    "block_comment": "The block of code acts as a shift register that resets or loads new data based on the module's logic signals. On receiving a rising edge clock signal, the behavior of the module depends on the status of the reset and other conditional signals. If reset is high, it clears the shift register else if both bit_clk_rising_edge and valid_audio_input are high, the operation of inserting new serial_audio_in_data at the least significant bit position of the data_in_shift_reg register happens. This is done by sliding the rest of the bits to the left and losing the most significant bit; making it act like a shift register for audio data management."
