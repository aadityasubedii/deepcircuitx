This block of code primarily manages the read space of the left audio fifo, under different conditions of reset and fifo utilisation. If a reset signal is high, the read space of the left audio fifo is cleared to 0. If the reset signal is not high, the most significant bit of the read space status register gets updated with the status of "left_channel_fifo_is_full" indicating if the fifo is full, and the lower 7 bits of the register are updated with the data describing the amount of space used in the left_channel_fifo.
