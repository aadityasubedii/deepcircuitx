Module-level comment: 

This module, Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer, handles the deserialization and synchronization of incoming serialized digital audio data for right and left channeling. It uses two separate synchronous FIFOs to store each channel's data. Various control and status signals are implemented for synchronizing the bit clock and left/right channels; tracking the status of FIFOs; and controlling data reading. The Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter and Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO internally partition the data processing tasks. Valid audio input data is counted, managed, and shifted using a reg data shift chain. Output data is coupled with read space indicators for each channel.
