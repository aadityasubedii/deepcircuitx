Comment: 
The block performs control of data transmission by altering `data_to_transfer` and `num_bits_to_transfer` upon different conditions. When the internal reset is active, it initializes transmission variables to zero. For an incomplete auto-initialization, it sets `data_to_transfer` to auto-initialized data while making `num_bits_to_transfer` to reflect 7-bit data. In other cases, it specifies a data transfer operation according to `s_alavon_slave == I2C_STATE_1_START` where it chooses the data to transfer based on `ob_address` and `writedata`, while the number of bits to transfer is set at 7 bits. The priority execution order is internal reset, auto-initialization, then specific data transfer operation.
