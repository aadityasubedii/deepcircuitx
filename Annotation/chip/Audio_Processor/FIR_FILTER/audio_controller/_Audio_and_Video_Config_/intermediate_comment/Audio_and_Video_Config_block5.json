    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a signal state for an I2C-bus transfer operation. With each positive edge of the system clock, it checks if the reset signal is asserted. If so, it sets the 'transfer_is_read' signal to a default state of 0. It also checks if the I2C bus is in 'start' state and the target address is 0, in which case it sets 'transfer_is_read' to the value of the 4th bit in the writedata bus."
