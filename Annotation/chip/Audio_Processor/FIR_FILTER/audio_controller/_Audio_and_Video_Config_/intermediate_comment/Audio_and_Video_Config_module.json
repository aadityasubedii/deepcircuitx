    "module": "Module-level comment: The Audio_and_Video_Config module configures audio and video settings using the I2C communication protocol. This is achieved via I2C data transmission operations, handling start/stop conditions on the I2C bus, and automatic initialization using interlinked submodules like Altera_UP_I2C, Altera_UP_I2C_AV_Auto_Initialize, and Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator. It uses an internal state machine for flow control and several internal signals for tracking and controlling operation states, data to be transferred, acknowledgments, and the number of bits to be transferred. Input/Output ports manage the operation types and data routing. Module provides flexibility with memory operations and data transfers in audio-video settings."
