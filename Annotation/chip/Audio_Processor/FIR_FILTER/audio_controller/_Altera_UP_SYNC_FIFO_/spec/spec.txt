Module name: Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO.

Module specification: 
The Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO module is a representation of a Synchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) design written in Verilog RTL. Its prime function is to accept input data, store it temporarily and permits to read it out based on synchronous behavior driven by the rising edge of the clock signal.

The module has five input signals and four output signals. The input signals include clk, reset, write_en, write_data, and read_en. The clk (clock) signal synchronizes all read and write operations in the FIFO, reset is used to restore the initial state of the FIFO, write_en allows to load data into the FIFO, write_data is the actual data to be loaded, and read_en allows to read data from the FIFO. 

The output signals are fifo_is_empty, fifo_is_full, words_used, and read_data. fifo_is_empty flags whether the FIFO is free of data, fifo_is_full indicates that FIFO can't take more data, words_used provides the number of data points stored in the FIFO, and read_data carries the data being read from the FIFO.

The module internally does not have any logic or signals of its own, but it interfaces with a 'scfifo' sub-module from Altera's library, with various signals such as clock, sclr, data, wrreq, rdreq, empty, full, usedw, and q. These facilitate synchronous data read and write operations, efficient data capacity tracking, and FIFO status tracking.

The code in the module contains the module declaration, parameter definitions, signal declarations, sub-module instantiation (Sync_FIFO), and defparam settings for the performance optimization and customization. The module does not contain any procedural blocks, control-flow statements, or generate constructs. The entire functionality is provided by the sub-module instantiation.
