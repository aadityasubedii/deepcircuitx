    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\"This Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO module implements a Synchronous FIFO using Verilog RTL, by leveraging Altera's 'scfifo' sub-module for the FIFO function. The module takes input data on a write operation, stores it, and outputs data on a read operation, all synchronized with a clock signal. Presence of data and current storage state is signaled by fifo_is_empty, fifo_is_full, and words_used. The interaction with 'scfifo' sub-module achieves the FIFO functionality. It doesn't contain internal processing but interfaces with 'scfifo' for handling the FIFO operations.\""
