It is using a sub-component \"scfifo\" which is from Altera's library. DATA_WIDTH and DATA_DEPTH parameters establish the configuration for data bit width and depth of the FIFO. The FIFO accepts input data (write_data) when write_en is asserted, and it outputs data (read_data) when read_en is asserted. This module checks if the FIFO is empty or full with fifo_is_empty and fifo_is_full signals. For tracking the FIFO queue status, it uses words_used. This FIFO has synchronous behavior, meaning that changes in the state of data, read, and write operations are triggered by the rising edge of the clk signal."
