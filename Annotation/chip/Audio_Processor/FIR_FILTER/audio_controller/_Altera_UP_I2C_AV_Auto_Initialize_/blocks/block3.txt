Comment: 
This line of code is responsible for the state transition of a data transfer operation. It assigns the logical AND operation result of 'transfer_complete' and 'transfer_data' signals to 'change_state'. This implies that the value of 'change_state' will be set high (1) only when both 'transfer_complete' and 'transfer_data' are high (1), signifying that a data transfer operation is completed successfully with valid data.
