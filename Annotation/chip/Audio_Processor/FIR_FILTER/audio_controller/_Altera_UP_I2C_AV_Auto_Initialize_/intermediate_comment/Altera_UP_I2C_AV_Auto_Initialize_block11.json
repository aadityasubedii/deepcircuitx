    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code performs a state machine sequence for automatic initialization of an I2C communication process. Functionally, the state machine checks the initialization status, initiates the transfer of two bytes subsequent to a start bit and waits until the transfer has completed, post which it sends the stop bit and repeats the process from checking the initialization status. While transitioning, it checks various conditions like 'finished_auto_init', 'change_state', and 'transfer_complete' based on which it moves to the next state. The process employs ROM data for decision making in two stages. As a fallback, in case of unanticipated conditions, it defaults to checking the initialization status."
