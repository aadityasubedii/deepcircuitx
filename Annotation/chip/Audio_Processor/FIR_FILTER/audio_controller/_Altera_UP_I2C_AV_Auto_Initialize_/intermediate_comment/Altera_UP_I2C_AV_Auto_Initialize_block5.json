    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls a ROM address counter, primarily based on two input signals 'reset' and 's_i2c_auto_init'. Upon a positive edge of the clock signal, if 'reset' is asserted, the ROM address counter is set to an initial minimum ROM address ('MIN_ROM_ADDRESS'). If 'reset' is not asserted and 's_i2c_auto_init' equals the constant 'AUTO_STATE_6_INCREASE_COUNTER', the ROM address counter increments by one. This might be part of a larger system requiring periodic or conditional incrementation of ROM address for memory utilization or data retrieval."
