    "block_comment": "This block of code is to create a signal `finished_auto_init` that indicates if the entire Read-Only Memory (ROM) has been addressed/initialized. It does so by continuously comparing the `rom_address_counter` with `MAX_ROM_ADDRESS`, which represents the maximum addressable number in the ROM. When `rom_address_counter` equals `MAX_ROM_ADDRESS`, it signifies that the ROM has been fully navigated and hence `finished_auto_init` is assigned the value of 1 (true)."
