The module goes through a series of states, each of which perform a specific operation (sending start bit, transferring bytes, sending stop bit), to set up the I2C interface. The states themselves are executed in response to certain conditions such as receiving an acknowledgement or the completion of data transfer. The module also interprets a range of ROM address values for different audio parameters like audio line in/out, ADC/DAC path, and other audio-related settings. Once the address space completes, the auto-initialization concludes and appropriate signals (auto_init_complete) are set to indicate the status. The module also produces an error signal (auto_init_error) when appropriate."
