    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block configures the control for sending the stop bit in an I2C-based data transfer process. It operates synchronously with the rising edge of a clock signal. When a reset signal is high, or when the transfer is flagged as complete, it ensures the stop bit is not sent. However, if the I2C is in the AUTO_STATE_5_SEND_STOP_BIT state, it triggers the transmission of the stop bit."
