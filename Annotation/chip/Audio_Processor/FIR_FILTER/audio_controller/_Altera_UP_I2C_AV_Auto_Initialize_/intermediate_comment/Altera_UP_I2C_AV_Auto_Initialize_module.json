    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'Altera_UP_I2C_AV_Auto_Initialize' module auto-initializes an I2C interface for audio settings. It utilizes a state machine, operating through several states for sending/receiving bits, transferring data, and maintaining protocol. It handles a range of ROM addresses for audio parameters, with the state machine operations dictated by these addresses. The module uses input/output ports for data transmission, state transition, error signaling, and initialization completion. Internal signals and a switch-case block for predefined audio path settings control the state transitions and ROM data manipulation. Errors are detected and flagged for monitoring and action."
