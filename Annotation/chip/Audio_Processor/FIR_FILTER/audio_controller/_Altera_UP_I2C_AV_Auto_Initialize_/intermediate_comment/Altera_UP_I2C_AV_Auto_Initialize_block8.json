    "block_comment": "The block manages the output state of the `send_start_bit` signal based on different conditional scenarios. The signal `send_start_bit` gets reset to 0 in case a `reset` is active high or the `transfer_complete` signal is set to 1. In a different instance, if the variable `s_i2c_auto_init` equals `AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT`, `send_start_bit` signal is set to be 1, indicating the start of communication. This control flow is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal, indicating it's a synchronous system design."
