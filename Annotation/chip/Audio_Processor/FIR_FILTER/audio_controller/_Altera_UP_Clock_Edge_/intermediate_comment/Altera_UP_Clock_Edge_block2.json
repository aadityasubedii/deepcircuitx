    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to detect a falling edge in a digital waveform. It accomplishes this by using the 'assign' keyword to assign the \"falling_edge\" signal a value based on a logical AND operation between two other signals: \"found_edge\" and \"last_test_clk\". The \"falling_edge\" signal will go high (true) only if both the \"found_edge\" and \"last_test_clk\" signals are high, which indicates a falling edge has been found."
