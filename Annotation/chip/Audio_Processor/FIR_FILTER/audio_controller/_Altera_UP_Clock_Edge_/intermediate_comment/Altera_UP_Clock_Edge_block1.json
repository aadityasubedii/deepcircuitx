    "block_comment": "This code block generates an edge detection signal for a test clock signal. Specifically, it uses an exclusive OR (XOR) operation on the current and last test clock signals to detect a rising or falling edge - if there's a change in the state of the test clock from the last cycle to the current one, it will output '1', otherwise '0'."
