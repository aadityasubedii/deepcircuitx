The \"test_clk\" signal is monitored and the current state and previous state of \"test_clk\" are updated on the rising edge of input clock \"clk\". The rising edge and falling edge of \"test_clk\" are then detected by comparing the previous and current states of \"test_clk\". This is used to generate the \"rising_edge\" and \"falling_edge\" output signals. If the \"test_clk\" transitions from a logic 0 to a logic 1, there's a rising edge. Conversely, if it transitions from a logic 1 to a logic 0, there's a falling edge."
