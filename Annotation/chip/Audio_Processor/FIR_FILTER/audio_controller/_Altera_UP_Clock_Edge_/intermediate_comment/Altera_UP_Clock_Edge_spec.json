This module's primary functionality is to monitor and detect the changing states or \"edges\" of an input test clock signal. The module employs three input ports: 'clk' which serves as the primary synchronization signal, 'reset' for system state resetting (despite not explicitly appearing in the code), and 'test_clk', which provides the test clock signal to be analyzed. Further, it uses two output ports: 'rising_edge', which exhibits an activated state when a rising edge is detected on test_clk signal, and 'falling_edge' that gets activated when a falling edge is recognized on test_clk signal. Internally, the module uses signals such as 'found_edge', which helps detect the presence of an edge (rising or falling) in the test_clk signal; 'cur_test_clk', a register storing the current state of the test_clk signal; and 'last_test_clk', a register retaining the previous state of the test_clk signal. These signal declarations and assignments are processed in different blocks of the code. Two always blocks update the 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk' registers on every positive edge of the clock signal. The states of the 'rising_edge' and 'falling_edge' signals are then determined by using the 'found_edge' signal, which is computed by an XOR operation between 'last_test_clk' and 'cur_test_clk'. This structured design enables the efficient detection of test_clk signal transitions, beneficial for various digital systems' operations.",

The \"test_clk\" signal is monitored and the current state and previous state of \"test_clk\" are updated on the rising edge of input clock \"clk\". The rising edge and falling edge of \"test_clk\" are then detected by comparing the previous and current states of \"test_clk\".
