    "block_comment": "This block is used for detecting a rising edge in a clock signal. The assign statement uses bitwise AND operation on 'found_edge' and 'cur_test_clk'. It implies that a 'rising_edge' is detected when there's a simultaneous high state or '1' value in both 'found_edge' and 'cur_test_clk'. \n"
