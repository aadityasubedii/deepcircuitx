Module name: Altera_UP_Clock_Edge

Module specification: The Altera_UP_Clock_Edge is a hardware design module defined in Verilog. This module's primary functionality is to monitor and detect the changing states or "edges" of an input test clock signal. The module employs three input ports: 'clk' which serves as the primary synchronization signal, 'reset' for system state resetting (despite not explicitly appearing in the code), and 'test_clk', which provides the test clock signal to be analyzed. Further, it uses two output ports: 'rising_edge', which exhibits an activated state when a rising edge is detected on test_clk signal, and 'falling_edge' that gets activated when a falling edge is recognized on test_clk signal. Internally, the module uses signals such as 'found_edge', which helps detect the presence of an edge (rising or falling) in the test_clk signal; 'cur_test_clk', a register storing the current state of the test_clk signal; and 'last_test_clk', a register retaining the previous state of the test_clk signal. These signal declarations and assignments are processed in different blocks of the code. Two always blocks update the 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk' registers on every positive edge of the clock signal. The states of the 'rising_edge' and 'falling_edge' signals are then determined by using the 'found_edge' signal, which is computed by an XOR operation between 'last_test_clk' and 'cur_test_clk'. This structured design enables the efficient detection of test_clk signal transitions, beneficial for various digital systems' operations.
