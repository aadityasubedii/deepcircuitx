The block of code is designed to update and store the status of the 'cur_test_clk' every positive edge of the clock pulse. Specifically, this is achieved using the 'always' block in Verilog, which triggers on the positive edge of the 'clk' signal. The current value of 'cur_test_clk' is stored in 'last_test_clk', effectively recording the recent past of 'cur_test_clk'.
