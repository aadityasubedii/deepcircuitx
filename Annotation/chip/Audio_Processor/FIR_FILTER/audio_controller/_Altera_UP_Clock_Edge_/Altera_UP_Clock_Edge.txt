Module-level comment: This is the Altera_UP_Clock_Edge module, responsible for detecting rising and falling edges of the 'test_clk' signal. It uses a primary system clock ('clk') to synchronize changes. On each 'clk' rising edge, the current and previous states of 'test_clk' are updated to 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk'. An XOR operation between these states generates 'found_edge', used to indicate a change. If 'found_edge' is combined with 'cur_test_clk' or 'last_test_clk', it signifies a rising or falling edge of 'test_clk' respectively, which are output through 'rising_edge' and 'falling_edge'.
