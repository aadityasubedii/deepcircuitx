Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter is a digital audio bit counter. It processes bit clocks and left-right clocks (both edges) to effectuate counting operations. 'bit_counter' is the main internal register that increments or decrements based on these inputs. An auxiliary 'reset_bit_counter' signal, driven by left-right clocks, facilitates additional resetting capability. The 'counting' output reflects the active state of the counter. Two always blocks, triggered at the rising edge of 'clk', handle the transitions of 'bit_counter' and 'counting', using input clock signals and reset conditions.
