Based on the provided Verilog code block snippet, the function of this block is to set or reset a bit counter mechanism. This is implemented by the 'assign' statement, commonly used in Verilog RTL codes to model combinational logic, evaluating on the right-side and assigning the result to the left-side. In this case, the reset_bit_counter is set when the 'left_right_clk_rising_edge' condition is met, denoting a triggering on the rising edge of a clock signal. However, due to partial visibility of the code, it's hard to provide precise functionalities of each component. More context could result in a more detailed explanation.

Please ensure to provide full block of code for more accurate comments.
