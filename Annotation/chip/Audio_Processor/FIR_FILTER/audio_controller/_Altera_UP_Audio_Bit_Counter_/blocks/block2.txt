Comment: 
This block of code is a clocked control loop that manages a binary counter named 'counting'. On each positive edge of the clock signal, it checks several conditional statements before acing its states. If the 'reset' signal is high, it sets the 'counting' variable to a low state. When 'reset_bit_counter' is high, the 'counting' variable is set to a high state. If neither of those conditions are met, the 'counting' will be switched off whenever there is a falling edge on the 'bit_clk_falling_edge' and 'bit_counter' is at its initial position.
