    "block_comment": "The block controls a counter reset and decrement operation. The counter 'bit_counter' is reset at a rising clock edge if the reset is high, or is set to a predetermined initialization value 'BIT_COUNTER_INIT' if the 'reset_bit_counter' signal is high. If neither signal is high, and the 'bit_clk_falling_edge' is high and the 'bit_counter' is not at zero, 'bit_counter' is decremented."
