    "spec": "Module name: Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter. \n\nModule Specification: The Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter module is a dedicated bit counter for audio operations. The purpose of this module is to provide a mechanism to count audio data bits while also having the capability to restart or stop the count operation when required.\n\nThe module takes five input ports: 'clk', 'reset', 'bit_clk_rising_edge', 'bit_clk_falling_edge', 'left_right_clk_rising_edge', and 'left_right_clk_falling_edge'. The 'clk' port provides the main system clock that synchronizes the internal operations of the module. The 'reset' port provides a way to reset the internal states of the module. The remaining ports are clock related signals derived from the bit clock and left/right clock which influence the operation of the internal bit counter accordingly.\n\nThe module provides one output port: 'counting', which indicates whether the internal counter is actively counting or not, depending on the state of 'bit_counter' and state of reset and clock events.\n\nInside the module, there are two significant internal signals: 'reset_bit_counter' and 'bit_counter'. 'reset_bit_counter' acts an additional reset driven by the edges of the 'left_right_clk' clock source. 'bit_counter' is the core counting element in this module. These signals are integral to the functionality of the module and work in concert to control the state of the output 'counting'.\n\nThe code can be conceptualized in three major segments. The Input/Output (I/O) port definitions and parameters declaration, the event-driven always blocks that control 'bit_counter' and 'counting' states based on clock events and reset signals, and finally, the 'assign' statement where the 'reset_bit_counter' is assigned an OR operation of 'left_right_clk' rising and falling edges.\n\nOverall, Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter is a specialized module for sound applications where synchronizing audio data bits is crucial. Its design allows for precise control over bit counting operations, providing stable, reliable, and consistent operation that meets the demands of audio systems.",

It takes a system clk, a reset signal, bit clock (both rising and falling edges), and left-right clock (both rising and falling edges) as inputs. It outputs a signal centered around 'counting', indicating that counting is being performed. A reset is present to restart the operation by resetting the counter to initial value and stopping the counting. Bit_clk_falling_edge acts to decrement the counter when it is not zero. Reset_bit_counter is set on any edge of the left-right clock, which triggers a reset to the initial value or stops/starts the counting. This module can be used in digital audio systems to synchronize audio data bits."

These clock edge signals are crucial control signals that interact with the internal bit_counter and the counting signal.\nThe output 'counting' provides an indication of whether the bit_counter inside the module is actively counting or in rest state.

When either the rising or falling edge of the left_right_clk occurs, it triggers the bit_counter to reset to its INITIAL state (BIT_COUNTER_INIT) or helps in transitioning the counting signal. This signal serves as an additional reset mechanism driven by the edges of another clock source.\n\n2. bit_counter: This is a 5-bit (from 4 downto 0) register type internal signal which acts as the main counter. Under the posedge of clk, it is set to '0' if the reset signal is high; set to the INITIAL state if reset_bit_counter is high; and decremented by 1 if the bit_clk_falling_edge is high and the current bit_counter value is not '0'. It works as the core element in this module for counting and aids in controlling the 'counting' output value based on its own state and the input clock signals."
