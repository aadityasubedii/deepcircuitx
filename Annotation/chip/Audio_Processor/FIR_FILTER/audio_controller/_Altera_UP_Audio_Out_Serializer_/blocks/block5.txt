Comment: 
This block of code manages the `left_channel_was_read` signal in a digital system. Triggered at a rising edge of the `clk` signal, it determines whether the left or right channel was read based on the `reset`, `read_left_channel`, and `read_right_channel` inputs. The logic's functionality is, if the system is under reset, then `left_channel_was_read` is set to '0'. Otherwise, if the `read_left_channel` is active, `left_channel_was_read` is set to '1', and finally, if `read_right_channel` is active, `left_channel_was_read` is set to '0'.
