This block of code manages the write space allocation in the right-channel FIFO of a stereo audio system. When the reset signal is active, it sets the `right_channel_fifo_write_space` to 0, effectively clearing the FIFO buffer. If the reset signal is not active, it updates the `right_channel_fifo_write_space` with the free space left in the FIFO, calculated as the difference between the maximum size (128) and the sum of the FIFO's `full` flag and `used` states.
