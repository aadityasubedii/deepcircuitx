Comment: 
The block assigns a logic condition to 'read_left_channel'. The condition is the conjunction of three logic conditions: the rising edge of the 'left_right_clk', the left channel FIFO is not empty, and the right channel FIFO is not empty. Therefore, 'read_left_channel' is assigned with 1 value only when all the three conditions are met simultaneously which ensures simultaneous emptying of both the channels synchronously to the rising edge of 'left_right_clk'.
