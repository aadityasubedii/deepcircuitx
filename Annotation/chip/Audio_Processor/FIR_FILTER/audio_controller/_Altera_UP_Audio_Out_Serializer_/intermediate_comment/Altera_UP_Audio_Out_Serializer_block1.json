    "block_comment": "This block of code is a Sync_FIFO instance for the audio output's right channel. It operates via a clock signal and can be reset, with the capability to write data into FIFO when enabled and if the FIFO is not full. The data written into the FIFO is predicated on the 'right_channel_data_en' signal and the FIFO's fullness status. Furthermore, the block is also capable of reading from the FIFO when the 'read_right_channel' signal is enabled. The block also provides details about the FIFO's status such as if it's empty, full and the number of words used. The read data is output via the 'right_channel_from_fifo' signal."
