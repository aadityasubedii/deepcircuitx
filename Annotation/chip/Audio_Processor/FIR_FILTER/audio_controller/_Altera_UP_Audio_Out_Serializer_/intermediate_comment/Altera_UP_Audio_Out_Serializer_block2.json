    "block_comment": "The block defines an UART transmission process. It applies a synchronous FIFO (First-In First-Out) memory buffer - Audio_Out_Left_Channel_FIFO, which uses the Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO module to handle the storage and retrieval of left audio channel data. When 'write_en' is enabled, and the FIFO is not full, audio data can be written. When 'read_en' is enabled, the module provides the audio data stored at the head of the queue. It also outputs the status of the FIFO queue such as filling state with 'fifo_is_full' and 'fifo_is_empty' as well as holds information about used words in 'words_used'."
