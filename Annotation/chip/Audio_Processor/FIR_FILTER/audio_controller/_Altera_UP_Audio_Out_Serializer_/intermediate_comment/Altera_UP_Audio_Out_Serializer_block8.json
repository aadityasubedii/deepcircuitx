    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the write space availability in the left channel FIFO buffer. Upon each positive edge of the clock signal, it checks if a reset signal is high; if high, it resets the 'left_channel_fifo_write_space' register to zero, effectively emptying the FIFO. If the reset signal is not high (i.e., a normal operation period), the block calculates and assigns a new write space value for 'left_channel_fifo_write_space' by subtracting a composite value of 'left_channel_fifo_is_full' and 'left_channel_fifo_used' from 128 (0x80 in hexadecimal). This helps manage and prevent FIFO overflow in the left audio channel."
