    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the resetting and updating of the serial_audio_out_data. The operation of the block hinges on the values of the 'reset' signal and 'clk'. At the positive edge (rising) of the clock signal (clk), if the reset signal is high (1'b1), the serial_audio_out_data is cleared or reset to a binary 0 (1'b0). If the reset signal is not high, the block fetches the last bit from the data_out_shift_reg array which is indexed by AUDIO_DATA_WIDTH, and assigns it to the 'serial_audio_out_data' on each clock cycle."
