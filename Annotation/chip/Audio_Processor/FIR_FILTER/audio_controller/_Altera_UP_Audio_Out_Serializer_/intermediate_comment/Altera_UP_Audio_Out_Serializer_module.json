    "module": "Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer module serializes audio data for interfacing with audio devices. It manages data flow through FIFOs for left and right audio channels. Input ports determine module operation, output ports present the resultant serialized audio data and FIFO write spaces. Internal signals control read/write operations, track FIFO status and manage serialized audio data shifts. The module includes several always blocks for various computational operations and integrates two Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO instances to manage read/write audio data."
