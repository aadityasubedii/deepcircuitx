It's designed to handle left and right audio channels separately. It features synchronous FIFOs (First In, First Out data structures) for both channels to enable the management of data flow. The module uses a clock and a reset signal, and it handles data input for both channels, supporting enable signals for each. It also features indicators for FIFO write space for each channel and outputs serialized audio data. The module factors in bit clock rising and falling edges, as well as left/right clock rising and falling edges, to handle the reading and writing of the data."
