    "block_comment": "The block of code resets a byte to zero on a reset signal, and updates the byte with input data if the I2C transceiver is in an idle or start bit state. The implementation employs an always block that is sensitive to the rising edge of a clock signal, then it proceeds with condition checks. It first checks if the reset signal is high and sets 'current_byte' to zero in that case. If not, it checks if 's_i2c_transceiver' is either in the idle state or in the start bit state, and if so, data is fetched from 'data_in' and assigned to the 'current_byte'."
