    "spec": "Module name: Altera_UP_I2C.\n\nModule specification: The Altera_UP_I2C module is designed to facilitate Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication, functioning as a transceiver. Key to its operation are the input ports which include clk, reset, clear_ack, clk_400KHz, start_and_stop_en, change_output_bit_en, send_start_bit, send_stop_bit, data_in, transfer_data, read_byte, num_bits_to_transfer. These inputs govern the timing, data transfer initiation, byte read initiation and quantity of bits to transfer in the system. The module provides output signals through i2c_sclk, i2c_scen, enable_clk, ack, data_from_i2c, transfer_complete. These outputs involve clocking, enabling the bus, acknowledging data transfer, and indicating data transfer completion. An inout port, i2c_sdata, is used as the bidirectional data line for I2C communication. Internally, the module uses several signals, including I2C_BUS_MODE to dictate the mode of I2C bus for communication, and a collection of I2C_STATE signals to manage different states of I2C transceiving operations. Signals such as current_bit and current_byte persist the bit and byte to be passed, while ns_i2c_transceiver, s_i2c_transceiver are state signals for driving the state machine of the I2C transceiver. The code is divided into sections handling parameter declaration, port declarations, local state declaration, state machine transitions and assignments, internal signal assignments and signal value assignments. These sections collectively contribute to achieving I2C transceiving operations as per the desired conditions and inputs.",

Key to its operation are the input ports which include clk, reset, clear_ack, clk_400KHz, start_and_stop_en, change_output_bit_en, send_start_bit, send_stop_bit, data_in, transfer_data, read_byte, num_bits_to_transfer. These inputs govern the timing, data transfer initiation, byte read initiation and quantity of bits to transfer in the system. The module provides output signals through i2c_sclk, i2c_scen, enable_clk, ack, data_from_i2c, transfer_complete. These outputs involve clocking, enabling the bus, acknowledging data transfer, and indicating data transfer completion. An inout port, i2c_sdata, is used as the bidirectional data line for I2C communication. Internally, the module uses several signals, including I2C_BUS_MODE to dictate the mode of I2C bus for communication, and a collection of I2C_STATE signals to manage different states of I2C transceiving operations. Signals such as current_bit and current_byte persist the bit and byte to be passed, while ns_i2c_transceiver, s_i2c_transceiver are state signals for driving the state machine of the I2C transceiver. The code is divided into sections handling parameter declaration, port declarations, local state declaration, state machine transitions and assignments, internal signal assignments and signal value assignments. These sections collectively contribute to achieving I2C transceiving operations as per the desired conditions and inputs."
