    "block_comment": "The function of this block of Verilog code is to control the enablement of a clock signal named 'enable_clk'. It checks if the I2C transceiver is not in the 'IDLE' or 'COMPLETE' state. If the I2C transceiver is in any other state, the enable_clk signal is asserted. The implementation is an 'assign' statement that checks the state of 's_i2c_transceiver' against two different states 'I2C_STATE_0_IDLE' and 'I2C_STATE_6_COMPLETE', and negates the result of these comparisons to activate the 'enable_clk' signal."
