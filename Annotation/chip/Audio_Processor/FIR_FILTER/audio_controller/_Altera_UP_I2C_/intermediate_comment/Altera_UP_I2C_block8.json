    "block_comment": "This block of code is an asynchronous reset for `ack` flag used in an I2C protocol transceiver. It operates on the rising edge of the clock. Once there is a positive clock edge, depending upon the condition, it resets the acknowledge `ack` flag. If the `reset` signal or `clear_ack` is set, the `ack` flag is reset unconditionally. If the `start_and_stop_en` signal is true and the transceiver state is `I2C_STATE_4_TRANSFER_ACK`, it updates `ack` to be the XOR of the `i2c_sdata` and `I2C_BUS_MODE`."
