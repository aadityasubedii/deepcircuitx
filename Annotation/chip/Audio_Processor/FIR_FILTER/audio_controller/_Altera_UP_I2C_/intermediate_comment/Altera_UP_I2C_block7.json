    "block_comment": "This block initializes and updates a variable representing data received from a I2C interface. If a reset signal is detected(high), it initializes the `data_from_i2c` to '0'. But if the reset signal is not high, and both the `start_and_stop_en` (flag for I2C start and stop condition) is set and `s_i2c_transceiver` (I2C state variable) equals `I2C_STATE_3_TRANSFER_BYTE`, it updates `data_from_i2c`, shifting its contents to the right and appending the least significant bit from `i2c_sdata`."
