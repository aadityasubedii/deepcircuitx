This block primarily manages the 'current_bit' variable in a system dealing with I2C data transferring. On the rising edge of the clock, if the reset is high, 'current_bit' is reset to 0; else if the system is in the 'transfer byte' state and 'change_output_bit_en' is high, the value of 'current_bit' decrements. However, if the system moves out of the 'transfer byte' state, 'current_bit' is reloaded with 'num_bits_to_transfer'. This ensures 'current_bit' reflects the current point in the data transfer process or defaults to the total bits to transfer when not transferring, providing a dynamic bit counter in the I2C system.
