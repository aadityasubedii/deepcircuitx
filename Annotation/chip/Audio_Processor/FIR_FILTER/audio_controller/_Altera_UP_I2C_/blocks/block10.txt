This block implements an I2C transceiver state machine. The always block, sensitive to all signals, uses a switch-case construct to transition between different states. It begins in the idle state, and based on control signals such as send_start_bit, send_stop_bit, and transfer_data, it transitions to states such as pre_start, start_bit, stop_bit, transfer_byte, and transfer_ack. Each state handles specific tasks. For instance, the start_bit state can transition to the transfer_byte state if a data transfer is requested, or it can complete the process if no such request exists. Similarly, the transfer_byte state can transition to either the transfer_ack state or the complete state, depending on the bus mode and number of bits to transfer. Finally, this finite state machine reverts to the idle state upon completion or in default scenarios.
