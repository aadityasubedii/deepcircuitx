This block of Verilog code is a state machine that effectively controls an I2C transfer scenario. It does so by examining the state of the I2C transceiver and adjusting the I2C scenario flag (i2c_scen) accordingly, upon each rising edge of the clock signal. Initially, if the reset signal is set, the I2C scenario flag is set to high. However, if the change_output_bit_en is enabled and the I2C transceiver is at the start bit stage, the I2C scenario flag is deactivated (set to zero) signifying the beginning of data transfer. Lastly, when the I2C transceiver reaches the stop bit state, the I2C scenario flag is re-activated, implying the end of data transfer.
