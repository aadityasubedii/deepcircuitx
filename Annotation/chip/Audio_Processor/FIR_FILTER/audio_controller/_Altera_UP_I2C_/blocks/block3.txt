Comment: 
This block facilitates data transmission over the I2C bus. It assigns the `i2c_sdata` output depending on the state of the I2C transceiver and certain conditions. If the state is in START_BIT or STOP_BIT or in TRANSFER_ACK with `read_byte`, it assigns `1'b0` (low level). If the state is TRANSFER_BYTE and `read_byte` is not asserted, the output `i2c_sdata` will have the value of `current_byte[current_bit]`. In all other cases, it's high impedance (1'bz).
