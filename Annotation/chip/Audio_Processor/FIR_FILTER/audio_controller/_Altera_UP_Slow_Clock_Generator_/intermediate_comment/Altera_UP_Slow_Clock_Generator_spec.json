This module works with three input ports named 'clk', 'reset', and 'enable_clk'. 'clk' is the primary clock input and drives the overall operability of the module. 'reset' is a synchronous reset signal that, when high, resets the state of all the internal flip-flops. 'enable_clk', when high, allows the internal clock counter to increment. \n\nThe module provides five output ports: 'new_clk', 'rising_edge', 'falling_edge', 'middle_of_high_level', and 'middle_of_low_level'. 'new_clk' is the slow clock signal generated by the module. 'rising_edge' indicates the points of the rising edge of 'new_clk', while 'falling_edge' points out the moments of the falling edge of 'new_clk'. The signals 'middle_of_high_level' and 'middle_of_low_level' reflect the middle points of high and low logic levels of the new clock respectively. \n\nThe crucial internal signal of this module is 'clk_counter', which is a binary counter incrementing with each positive edge of the 'clk' signal embodying the control by 'enable_clk'. This counter, width defined by 'COUNTER_BITS' and increment defined by 'COUNTER_INC', influences the frequency of 'new_clk'. \n\nThe module code is separated into a set of blocks each oriented to control one output signal or an internal counter. It includes blocks for resetting the state and updating the clock counter, controlling the state of 'new_clk', 'rising_edge', 'falling_edge', 'middle_of_high_level', and 'middle_of_low_level' based on 'clk', 'reset', 'enable_clk' and 'clk_counter'.\nIn summary, this module is a slow clock generator which creates not only a slower clock signal but also renders various time-specific signals providing valuable time-specific information about the slower clock.\n",
