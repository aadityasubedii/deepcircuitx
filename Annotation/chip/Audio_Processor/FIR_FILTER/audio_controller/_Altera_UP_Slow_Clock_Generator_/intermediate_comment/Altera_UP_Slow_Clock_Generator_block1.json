    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a synchronous reset functionality and determines the middle point of a low-level signal cycle. Upon receiving a positive edge clock signal, the code block checks if the reset signal is high; if it is, the 'middle_of_low_level' signal is reset to '0'. If the reset signal is low, the block executes a bitwise operation on 'clk_counter' to detect the middle of a low-level signal cycle. The block achieves this by performing a logical AND operation on inverted highest and second-highest bits of 'clk_counter' and a bit-wise AND on all but least significant bit of 'clk_counter', inverted."
