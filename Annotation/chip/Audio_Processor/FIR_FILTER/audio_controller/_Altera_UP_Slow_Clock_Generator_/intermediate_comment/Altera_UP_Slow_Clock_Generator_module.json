    "module": "Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator module is a slow clock generator and provides timing signals. It uses 'clk', 'reset', and 'enable_clk' inputs to control a counter (clk_counter) that regulates 'new_clk', the slow output clock. The module also generates 'rising_edge', 'falling_edge', 'middle_of_high_level', and 'middle_of_low_level' output signals, indicating specific moments in the clock cycle. It achieves this by using 'always' constructs to define the state of output and internal signals based on the states of the input signals."
