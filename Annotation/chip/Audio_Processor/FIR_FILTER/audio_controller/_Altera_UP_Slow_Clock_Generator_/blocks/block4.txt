Comment: 
This block of Verilog code manages the detection of a rising edge on a system clock. The operations commence at each positive clock edge (`posedge clk`). If the `reset` signal is high (`1'b1`), the `rising_edge` signal is set to low (`1'b0`), effectively resetting the operation. If not in reset, the `rising_edge` is generated by comparing (`^`) the most significant bit of `clk_counter` with `new_clk` and ANDing (`&`) the result with the logical negation (`~`) of `new_clk`. This implementation determines whether a rising edge has occurred on the `new_clk` signal based on the `clk_counter`.
