This block of code is an asynchronous reset design pattern for generating a falling edge detection. It becomes active upon detecting a positive edge in the system clock 'clk'. During a reset (reset == 1'b1), it forces 'falling_edge' to be '0'. If it is not in reset mode, the code implements a falling-edge detection where the current clock state 'new_clk' and the previous clock state 'clk_counter[COUNTER_BITS]' are XOR'ed and logically AND'ed with the current clock state, resulting in 'falling_edge' only transitioning to high ('1') when a falling clock edge is detected.
