Module-level comment: The 'audio' module interfaces an Audio CODEC, managing the input/output audio streams. Inputs/outputs are processed via 16-bit shift registers sr_out and sr_in, with 8-bit counters cnt_in and cnt_out controlling data transmission rate. Pacing and synchronization are achieved using the AUD_BCLK, sync, ao, ai, and xck signals. AUD_DACDAT and AUD_XCK are sourced from sr_out and xck respectively, and 'aout' availability and 'ain' updates are signaled by aout_avail and ain_new.
