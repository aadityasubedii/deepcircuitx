    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code executes a sequence of actions following a positive-edge of the CLOCK_50 signal. If the 'reset' signal is true, it sets 'ao' to zero, which is a synchronous reset operation. Otherwise, the least significant bit of 'ao' is replaced with the comparison of 'cnt_out' with 32, which is a conditional bit shift operation. This is a means of performing operation based on the clock signal and 'reset' state, often used in counter or state machine implementations to manage its state."
