    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code forms part of an asynchronous counter with reset functionality. It functions by issuing a reset command at the rising edge of the 50Hz clock signal, thereby resetting the value of 'ai' to 0. In non-reset operation, it implements a shift register where the 'ai' register is right-shifted and the most significant bit is replaced by the result of (cnt_in == 16). This effectively works as a counter with 'cnt_in' values from 0 to 16."
