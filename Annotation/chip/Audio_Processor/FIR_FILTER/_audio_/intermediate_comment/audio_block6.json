    "block_comment": "This block manages an input sample count in synchronization with an audio bit clock (AUD_BCLK). When a reset signal is received, or the audio A/D converter latch clock (AUD_ADCLRCK) has a positive edge, the count is reset to zero. If these conditions aren't met and the current count is less than 16, the count is incremented on every positive edge of the audio bit clock."
