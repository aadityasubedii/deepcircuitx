    "spec": "Module name: Audio. \n\nModule specification: The 'Audio' module operates as a part of an Audio CODEC (Coder-Decoder) system, managing both input and output audio data streams. The input ports include CLOCK_50 (main system clock), reset (used for initializations), aout (16-bit audio output data), AUD_ADCLRCK (ADC's left-right clock), AUD_ADCDAT (ADC's data), AUD_DACLRCK (DAC's left-right clock), and AUD_BCLK (Bit clock for ADC & DAC). The output ports include ain (16-bit processed audio data), aout_avail (signal for 'aout' availability), AUD_DACDAT (DAC's data), ain_new (signal when new 'ain' data is processed), and AUD_XCK (an optional extended clock signal). \n\nInternally, the module employs shift registers sr_out and sr_in for output and input data stream respectively, counters cnt_in and cnt_out for pacing data transmission, and sync for synchronizing operations related to AUD_DACLRCK & AUD_BCLK. Two 2-bit registers, ao and ai, indicate the readiness of output and input data streams. A 2-bit counter xck aids in generating an optional extended clock.\n\nThe module operates as follows: On the negative edge of AUD_BCLK, the 'sr_out' shift register processes output data. AUD_DACDAT is allocated the most significant bit of sr_out. On the positive edge of AUD_BCLK, 'sync' becomes equal to AUD_DACLRCK and 'cnt_out' increments, unless reset. A similar process follows for sr_in and cnt_in, but the conditional execution depends upon the value of AUD_ADCLRCK. The most significant bits of ao and ai reflect the readiness of aout and ain when cnt_out and cnt_in reach certain values respectively. The most significant bit of 'xck' forms AUD_XCK. 'ain' is updated with sr_in when cnt_in equals 16 on the positive edge of CLOCK_50.",
