    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for counter control, which reacts to the rising edge of the AUD_BCLK signal. Upon the activation of reset signal or the AUD_DACLRCK signal, the counter 'cnt_out' is reset to 0. If neither signal is active and 'cnt_out' is less than 32, then 'cnt_out' is incremented by 1 every AUD_BCLK positive edge, effectively creating a cycle counter for a 32-bit word length system."
