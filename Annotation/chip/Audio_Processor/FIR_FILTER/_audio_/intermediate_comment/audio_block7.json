    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code represents a shift register that inputs serial data from an audio ADC. On every positive edge of the audio bit clock (AUD_BCLK), provided that the system is not under reset, the block checks if the current count (cnt_in) is less than 16. If it is, it shifts its current 15-bit contents to the left and appends the new bit from the audio ADC data (AUD_ADCDAT) to the end. If the system is under reset, the shift register (sr_in) is cleared to 0."
