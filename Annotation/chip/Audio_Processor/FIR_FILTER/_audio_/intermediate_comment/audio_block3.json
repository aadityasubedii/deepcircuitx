    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a new value to the `ain` register at the positive edge of a 50 MHz clock. If `reset` is activated, it sets `ain` to zero, effectively resetting it. However, if `reset` is not activated and `cnt_in` equals 16, the code assigns the value of `sr_in` to `ain`. This is likely to load a new value into `ain` at a certain stage of a counter or state machine sequence."
