This block of code functions as a module for clock pulse counting in a digital system. Upon each positive rising edge of the 'CLOCK_50' signal, it increments the value of 'xck', thereby effectively keeping count of the number of clock cycles. This implementation utilizes the 'always @' keyword to continuously monitor changes in the 'CLOCK_50' signal.
