The block of code assigns a boolean value to the signal `ain_new` based on the comparison of `ai` with a two-bit binary number `2'b01`. Specifically, `ain_new` gets assigned a true value if `ai` equals `2'b01` and a false value if it doesn't. This is a simple wire assignment operation using the equality operator for comparison and conditional signal update in Verilog.
