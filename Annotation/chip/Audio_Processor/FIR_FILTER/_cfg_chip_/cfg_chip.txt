Module-level comment: 

The cfg_chip module configures a chip using the I2C protocol. It is driven by a 50MHz clock ('clock50') and initiated by a 'start' signal. Module manages I2C communication using a state machine ('mst'), leveraging an internal counter for timing. It employs 'data' array for sending configuration data. Completion of configuration is signaled by the 'done' output. The 'i2c_c' and 'i2c_d' signals handle the I2C clock and data lines, respectively. Module handles stages of I2C communication using different sections of code.
