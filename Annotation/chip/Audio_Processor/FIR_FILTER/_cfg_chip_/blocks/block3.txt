This code block works as a counter. The counter is reset to zero whenever the 'start' signal is received. Otherwise, it increments by one at every rising edge of the 'clock50' signal. This is achieved through using edge-sensitive always block which is executed at each rising edge of either the 'clock50' or 'start' signal. The ternary operator checks for the 'start' signal, and if it is high, the counter is reset, but if it is low, the counter increments by one.
