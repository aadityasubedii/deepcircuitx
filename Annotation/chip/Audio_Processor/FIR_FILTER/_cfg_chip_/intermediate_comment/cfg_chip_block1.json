    "block_comment": "This line of code serves as a signal assignment in a Verilog design, indicating that the 'done' signal becomes true when the machine state (represented by 'mst') reaches the state defined as 'ms_done'. The implementation relies on standard Verilog signal assignment methods and equality checking. It's a simple yet crucial part of managing flow control within hardware systems."
