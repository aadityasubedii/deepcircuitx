Module-level comment: The hex2seg module converts a 4-bit hexadecimal 'hex' input into a corresponding 7-bit binary 'seg' output for 7-segment display. Each 'seg' output is an encoded representation of seven segments of a digital display that needs to be lit for accurate character depiction. It achieves this through condition checks within an assign statement comparing 'hex' input with each hexadecimal digit and mapping it to an appropriate binary configuration.
