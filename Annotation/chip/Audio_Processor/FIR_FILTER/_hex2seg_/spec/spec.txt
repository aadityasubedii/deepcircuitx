Module name: hex2seg.

Module specification: The hex2seg module is designed to perform a conversion of a 4-bit hexadecimal number into a 7-segment display format. The main function is to translate each hexadecimal digit into an encoded binary number that decides which segments of a 7-segment digital display should be lit to display the correct character. The module features one input port and one output port. The input port 'hex' is a 4-bit input port that accepts a hexadecimal number ranging from 0 to F. In contrast, the output port 'seg' is a 7-bit output port that provides the correspondence between the inputted hexadecimal number and the 7-segment display's segments that need to be illuminated to represent the hexadecimal digit accurately. Each bit in this output symbolizes the status (on/off) of a certain segment on the 7-segment display. Although the module does not strictly possess internal signals due to its structure containing only a block of combinational logic (the assign statement) and no register to retain any signal values internally, we recognize the different conditions and implications within the assign statement as 'pseudo-internal signals'. In the assign statement, there's a defined condition that compares the 'hex' input with a range of hexadecimal digits. Depending on the 'hex' input's equivalence with each condition, an output binary configuration is generated which forms the 'seg' output to represent the inputted hexadecimal digit on the seven-segment display. Each binary configuration signifies how the segments of the display should be enabled (on/off) to depict a distinct hexadecimal digit.
