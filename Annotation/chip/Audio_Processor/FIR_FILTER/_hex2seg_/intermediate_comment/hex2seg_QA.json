Explanation: This module is converting a 4-bit hexadecimal number ('hex' input) into a 7-segment display format ('seg' output), often used in digital display systems.

Explanation: The 'seg' is a 7-bit output port that provides the correspondence between the hexadecimal input and the segments of a 7-segment display that need to be lit in order to represent the input hexadecimal digit accurately.
