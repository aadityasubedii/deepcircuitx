It takes an input clock signal (inclk0) and generates 3 output clock signals (c0, c1, c2) with different characteristics. The module uses an altpll instance (Phase Locked Loop) found in more advanced FPGA families provided by Altera (now Intel). The output clocks (c0, c1, c2) are derived from the base clock signal with different divisions and phase shifts as defined in the module parameters. This PLL is typically used to provide the necessary clock signals for SDRAM timing requirements in FPGA designs."
