    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe SDRAM_PLL module is designed to generate three output clocks (\"c0\", \"c1\", and \"c2\") from an input clock (\"inclk0\"), employing an altpll component instance for FPGA-driven SDRAM applications. The output clocks' frequency and phase are defined by the parameters within the altpll instance, facilitated by the 'sub_wire0' to 'sub_wire6' internal wires, which handle the port connections and signal manipulations. Functionality is realized through multiple defparams that condition the specificities of the module, enabling customization of outputs per design requirements."
