Module name: SDRAM_PLL. 

Module specification: The SDRAM_PLL is a phase-locked loop (PLL) module specifically designed for Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (SDRAM) used in FPGA designs. Its primary function is to take an input clock signal (named as "inclk0") and synthesize three output clock signals (designated "c0", "c1", "c2") from it. These output clocks are conditioned versions of the input clock and can have different frequencies and phase shifts as defined inside the module parameters. The module uses an instance of the altpll component provided by Altera (now Intel) for this purpose.

In terms of input and output ports, "inclk0" serves as the input clock port to the module. The module generates three output clocks "c0", "c1" and "c2" derived from the input clock using the altpll component with diverse divisions and phase shifts set in the module parameters.

The internal signals used include "sub_wire0" which is a 6-bit wide wire representing the output clock from the altpll component. This is then divided into three individual wires named "sub_wire1", "sub_wire2", and "sub_wire3" representing the bits 0, 1, and 2 of "sub_wire0" and correspond to the output clocks "c0", "c1", and "c2" respectively. Additionally, "sub_wire4" is used for the input clock ("inclk0") while "sub_wire5" is a 2-bit wire composed of "sub_wire4" and "sub_wire6" (initially assigned the value 0), serving as an input to the altpll instance.

The overall code comprises majorly of the altpll instance declaration and its parameter definitions (defparam) controlling the characteristics of the output clocks amongst other operations. Specifically, it firstly defines the connections to the altpll instance using the predefined external and internal ports. Secondly, it sets the specific properties of the module such as the input frequency, clock division, multiplication factors, phase shifts, and active/inactive ports via the defparam statements. Each of these control characteristics like frequency, phase shift of the output clocks, and signifies the mode of operation, contributing to the customization and tuning of the output clocks "c0", "c1", and "c2". 

In conclusion, the SDRAM_PLL module is a tailored CLK synthesizer providing multiple controlled output clock signals from a singular input, consequently realizing crucial SDRAM timing requirements in FPGA designs.
