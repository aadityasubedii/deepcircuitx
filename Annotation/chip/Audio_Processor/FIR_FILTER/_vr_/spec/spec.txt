Module name: vr. 

Module specification: 

The 'vr' module is a multi-functional system designed for processing audio and video signals. It encompasses several submodules including SDRAM memory control, clock generation, audio controller, playback and record unit, VGA display adapter, and hex-to-7seg decoder. The central task performed by this module includes proper control of memory data, audio processing, VGA signal generation, Hex display decoding, and managing various user inputs. 

The input ports of this module are: DRAM_DQ, a bidirectional port for SDRAM; CLOCK_50, the system clock; KEY and SW, which takes user inputs; AUD_ADCLRCK, AUD_ADCDAT, AUD_DACLRCK, which are the analogue to digital converter clock and data input; AUD_BCLK, the audio interface clock; I2C_SDAT, the I2C data line. These input ports provide essential control signals, data, and clock to the system. 

The output ports include: DRAM_ADDR, address for SDRAM; DRAM_LDQM, DRAM_UDQM, DRAM_WE_N, DRAM_CAS_N, DRAM_RAS_N, DRAM_CS_N, DRAM_BA_0, DRAM_BA_1, DRAM_CLK, DRAM_CKE which are SDRAM control signals; HEX0, HEX1, HEX2, HEX3, the 7-segment display output; LEDG and LEDR control the display LEDs; AUD_DACDAT is the audio data output; I2C_SCLK is the I2C clock line; VGA interface signals include VGA_HS, VGA_VS, VGA_BLANK, VGA_SYNC, VGA_R, VGA_G, VGA_B. The outputs are utilized for sending data and control signals to peripheral components ensuring the correct operation of memory, display, and data transfer functions.

Several critical internal signals used for managing and coordinating tasks within the module include reset, ram control signals, audio control signals, vga control signals, user control signals, and the display_data_scaled signals that manage the scaled data for display.

The major blocks or sections in the code include the SDRAM memory control, the audio controller, the play and record control unit, the VGA adapter, and the hex-to-7seg decoder. The SDRAM block interfaces with the memory, the audio controller handles the audio processing, the play and record control unit manage user commands and audio data, the VGA adapter handles video display, and the hex-to-7seg decoder manages the display on 7 segment display. Each functionality is implemented discreetly in its respective block, which are all encapsulated and managed by the top-level 'vr' module.
