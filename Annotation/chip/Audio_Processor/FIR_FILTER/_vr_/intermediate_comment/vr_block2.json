    "block_comment": "The block of code is used to control an LED (referred to as LEDG[8]). Depending on the condition (\"pause\"), it either emits a blinking pattern determined by the count number represented by \"blink_cnt[25]\" or it remains switched off. In terms of implementation, a ternary operator is used to check the status of \"pause\". If \"pause\" is true, the value of \"blink_cnt[25]\" is assigned to the LEDG[8], otherwise the value '0' turns off the LED."
