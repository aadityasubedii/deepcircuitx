    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'vr' module integrates submodules for SDRAM memory, audio control, playback/record unit, VGA adapter, and hex-to-7seg decoder to process audio-video signals. Memory control, audio processing, VGA display, and hex display decoding are performed through bidirectional SDRAM data port, audio interface, VGA interface signals, and user controls input. Implementation leverages various internal signals for inter-block communication and system-wide control. The module structure follows a top-level design ensuring discreet handling of each functionality."
