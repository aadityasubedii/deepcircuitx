    "block_comment": "The provided block of code is responsible for managing the data in the 'za_data' register. It specifically determines how the 'za_data' register should respond to changes in system clock ('clk') or reset signals ('reset_n'). If the reset signal is negative (equivalent to a digital '0'), the block resets the 'za_data' register to 0. If the reset is not activated, it causes 'za_data' to mirror the value present in the 'zs_dq' register at the rising edge of the system clock."
