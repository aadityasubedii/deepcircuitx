    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is responsible for handling the memory command, address, data, and bank information, and determining the chip-select operation based on the command state. Inside, the memory command `m_cmd` is unpacked to control signals, `m_addr`, `m_data`, `m_dqm`, and `m_bank` are assigned to the corresponding interface wires. `clk_en` is set to '1'. This block also decides the `f_select` signal based on `f_pop` and `pending` signals. Then, it decides `cs_n` based on `f_select` and `active_cs_n`. At last, `cs_n` is assigned to `csn_decode`."
