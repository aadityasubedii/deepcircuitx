    "block_comment": "The given Verilog code block designs a synchronous counter circuit with a reset facility. It specifically contributes to a subsystem that handles memory refresh operations. Upon a negative reset signal ('reset_n' == 0), the counter resets to an initial value of 5000. Otherwise, on every positive edge of the clock cycle, the counter decreases by one ('refresh_counter' -= 1). However, if the counter drops to zero, it is reinitialized to 781, ensuring a cyclical operation within specified boundaries."
