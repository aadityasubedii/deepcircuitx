    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a data read operation from a 2-entry memory. It selects one of the two memory entries to read based on the `rd_address` value. The operation is implemented using an `always` block that triggers on any change to either `entry_0`, `entry_1`, or `rd_address`. The code then uses a case statement on the `rd_address` to handle the read operation. If `rd_address` is 0, `rd_data` is set to `entry_0`, and if `rd_address` is 1, `rd_data` is set to `entry_1`. If `rd_address` is not 0 or 1, the default case is invoked, which does nothing."
