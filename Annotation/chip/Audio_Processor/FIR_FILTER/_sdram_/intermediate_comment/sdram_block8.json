    "block_comment": "This block of code is a state machine for a memory controller in Verilog. It uses various registers to handle commands, address, data, and control state transitions for tasks such as reading, writing, and refreshing the memory. Upon each positive edge of a clock cycle, the code block checks for reset or the current state and makes corresponding changes. If a reset occurs, it sets all registers to default values. Without reset, it moves sequentially through various states (identified by binary numbers). Each state represents a specific memory action. For example, \"9'b000000010\" state relates to writing to memory, with command, bank, address, and data being set accordingly. Some of the registers set within each state include `m_cmd` (to organize the command), `m_addr` (to manage the address), or `m_dqm` (to handle data mask signals). These state transitions continue on every clock cycle, ensuring the memory controller carries out necessary operations as defined by the commands issued."
