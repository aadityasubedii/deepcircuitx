Module name: sdram_0_input_efifo_module. Explanation: This module acts as a FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer for the SDRAM inputs. It ensures synchronization of data coming from different clock domains, by defining flags for empty, full, almost empty, and almost full conditions. It modifies the status of these flags based on the conditions of data read or write operations.\n\n2. Module name: sdram. Explanation: The `sdram` module defines the interface to the SDRAM memory, handles the signals and conditions for different states of SDRAM like active, data read/write, and refresh states. It also keeps track of the refresh counter to generate the refresh request, while also ensuring the data integrity and synchronization of the read and write operations. This module uses the previously defined `sdram_0_input_efifo_module` for managing its input buffers. It's crucial for interactions with SDRAM memory, which is commonly used in hardware designs requiring large, cheap and non-volatile storage."
