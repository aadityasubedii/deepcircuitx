    "block_comment": "The block of code describes a memory writing process that occurs at positive edges of the clock cycle. It checks if the memory write (wr) signal is activated and if the memory is not full. If these conditions are met, the code switches between writing data (wr_data) to entry_0 or entry_1 depending on the value of the write address (wr_address). If the write address is neither 0 nor 1, no operation is performed."
