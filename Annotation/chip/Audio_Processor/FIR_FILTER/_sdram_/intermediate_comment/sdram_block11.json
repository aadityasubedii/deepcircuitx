    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block runs a Finite State Machine (FSM) which drives commands based on state transitions, determined by state variables i_state and i_next, and command variables i_cmd and i_addr. It is driven on an active-high clock edge or when reset_n negative edge triggers. On reset, all variables are initialized to known values. Subsequently, with each clock tick, the FSM transitions between different states: '000' (idle), '001' (prepare to issue command), '010' (refresh or do a set of actions and possibly switch to another state), '011' (execute issued command and possibly decrement a counter), '101' (wait state), and '111' (issue a specific command and prepare to transition to wait state). The end state or transition path is determined by multiple conditions like refresh_counter or value of i_refs and i_count."
