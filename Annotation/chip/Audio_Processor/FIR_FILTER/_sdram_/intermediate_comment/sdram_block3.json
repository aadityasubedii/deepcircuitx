    "block_comment": "This block of code extracts and assigns the value from the 3 least significant bits (LSBs) of `m_cmd` (bits in indexes 2 to 0 inclusive) to the variable `cmd_code`. The `assign` keyword in Verilog is used here for continuous assignment, meaning the value of `cmd_code` will always reflect the current value of the designated bits of `m_cmd`. This block can be used in a context where `m_cmd` represents a command or instruction set where the last three bits encode a command code."
