This block of code is responsible for ensuring the initialization of a specific state in a state machine, specifically the `3'b101` state. It manages this function based on the system clock (`clk`) and a reset condition (`reset_n`). Upon a negative edge of the reset signal, the block resets the `init_done` signal to `0`. Otherwise, on the subsequent positive edge of the clock signal, it sets the `init_done` signal to high when `i_state` reaches `3'b101`. This block enables system initialization and state tracking.
