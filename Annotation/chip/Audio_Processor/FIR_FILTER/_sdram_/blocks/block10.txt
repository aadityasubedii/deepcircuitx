Comment: 
The block is essentially dedicated to comparing a set of current attributes with corresponding future attributes. It specifically identifies whether there's a match between the active and future states of the chip select (csn), read not write (rnw), bank information, and row address. The final line of the block generates a pending status based on whether all these conditions match and if the future state isn't empty. Using the assign keyword, the block assigns respective boolean values to different matching conditions. It uses bitwise operations for comparisons and logical operators like "&&" (AND) and "!" (NOT) to calculate the overall pending status.
