This block assigns a value to the 'rd_strobe' signal based on a conditional equality check. It checks whether the three least significant bits (LSBs) of the 'm_cmd' signal are equal to the 3-bit binary equivalent of 5 (3'h5 in hexadecimal notation). If the condition is true, 'rd_strobe' gets a value of 1 (true), else it remains at 0 (false). This implementation can typically be used for command decoding or signaling specific command instructions in a memory or processor design.
