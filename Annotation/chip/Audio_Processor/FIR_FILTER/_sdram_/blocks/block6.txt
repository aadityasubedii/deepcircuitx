This block of code is used to shift and update the 'rd_valid' register on every positive edge of the clock or negative edge of the 'reset_n' signal. Basically, if the 'reset_n' signal is low (0), then 'rd_valid' register is reset to a value of 3'b000. However, if 'reset_n' is not low (is high), then 'rd_valid' register is updated by shifting its contents by one to the left and inserting 'rd_strobe' at its rightmost bit while the other two rightmost bits are set to zero.
