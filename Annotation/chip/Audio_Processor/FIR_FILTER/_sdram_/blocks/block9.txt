This block assigns a value to "cas_addr" based on the output of a conditional statement. The implementation utilises a ternary operator which checks if "f_select" is activated. If so, the 8 bit binary number from "f_addr" is concatenated with four leading zeros and assigned to "cas_addr". Otherwise, the value of "active_addr" is used in the same way, with the 8 lower bits selected and four leading zeros added before assignment.
