Comment: 
This block defines a synchronous reset mechanism based on a clock signal, and conditions to update the 'za_cannotrefresh' register. Upon receiving a low signal on 'reset_n' during either positive edge of clock or when 'reset_n' goes low, 'za_cannotrefresh' is asynchronously reset to zero. Following the reset, if there is a refresh request and the refresh counter is zero, the 'za_cannotrefresh' register is updated to the outcome of the logical AND operation of the two conditions.
