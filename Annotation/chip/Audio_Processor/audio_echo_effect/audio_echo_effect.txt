The audio_echo_effect repository encapsulates a comprehensive suite tailored for implementing and testing various audio echo effects on digital audio data streams. At the heart of this repository is the 'audio_echo_effect_top' module available in multiple designs adapted for both Lattice Radiant and Lattice Diamond projects, facilitating echo effects on audio signals through submodules like 'serial_audio_decoder', 'dual_clock_buffer', 'audio_echo_effect', and 'spdif_audio_encoder' for processing and SPDIF output encoding. Other core components include 'sample_processor' for auditing processing through delaying buffers and computation logic, 'sample_delay_buffer' for managing audio sample flow, and dedicated modules for RAM storage. Additionally, serialization and parallelization are handled by 'stereo_audio_serializer' and 'stereo_audio_parallelizer', which respectively manage the serializing and parallelizing of processed audio. The repository also accommodates a robust series of test benches like 'audio_echo_processor_tb', and 'stereo_audio_parallel_serial_tb' designed to validate each componentâ€™s functionality thoroughly using simulated input scenarios and internal signal and data handling mechanisms to ensure reliable operations and easy integration into larger digital signal processing systems or analogous audio systems.
