    "spec": "Module name: sample_processor. \n\nModule specification: The sample_processor serves as an audio data processing module that handles audio data input on left and right channels and delivers output on the same channels. It features adjustable 'audio_width' and 'delay_samples' parameters, and operates with the standard valid-ready handshake mechanism. The module inputs include 'reset' that initializes the module, 'clk' for timing the operations, 'i_valid', 'i_left', and 'i_right' which marks valid left and right audio signals for processing, and 'o_ready' for allowing the next output from the module. The outputs include 'i_ready' that signals readiness for more input, 'o_valid' along with 'o_left' and 'o_right' which signals valid processed left and right audio signals. The internal logic utilizes several registers and wires, such as 'i_valid_processor', 'i_ready_processor', 'o_valid_processor', 'o_ready_processor', 'i_current_left/right', 'i_buffer_left/right', and 'o_current_left/right', 'o_feedback_left/right', which act as intermediary and feedback signals in between the sample_delay_buffer instance and main module logics. It uses a 'sample_delay_buffer' instance for maintaining a delay in the audio data, and couples it with the logic within a posedge clock or posedge reset block to perform advanced calculations on the audio signals, resulting in processed output and feedback signals.",

It features an interface for audio input on the left and right channels and for output on the same channels. These channels are configurable by 'audio_width' and 'delay_samples' parameters. The module includes a sample_delay_buffer instance (most probably for maintaining a certain delay in the audio sample data). Based on the logic in posedge clock or posedge reset block, it performs calculations on the input audio signals and accumulates the processed resultant signals. The output signals, `o_current_left` and `o_current_right` are the audios after processing while `o_feedback_left` and `o_feedback_right` are the feedback signals for the left and right channels, respectively. The module communicates with the external world using the standard valid-ready handshake mechanism, where `i_valid` & `i_ready` represent input lines and `o_valid` & `o_ready` represent output lines. The calculations involved in the processing seem to involve both the current and buffered signals (possibly creating some feedback based audio effects)."
