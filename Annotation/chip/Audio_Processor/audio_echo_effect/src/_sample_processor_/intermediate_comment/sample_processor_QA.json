It features an interface for audio input on the left and right channels and for output on the same channels. These channels are configurable by 'audio_width' and 'delay_samples' parameters. The module includes a sample_delay_buffer instance (most probably for maintaining a certain delay in the audio sample data). Based on the logic in posedge clock or posedge reset block, it performs calculations on the input audio signals and accumulates the processed resultant signals. The output signals, `o_current_left` and `o_current_right` are the audios after processing while `o_feedback_left` and `o_feedback_right` are the feedback signals for the left and right channels, respectively. The module communicates with the external world using the standard valid-ready handshake mechanism, where `i_valid` & `i_ready` represent input lines and `o_valid` & `o_ready` represent output lines. The calculations involved in the processing seem to involve both the current and buffered signals (possibly creating some feedback based audio effects)."
