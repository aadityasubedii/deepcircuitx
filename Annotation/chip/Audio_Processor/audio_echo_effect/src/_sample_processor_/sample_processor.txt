Module-level comment: The 'sample_processor' is an audio data processing module, accepting inputs on two channels and producing corresponding outputs. It includes control ports 'reset' and 'clk', valid-ready handshake mechanism, and audio channels. Its internal design encloses a 'sample_delay_buffer' instance and a logic block to perform advanced audio computations. The 'sample_delay_buffer' temporizes audio data, and the logic block, working on the posedge of the 'clk' or 'reset', operates on current and buffered data, generating resultant outputs and feedback signals. Ensuring delay and feedback effects, this module efficiently processes audio data.
