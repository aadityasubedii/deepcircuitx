Module name: sample_processor. 

Module specification: The sample_processor serves as an audio data processing module that handles audio data input on left and right channels and delivers output on the same channels. It features adjustable 'audio_width' and 'delay_samples' parameters, and operates with the standard valid-ready handshake mechanism. The module inputs include 'reset' that initializes the module, 'clk' for timing the operations, 'i_valid', 'i_left', and 'i_right' which marks valid left and right audio signals for processing, and 'o_ready' for allowing the next output from the module. The outputs include 'i_ready' that signals readiness for more input, 'o_valid' along with 'o_left' and 'o_right' which signals valid processed left and right audio signals. The internal logic utilizes several registers and wires, such as 'i_valid_processor', 'i_ready_processor', 'o_valid_processor', 'o_ready_processor', 'i_current_left/right', 'i_buffer_left/right', and 'o_current_left/right', 'o_feedback_left/right', which act as intermediary and feedback signals in between the sample_delay_buffer instance and main module logics. It uses a 'sample_delay_buffer' instance for maintaining a delay in the audio data, and couples it with the logic within a posedge clock or posedge reset block to perform advanced calculations on the audio signals, resulting in processed output and feedback signals.
