    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, single_port_ram, functions as a single port RAM. It utilizes an internal one-dimensional register array 'mem' for storage. Operations (read/write) are executed at the clk's rising edge. If write_en is high, write_data is written at the addr in mem; otherwise, data at addr in mem is loaded into read_data. All addressing is done using addr, making memory operations dynamic and efficient."
