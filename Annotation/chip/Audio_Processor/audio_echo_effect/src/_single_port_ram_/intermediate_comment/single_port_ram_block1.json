    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a simple memory write/read operation. When the system clock edge is on the rise, it checks the write enable signal. If 'write_en' is true then it writes the data from 'write_data' into the memory address defined by 'addr', otherwise, it transfers the data from the memory 'addr' location to 'read_data'."
