Explanation: This module provides the functionality of a single port Random Access Memory (RAM). It consists of an array \"mem\" that has a size and width defined by the parameters \"size\" and \"width\". The RAM contents can be read or written based on the \"write_en\" signal. When \"write_en\" signal is active, data at the provided address \"addr\" is replaced by the data \"write_data\" on the rising edge of the clock signal \"clk\". In case \"write_en\" is inactive, the data from the address \"addr\" is read and placed into \"read_data\" on rising edge of the clock signal \"clk\"."
