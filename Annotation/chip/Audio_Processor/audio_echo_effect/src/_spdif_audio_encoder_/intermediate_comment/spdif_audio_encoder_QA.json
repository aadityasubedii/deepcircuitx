It works in conjunction with dual_clock_buffer and spdif_frame_encoder modules. It takes an incoming audio stream and splits it into left and right parts for dual channel audio encoding. \n\nThe spdif_audio_encoder module processes input audio stream according to SPDIF format. It receives inputs from a clock, a reset signal, two clock signals, audio and its channel indicator. The module features two clocking domains separated by a dual clock FIFO (dual_clock_buffer). It takes audio data and a left/rigidentifier on the clock's posedge rising edge. Then, the data is passed forward on clk128's posedge. \n\nAudio is transmitted as stereo pair, where left and right channel alternate each time. The spdif_frame_encoder prepares the S/PDIF frames composing the preamble, the audio data, validity, user data, control data and finally parity bit. Output of this module is 'spdif' signal which is a sequence of frames in S/PDIF format. This module works synchronously based on the clk256 and clk signals as well as a reset signal to initialize or reset its operations."
