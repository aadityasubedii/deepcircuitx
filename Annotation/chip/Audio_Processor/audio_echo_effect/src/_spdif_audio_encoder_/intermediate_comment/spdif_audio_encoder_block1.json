    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as an instantiation of a S/PDIF (Sony/Philips Digital Interface) frame encoder module in a digital audio system. It's responsible for taking incoming valid audio data and encoding it to conform to the S/PDIF specification. The module, parameterized by the audio_width, uses a 128MHz clock signal (clk128) and reset signal for synchronization. Audio data is received through the i_audio input, while the o_is_left input determines if the data pertains to the left channel. Inputs i_user and i_control are fixed at zero, suggesting user data and control data aren't incorporated into the resulting S/PDIF data stream. The output S/PDIF stream is driven onto spdif."
