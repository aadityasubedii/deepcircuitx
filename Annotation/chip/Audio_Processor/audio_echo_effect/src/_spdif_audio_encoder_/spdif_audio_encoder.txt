Module-level comment: The spdif_audio_encoder module encodes incoming audio data into SPDIF format. It uses dual_clock_buffer for handling different clock domains and buffering data, and spdif_frame_encoder for creating SPDIF frames from valid audio data. Inputs include audio data, its channel indicator, and clock signals while outputs include SPDIF encoded audio data and a readiness indicator. It synchronously operates based on clock signals and requires a reset signal for initialization. An internal parameter, 'audio-width,' defines the bit-width of one audio sample.
