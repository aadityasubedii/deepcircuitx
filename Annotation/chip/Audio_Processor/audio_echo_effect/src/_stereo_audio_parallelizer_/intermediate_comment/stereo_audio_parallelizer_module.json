    "module": "Module-level comment: This stereo_audio_parallelizer is a Verilog module designed to convert an incoming sequential stereo audio signal into two parallel signals for the left and right channels. The module takes the stereo audio data as input and aligns it to the left or right output register based on the `i_is_left` flag. It energetically readies itself to accept data by issuing `i_ready` signal high upon reset and dynamically manages `i_ready` based on the data flow. The `o_valid` signal indicates the availability of valid stereo data. The module ensures synchronous operations with positive-edge clocking and reset controls."
