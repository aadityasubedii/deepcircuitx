It accepts the audio input data (`i_audio`) which can represent either the left or right channels depending on the `i_is_left` flag. Upon reset, it sets the `i_ready` signal high, meaning it is ready to accept data. Based on `i_is_left` flag, it loads the received audio data into `o_left` or `o_right` accordingly. When each channel data is loaded, the `i_ready` signal is toggled based on the `i_is_left` flag. Once both left and right channel data are available, it sets `o_valid` signal high, indicating that valid parallelized stereo data is available for output. If the destination is not ready (`o_ready` low), it makes `i_ready` low, thus preventing new data from entering."
