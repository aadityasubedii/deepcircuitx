    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the state of an audio channel system in a synchronous design. When the system performs a reset operation, the block sets `i_ready` signal to high and clears both left and right channel signals. During operation, the block prioritizes processing signals from the left channel. If there is a valid input signal and it corresponds to the left channel, the signal is passed to `o_left`; if it is from right channel, the signal is passed to `o_right`. The `i_ready` signal status is updated based on the input channel type. In case `i_ready` is false, it gets synchronized with `o_ready` signal status."
