Explanation: The audio_echo_effect module seems to be a hardware design implementing an audio echo effect considering its name. It receives stereo audio input data (`i_audio`) and whether the incoming audio is the left channel (`i_is_left`) in a serialized format. It then deserializes the audio using the `stereo_audio_parallelizer` submodule. After that, the `sample_processor` submodule applies the audio effect and possibly delays the audio samples. Finally, the processed audio is then serialized back into a format that can be transmitted out by the `stereo_audio_serializer` submodule. The output serialized audio is available on `o_audio` with a flag indicating if it is the left channel (`o_is_left`). The module uses common interfaces for streaming data: valid and ready signals."
