Module name: audio_echo_effect. 

Module specification: The audio_echo_effect module is a hardware design which implements an audio echo effect. It accepts serialized stereo audio input and deserializes it using a submodule called `stereo_audio_parallelizer`. Another submodule, `sample_processor`, processes this data and applies the audio effect, potentially delaying the samples. Then, a third submodule, `stereo_audio_serializer`, serializes the processed audio back to a format that can be transmitted out. The output is flagged to indicate the left channel using `o_is_left` signal. 

Input and output ports include `reset` (system reset), `clk` (system clock), `i_valid` (current input audio data validity), `i_is_left` (indicates if current audio is left channel), `i_audio` (audio data input), `o_ready` (readiness of output receiving module), `i_ready` (module's readiness to accept new input), `o_valid` (current output data validity), `o_is_left` (indicates if output data is left channel) and `o_audio` (audio data output). 

Internal signals include `parallelizer_valid`, `parallelizer_ready`, `parallelizer_left`, `parallelizer_right`, `processor_valid`, `processor_ready`, `processor_left`, `processor_right`, `serializer_valid`, `serializer_ready`, `serializer_is_left` and `serializer_audio`. These are used to maintain the interface between the main module and the submodules and to carry data and its validity status between them. 

The code is segmented into three blocks, each representing a submodule (`stereo_audio_parallelizer`, `sample_processor`, `stereo_audio_serializer`), which work together to implement the audio echo effect by deserializing the audio data, processing it and then serializing it back for output. This specification depicts a comprehensive and detailed overview of the module's design and operation.
