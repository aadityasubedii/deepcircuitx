Module-level comment: This module, audio_echo_effect, implements an audio echo effect on serialized stereo audio. It utilizes three submodules: `stereo_audio_parallelizer` for deserialization, `sample_processor` for the echo effect, and `stereo_audio_serializer` for re-serialization of processed audio. Input/output valid and ready signals, audio data, and channel status are managed via external ports. Internal communication between submodules is secured through a set of dedicated signals. A system clock and reset are also incorporated.
