Comment: 
This block is a clock-driven (on positive edge) debugging mechanism that prints out the values of `o_left` and `o_right` when `o_valid` signal is high or true. In the case of a reset, the block does nothing. The `if` conditions handle the control flow based on the signals `reset` and `o_valid`, while `$write` function prints the hexadecimal value of `o_left` and `o_right` to the console.
