This block of code generates a clock signal with a period of CLK_TIME units. It does this by initializing the clock signal (clk) to 0 and then in an infinite loop (forever), it toggles the clock value every CLK_TIME / 2 units of time. This results in a clock signal that oscillates between 0 and 1 at a frequency determined by CLK_TIME.
