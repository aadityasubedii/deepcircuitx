This block of code initializes the simulation phase of the Verilog design. It does this by firstly creating a new dump (.vcd) file titled "audio_echo_processor_tb.vcd", which stores the waveforms that characterize the simulation run. It then uses the "$dumpvars" system task to write all changes in signal values to the .vcd file. This is essential for debugging and post-simulation verification analysis.
