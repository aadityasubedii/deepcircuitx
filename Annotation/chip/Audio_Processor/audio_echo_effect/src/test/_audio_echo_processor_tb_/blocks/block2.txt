The block of code represents a Verilog task called "out_data" which is responsible for transferring audio data. It takes in two inputs, left and right audio data channels and sets them to internal variables i_left and i_right respectively. It also sets i_valid to '1' signaling data is ready for transfer before waiting for the 'i_ready' signal to go high, denoting the readiness of the receiver, on the next clock cycle. Once the data transfer occurs, it sets i_valid back to '0' signalling end of current data transfer, and waits for the next clock cycle.
