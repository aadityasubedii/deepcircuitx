    "spec": "Module name: audio_echo_processor_tb.\n\nModule specification: \n\nThe 'audio_echo_processor_tb' is a testbench module for the 'audio_echo_processor' module. Its primary function is to test the 'audio_echo_processor' module under specific pseudo-real conditions, provide different inputs, simulate clock signals, and monitor the output of the processor module. \n\nThe module has several input ports including 'clk', a clock signal input for the module; 'reset', a reset signal input; 'i_valid', a signal indicating the current input data is valid; 'i_left', the input audio data for the left channel; 'i_right', the input audio data for the right channel. \n\nIt also has multiple output ports: 'i_ready', an output signal that indicates the module is ready to take new input data; 'o_valid', an output signal that indicates output data is valid; 'o_left', the output audio data for the left channel; 'o_right', the output audio data for the right channel.\n\nInternally, the module generates the clock signal 'clk'. It contains several signals and registers, all of which contribute to the functioning of the module. The 'CLK_TIME' internal parameter sets the clock speed based on the audio sample rate and bit depth. There are registers 'i_left' and 'i_right' that carry the audio data for left and right channels. Lastly, there are binary signals 'reset', 'i_valid', 'o_valid' and 'o_ready' controlling functionalities like resetting the module, input and output data control.\n\nThe code takes the form of a typical testbench, featuring an initial block that creates a dump file and sets initial variables and parameters. It then moves on to testing procedures, which are carried out by passing sequences of datas to 'audio_echo_processor', observing the response for each clock cycle until a finish command is issued. With the internal task 'out_data', it drives input data to the 'audio_echo_processor'. This module is crucial for validating and examining the functionality of 'audio_echo_processor' within a simulated environment.",

This module generates a clock signal, tests the 'audio_echo_processor' module under specific conditions, and provides varying input values for the module. It writes out the audio data values for the left and right channels on each clock cycle when the output is valid. It is designed to validate and inspect the operation of the 'audio_echo_processor' by generating specific audio data and observing the resultant behavior.
