    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog RTL code acts as an initializer and data tester. Initially, the reset signal is set high, de-asserting the 'i_valid' signal, asserting 'o_ready' signal, and the left and right input values to zero. Following the two clock cycles, the reset signal is then set low. Subsequent lines indicate a series of calls to 'out_data', whereby specific values are input for testing purposes. The process synchronizes to 16 further clock cycles before terminating with the '$finish' call."
