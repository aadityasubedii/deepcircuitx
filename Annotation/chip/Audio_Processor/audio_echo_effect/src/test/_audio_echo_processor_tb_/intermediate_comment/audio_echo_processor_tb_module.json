    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe 'audio_echo_processor_tb' is a testbench module purpose-built to verify the 'audio_echo_processor' module by simulating a range of input scenarios and observing the output. It generates a clock signal and initializes modules while employing varying inputs. It manages input and output data using several ports like 'clk', 'reset', 'i_left/right', 'i/o_valid', and 'i/o_ready'. Through its internal task 'out_data', it feeds defined input data sequences into the 'audio_echo_processor', allowing detailed investigation of its behavior under simulated conditions."
