    "block_comment": "This block is an initialization procedure for a system with simulated clock cycles and input data. The operation starts by disabling the 'valid' flag and triggering a reset, which is held active for two clock cycles. The reset is then disabled and the ensuing operation is to feed a sequence of inputs to the 'intake' function, alternating between the states '1' and '0' with pre-determined hex values. This is followed by setting 'i_valid' flag to '0' and waiting for 'intake_count' to equal 'outlet_count'. After clocking for additional 32 cycles, the operation is concluded by calling the '$finish()' function to end the simulation."
