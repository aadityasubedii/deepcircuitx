    "block_comment": "This block handles the intake of provided audio signals. It accepts a binary indicator 'is_left' and a 32-bit 'value' representing the audio signal. Upon invocation, it flags 'i_valid' to signal the valid data and then assigns 'is_left' and 'value' to 'i_is_left' and 'i_audio' respectively. It then waits for the positive edge of the clock. If 'i_ready' is not flagged, the task waits until 'i_ready' before incrementing 'intake_count'. The 'intake_count' is used to keep track of how many audio signals have been processed."
