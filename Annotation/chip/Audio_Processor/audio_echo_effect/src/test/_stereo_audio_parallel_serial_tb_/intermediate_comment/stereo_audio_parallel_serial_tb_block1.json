    "block_comment": "This particular Verilog RTL code block observes changes on the rising edge of both the clock signal or the reset signal. If the reset signal is high, it renders the o_serial_ready signal high. The code also checks for the condition when both o_serial_valid and o_serial_ready are true, it then prints the current value of o_serial_is_left and o_serial_audio to the console. It also increments the outlet_count variable by 2."
