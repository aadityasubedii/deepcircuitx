Module name: stereo_audio_parallel_serial_tb
Module specification: The module is a testbench designed to verify the functionality of stereo audio data parallelization and serialization. It operates under a clock and resets signal, feeding in audio data to test parallelization and serialization of the data and validating synchronization at the end. The module's input ports include clk, reset, i_valid, i_is_left, and i_audio, representing the clock signal, reset signal, validity of the input data, whether the data pertains to the left stereo channel, and the actual audio data, respectively. The output ports include i_ready, o_valid, o_ready, o_left, o_right, o_serial_valid, o_serial_ready, o_serial_is_left, and o_serial_audio respectively confirming wait states, validity of the parallelized audio data, pipe-lining status, left and right audio channels data after parallelization and serialization, and signifying overall readiness of the module to output serialized data. Internal signals include counters intake_count and outlet_count, in addition to the aforementioned input and output ports being used for internal operations. The module includes an initial block that sets up and executes test cycles, an always block for signaling when data is ready for consumption and a task intake for feeding test data. This testbench is critical in ensuring the modules stereo_audio_parallelizer and stereo_audio_serializer are functioning correctly.
