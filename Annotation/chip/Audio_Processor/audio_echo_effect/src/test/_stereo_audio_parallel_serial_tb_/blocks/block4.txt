This block of code is responsible for generating a clock signal. It achieves this using an initial block combined with a forever loop, which together continuously toggle the value of 'clk' every half of the set 'CLK_TIME'. The 'clk' signal starts at a low logic level (0), and then alternates between high (1) and low (0) to mimic a clock pulse.
