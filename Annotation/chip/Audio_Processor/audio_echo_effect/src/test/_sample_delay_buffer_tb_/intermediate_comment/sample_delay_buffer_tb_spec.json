    "spec": "Module name: sample_delay_buffer_tb.\nModule specification: The \"sample_delay_buffer_tb\" is a module serving as a testbench for \"sample_delay_buffer\". It interfaces with both `sample_delay_buffer` and `process_` modules by generating a series of predefined data inputs to `sample_delay_buffer`, then monitoring the output audio signals to check if the circuit operates correctly. It performs its operations based on clock and reset signals. There are three groups of ports \u2014 input, output and two-way ports. Input ports (\"reset\", \"clk\", \"i_valid\", \"o_ready\") are used for reset, clock, input data validation, and readiness of output data processing. Output ports (\"i_ready\", \"o_valid\", \"i_audio\", \"o_audio\", \"o_current\", \"o_buffer\", \"i_result\", \"i_buffer\") are responsible for flow control, carrying audio signals and processed data signals. The two-way ports participate in data flow control and audio data transmission. Internal module signals like \"i_valid_operator\", \"i_ready_operator\", \"o_valid_operator\", \"o_ready_operator\", \"o_current\", \"o_buffer\", \"i_valid_result\", \"i_ready_result\", \"i_result\", \"i_buffer\" serve for data flow control and data transmission inside the testbench. The testbench comprises several parts including initialisations, model instantiations, always block for data processing and monitoring, output data task and testing sequences.\n\nModule name: process.\nModule specification: The \"process\" module functions as a part of the audio signal processing pipeline. It receives audio samples as inputs, performs operations (in this case, addition) on these samples, and outputs the results. The module operates under control of the external clock signal and can be reset by receiving a reset signal. It has two groups of ports. Input ports (\"reset\", \"clk\", \"i_valid\", \"i_current\", \"i_buffer\", \"o_ready\") are utilised for reset, clock, data validation, input audio data, and readiness of output data processing. Output ports (\"i_ready\", \"o_valid\", \"o_result\", \"o_buffer\") control the flow and carry the resultante audio signal after processing. Despite being a simple module, the process module uses some control logic to manage the data flow and processing using valid and ready signals. It does not have internal signals as all operations are performed directly over input and output ports. The module is primarily formed by a single always block which controls the data processing and flow control logic.",

Module name: sample_delay_buffer_tb. \n   Explanation: This module is a testbench for a module named `sample_delay_buffer`. It generates a clock signal and interfaces with the `sample_delay_buffer` and `process_` modules. It sends series of defined data to the `sample_delay_buffer` and passes the output to `process` module. It also drives reset, i_valid signals and monitors the o_audio signal, to check if the entire circuit is working as expected. It appears to be a part of audio signal processing.\n\n2.

It interfaces with both `sample_delay_buffer` and `process_` modules by generating a series of predefined data inputs to `sample_delay_buffer`, then monitoring the output audio signals to check if the circuit operates correctly. It performs its operations based on clock and reset signals. There are three groups of ports \u2014 input, output and two-way ports. Input ports (\"reset\", \"clk\", \"i_valid\", \"o_ready\") are used for reset, clock, input data validation, and readiness of output data processing. Output ports (\"i_ready\", \"o_valid\", \"i_audio\", \"o_audio\", \"o_current\", \"o_buffer\", \"i_result\", \"i_buffer\") are responsible for flow control, carrying audio signals and processed data signals. The two-way ports participate in data flow control and audio data transmission. Internal module signals like \"i_valid_operator\", \"i_ready_operator\", \"o_valid_operator\", \"o_ready_operator\", \"o_current\", \"o_buffer\", \"i_valid_result\", \"i_ready_result\", \"i_result\", \"i_buffer\" serve for data flow control and data transmission inside the testbench. The testbench comprises several parts including initialisations, model instantiations, always block for data processing and monitoring, output data task and testing sequences.\n\nModule name: process.\nModule specification: The \"process\" module functions as a part of the audio signal processing pipeline. It receives audio samples as inputs, performs operations (in this case, addition) on these samples, and outputs the results. The module operates under control of the external clock signal and can be reset by receiving a reset signal. It has two groups of ports. Input ports (\"reset\", \"clk\", \"i_valid\", \"i_current\", \"i_buffer\", \"o_ready\") are utilised for reset, clock, data validation, input audio data, and readiness of output data processing. Output ports (\"i_ready\", \"o_valid\", \"o_result\", \"o_buffer\") control the flow and carry the resultante audio signal after processing. Despite being a simple module, the process module uses some control logic to manage the data flow and processing using valid and ready signals. It does not have internal signals as all operations are performed directly over input and output ports. The module is primarily formed by a single always block which controls the data processing and flow control logic."
