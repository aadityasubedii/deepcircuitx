    "block_comment": "This block primarily functions as a pipelined adder that adds input values 'i_current' and 'i_buffer'. To accomplish this, it utilizes ready-valid handshake signals for synchronization. Firstly, if a reset signal is detected, 'i_ready' is set true and 'o_valid' is set false, indicating the system is ready but no valid output is present. During each clock cycle, if a current valid input 'i_valid' exists, 'i_ready' becomes false, and addition operation is performed and stored in 'o_result'. In the meantime, 'i_buffer' remains the same. There's a two clock cycle delay before 'o_valid' is set to true, indicating a valid output is ready. However, if an 'o_valid' output exists simultaneously with 'o_ready', it sets 'o_valid' to false and 'i_ready' to true, marking an end to the current operation and making the system ready for next input."
