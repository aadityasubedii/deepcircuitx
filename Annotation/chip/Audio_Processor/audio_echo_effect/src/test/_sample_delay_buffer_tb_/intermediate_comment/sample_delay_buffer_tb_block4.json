    "block_comment": "The code provided is a synchronous block of Verilog RTL design, responsible for generating debug output on valid signals. The block is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock or a system-wide reset. If a reset signal is detected, the block doesn't perform any operation. Alternatively, on a clock rising edge, it examines if the output `o_valid` is true or not. If `o_valid` is true, it generates an 8-digit hexadecimal output representation of `o_audio`, likely representing an audio signal in the system."
