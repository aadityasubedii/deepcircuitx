Module name: sample_delay_buffer_tb. \n   Explanation: This module is a testbench for a module named `sample_delay_buffer`. It generates a clock signal and interfaces with the `sample_delay_buffer` and `process_` modules. It sends series of defined data to the `sample_delay_buffer` and passes the output to `process` module. It also drives reset, i_valid signals and monitors the o_audio signal, to check if the entire circuit is working as expected. It appears to be a part of audio signal processing.\n\n2. Module name: process. \n   Explanation: This module appears to be a part of the pipeline in a digital signal processing chain, specifically for audio processing. Given its interface, it seems to perform an operation on the input audio samples (i_current) and output the result (o_result). It syncs its operation with an internal clock signal and can be reset. It also controls the flow of data by using valid and ready flow control signals."
