Module-level comment: The "sample_delay_buffer_tb" is a testbench module interfacing with `sample_delay_buffer` and `process` modules, where it input audio data and checks circuit operation by monitoring the output. Inputs are fed based on 'valid' and 'ready' signals. The "process" module performs arithmetic operation on input audio samples, with data flow managed by controlling 'valid' and 'ready' signals. Essentially, it processes audios and outputs the results. No internal signals are used, all connections are from input/output ports.
