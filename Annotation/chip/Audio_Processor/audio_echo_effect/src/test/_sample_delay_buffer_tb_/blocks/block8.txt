This block of code initializes the simulation waveform dumping in Verilog. It manages dumping variables and variable changes to a .vcd (Value Change Dump) file, which is helpful for reviewing and debugging the design in a waveform viewer. Implemented through system tasks `$dumpfile` and `$dumpvars` which respectively specify the name of the output .vcd file and indicate dumping all top-level variables of the design.
