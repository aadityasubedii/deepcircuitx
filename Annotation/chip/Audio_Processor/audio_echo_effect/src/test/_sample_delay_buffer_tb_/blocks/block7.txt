This block of code is used to implement a clock generator. It uses an initial block to reset the clock 'clk' to low signal or '0'. Then, within a forever loop, it negates the clock signal after a certain delay which equals half of the defined clock period (CLK_TIME / 2). This effectively creates a clock signal that toggles between '0' and '1' with a period of 'CLK_TIME'.
