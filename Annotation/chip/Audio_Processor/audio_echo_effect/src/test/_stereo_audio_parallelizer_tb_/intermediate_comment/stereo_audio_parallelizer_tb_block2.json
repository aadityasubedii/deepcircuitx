    "block_comment": "The block initializes the registers and then repeatedly invokes the `intake` function with a set of specific input patterns. It first resets the outputs `o_ready` and `i_valid` and the `reset` register. After waiting for a positive clock edge, it turns off the reset. Then, it invokes the `intake` function with alternating high and low valid signals, each accompanied by different 32-bit data. The operation continues until the `intake_count` matches the `outlet_count`, asserting that all data passed through the intake process successfully processed and ready in outlet, after which the process finishes."
