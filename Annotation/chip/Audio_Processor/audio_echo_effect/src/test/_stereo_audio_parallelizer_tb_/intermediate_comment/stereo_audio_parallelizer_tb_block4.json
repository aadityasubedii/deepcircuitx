    "block_comment": "The block of code represents a clock signal generator in Verilog. The 'initial begin' block indicates the variable 'clk' is set to low (0) at time 0. The 'forever begin' block continuously toggles the 'clk' signal after each half period, 'CLK_TIME/2', which generates a periodic clock signal with a specific frequency defined by 'CLK_TIME'."
