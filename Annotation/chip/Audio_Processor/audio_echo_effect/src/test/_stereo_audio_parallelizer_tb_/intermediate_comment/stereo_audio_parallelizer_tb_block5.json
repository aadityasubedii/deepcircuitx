    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog sets up waveform logging for simulation analysis. It functions by declaring an initial block which execute the commands within it only once, at the beginning of the simulation. The $dumpfile command is used to specify the name of the output file that will contain the waveform information, here named \"stereo_audio_parallelizer_tb.vcd\". The $dumpvars command is used to dump all variables and waveforms at the start of simulation for later analysis."
