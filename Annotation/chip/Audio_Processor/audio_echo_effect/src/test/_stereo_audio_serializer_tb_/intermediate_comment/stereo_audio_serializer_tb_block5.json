    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is for setting up waveform dump for testbench debugging. At the beginning of simulation, it specifies \"stereo_audio_serializer_tb.vcd\" as the output file for storing waveform data and then dumps all variables' values in the testbench scope into this file. It helps in visualizing the changes in different signals throughout the simulation time, improving the debugging experience."
