    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for managing the audio encoder state. When a reset occurs, the circuit is set to its initial state where 'aligned_o_ready' is set to true, 'encoder_audio' is set to zero, and 'encoder_is_left' is set as false. If there's no reset, the block checks whether 'aligned_o_valid' and 'aligned_o_ready' are both true. In such a case, the encoder's audio and 'is_left' parameters are updated with 'aligned_o_audio' and 'aligned_o_is_left' respectively. This update is synchronized with the system clock, ensuring consistent audio encoding.\n"
