    "block_comment": "This block of code initialises a synchronous process that performs a series of actions when the simulation starts. It first asserts a reset signal for 2 clock cycles, then deasserts it for the next 20 clock cycles. The block also invokes the `out_data` function four times with four different pairs of hexadecimal arguments. After that, it waits for 32 more clock cycles before terminating the simulation. The set of actions are useful for testing hardware designs where an alignment and a reset process are followed by a series of data outputs then followed by a waiting period, before the simulation ends."
