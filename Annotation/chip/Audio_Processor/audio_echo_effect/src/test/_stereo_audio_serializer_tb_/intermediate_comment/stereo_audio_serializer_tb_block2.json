    "block_comment": "The block is a `task` in Verilog that handles alignment and transmission of audio data. It accepts left and right audio streams from a stereo sound source, aligns them internally using signals `aligned_i_left` and `aligned_i_right`, and flags their availability for further processing via the `aligned_i_valid` signal. On readiness by receiving system clock positive edge and confirming `aligned_i_ready`, it then waits for another system clock positive edge, signaling the completion of transmission by setting `aligned_i_valid` to 0."
