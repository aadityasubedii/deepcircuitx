    "module": "Module-level comment: This testbench module, \"stereo_audio_serializer_tb\", is designed to verify the functionality of the `stereo_audio_serializer` module by generating and feeding it with test audio signals. Internally, it utilizes registers and tasks to create test signals and control parameters, primarily driven by a clock signal `sclk`. The instance of `stereo_audio_serializer` is used to perform audio serialization. The results of the test are displayed for verification and debugging. An appropriate order of task execution is maintained, leading to proper serialization testing."
