Inputs are accepted when `i_valid` signal and `i_ready` signal are high. During this stage, the left and right audio input are stored in the `left` and `right` registers. Following this, the `i_ready` signal is set low, halting new inputs. The current audio being outputted is determined by the `o_is_left` register. If `o_is_left` is high, the left audio is outputted; if it is low, the right audio is outputted. The outputting audio alternates between left and right whenever `o_valid` and `o_ready` signals are high. The `i_ready` signal is set to inverse of `o_is_left`, making the module ready to accept inputs when right audio is being outputted. Upon reset, the module is ready to accept new input and defaults to outputting left audio. The stereo audio serializer operates on a clock signal where data transfer occurs at the positive edge of the clock."
