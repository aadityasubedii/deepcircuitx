    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a toggle controller for left and right signals. At the positive edge of either the clock or reset signal, if the reset signal is asserted, all outputs are preset to their default state: the ready flag is set true, the 'is_left' flag is true, and the left and right signals are zeroed out. If not in reset, it checks if both valid and ready flags of the input are set true. If true, the ready flag set to false, and mirrors 'i_right' and 'i_left' to right and left, respectively. If the valid and ready flags of output are set true, it toggles the 'is_left' and 'i_ready' signal."
