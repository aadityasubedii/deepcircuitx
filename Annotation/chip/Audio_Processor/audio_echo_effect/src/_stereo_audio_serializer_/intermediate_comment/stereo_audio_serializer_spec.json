    "spec": "Module name: stereo_audio_serializer. \n\nModule specification: The stereo_audio_serializer module is designed to serialize stereo audio input, alternating between left and right audio inputs. This module is set to operate under a clock signal, with data transfer triggered at the positive edge of the clock signal. It accepts inputs when both `i_valid` and `i_ready` signals are high, storing left and right audio inputs in the `left` and `right` internal registers. After storing inputs, the module stops accepting new inputs by setting `i_ready` low. Depending on the `o_is_left` output register's value, it outputs either the left or right audio input, which if high outputs left audio and vice versa. The output alternates between left and right audio inputs whenever both `o_valid` and `o_ready` signals are high. The `i_ready` output signal is set to the inverse of `o_is_left`, which makes the module ready to accept inputs when the right audio is being outputted. On receiving a reset control signal, the module becomes ready to accept new inputs and defaults to output the left audio. The module has a few input ports including `reset`, `clk`, `i_valid`, `i_left`, `i_right`, and `o_ready`. It also has several output ports: `i_ready`, `o_is_left`, `o_valid`, and `o_audio`. There are also two internal registers `right` and `left`, that store the value of the right and left audio inputs respectively. They serve to output the audio signal as controlled by the `o_is_left` signal. The module is divided into a few blocks including an assignment block, where `o_audio` is assigned the value of either left or right input based on `o_is_left` and `o_valid` is inversely assigned the value of `i_ready`. The other block is a conditional block that checks for reset, input validation, and output validation, alternating between accepting inputs and outputting audio, also alternated between left audio and right audio.",
