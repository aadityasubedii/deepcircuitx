    "spec": "Module name: `sample_delay_buffer`. \n\nModule specification: The `sample_delay_buffer` module, parameterized by `sample_width` and `buffer_depth`, is designed to buffer and control the flow of audio samples in a synchronized manner. The key input ports include `reset` for initializing the state machine, `clk` to synchronize operations, `i_valid` and `i_valid_processor` to indicate valid audio samples, `i_audio`, `i_current` and `i_feedback` to receive audio samples, and `o_ready_processor` to signify readiness of the processor. Output ports consist of `i_ready` and `i_ready_processor`, readiness indicators for new audio input, `o_valid` and `o_valid_processor` signals to indicate validity of output audio, and `o_audio`, `o_current`, and `o_buffer` for conveying processed audio samples. \n\nInside the module, a set of internal signals like `buffer_depth_msb`, `buffer_depth_last`, `buffer_ad`, `next_buffer_ad`, `buffer_rd`, `buffer_wd`, `buffer_we`, `state`, and `o_buffer` manage the functioning of the audio buffer and control flow. \n\nThe code mainly encompasses a single-port RAM for buffering the audio samples and a state machine to control the overall workflow, which includes buffering inputs, processing certain samples, and managing the output. The system transitions between states based on certain conditions, modifying the readiness and validity of inputs/outputs, and controlling read/write operations to the buffer. This module is envisaged to be part of a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) system or a similar audio processing hardware system.",

It triggers data movement and state transitions. \n3. `i_valid` - It is the input validity signal that indicates when a valid audio sample is available at `i_audio` for processing. \n4. `i_audio` [sample_width-1:0] - This port receives the input audio samples to be buffered or processed. \n5. `o_ready_processor` - This is an external readiness signal to the module, signifying that the processor is ready to consume the output data. \n6. `i_valid_processor` - It is the input validity signal that indicates when a valid audio sample is available at `i_current` for processing. \n7. `i_current` [sample_width-1:0] - This input represents the current audio sample being processed. \n8. `i_feedback` [sample_width-1:0] - This input is meant for received feedback data (possibly from another module or the downstream processor).\n\nOutput ports: \n1. `i_ready` - This is a ready signal indicating when the module is ready to accept a new audio input.\n2. `o_audio` [sample_width-1:0] - This port outputs the processed (or derived) audio samples. \n3. `o_current` [sample_width-1:0] - This is an output which holds a copy of the current processed audio data. \n4. `o_valid` - This is a validity signal which indicates when the output audio is valid.\n5. `i_ready_processor` - It behaves as an readiness indicator, confirming the module is ready to accept a new sample from the processor.\n6. `o_valid_processor` - It is an output flag to show that the output data for the processor is valid.\n7. `o_buffer` [sample_width-1:0] - This port holds the data being read from the buffer.\n\nNote: The difference between `o_audio` and `o_buffer` seems to be in their intended use. `o_audio` represents processed data while `o_buffer` provides direct access to data from the buffer to be read or utilized elsewhere."

The key input ports include `reset` for initializing the state machine, `clk` to synchronize operations, `i_valid` and `i_valid_processor` to indicate valid audio samples, `i_audio`, `i_current` and `i_feedback` to receive audio samples, and `o_ready_processor` to signify readiness of the processor. Output ports consist of `i_ready` and `i_ready_processor`, readiness indicators for new audio input, `o_valid` and `o_valid_processor` signals to indicate validity of output audio, and `o_audio`, `o_current`, and `o_buffer` for conveying processed audio samples. \n\nInside the module, a set of internal signals like `buffer_depth_msb`, `buffer_depth_last`, `buffer_ad`, `next_buffer_ad`, `buffer_rd`, `buffer_wd`, `buffer_we`, `state`, and `o_buffer` manage the functioning of the audio buffer and control flow. \n\nThe code mainly encompasses a single-port RAM for buffering the audio samples and a state machine to control the overall workflow, which includes buffering inputs, processing certain samples, and managing the output. The system transitions between states based on certain conditions, modifying the readiness and validity of inputs/outputs, and controlling read/write operations to the buffer. This module is envisaged to be part of a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) system or a similar audio processing hardware system."
