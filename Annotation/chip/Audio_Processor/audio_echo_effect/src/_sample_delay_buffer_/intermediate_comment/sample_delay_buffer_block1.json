    "block_comment": "This code defines a synchronous sequential logic block acting on the rising edge of a clock or a reset signal. When in reset mode, it initializes data buffers, output signals, and sets the state machine to a default state. When not in reset, it acts as a finite state machine with various states controlling the data flow between input and output buffers, and processing mechanisms. The function of each state varies from reading audio input, checking validity, writing to the buffer, transferring audio data, to feedback processing. The advancement of states is governed by different condition checks including the validity of inputs and readiness of outputs."
