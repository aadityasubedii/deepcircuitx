Module-level comment: The `sample_delay_buffer` module buffers and manages the flow of audio samples. It employs a single-port synchronous RAM for storage and a state machine for controlling operations like writing to buffer, processing audio samples and output readiness/validation status. The descriptive I/O ports and several internal signals are used to track and manage the flow of data and states. This module potentially integrates into a larger DSP or analogous audio system.
