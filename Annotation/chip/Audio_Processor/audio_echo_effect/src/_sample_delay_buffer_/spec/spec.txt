Module name: `sample_delay_buffer`. 

Module specification: The `sample_delay_buffer` module, parameterized by `sample_width` and `buffer_depth`, is designed to buffer and control the flow of audio samples in a synchronized manner. The key input ports include `reset` for initializing the state machine, `clk` to synchronize operations, `i_valid` and `i_valid_processor` to indicate valid audio samples, `i_audio`, `i_current` and `i_feedback` to receive audio samples, and `o_ready_processor` to signify readiness of the processor. Output ports consist of `i_ready` and `i_ready_processor`, readiness indicators for new audio input, `o_valid` and `o_valid_processor` signals to indicate validity of output audio, and `o_audio`, `o_current`, and `o_buffer` for conveying processed audio samples. 

Inside the module, a set of internal signals like `buffer_depth_msb`, `buffer_depth_last`, `buffer_ad`, `next_buffer_ad`, `buffer_rd`, `buffer_wd`, `buffer_we`, `state`, and `o_buffer` manage the functioning of the audio buffer and control flow. 

The code mainly encompasses a single-port RAM for buffering the audio samples and a state machine to control the overall workflow, which includes buffering inputs, processing certain samples, and managing the output. The system transitions between states based on certain conditions, modifying the readiness and validity of inputs/outputs, and controlling read/write operations to the buffer. This module is envisaged to be part of a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) system or a similar audio processing hardware system.
