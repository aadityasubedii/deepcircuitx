Module-level comment: The `audio_echo_effect_top` module introduces an echo effect to an incoming audio data stream and prepares it for SPDIF encoding and transmission. It uses a serial_audio_decoder for decoding the input, a dual_clock_buffer for clock synchronization of the audio data, an audio_echo_effect unit for generating the echo, and finally, a spdif_audio_encoder for encoding the processed audio. Error handling and reset operations are handled by internal signals. Inputs include clocks and serialized audio, and the output is the SPDIF encoded audio data.
