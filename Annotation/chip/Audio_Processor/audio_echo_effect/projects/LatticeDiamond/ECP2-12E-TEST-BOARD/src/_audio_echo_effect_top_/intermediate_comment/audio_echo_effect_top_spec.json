    "spec": "Module name: audio_echo_effect_top. \n\nModule specification: \n\nThe audio_echo_effect_top module stands as a cornerstone in the Verilog code. Specifically, it contributes to generating an echo effect in a given audio stream, effectively preparing the audio for transmission in the Sony/Philips Digital Interface (SPDIF) format.\n\nThere are four input ports named `sclk`, `lrclk`, `sdin`, and `clk256` as well as one output port titled `spdif`. The `sclk` represents the serial clock for the audio stream, whereas `lrclk` stands for the left-right clock, relevant for distinguishing if the audio data is left or right. `sdin` is the serial data input to the module and `clk256` is a clock signal for SPDIF encoding. Finally, `spdif` acts as the interface for releasing the final echoed and encoded audio data.\n\nWithin the module, there exist multiple internal signals, such as `reset`, `clk`, `decoder_valid`, `decoder_ready`, `decoder_audio`, `decoder_is_error`, `reset_with_error`, and signals that relate to sync_decoding, echoing, and encoding of the audio data like `decoder_sync_ready`, `echo_valid`, `echo_audio`, etc. While `reset` triggers a reset, `clk` is used for regulating operations in synchronization. Signals starting with `decoder_` support decoding the audio and manage errors, whereas `reset_with_error` strengthens reset conditions by incorporating decoder errors. Remaining signals are tied to synchronizing, echoing, and encoding phases of the audio signal.\n\nThe module, in essence, comprises multiple blocks representing distinct functionalities. It first employs a power-up-reset (PUR) to generate a reset signal and an OSCD module to produce a synchronized clock signal. The serial_audio_decoder fetches and decodes the audio data stream safeguarding against errors in decoding by enhancing the reset signal with an error signal. A dual_clock_buffer then ensures the harmonization of data to the generated clock. In the next step, the audio_echo_effect infuses an echo effect on the synchronized audio, which subsequently gets encoded by a spdif_audio_encoder into SPDIF format. The entire procedure embarked on by the module, provides an end-to-end route from input audio data to its processed transformation for further transmission through SPDIF.",
