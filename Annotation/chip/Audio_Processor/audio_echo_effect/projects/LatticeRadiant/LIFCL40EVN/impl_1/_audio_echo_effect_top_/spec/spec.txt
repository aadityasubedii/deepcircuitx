Module name: audio_echo_effect_top. 

Module specification: The 'audio_echo_effect_top' is a top-level module that is designed to create an echo effect on audio inputs. It receives an audio signal via an I2S interface and then transfers it through a dual-clock FIFO into the system clock domain. The received audio signal is then processed by the 'audio_echo_effect' to add the echo effect, and the processed audio is finally encoded into a SPDIF output signal via the 'spdif_audio_encoder'. 

Input ports of the module include 'sclk' (the serial clock for data synchronization), 'lrclk' (Left/Right clock that signifies whether the data on the 'sdin' port is for the left or right audio channel), 'sdin' (the serial audio data input), 'clk256' (the over-sampling clock for the SPDIF encoder), and 'nreset' (the active low reset signal to put the system into its reset state). The module only has one output port 'spdif', which forwards the processed SPDIF output audio data signal.

Internally, the module uses various signals like 'reset', 'clk', 'decoder_valid', 'decoder_ready', etc., all of which serve as indicators, handshaking control signals or triggers to facilitate communication between different components of the module and to control different sections of the module's operations.

The module utilizes sub-modules such as 'GSR', 'OSCA', 'serial_audio_decoder', 'dual_clock_buffer', 'audio_echo_effect', and 'spdif_audio_encoder' to accomplish the desired operations. 'GSR' is utilized for global set/reset operations, 'OSCA' provides the clock signal for internal operations, 'serial_audio_decoder' decodes the incoming audio signals, 'dual_clock_buffer' helps transfer data from one clock domain to another, 'audio_echo_effect' is used to add echo effect to the audio signals, and 'spdif_audio_encoder' encodes the processed audio data into a SPDIF signal for output. All together, these components help achieve the functionality of adding echo effects to audio signals.
