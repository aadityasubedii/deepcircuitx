The module receives a stereo audio signal via an I2S interface, transfers it using dual-clock FIFO from the serial clock domain into a system clock domain. It then passes the signals through 'audio_echo_effect' to apply the echo effects. Then the processed audio signals pass through a SPDIF encoder to create a SPDIF output signal. Sub-modules like 'GSR', 'OSCA', 'serial_audio_decoder', and 'spdif_audio_encoder' are instantiated within this module to help accomplish the tasks. The audio signals are processed in 16-bit resolution and the echo-effect's delay is designed to handle 4096 samples. In case of reset signal being enabled or an error in the received data, the respective processes get aborted, initiated by the 'reset_with_error'."
