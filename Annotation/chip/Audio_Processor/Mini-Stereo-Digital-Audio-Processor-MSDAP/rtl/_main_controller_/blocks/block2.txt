Comment: 
The provided Verilog block serves as a synchronous state machine that is driven by the positive edge of the clock signal or the negative edge of the reset signal. It functions by updating the current state (`state_present`) based on the next state (`state_next`) under normal operation. In case the reset signal is active (i.e., low), the current state will be reset to a default state or continue towards the next state depending on whether the current state is higher than '4. The value '4 here is used as a threshold to decide if a reset should be performed or not. It ensures that the state machine does not enter an undefined state if an abnormality occurs.
