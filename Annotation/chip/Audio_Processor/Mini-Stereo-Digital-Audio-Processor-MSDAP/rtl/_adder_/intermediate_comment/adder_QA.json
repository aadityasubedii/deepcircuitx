The operation is determined based on the value of the binary input signal 'addsub': if it is 1, subtraction (b - a) is performed; if it is 0, addition (b + a) is performed. The result of the operation is output as 'sum'. Operation takes place only when the 'adder_en' signal is enabled. If addsub is neither 1 nor 0, the previous 'sum' is held."

'addsub' is a single bit input wire that dictates whether an addition or subtraction operation must be executed (1 for subtraction (b - a), and 0 for addition (b + a)).
