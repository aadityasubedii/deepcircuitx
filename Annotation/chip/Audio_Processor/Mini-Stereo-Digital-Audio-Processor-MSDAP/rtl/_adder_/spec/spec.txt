Module name: adder. 

Module specification: The 'adder' is a simple arithmetic core capable of performing either addition or subtraction operations on two 40-bit value inputs. The operation executed is dictated by the binary input signal 'addsub', with the condition of performing subtraction (b - a) if 'addsub' equals 1, and addition (b + a) if 'addsub' equals 0. Should 'addsub' fall outside these binary values, the previous output 'sum' is sustained. The module's functionality is controlled by an enable signal 'adder_en', and will be operational only when 'adder_en' is enabled. The module contains four input ports, specifically 'a', 'b', 'addsub', and 'adder_en'. The 'a' and 'b' signals serve as the operands for the executed operations, while 'addsub' oversees the operation type, and 'adder_en' manages the module's function state. The output port is 'sum', a 40-bit wire carrying the result of the performed operation. Inside the module, there are no additional internal signals, all signals part of the interface (inputs and outputs). This module does not divide its operation into separate blocks or sections. It performs its calculations and communicates its results via the module's interface.
