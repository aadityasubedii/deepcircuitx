    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to open an output file named \"output2.txt\". It uses the built-in Verilog function $fopen to create a new file or open an existing one and assigns its file descriptor to the variable \"mv\". The \"w+\" mode means that the file is opened for both writing and reading. Any previous content in the file is erased, and if the file doesn't exist, it will be created."
