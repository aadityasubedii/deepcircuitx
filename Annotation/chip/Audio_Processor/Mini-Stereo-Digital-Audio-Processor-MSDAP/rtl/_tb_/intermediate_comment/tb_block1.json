    "block_comment": "This block of code acts as a Synchronous Memory Controller for audio data storage. At each negative edge of the system clock, if an output ready flag is high, audio data is written from registers to storage arrays, 'writeL' and 'writeR', uniquely indexed by 'l'. Also, the outputs 'OutputL' and 'OutputR' are updated. After writing, the index 'l' is decremented. If 'l' goes below 0 and a 'count' is less than 6395, the count is incremented and 'l' is reset to 39. However, if the count is 3798 or 5397, the fwrite function is bypassed to ensure no writing occurs at these specific counts."
