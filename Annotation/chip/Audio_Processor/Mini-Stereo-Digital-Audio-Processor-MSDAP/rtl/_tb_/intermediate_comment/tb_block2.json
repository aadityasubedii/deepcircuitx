    "block_comment": "The block performs data synchronization and framing operations, based on input signals and internal counters. On each positive edge of Dclk, it checks certain conditions to either reset the process or progress with data operations. Particularly, it resets if 'm' matches certain values and 'flag_reset' is 0. If either 'InReady' or 'flag_reset' are high, it proceeds with data handling -- retrieving data pairs depending on the values of 'm' and 'n', incrementing and decrementing 'm' and 'n' respectively for each cycle. It also sets the 'Frame' signal when 'n' equals 15, and resets 'flag_reset' when 'n' is -1, indicating completion of one data frame."
