Module-level comment: The module 'tb' serves as a testbench for the 'top' module. It uses 'Dclk' and 'Sclk' clock signals to regulate data input from the file 'data2.in' and data output write to 'output2.txt'. The testbench manages reset conditions, and the 'Frame' and 'Start' signals to control data flow. It uses input data signals, 'InputL' and 'InputR', and captures output in 'OutputL' and 'OutputR'. It operates through sections including signal declaration, 'top' module instantiation, file operations, and clock-triggered blocks to effectively validate the 'top' module's functionality and performance.
