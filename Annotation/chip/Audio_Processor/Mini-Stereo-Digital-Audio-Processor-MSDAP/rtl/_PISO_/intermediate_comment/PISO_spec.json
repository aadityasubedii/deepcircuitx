    "spec": "Module name: PISO.\n\nModule specification: The PISO (Parallel-In-Serial-Out) module aims to perform a parallel to serial conversion of a 40-bit data. The module takes five input ports which include a system clock signal (Sclk), an asynchronous clear signal (Clear), a parallel-to-serial enable signal (p2s_en), a frame signal (Frame), and a 40-bit parallel input signal (Shift_done). The system clock (Sclk) triggers all synchronous logic, while the clear signal (Clear) resets all the flip-flops to their initial states. The parallel-to-serial enable signal (p2s_en) drives the loading of the 40-bit data into an internal shift register (register_piso) while the frame signal (Frame) triggers the start of the serial shifting. The module produces two output ports, a bit-wise serial output (SerialOut), and a ready signal (OutReady) to indicate when valid data is available at the output. Internally, a 6-bit register (count_bit) controls the bit-by-bit serial shifting. Two internal flags are used, one to indicate that the shift register is loaded with data (ready_out) and the other to show the start of serial shifting (frame_flag). The operation of the code can be divided into three sections based on the control signals. When the clear signal is high, all state variables are reset. If the parallel-to-serial enable is high, the 40-bit input data is loaded into the shift register. Finally, if the frame signal is high and the shift register is ready, the serial output process starts. When all bits are shifted out, the frame flag is reset to start over the process.",

Sclk: This is the system clock input signal. All synchronous logic inside the module PISO is triggered by the rising edge of this signal. \n2. Clear: This is an asynchronous clear input. When asserted 'high', it resets all the flip-flops and state variables inside the module to their respective initial values.\n3. p2s_en: Standing for 'Parallel-to-Serial enable', it drives the loading of the 40-bit data (Shift_done) into the PISO shift register (register_piso). When this signal is 'high', the 40-bit word is loaded from the parallel input into the internal shift register.\n4. Frame: This signal when 'high' triggers the start of the serial shifting from the shift register. \n5. Shift_done: This is a wide 40-bit input which bears the data to be serially shifted out by the PISO.\n\nOutput ports: [SerialOut, OutReady]. \n\nExplanation: \n\n1. SerialOut: This is the bit-wise serial output of the 40-bit word loaded into the module's internal shift register.\n2. OutReady: This signal becomes 'high' whenever there is valid data available on the SerialOut output.

It essentially serves as a counter to keep track of the number of bits that have been shifted out. At the beginning or reset, it is set to 40, and it decrements as each bit is shifted out.\n\n2. ready_out: This signal is an internal flag which indicates that the shift register (register_piso) is loaded with the 40-bit input data (Shift_done) and the system is ready to start the serial shift out process.

It is set to 1 when the first bit is shifted out and the Frame signal is high.
