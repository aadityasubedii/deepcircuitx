Module-level comment: The PISO module performs parallel-to-serial conversion of a 40-bit data using an internal shift register. It reads control signals (Clear, p2s_en, Frame) for reset or parallel data loading and starts the serial output. The 40-bit input data (Shift_done) is loaded onto the shift register (register_piso), and bit-by-bit output is performed under the control of the Frame signal, reflecting on SerialOut port. The number of shifted bits is tracked by the count_bit register. The OutReady signal indicates when valid data is ready for output. The module operates synchronously with a system clock (Sclk).
