    "module": "Module-level comment: The SIPO module, short for Serial-In Parallel-Out, converts serial data into parallel data. Input ports accept signals for frame start, clock, clear, and two serial data bits ('InputL' & 'InputR'). The module completes operations on the falling edge of the clock signal, resetting all states and registers when the 'Clear' signal is high. Data is persistently loaded into two 16-bit registers 'DataL' & 'DataR' in response to valid frame start signal. The loading is managed using internal signals 'count_bit' to index loading position, and 'frame_stat' to track the loading process. The output flag 'in_flag' is set when all frame bits are loaded. This module is key for efficient data transmission."
