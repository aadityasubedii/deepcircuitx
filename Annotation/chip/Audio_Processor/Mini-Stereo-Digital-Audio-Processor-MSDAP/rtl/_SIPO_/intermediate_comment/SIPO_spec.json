    "spec": "Module name: SIPO. \n\nModule specification: The SIPO (Serial-In Parallel-Out) module is designed to convert serialized data into parallel form, allowing for efficient data transmission bit by bit, which is then converted into a byte. Influential inputs to this module include 'Frame', 'Dclk', 'Clear', and 'InputL' & 'InputR'. The 'Frame' signal commences a new sequence of data, whereby any operations are completed on the falling edge of 'Dclk', the clock pulse. If the 'Clear' is asserted, all internal registers and states are reset. 'InputL' and 'InputR' represent the serialized data that is transformed into parallel data. The module yields a 'in_flag' that signals when an entire frame has been loaded into the data registers, 'DataL' and 'DataR'. Internally, the module uses 'count_bit' to maintain current bit position in the registers during the data loading process, and 'frame_stat' to keep track of the status of the current frame loading process. The code is divided into sections controlling the state of the registers depending on 'Clear' and 'Frame' signals, loading the data into the registers, decrementing the 'count_bit' as the frame is loaded, and resetting the module at the end of the frame. It creates a framework for supple data transformation that is crucial for improving data transmission efficiency.",

This process is commonly used for data transmission where the data is transmitted bit by bit (Serially) which then gets converted into a byte (Parallel). The functionality is controlled through different signals like 'Clear', 'Frame', 'Dclk', and 'InputL' & 'InputR' for data. When Clear is high, all registers are reset. When a new Frame start ('Frame' high), the input data is loaded into the 16-bit shift register 'dataL' and 'dataR'. The 'in_flag' is set when all the bits of a frame are loaded. Frame data is loaded in response to a falling edge of 'Dclk'. The 'frame_stat' bit is to keep track of whether the frame is loaded completely or not."

A frame in data communication is a unit of data.\n2. Dclk: This is the clock input for the module. All operations take place on the falling edge of this clock signal.\n3. Clear: This is a digital signal used to reset the state of all registers and the finite state machine in this module.\n4. InputL and InputR: They are the input data ports for the module. This is the serial data that is input to the module. The module converts this serial data into parallel data.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. In_flag: This flag is set when all the bits of a frame are loaded into the data registers.\n2. DataL and DataR: These are 16-bit registers that hold the output data. All the bits of a frame are loaded into these registers bit-by-bit. After all the bits of a frame are loaded, the in_flag is set.\n3.

It decrements after each bit is loaded and resets to 15 (4'd15) at the start of each frame or when a clear signal comes.\n2. frame_stat: This binary signal flag is used to keep a track of the status of the current frame loading process. It's set to 1 when a new frame starts (Frame == 1'b1) and is reset to 0 once the entire frame is loaded or when a clear signal comes indicating that the frame is fully loaded.
