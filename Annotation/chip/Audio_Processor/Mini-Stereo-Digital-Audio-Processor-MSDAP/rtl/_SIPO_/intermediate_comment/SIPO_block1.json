    "block_comment": "This block of code facilitates the process of data framing. The module is sensitive to negative edge of Dclk and positive edge of Clear. Upon reset (i.e., when Clear is high), the 'count_bit' counter sets to 15 and 'dataL', 'dataR', 'in_flag', and 'frame_stat' are all reset to 0. On new frame signal (Frame == 1), the 'count_bit' resets to 15, and 'InputL' and 'InputR' data are stored sequentially in 'dataL' and 'dataR' respectively, as per 'count_bit'. If the frame continues (frame_stat == 1), data keeps storing and 'count_bit' keeps decreasing. Once all the 16 bits are stored ('count_bit' equals 0), the 'in_flag' signals the end of data input and the process resets."
