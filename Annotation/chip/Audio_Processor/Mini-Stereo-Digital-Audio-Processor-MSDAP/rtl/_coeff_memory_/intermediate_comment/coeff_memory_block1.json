    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to the variable 'data_coeff'. It does so by utilizing a ternary operator to check the state of 'read_enable'. If 'read_enable' is high (or true), 'data_coeff' is assigned the value from a location in the 'coeffmem' array specified by 'coeffread'. In contrast, if 'read_enable' is low (false), 'data_coeff' is simply assigned a zero value in 16-bits format. This is a combinational logic implementation for data coefficient access based on the read-enable signal."
