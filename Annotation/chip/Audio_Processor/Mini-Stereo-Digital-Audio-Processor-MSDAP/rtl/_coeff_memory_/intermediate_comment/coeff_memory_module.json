    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'coeff_memory' module is a 512x16-bit coefficient memory unit. It writes 16-bit 'in_data' to 'coeffmem' at 'coeffwrite' index on high 'write_enable', and reads from the 'coeffmem' assigning to 'data_coeff' at 'coeffread' index on high 'read_enable', all on 'Sclk' rise. If 'read_enable' is low, 'data_coeff' is zero. Reading/writing is managed by a conditional statement and an always block, respectively."
