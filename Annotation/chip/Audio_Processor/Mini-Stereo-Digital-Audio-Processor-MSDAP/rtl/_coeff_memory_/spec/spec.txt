Module name: coeff_memory. 

Module specification: The 'coeff_memory' module functions as a memory block for holding coefficients. It comprises a memory byte array 'coeffmem' with 512 elements each 16 bits wide. Operations on this module are triggered on the positive edge of input system clock 'Sclk'. This module has two main operations: reading and writing, dictated by the inputs 'read_enable' and 'write_enable' respectively. When 'write_enable' is high, 16-bit data from the 'in_data' wire is written into the 'coeffmem' index specified by the 'coeffwrite' wire. When 'read_enable' is high, data from the 'coeffmem' index mentioned by the 'coeffread' wire is assigned to 'data_coeff' output wire. The writing operation is performed within an always block while the reading operation is handled in a continuous assignment statement where 'data_coeff' is assigned a ternary operation result based on the 'read_enable' signal. If 'read_enable' is low, 'data_coeff' is assigned a zero value. The module hence provides a functional memory unit for storing and retrieving data based on control signals.
