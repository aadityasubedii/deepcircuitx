Comment: 
This block of Verilog code handles the write operation of a 'coeffmem' memory module. It activates on every positive edge of the system clock ('Sclk'). If 'write_enable' is set to '1', it writes the value of 'in_data' into the memory location specified by 'coeffwrite'. However, if 'write_enable' is not set, it maintains the existing value of 'coeffmem' at the location 'coeffwrite'.
