It is designed to process stereo audio inputs (InputL and InputR) and create stereo audio outputs (OutputL and OutputR). Processing is controlled by various signals such as Dclk, Sclk, Reset_n, Frame, and Start. The module includes separate subsystems for processing left and right audio inputs, which involve interactions with different memory types (rj_memory, coeff_memory, data_memory), mathematical operations (adder, shift accumulator), and serial data conversion (PISO, SIPO). It also features a main controller and an alu controller to manage the overall operations and data flow."
