    "block_comment": "This block performs as a state register for a finite state machine. It takes inputs 'Clear' and 'next_stateR'. Whenever 'Clear' is active high, the present state of the machine is set to the predefined initial state ('start_ini_state'). When 'Clear' is not active, the present state changes to whatever state is captured in 'next_stateR'. This block regulates the transitions of the machine between its various states."
