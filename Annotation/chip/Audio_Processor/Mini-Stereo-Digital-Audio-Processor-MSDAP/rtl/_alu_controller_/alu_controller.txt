Module-level comment: The "alu_controller" module controls an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) operation based on input signals (work_enable, Clear etc.). It uses a state machine design pattern (states: start_ini_state, work_state, sleep_state) to manage operations dynamically. The module generates control signals for left and right data streams and handles data overflows. Its operation is synchronized with system clock, transitioning between states based on work_enable and sleep_flag signals. It also tracks work and memory status through internal signals.
