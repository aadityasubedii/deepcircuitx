    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a write operation for a memory module in a synchronous digital system. It utilizes a positive edge triggered clock signal (Sclk) to enable data writing whenever the 'write_enable' signal is asserted high. The incoming data 'in_data' is stored into the memory array 'datamem' at the index 'datawrite'. If the 'write_enable' signal is not high, the existing data at the specified index remains unchanged."
