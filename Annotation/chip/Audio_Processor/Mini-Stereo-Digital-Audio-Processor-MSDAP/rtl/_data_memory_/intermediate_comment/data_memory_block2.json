    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is for a zero counter that triggers a flag when a certain threshold is reached. It operates synchronously on the positive edge of the 'in_flag'. If 'in_data' equals to zero, it increments 'count_zero' by one, and when 'count_zero' reaches 800, it sets 'flag_zero' to one. To prevent, 'count_zero' from exceeding 800, any value above 800 is clamped back to 800. However, if 'in_data' is any non-zero value, 'count_zero' and 'flag_zero' are reset.\n"
