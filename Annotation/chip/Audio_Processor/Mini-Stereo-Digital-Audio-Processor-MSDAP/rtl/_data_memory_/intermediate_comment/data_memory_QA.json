It comprises of a memory array 'datamem' from location 0 to 255, each with a 16-bit data. There are some control signals including 'write_enable' and 'read_enable' representing write or read action. 'in_data' is the input data for write and 'datawrite' is the location to write the data. If 'write_enable' is set, then 'in_data' is written at the 'datawrite' location in the memory. The module also counts the total number of zeroes encountered at the input with a maximum count up to 800. The flag 'flag_zero' is set when 'in_data' is zero and 'count_zero' has reached 800. When 'read_enable' is high, the data from 'dataread' memory location is available at 'input_data'. In a nutshell, it carefully handles read/write operations in a memory unit and monitors the frequency of zero inputs."

Sclk is the system clock that gives the timing information required for synchronization. Whenever a rising edge is observed on 'in_flag', the count_zero and flag_zero registers are updated based on whether 'in_data' is zero or not.
