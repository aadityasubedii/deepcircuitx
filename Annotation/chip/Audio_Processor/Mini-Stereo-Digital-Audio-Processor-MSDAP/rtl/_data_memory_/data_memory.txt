Module-level comment: The 'data_memory' module performs reading and writing operations to a memory array 'datamem' of 256 16-bit locations. It uses control signals 'write_enable' and 'read_enable' to control the memory operations, writes 'in_data' to 'datamem' at 'datawrite' location, and reads 'datamem' at 'dataread' location outputting as 'input_data'. The module also tracks zero input instances, up to 800, using 'count_zero' register and 'in_flag' signal, and flags with 'flag_zero' when the limit is reached. The functions are achieved in a sequential manner using 'always' blocks on system clock and 'in_flag' signal.
