This code block performs selective data retrieval from a data memory structure. When the 'read_enable' signal is active, the block fetches and assigns the corresponding data pointed by 'dataread' from the 'datamem' memory to 'input_data'. In case 'read_enable' is not active, it assigns a zero value, denoted by '16'd0', to 'input_data'. The entire operation is performed in a single hardware clock cycle as this is an assign statement, denoting a combinational logic implementation.
