    "module": "Module-level comment: The shift_accumulator is a shift-register-based module that takes a 40-bit input, load, shift enable, clear, and a clock signal. It either performs a right shift operation, load operation, or a clear operation based on the control signals. Internal shift_register holds intermediate values and outputs at negative edge of clock. The shift operation retains the MSB at bit position 40. It is suitably implemented by conditional statements inside an always block, triggered by the falling edge of the system clock."
