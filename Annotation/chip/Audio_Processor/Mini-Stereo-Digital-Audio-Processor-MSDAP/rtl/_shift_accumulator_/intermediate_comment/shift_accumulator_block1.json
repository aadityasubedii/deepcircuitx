    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for assigning the value of shift_reg to out_bk. It is a simple assign statement, providing a connection between out_bk and shift_reg. Whenever shift_reg changes its value, out_bk will instantly reflect the same value due to this continuous assignment. This forms an effective mechanism for tracking the value of shift_reg within other areas of the code, through out_bk. So, it's essentially mapping the value of shift_reg to out_bk."
