It takes a 40-bit input (in_bk), a shift enable signal (shift_en), a load signal, a clear signal, and a clock signal (sclk). It shifts the input bits to the right when both load and shift_en are high, retaining the MSB bit in position 40. If only the load signal is high and shift_en is low, it simply loads the input into the shift register. If the clear signal is high, it clears the shift register. The output (out_bk) is the current contents of the shift register at the negative edge of the clock pulse."

If only load is high and shift_en is off, it simply loads the input into the shift register.\n4. clear: This signal controls the reset of the shift register. If high, the shift register contents are cleared. \n5. sclk: This is the system clock signal. The operations are synchronised at its negative edge.\n\nOutput ports: [out_bk]. \nExplanation: \n1. out_bk: This is a 40 bit output vector which returns the current contents of the shift register. The values get updated at each negative edge of the system clock pulse, based on the conditions from input ports."
