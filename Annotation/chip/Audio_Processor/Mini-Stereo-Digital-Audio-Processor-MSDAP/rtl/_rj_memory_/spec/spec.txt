Module name: rj_memory. 

Module specification: The rj_memory module serves as a simple memory module implemented in Verilog language. Its purpose is to enable controlled reading from and writing to an internal memory structure, facilitating basic data storage operations. The module features several input ports, including 'write_enable' and 'read_enable' for activating writing and reading procedures respectively, with operations initialized on the rising edge of the supplied system clock ('Sclk'). It also houses 'in_data', a 16-bit input mechanism to feed data to memory when writing is enabled, along with 'rjwrite' and 'rjread'; 4-bits address signals intended for specifying the desired memory location for each process. The sole output stage is embodied by 'data_rj', a 16-bit port designed to carry data read from memory to the exterior, supplying '0' when reading is inactive. The module uses one key internal signal named 'rjmem'. This is a 16-word deep, 16-bit wide register array, assigned as the memory module itself. The Verilog code is divided into different sections with the first part primarily focusing on initialization and declaration of input/output ports and internal register array. Following this, the always @ (posedge Sclk) procedural block manages the write operations under the control of the 'write_enable' signal. An 'assign' statement is used to determine the output 'data_rj' based on the control signal 'read_enable'. In its entirety, the rj_memory module is a compact and operational design for a controlled memory element offering read and write capabilities.
