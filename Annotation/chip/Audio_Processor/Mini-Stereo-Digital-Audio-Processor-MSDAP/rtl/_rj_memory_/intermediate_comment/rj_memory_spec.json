Its purpose is to enable controlled reading from and writing to an internal memory structure, facilitating basic data storage operations. The module features several input ports, including 'write_enable' and 'read_enable' for activating writing and reading procedures respectively, with operations initialized on the rising edge of the supplied system clock ('Sclk'). It also houses 'in_data', a 16-bit input mechanism to feed data to memory when writing is enabled, along with 'rjwrite' and 'rjread'; 4-bits address signals intended for specifying the desired memory location for each process. The sole output stage is embodied by 'data_rj', a 16-bit port designed to carry data read from memory to the exterior, supplying '0' when reading is inactive. The module uses one key internal signal named 'rjmem'. This is a 16-word deep, 16-bit wide register array, assigned as the memory module itself. The Verilog code is divided into different sections with the first part primarily focusing on initialization and declaration of input/output ports and internal register array. Following this, the always @ (posedge Sclk) procedural block manages the write operations under the control of the 'write_enable' signal. An 'assign' statement is used to determine the output 'data_rj' based on the control signal 'read_enable'. In its entirety, the rj_memory module is a compact and operational design for a controlled memory element offering read and write capabilities.",
