    "block_comment": "This code block writes input data to the memory when the write_enable signal is high during the positive edge of the system clock. More specifically, it is an always block that waits for the positive edge of the signal 'Sclk'. During this event, if 'write_enable' signal is high (1), it writes the 'in_data' into 'rjmem' at the address indicated by 'rjwrite'. If 'write_enable' is low (0), it simply retains the existing data at the memory location indicated by 'rjwrite'."
