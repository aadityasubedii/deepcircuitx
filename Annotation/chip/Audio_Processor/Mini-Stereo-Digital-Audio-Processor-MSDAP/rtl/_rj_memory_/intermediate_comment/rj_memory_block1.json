    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL assigns the \"data_rj\" signal to data from the \"rjmem\" memory at the index \"rjread\" if the \"read_enable\" signal is high. If the \"read_enable\" signal is not active(low), the \"data_rj\" signal is assigned with the 16-bit binary value of zero. This assignment operation happens concurrently and not sequentially."
