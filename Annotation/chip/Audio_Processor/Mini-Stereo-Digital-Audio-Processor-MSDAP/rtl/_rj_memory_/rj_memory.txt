Module-level comment: The rj_memory is a simple 16x16 memory module in Verilog. It uses input controls 'write_enable', 'read_enable' and message signals including 'in_data', 'rjwrite', and 'rjread', along with the system clock 'Sclk' to synchronize read and write operations. 'rjmem' is the internal memory register used for storage. 'write_enable' and 'rjwrite' control writing 'in_data' into 'rjmem'. 'read_enable' and 'rjread' dictate output 'data_rj' based on the content of 'rjmem'. All operations are edge-triggered with 'Sclk'.
