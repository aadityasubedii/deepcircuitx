This block of Verilog code is used for edge-triggered clock signal handling. More specifically, it assigns the value of the `test_clk` signal to `cur_test_clk` at the rising edge of the `clk` signal. By utilizing this, the RTL design ensures synchronization and keeps the `cur_test_clk` up-to-date with the `test_clk` at each positive edge of `clk`, helping maintain the timing and sequence integrity within digital circuits.
