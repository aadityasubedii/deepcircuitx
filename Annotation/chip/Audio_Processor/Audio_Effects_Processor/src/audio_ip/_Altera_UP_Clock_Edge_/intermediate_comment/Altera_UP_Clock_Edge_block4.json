    "block_comment": "The block of code captures and recognizes the rising and falling edge signals in a clock cycle. At every positive edge of the main clock signal (clk), the previous value of the clock signal under test (last_test_clk) is updated with the current value (cur_test_clk). The recognition of rising and falling edges of this 'test clock' is done by combining the output of a XOR operation (found_edge), which checks for a change in the signal state (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0), with the current and last state of test clock accordingly. A True result for rising_edge and falling_edge indicates a rising and falling edge in the test clock respectively."
