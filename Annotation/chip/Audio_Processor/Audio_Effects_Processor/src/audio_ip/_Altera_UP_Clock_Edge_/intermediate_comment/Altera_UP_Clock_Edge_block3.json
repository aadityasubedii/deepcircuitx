    "block_comment": "This block detects a rising edge of a clock signal. It achieves this by performing a bitwise AND operation on two signal variables: 'found_edge' and 'cur_test_clk'. The result is assigned to 'rising_edge', indicating the detection of a rising edge when 'cur_test_clk' is high and 'found_edge' is asserted."
