    "spec": "Module name: Altera_UP_Clock_Edge.\nModule specification: The Altera_UP_Clock_Edge module is specifically designed to detect both the rising and falling edges of a nominated signal named 'test_clk'. Its function is governed by three input ports: 'clk', which is the main clock signal that defines the module's timing, 'reset', utilized for resetting the module to its initial state, and 'test_clk', the chosen signal for detecting rising and falling edges. The module has two output ports: 'rising_edge' and 'falling_edge'. These ports output a high signal when a rising (from low to high) or falling (from high to low) edge in 'test_clk' respectively is detected. Internal to the module, three signals ('found_edge', 'cur_test_clk', 'last_test_clk') are used for control and processing. 'found_edge' is a wire that detects any changes (either rising or falling) in 'test_clk'. 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk' are registers that maintain the current and previous state of 'test_clk', respectively. The entire process of edge detection is split into multiple code blocks, each with its function. The 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk' states update on every positive clock edge. The logical 'AND' and 'XOR' operations are used to determine rising and falling edges, thereby creating a comprehensive module designed for efficient edge detection.\n",
