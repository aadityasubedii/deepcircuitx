    "block_comment": "The given block of code is responsible for driving the 'change_state' signal. The value of 'change_state' is an outcome of a logical AND operation between 'transfer_complete' and 'transfer_data'. In essence, 'change_state' will be True (or \"1\") only when both 'transfer_complete' and 'transfer_data' are True (or \"1\"). Otherwise, it is False (or \"0\")."
