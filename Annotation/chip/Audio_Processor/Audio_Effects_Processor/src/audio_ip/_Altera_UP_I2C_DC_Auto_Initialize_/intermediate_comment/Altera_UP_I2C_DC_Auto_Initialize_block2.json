    "block_comment": "This line of code in Verilog is functioning as a signal assigner, specifically assigning the Boolean value to 'finished_auto_init'. This flag gets set to true when 'rom_address_counter' equals 'MAX_ROM_ADDRESS'. This indicates the completion of the initialization process of the ROM by checking if the counter has reached the maximum address of the ROM. This implementation provides an effective way to keep track of ROM initialization and prevent any overflow or accessing beyond its allocated capacity.\n"
