    "block_comment": "The block of code is a state machine for an I2C initialization sequence. The sequence begins at the \"AUTO_STATE_0_CHECK_STATUS\" state where it checks if the initialization process is finished or if a flag from the ROM data is active. Depending on the condition, it transitions to either \"AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT\", \"AUTO_STATE_8_DONE\", or \"AUTO_STATE_3_TRANSFER_BYTE_1\". It proceeds through more states which transfer bytes, wait for completion of tasks and increase counters. The final state, \"AUTO_STATE_8_DONE\", signifies the end of the sequence. It remains in each state until \"change_state\" is triggered. If unhandled conditions occur, it defaults back to the \"AUTO_STATE_0_CHECK_STATUS\" state."
