    "block_comment": "This block of code performs data output modification based on different states in a synchronized clock environment. The code handles data output for a I2C protocol sequence of operations. When the reset signal is high, it sets 'data_out' to zero. Else, depending on the 's_i2c_auto_init' value, which indicates the specific I2C state, it will either send a predefined start bit of '8'hBA', or transfer certain chunks of 'rom_data'. For 'AUTO_STATE_2_TRANSFER_BYTE_0', 'AUTO_STATE_3_TRANSFER_BYTE_1' and 'AUTO_STATE_4_TRANSFER_BYTE_2' states, it sends different slices of 'rom_data'.\n"
