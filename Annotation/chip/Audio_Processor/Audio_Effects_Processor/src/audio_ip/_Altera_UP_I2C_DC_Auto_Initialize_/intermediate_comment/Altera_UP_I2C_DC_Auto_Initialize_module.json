    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThis Altera_UP_I2C_DC_Auto_Initialize module automatically initializes an I2C communication by sending predefined values to specific addresses on reset. It uses a state machine for managing various stages of the transmission, driven by ROM-mapped array data. The module employs signals such as 'ack' for acknowledgment of data transfer, 'transfer_complete' to progress the state machine, and 'reset' to initiate the initialization process. It outputs signals like 'auto_init_complete' and 'auto_init_error' for signaling the end of initialization and occurrence of errors, respectively. Through this design, the module simplifies the device initialization process over I2C."
