Comment: 
This block of code facilitates data transfer on the rising edge of a clock for an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) interface. The transfer flag (`transfer_data`) is reset when the `reset` signal or `transfer_complete` flag is high. Conversely, the flag is enabled despite the stages of automatic I2C interactions (send start bit, transfer byte 0/1/2), indicated by states `AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT` through `AUTO_STATE_4_TRANSFER_BYTE_2` of `s_i2c_auto_init`.
