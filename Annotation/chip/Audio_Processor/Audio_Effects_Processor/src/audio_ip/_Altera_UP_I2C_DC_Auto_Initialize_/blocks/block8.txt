Comment: 
This block is a state selector that controls when the `send_start_bit` of an I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus controller is set. It's clocked on the positive edge of the `clk` signal and it listens for specific controlling signals such as `reset`, `transfer_complete`, and `s_i2c_auto_init`. When `reset` is high or `transfer_complete` signal is asserted, the block resets `send_start_bit` to low. Conversely, if `s_i2c_auto_init` is equal to `AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT`, it sets `send_start_bit` to high, indicating the start of a new transfer on the I²C bus.
