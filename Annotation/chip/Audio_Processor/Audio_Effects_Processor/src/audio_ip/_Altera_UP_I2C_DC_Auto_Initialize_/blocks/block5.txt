Comment: 
The block of code serves as a ROM address counter update mechanism under different conditions. On each positive clock edge, the counter is reset to the defined minimum ROM address if a reset signal is asserted. Alternatively, if the automatic initialization state is AUTO_STATE_7_INCREASE_COUNTER, the ROM address counter increases by one. Both these actions effectively maintain and manage the ROM address space by resetting or incrementing the current address.
