    "block_comment": "This block of code is a state management module for a counter. This block's action is dependent on different conditions. Whenever a positive clock signal (posedge clk) is encountered, it checks whether a reset signal is active. If active, it sets the 'counting' to low, effectively resetting the state. Alternatively, if a 'reset_bit_counter' is high, the 'counting' is turned on. Lastly, it checks if there has been a falling edge in bit clock ('bit_clk_falling_edge') and if the 'bit_counter' is at zero state. In such a case, it turns off 'counting'. The block, thus, manages the state of 'counting' based on various system signals and states.\n"
