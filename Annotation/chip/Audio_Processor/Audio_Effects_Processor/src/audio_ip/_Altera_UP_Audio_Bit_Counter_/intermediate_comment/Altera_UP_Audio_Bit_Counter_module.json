    "module": "Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter module serves as a digital audio data processing unit operating on the edges of bit and left/right clocks. It uses inputs to control its functioning (reset, bit clock, and left/right clock edges) and outputs its counting state. Internally, it uses 'reset_bit_counter' to trigger resets and 'bit_counter' as a countdown timer. The design uses always blocks to update statuses based on control logic and an assign statement to compute 'reset_bit_counter'."
