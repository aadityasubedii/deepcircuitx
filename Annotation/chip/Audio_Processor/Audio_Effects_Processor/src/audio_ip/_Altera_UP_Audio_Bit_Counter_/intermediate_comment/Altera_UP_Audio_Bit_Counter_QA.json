This module works by acting on the rising and falling edges of the bit and left/right clocks. When the reset input is high, the counter value is reset, and the same occurs when the reset_bit_counter signal is high. The counter decrements with every falling edge on the bit clock until it reaches 0, and its state is related to the 'counting' output signal. The counter can also be reset by either the rising or falling edge of the left/right clock."
