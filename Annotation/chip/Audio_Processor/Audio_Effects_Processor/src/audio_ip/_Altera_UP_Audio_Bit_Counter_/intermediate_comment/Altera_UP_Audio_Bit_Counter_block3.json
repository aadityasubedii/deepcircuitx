    "block_comment": "This block of code controls a bit counter in a synchronous design. The counter is reset when either the system reset (`reset`), or a specific bit counter reset (`reset_bit_counter`) is high. The value of the counter after reset is either hard-coded to zero, or an initial predefined value provided by `BIT_COUNTER_INIT`. Also, the counter decrements by one on each falling edge of `bit_clk_falling_edge` signal, given that the current counter value is non-zero."
