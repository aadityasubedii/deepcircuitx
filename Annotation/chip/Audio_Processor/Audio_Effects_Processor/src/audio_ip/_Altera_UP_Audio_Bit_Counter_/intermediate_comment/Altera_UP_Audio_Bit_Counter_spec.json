    "spec": "Module name: Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter. \n\nModule specification: The Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter module is a digital signal counter that displays an audio data processing functionality. It operates by acting on the rising and falling edges of the bit and left/right clocks. This module uses several input ports, such as clk (system clock gate), reset (system reset signal), bit_clk_rising_edge, bit_clk_falling_edge, left_right_clk_rising_edge, and left_right_clk_falling_edge (these detect the edges of the bit clock/right_left clock respectively). The module has one output port, counting, which indicates the counter state and is reset if either reset or 'reset_bit_counter' is high. \n\nInternally, it uses the signals 'reset_bit_counter' and 'bit_counter'. Reset_bit_counter is a control signal used to automatically reset the 'bit_counter' and 'counting' states when the left/right clock has an edge. Bit_counter is a 5-bit register that is used as a countdown timer, decremented by the falling edge of the bit clock, and reset by either the 'reset' or 'reset_bit_counter' signals.\n\nThe code can be logically divided into sections: first, initializing parameters, defining input/output ports, and internal signals; then, using always blocks to update the 'bit_counter' and 'counting' on every positive edge of the clk based on the module's control logic; finally, an assign statement for computing 'reset_bit_counter' based on the left/right clock's edges. This module provides a basic and robust design for digital audio processing tasks using hardware description language.",
