    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for resetting a bit counter. The reset is triggered under two conditions - either when the clock signal for the 'left_right' block experiences a rising edge or a falling edge. The 'assign' statement is used to continuously assign the value of the ORed results of these two conditions to the 'reset_bit_counter'."
