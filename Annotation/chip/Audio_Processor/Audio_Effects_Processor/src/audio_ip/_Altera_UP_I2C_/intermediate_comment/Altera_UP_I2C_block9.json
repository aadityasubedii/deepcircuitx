    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the signal 'i2c_scen' in an I2C communication protocol using a clock-synchronized mechanism. On a positive edge of the clock, if a reset event occurs, 'i2c_scen' is set high; alternatively, when the 'change_output_bit_en' signal is enabled and the transceiver is in the 'START' state, 'i2c_scen' is set low. Finally, when the transceiver reaches the 'STOP' state, 'i2c_scen' is again set high. All these events are processed synchronously with the system clock ensuring timing precise outcomes."
