    "block_comment": "This code block is a sequential logic block, operating on a positive edge clock's trigger, used for handling the input data from I2C communication. If a reset signal occurs, data_from_i2c is cleared to 0. Otherwise, when the start_and_stop_en signal and state of the I2C transceiver match certain conditions (specifically, in the byte transfer state), it takes the least significant 7 bits of the current data_from_i2c and appends the i2c_sdata bit at the end, updating the value of data_from_i2c accordingly. This operation is effectively a shift of the data and capturing the new bit from the I2C bus, supporting the data capture process in an I2C communication protocol."
