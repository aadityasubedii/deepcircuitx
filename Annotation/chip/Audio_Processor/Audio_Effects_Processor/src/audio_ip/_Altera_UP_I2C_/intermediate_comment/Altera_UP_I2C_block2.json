    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the logic for enabling the clock in an I2C transceiver circuit. The clock is enabled when the transceiver is not in either the idle state (`I2C_STATE_0_IDLE`) or the complete state (`I2C_STATE_6_COMPLETE`). This is achieved by negating each of these state conditions using the bitwise NOT operator (`~`), then performing a logical AND operation (`&&`) on these negated conditions."
