    "module": "Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_I2C module implements an I2C protocol communication interface. It manages I2C states for data transfer, start and stop conditions, and sends and receives 8-bit data. It does this using a state machine driven by a 400KHz clock signal, provisions for input, output, and bidirectional ports for controlling data flow, and internal signals for tracking the current bit and byte being transferred. The module also handles bus contention and clock stretching scenarios."
