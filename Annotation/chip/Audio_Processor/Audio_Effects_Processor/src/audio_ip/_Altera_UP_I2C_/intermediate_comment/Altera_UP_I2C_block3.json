    "block_comment": "This piece of Verilog code is responsible for managing the data transmission in an I2C one-bit transceiver. Using a condition (ternary) operator, the code block determines the state of the I2C transceiver and corresponding data bit to be transmitted. If the state is 'start bit', 'stop bit' or 'transfer acknowledgment bit' during read operation, it sets i2c_sdata to '0'. During a 'transfer byte' state, if it's not a read operation, the current bit from the current byte gets assigned to i2c_sdata. For all other scenarios, a high impedance state 'z' is assigned to i2c_sdata."
