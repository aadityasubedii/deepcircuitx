    "spec": "Module name: Altera_UP_I2C. \nModule specification: The Altera_UP_I2C module is a Hardware Description Language (HDL) module written in Verilog which provides the functionality for an I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol communication, facilitating both sending and receiving data over an I2C bus, and managing I2C state transitions such as idle, pre-start, start bit, data transfer, acknowledgement, stop bit, and complete states. It operates based on the 400KHz clock signal and handles start and stop conditions for bit transfer, output bit modification, reading bytes from the bus, and data transfer. It consists of several input ports, output ports, and one bi-directional port which all work together to successfully enable a high-speed I2C communication interface. The input ports include the main system clock (clk), a reset signal, control signals for various operations, and an 8-bit wide data input bus. The output ports include the I2C clock (i2c_sclk), an enable signal for the I2C scene (i2c_scen), a clock enable signal, an 8-bit wide data output bus, an acknowledgement signal, and a completion signal for data transfer. The single bi-directional port (i2c_sdata) is used for both sending and receiving data on the I2C interface. Inside the module, there are key internal signals like the current_bit, current_byte, and next-state and current-state signals used for the state machine execution that commands the sequence of events. This module precisely synthesizes a state machine to control the different stages of I2C data transfer including sending a start bit, transferring data, sending an acknowledgement, and completing the data transfer operation, and thus offers a comprehensive solution for managing I2C transactions effectively.",

                    "text": "Module name: Altera_UP_I2C. \nModule specification: The Altera_UP_I2C module is a Hardware Description Language (HDL) module written in Verilog which provides the functionality for an I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol communication, facilitating both sending and receiving data over an I2C bus, and managing I2C state transitions such as idle, pre-start, start bit, data transfer, acknowledgement, stop bit, and complete states. It operates based on the 400KHz clock signal and handles start and stop conditions for bit transfer, output bit modification, reading bytes from the bus, and data transfer. It consists of several input ports, output ports, and one bi-directional port which all work together to successfully enable a high-speed I2C communication interface. The input ports include the main system clock (clk), a reset signal, control signals for various operations, and an 8-bit wide data input bus. The output ports include the I2C clock (i2c_sclk), an enable signal for the I2C scene (i2c_scen), a clock enable signal, an 8-bit wide data output bus, an acknowledgement signal, and a completion signal for data transfer. The single bi-directional port (i2c_sdata) is used for both sending and receiving data on the I2C interface. Inside the module, there are key internal signals like the current_bit, current_byte, and next-state and current-state signals used for the state machine execution that commands the sequence of events. This module precisely synthesizes a state machine to control the different stages of I2C data transfer including sending a start bit, transferring data, sending an acknowledgement, and completing the data transfer operation, and thus offers a comprehensive solution for managing I2C transactions effectively."
