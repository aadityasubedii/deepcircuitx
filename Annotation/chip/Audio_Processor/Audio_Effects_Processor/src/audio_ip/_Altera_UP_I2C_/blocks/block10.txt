This block of code represents a state machine for an I2C transceiver. The state machine has seven states, each representing a specific stage of an I2C communication session. Transitions between these states are controlled by conditions checked within each state. For example, in the idle state, if a start bit is to be sent and the clock is low, the state transitions to the pre-start state. Various states handle sending start and stop bits, transferring data and acknowledging transfer. The complete state has a condition to return to the idle state if no more data is left to transfer.
