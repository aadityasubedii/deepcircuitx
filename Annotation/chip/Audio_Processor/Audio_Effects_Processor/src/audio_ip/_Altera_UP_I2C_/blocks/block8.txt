Comment: 
This block manages the acknowledgement status for an I2C transceiver. Upon a positive edge clock signal, it first verifies if the system is in a reset mode, or if an acknowledgement clearing signal is given, if so, it sets the 'ack' signal to zero. If these conditions are not met, it checks if the transceiver is in the 'TRANSFER_ACK' state and 'start_and_stop_en' is enabled, upon which it sets the 'ack' signal to the XOR of current data line status and I2C bus mode.
