This block of code manages the current bit count in an I2C transceiver's state transfer. It uses a synchronous reset to initialize the current_bit at the rising edge of the clock. If the reset is high, the current_bit is set to zero. If the I2C is in a TRANSFER_BYTE state and change_output_bit_en is enabled, the current_bit is decremented. For any other transceiver state, the current_bit is set to the total bits to transfer.
