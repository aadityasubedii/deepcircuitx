This block of code represents a state machine controller for an I2C transceiver. It operates synchronously with a positive edge clock and has the ability to be reset. If a reset signal is received, the current byte is reset to an 8-bit zero. However, if no reset signal is present and the I2C transceiver is in an IDLE or START_BIT state, the current byte is set to the value of data_in.
