Comment: 
This block allows the initialization of the I2C transceiver when a reset signal is received or keeps the transceiver in its current state (idle or busy). It implements this functionality by waiting for a positive clock cycle. During this cycle, if a reset signal (high) is detected, it resets the I2C transceiver to the idle state. If a reset signal is not detected, the current state of the transceiver is maintained.
