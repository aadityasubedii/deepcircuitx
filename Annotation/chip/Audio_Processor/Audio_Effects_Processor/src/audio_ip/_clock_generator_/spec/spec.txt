Module name: clock_generator. 

Module specification: The clock_generator is a Verilog module that takes an input clock signal, CLOCK_27, and creates an output clock signal, AUD_XCK, based on parameters AUD_CLK_MULT and AUD_CLK_DIV. The conversion of the input signal to the output signal happens via the altpll (Phase Locked Loop) component, a key building block in the design used to generate multiple, phase-related clock signals. 

The module has two inputs - CLOCK_27, a 2-bit clock signal, and reset, a 1-bit signal used to reset the altpll block. The output consists of AUD_XCK, a 1-bit modified clock signal, and an internal wire audio_clk_locked, indicating whether the clock signal generated by the PLL is currently stable.

The altpll block is important as it is the part of the design that allows the generation of new, phase-related clock signals based on the received input signals. It is configured using various parameters defined in the code such as clk0_divide_by and clk0_multiply_by which determine the frequency of the new clock signal. The audio_clk_locked wire connects to the locked output of the altpll block, signalling whether the PLL has achieved lock and is outputting valid clock signals.

In essence, the clock_generator module works by receiving an initial clock signal, processing and modifying it using a PLL block configured by several defined parameters, and presenting new, reliable clock signals, potentially suited for different workloads. It further outputs a 'locked' status, providing a basis for potential debugging or monitoring in the context of a larger system design.
