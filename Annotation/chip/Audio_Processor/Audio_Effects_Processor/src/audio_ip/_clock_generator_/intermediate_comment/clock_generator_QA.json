Explanation: The clock_generator module takes an input clock signal, CLOCK_27, and creates a modified output clock signal, AUD_XCK, based on parameters AUD_CLK_MULT and AUD_CLK_DIV. It uses the altpll (Phase Locked Loop) component, a fundamental building block in the design used to generate multiple, phase-related clock signals. The module also possesses a reset input. The altpll block is configured using various parameters like clk0_divide_by, clk0_multiply_by, etc., that are defined later in the code. The locked output, audio_clk_locked, indicates that the PLL has achieved lock and is outputting valid clock signals."

CLOCK_27: It is a 2-bit input port which provides the base clock signal that will be modified by the clock_generator module to create the new clock signal.\n2. reset: It is a single bit input port used to reset the altpll (Phase Locked Loop). A high signal on the reset input causes the PLL to reset and attempt to relock on the incoming clock signal.\n\nOutput Ports: \n1. AUD_XCK: It is a single bit output port which delivers the modified clock signal that is derived from the input clock signal, CLOCK_27.\n2. audio_clk_locked: This is a single bit output signal which indicates that the Phase Locked Loop (PLL) within the altpll block has achieved lock and is outputting valid clock signals. Normally, once the PLL achieves lock, this output will remain high as long as the input clock is stable.\n\nExplanation: The input ports take in the base clock signal (CLOCK_27) and a reset signal. From this input signal, the clock_generator module creates a new clock signal (AUD_XCK) and indicates whether the clock signal generated by the PLL is valid (audio_clk_locked).

Explanation: audio_clk_locked is a wire (intermediate signal) that catches the locked status from the altpll block.
