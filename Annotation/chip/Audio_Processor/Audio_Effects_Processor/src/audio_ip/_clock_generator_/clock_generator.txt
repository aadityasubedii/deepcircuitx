Module-level comment: 
// The clock_generator module modifies input clock signal (CLOCK_27) to create a new clock signal (AUD_XCK) guided by AUD_CLK_MULT and AUD_CLK_DIV parameters. This is achieved via the altpll (a Phase Locked Loop block), which is configured using parameters defined in the code. In addition to the new clock signal, the module also outputs a 'locked' status (audio_clk_locked) indicating the stability of the output clock signals. The module accepts a reset signal for resetting the altpll block.
