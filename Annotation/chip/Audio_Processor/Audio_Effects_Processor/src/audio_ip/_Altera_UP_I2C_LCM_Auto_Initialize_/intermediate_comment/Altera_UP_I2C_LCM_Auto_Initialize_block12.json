    "block_comment": "This is a state machine for an I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) automatic initialization process. The block starts with checking the status of the initialization (`AUTO_STATE_0_CHECK_STATUS`). If finished, it transitions to the completion state (`AUTO_STATE_7_DONE`). If not, it proceeds to send the start bit (`AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT`) and then transferring bytes step by step (`AUTO_STATE_2_TRANSFER_BYTE_0` and `AUTO_STATE_3_TRANSFER_BYTE_1`). It waits for the transfer completion signal (`AUTO_STATE_4_WAIT`), sends the stop bit (`AUTO_STATE_5_SEND_STOP_BIT`), and increases the counter (`AUTO_STATE_6_INCREASE_COUNTER`) before going back to the checking status. If it encounters an uncharted state, it defaults back to the status checking state. The conditions for state transition are managed through if-else control constructs from status, transfer completion, and change state signals."
