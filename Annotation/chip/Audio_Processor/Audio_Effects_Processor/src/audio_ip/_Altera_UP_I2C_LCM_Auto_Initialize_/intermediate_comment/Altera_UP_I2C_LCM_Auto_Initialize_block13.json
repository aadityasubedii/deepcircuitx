    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a synchronous state-update for an I2C initialisation process in a Finite State Machine (FSM). On every positive edge of the system clock (`clk`), if the `reset` signal is high, the FSM state (`s_i2c_auto_init`) is set to the initial state (`AUTO_STATE_0_CHECK_STATUS`). Otherwise, it stays in its current state (`ns_i2c_auto_init`), which is assumed to be populated beforehand elsewhere in the code."
