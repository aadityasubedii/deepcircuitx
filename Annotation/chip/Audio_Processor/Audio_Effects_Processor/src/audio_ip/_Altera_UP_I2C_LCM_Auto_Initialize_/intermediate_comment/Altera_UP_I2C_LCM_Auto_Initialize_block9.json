    "block_comment": "The block of code manages the transfer of data within an I2C interface. Upon a clock's positive edge, it checks for a reset flag or a data transfer completion flag and accordingly resets the data transfer process by setting a 'transfer_data' flag to '0'. If neither conditions apply, it checks whether the I2C state is in ether 'AUTO_STATE_2_TRANSFER_BYTE_0' or 'AUTO_STATE_3_TRANSFER_BYTE_1' mode. If in either of these states, the data transfer process is initiated by setting the 'transfer_data' flag to '1'."
