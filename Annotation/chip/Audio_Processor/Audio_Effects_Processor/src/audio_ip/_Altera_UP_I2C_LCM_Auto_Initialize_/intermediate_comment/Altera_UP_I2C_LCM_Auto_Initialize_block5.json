    "block_comment": "The block of code serves as a counter that manages addresses in a read-only memory (ROM). Implemented to react on the positive edge of a clock signal, the counter either resets the ROM address to its minimum value when the reset signal is set or increments the ROM address by one in case the automated I2C initialization state matches the pre-defined value for increasing the counter. The counter's new value is latched on the next rising edge of the `clk`."
