It controls several operations with the help of a state machine that governs the sequence and timing of the write operations to the LCM memory locations with predefined values. To achieve this, it uses a set of carefully defined stages that are executed in response to specific bus conditions and host commands. The module transitions between these stages in a controlled order. It is also designed to handle exceptions and errors during the transfer process, allowing it to recover and retry if conditions permit. The transfer process involves parameters like start and stop bits, data bytes, and data size, which are managed by the module. It also reports its status details, including transfer completion or any errors, to the host system."
