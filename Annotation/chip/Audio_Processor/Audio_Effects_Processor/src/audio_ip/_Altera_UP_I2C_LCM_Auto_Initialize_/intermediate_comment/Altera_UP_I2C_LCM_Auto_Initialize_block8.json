    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for controlling the transmission of a start bit in an I2C communication protocol. The transmission relies on specific conditions: the \"send_start_bit\" signal is reset to '0' whenever a reset signal is detected or when the \"transfer_complete\" signal is tripped, indicating the successful end of a transfer. On the other hand, the \"send_start_bit\" signal is set to '1' to initiate a transfer when the state machine of the I2C protocol transitions to the AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT state. This mechanism ensures that the communication is properly framed and controlled, satisfying the requirements of the I2C protocol.\n"
