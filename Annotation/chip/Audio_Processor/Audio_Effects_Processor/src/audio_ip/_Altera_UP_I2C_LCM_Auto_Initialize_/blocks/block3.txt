Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for triggering the state change in the system. The state change occurs if both the 'transfer_complete' and the 'transfer_data' signals are asserted. The 'assign' keyword is used to continuously drive the 'change_state' wire based on the logical AND operation between these two signals.
