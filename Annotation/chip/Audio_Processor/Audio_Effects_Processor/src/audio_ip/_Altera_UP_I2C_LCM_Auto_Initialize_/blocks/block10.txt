This block of code handles the reset and byte transfer states of an I2C communication interface. On a positive edge clock signal, if the reset signal is high, the data_size variable is set to zero. If the operation is in the 'SEND_START_BIT' state, the data_size variable is set to 6. Conversely, if the operation is in the 'TRANSFER_BYTE_1' state, the data_size variable is then set to 7. This logic helps ensure the data size is set correctly based on the current state of the I2C operation.
