Comment: 
This block is responsible for controlling the output data based on the state of the system. It is synchronized with the positive edge of the system clock. If the system is in reset state, it sets the `data_out` as 8'h00, ensuring that no meaningful data is output during reset. However, if `s_i2c_auto_init` assumes the value of `AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT`, it assembles `data_out` from `rom_data[13: 8]` and padding bits, preparing for the transmission of part of the data stored in the ROM. If `s_i2c_auto_init` is `AUTO_STATE_3_TRANSFER_BYTE_1`, it outputs the lower byte - `rom_data[ 7: 0]` - of the same ROM data.
