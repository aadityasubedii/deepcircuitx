Comment: 
The block of code is assigning the "finished_auto_init" signal to be true when "rom_address_counter" equals "MAX_ROM_ADDRESS". This essentially means that the automatic initialization will be considered finished when the ROM address counter has reached its maximum limit, indicated by "MAX_ROM_ADDRESS". The "assign" keyword in Verilog is being used here to create this continuous assignment statement. This simple, yet critical function, allows the system to keep track of the initialization process and whether it has been completed or not.
