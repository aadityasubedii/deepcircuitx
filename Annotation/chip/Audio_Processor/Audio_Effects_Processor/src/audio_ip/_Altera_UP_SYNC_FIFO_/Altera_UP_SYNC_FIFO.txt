Module-level comment: "The Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO module is a custom implementation of a Synchronous FIFO memory queue, with fully configurable data and address widths and depth. It utilizes an internal instance of the predefined 'scfifo' module achieving FIFO functionality. Inputs include signals for clock, reset, write enable/data, and read enable, while the outputs are FIFO status indicators (empty, full, words_used) and read data. This offers a flexible, parameterizable FIFO design suitable for various applications."
