Explanation: This is a verilog module that declares a Synchronous FIFO (First In First Out) memory queue. The queue has parameters to set the data width, data depth, and address width. Data can be written into the FIFO using the `write_en` and `write_data` inputs. Data can be read from the FIFO using the `read_en` input. The `fifo_is_empty`, `fifo_is_full`, and `words_used` outputs provide status information about the FIFO. The `read_data` output provides the data that is read from the FIFO."
