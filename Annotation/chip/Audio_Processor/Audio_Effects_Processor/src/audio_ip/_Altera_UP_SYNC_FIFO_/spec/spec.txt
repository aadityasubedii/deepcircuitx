Module name: Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO. 

Module specification:

The Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO is a Verilog module which encapsulates a synchronous FIFO (First In First Out) memory queue with customizable parameters for data width, data depth, and address width. The module uses a predefined 'scfifo' module instance, customized with specific parameters representing the complexity and functionality, such as width and depth of the FIFO, underflow and overflow handling, and whether it uses an embedded array block (EAB). 

This module takes five inputs including a clock signal `clk` which controls the operation of the synchronous FIFO, `reset` to initialize the FIFO module, `write_en` to enable writing to the FIFO queue when it is not full, and `write_data` to transmit data to be stored into the FIFO, and `read_en` to enable reading from the FIFO queue.

The module outputs four entities, `fifo_is_empty` indicating if the FIFO queue is empty, `fifo_is_full` indicating if the FIFO queue is full, `words_used` providing the count of data items currently in the FIFO queue, and `read_data` transmitting the data read from the FIFO queue.

At the internal level, the module has a `Sync_FIFO` signal which is an instance of the `scfifo` module. This module performs the basic functionality of the FIFO queue with inputs connected to the clock, reset, write enable, write data, and read enable signals. Outputs from the `scfifo` instance are connected to the module's FIFO empty, FIFO full, words used, and read data signals. The code of the module is divided into declaration of module name with IO ports, defining parameters, declaring IO ports, internal signal (instance of `scfifo`), and finally defining the attributes of `scfifo` module.
