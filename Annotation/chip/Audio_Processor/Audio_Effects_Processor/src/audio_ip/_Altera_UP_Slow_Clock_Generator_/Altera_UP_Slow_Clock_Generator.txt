Module-level comment: This Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator module generates a slower clock (`new_clk`) based on an input clock(`clk`). It uses an internal counter (`clk_counter`), which increments on each `clk` cycle when a control signal (`enable_clk`) is high. Resetting functionalities and output signals are governed by a `reset` signal. Five output signals provide various characteristics of the new clock such as edge detection and level mid-points. Control flow is handled through six separate `always` blocks, each triggered by the positive edge of `clk`.
