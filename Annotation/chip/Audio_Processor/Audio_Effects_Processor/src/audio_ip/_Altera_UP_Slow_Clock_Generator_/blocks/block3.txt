Comment: 
This block of code generates a signal for falling edge detection. This code does so by storing the state of the clock signal after each clock cycle, in `falling_edge`. The statement under `always @(posedge clk)` trigger means the operation happens on every rising edge of the clock. If a reset signal is emitted (`reset == 1'b1`), `falling_edge` is cleared. Otherwise, `falling_edge` captures a falling edge when the current clock cycle (`new_clk`) is low but the last clock cycle (`clk_counter[COUNTER_BITS]`) is high.
