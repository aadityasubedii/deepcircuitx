    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code handles a clock counter reset mechanism in a synchronous digital system. When a new clock cycle begins (indicated by the positive edge of the 'clk' signal), the block checks if a reset has been triggered. If 'reset' is set to '1', 'middle_of_high_level' is reset to '0'. Otherwise, it takes the value determined by bitwise operations performed on 'clk_counter'. Specifically, it checks the value of the bit at position 'COUNTER_BITS', performs a bitwise AND operation with the negated bit at position 'COUNTER_BITS - 1', and then performs a bitwise AND operation with the result of a reduction AND operation on bits between position '1' and position 'COUNTER_BITS - 2'. This is typically used in timing-related circuit designs."
