It takes an input clock signal and generates a slower version of it. This is usually used in digital devices when a slower clock is required for certain operations or components. This module also provides ancillary signals such as `rising_edge`, `falling_edge`, `middle_of_high_level`, and `middle_of_low_level` from the generated slower clock. It uses a counter to achieve this functionality, and this counter increments on each clock cycle if the `enable_clk` control signal is high, otherwise the counter remains the same until enabled. The module also comes with a `reset` signal that resets the counter and all output signals to initial state."
