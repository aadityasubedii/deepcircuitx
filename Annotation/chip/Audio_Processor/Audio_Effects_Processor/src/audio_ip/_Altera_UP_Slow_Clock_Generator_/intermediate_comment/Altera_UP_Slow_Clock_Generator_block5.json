    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code generates a clock signal `new_clk` based on the condition of the `reset` and `clk_counter`. When a positive edge of `clk` gets detected, if `reset` is high, then `new_clk` is set to low, essentially initialising or resetting the clock. If `reset` is low, `new_clk` is updated based on the most significant bit of `clk_counter` array, thus dividing the main clock frequency by a factor dependent on the counter value."
