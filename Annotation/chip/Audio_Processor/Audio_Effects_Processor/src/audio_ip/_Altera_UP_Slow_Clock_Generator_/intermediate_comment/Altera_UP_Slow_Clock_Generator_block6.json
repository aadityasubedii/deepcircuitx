    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for managing a clock counter, which is either reset or incremented. Upon the rising edge of the clock signal, the block checks whether the reset signal is high. If it is, the clock counter variable `clk_counter` is reset to 0 - achieved by replicating a zero `COUNTER_BITS` times. If the reset signal isn't high, it checks if `enable_clk` is high. If it is, the `clk_counter` is increased by the constant `COUNTER_INC`. Therefore, this block effectively controls a counter that can be reset or increased with each clock cycle."
