    "block_comment": "This block is a rising edge detector that uses a clock counter for cycle detection. It detects the rising edge of a signal after a reset, where the 'reset' signal resets the status of the 'rising_edge' output to false during high. But, if the reset isn't high, the 'rising_edge' signal gets the value of an XOR operation on the most significant bit of the 'clk_counter' and 'new_clk' signals, which is then bit-wise ANDed with the negated 'new_clk' signal."
