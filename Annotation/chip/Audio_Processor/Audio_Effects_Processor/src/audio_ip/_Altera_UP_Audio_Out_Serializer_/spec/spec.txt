Module name: Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer. 

Module specification: The "Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer" module functions to serialize audio data in a digital audio system. It takes as input audio data for two channels (left and right), which is buffered synchronously in two FIFOs. The serialized audio data is output bit-by-bit following clock signals. The clock ('clk') and reset ('reset') ports serve as standard signals. The module receives audio input data through 'left_channel_data' and 'right_channel_data' ports, controlled by the enable signals 'left_channel_data_en' and 'right_channel_data_en' respectively. Bit clock signals 'bit_clk_rising_edge' and 'bit_clk_falling_edge' regulate the bit-wise output of data, while 'left_right_clk_rising_edge' and 'left_right_clk_falling_edge' switches between the left and right channel FIFOs. The unoccupied space in FIFOs is reported through 'left_channel_fifo_write_space' and 'right_channel_fifo_write_space' ports. The final serialized audio data is output through 'serial_audio_out_data' port.

The module utilizes internal signals 'read_left_channel' and 'read_right_channel' to perform read operations on the respective channel FIFOs. Status flags for FIFOs being full, or empty are monitored using 'left_channel_fifo_is_full', 'right_channel_fifo_is_full', 'left_channel_fifo_is_empty', and 'right_channel_fifo_is_empty' signals. Moreover, the amount of word use in each FIFO is tracked by 'left_channel_fifo_used' and 'right_channel_fifo_used'. The signals 'left_channel_from_fifo' and 'right_channel_from_fifo' hold the read audio data, and 'data_out_shift_reg' register holds the data being serialized for output. The module keeps track of read operation from left channel with 'left_channel_was_read' flag.

The module is organized into several logic operations delineated by "always" and "assign" statements to control the flow of data, updating of internal signals, and assignment of read operations, serialization and clock functions. This modular framework of the code aids in easier understanding and debugging. The module also makes use of Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO instances for implementing the FIFO buffer queues for both audio channels.
