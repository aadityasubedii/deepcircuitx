Comment: 
This block manages the output data shifting operations in a digital audio system. It uses a clock signal to ensure synchronization. When the reset signal is activated, the output data shift register is cleared. Depending on whether the read request is for the left or right audio channel data from the FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer, the corresponding data is moved into the output shift register. If an audio data clock transition is detected, the shift register is again cleared. For a bit clock falling edge event, the existing data in the shift register is shifted by one bit.
