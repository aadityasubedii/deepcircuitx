This block of code is responsible for controlling the write operation space available in a left channel FIFO. It resets the available write space to 0 if a reset signal is detected, otherwise, it calculates the space left for writing data considering the FIFO's full status and used space. This operation is synchronized with the rising edge of a clock signal, ensuring accurate and timely updates of the FIFO write space.
