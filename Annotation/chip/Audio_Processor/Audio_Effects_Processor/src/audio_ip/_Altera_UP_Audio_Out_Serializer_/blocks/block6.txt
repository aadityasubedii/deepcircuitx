Comment: 
The code block primarily enables reading from the right channel of a device. This function is triggered when two conditions are met as per the given logic: when there is a falling edge of the left right clock (left_right_clk_falling_edge is high) and when the left channel has been successfully read (left_channel_was_read is high). This is implemented using a bitwise AND operation, which makes the 'read_right_channel' high when both conditions are true, activating the reading from the right channel.
