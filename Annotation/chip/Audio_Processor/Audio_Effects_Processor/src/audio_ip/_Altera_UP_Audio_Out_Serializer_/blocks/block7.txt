Comment: 
This block assigns a value to the signal `read_left_channel`. The signal is used to read data from the left audio channel when both the left and right audio channels are not empty and a rising edge of the clock `left_right_clk` is detected. The operation is implemented by using a bitwise '&' operation to combine the aforementioned three conditions, indicating that all three must be true for `read_left_channel` to be set to '1'.
