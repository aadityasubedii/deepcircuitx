Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer module serializes audio data for digital audio systems. It uses two synchronous FIFOs to buffer the input audio data (left and right). FIFOs are managed with clock and reset signals, and audio data is output bit-by-bit as per clock signals. Space availability in the FIFOs is monitored and reported. Implementation uses multiple "always" and "assign" statements to control the data flow and the usage of 'Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO' instances for the internal FIFO functionality.
