    "block_comment": "This block of code corresponds to an instantiation of a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue using an Altera sync design for the right channel of an audio output interface. The FIFO queue is essential for buffering data between hardware devices working at different clock rates. Specifically, for this audio interface, the FIFO handles right channel data. The queue is configured to write data (`right_channel_data`) when the `right_channel_data_en` signal is high, the FIFO isn't full (`~right_channel_fifo_is_full`), and both actions are synchronous with the system's clock (`clk`). Data read from the FIFO queue (`right_channel_from_fifo`) is enabled by the `read_right_channel` signal. The code also aids in monitoring FIFO usage by providing signals that indicate if the FIFO is empty or full and how many words are used (`right_channel_fifo_used`)."
