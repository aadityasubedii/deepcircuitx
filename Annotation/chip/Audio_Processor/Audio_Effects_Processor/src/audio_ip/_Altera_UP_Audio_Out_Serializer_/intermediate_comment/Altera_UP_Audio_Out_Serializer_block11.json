    "block_comment": "The block of code is designed to manage write space in a FIFO for the right audio channel. It executes on the rising edge of the clock. If a reset signal is received, the available write space in the right channel's FIFO is zeroed out. Without a reset signal, the block calculates the available write space as 128 (hex 80) minus the current full and used status of the FIFO."
