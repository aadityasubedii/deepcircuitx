    "block_comment": "This block of code defines the parameters for `Audio_Out_Right_Channel_FIFO` in the Verilog HDL design. It specifies the data width of the audio output to fit `AUDIO_DATA_WIDTH`, the size of the FIFO queue as 128, and sets the address width to 7. These settings are critical in shaping the output bit-stream and managing the buffer effectively to prevent underflow or overflow."
