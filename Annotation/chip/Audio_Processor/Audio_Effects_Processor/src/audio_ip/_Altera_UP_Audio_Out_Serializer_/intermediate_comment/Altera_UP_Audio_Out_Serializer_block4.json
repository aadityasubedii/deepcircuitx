    "block_comment": "The block of code is a set of parameters for the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) buffer used by the left channel of an audio output device. The parameters define the width and depth of the data, as well as the address width for the FIFO buffer. This implementation ensures enough buffer capacity to handle audio data with defined width and a limitation on storage capacity is set to 128 units, and the range of accessible address space is defined by a 7-bit address."
