    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog describes a synchronous FIFO buffer (First-In-First-Out) for the audio left channel data (Audio_Out_Left_Channel_FIFO). This FIFO buffer uses a clock (clk) signal and a reset signal for synchronous operation. To add data to the buffer, the 'write_en' control signal is enabled when there's left-channel data available and the buffer is not full. The data to be written is specified by 'write_data'. The 'read_en' signal allows data to be read from the buffer when enabled. Status signals of the FIFO buffer are provided: 'fifo_is_empty' and 'fifo_is_full' which indicate if the buffer is empty or full respectively, and 'words_used' reports the amount of words currently in the buffer. Finally, 'read_data' fetches the output data from the buffer."
