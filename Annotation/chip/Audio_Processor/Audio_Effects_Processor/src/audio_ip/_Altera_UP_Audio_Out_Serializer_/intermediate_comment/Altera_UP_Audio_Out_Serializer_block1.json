    "block_comment": "Apologies, but the block of code you provided is incomplete. Typically, a Verilog module has a specific structure with `module` keyword followed by module name, inputs/outputs declaration, internal signals, and logic description before the `endmodule` keyword. Unfortunately, without these, I can't provide a meaningful commentary or summary. Please provide a complete block of code for analysis."
