    "block_comment": "This block handles the control signals for the left audio channel in a digital audio system. On the rising edge of the clock signal, the condition of the 'reset' input, 'read_left_channel' input and 'read_right_channel' input are checked, and the 'left_channel_was_read' flag is updated accordingly. If 'reset' is high, it means the system is in the initial state and 'left_channel_was_read' is set low. If 'read_left_channel' is high, it implies that the left audio channel data is being read and 'left_channel_was_read' is set high. If 'read_right_channel' is high, it indicates that the right audio channel data is being read, thus 'left_channel_was_read' is set low."
