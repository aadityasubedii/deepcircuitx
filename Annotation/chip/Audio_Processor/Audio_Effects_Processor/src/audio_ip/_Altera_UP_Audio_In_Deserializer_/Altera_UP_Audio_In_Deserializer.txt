Module-level comment: The Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer module deserializes incoming audio data and stores it in FIFO buffers. It operates based on a system clock, control signals for audio data timing, and data read enable signals. It uses 'valid_audio_input' signal for data validation, FIFO control signals and a shift register to manage reading/writing of data. The module integrates Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter for timing control and two instances of Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO for data storage, providing deserialized audio data for left and right channels.
