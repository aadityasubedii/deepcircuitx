Comment: 
This block initiates a FIFO read operation for right audio channel data upon a clock's positive edge trigger. In a reset state, all bits of 'right_audio_fifo_read_space' are cleared. However, when not under reset, this block updates 'right_audio_fifo_read_space', where the 7th bit maps to the full flag of 'right_channel_fifo' and the lower 6 bits hold the space used in the same FIFO.
