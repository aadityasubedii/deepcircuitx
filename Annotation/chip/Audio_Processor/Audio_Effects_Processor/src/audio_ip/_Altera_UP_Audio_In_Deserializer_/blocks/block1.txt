Comment: 
This block of code implements a shift register to buffer the incoming serial audio data. On every positive edge clock cycle, if the reset is active, it clears the shift register. If not, when valid audio input is present and a rising edge of bit clock is detected, it shifts all data in the register by one bit and appends the incoming serial audio data to the least significant bit.
