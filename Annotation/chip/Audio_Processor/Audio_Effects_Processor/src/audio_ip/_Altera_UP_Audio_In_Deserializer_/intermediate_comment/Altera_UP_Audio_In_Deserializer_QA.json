It reads serial audio input data, then depending on control signals, it feeds the data into the corresponding left or right audio data FIFO (First In First Out) buffer. The module ensures that data is only written if the FIFO is not full, and only read from if the FIFO is not empty. The module also contains a read space for each FIFO buffer indicating the amount of data currently stored. It uses the bit and \"left-right\" clocks for controlling different aspects of the deserialization process. Finally, it delivers the processed audio data for both left and right channels for further usage. The Altera_UP_Audio_Bit_Counter and Altera_UP_SYNC_FIFO are used inside this main module for performing the deserialization and the storing of data respectively."
