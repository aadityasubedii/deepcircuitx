    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for managing the read space register of the left audio channel FIFO in response to the system's clock. Upon a reset signal, it clears the left_audio_fifo_read_space register. Otherwise, the block updates the read space register information every clock cycle. This register is an 8-bit value. Most significant bit indicates whether the FIFO is full. The remaining 7 bits show how many entries are used in the FIFO."
