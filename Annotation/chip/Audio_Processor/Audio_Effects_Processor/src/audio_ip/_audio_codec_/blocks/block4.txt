Comment: 
This block of code defines an instance of the `Altera_UP_Clock_Edge` component, named `DAC_Left_Right_Clock_Edges`, which is used to detect and separately isolate the rising and the falling edges of an audio DAC Left/Right clock signal. The `CLOCK_50` signal serves as the main clock for this block, whereas the `reset` signal is used to reset the component. The audio DAC Left/Right clock signal, `AUD_DACLRCK`, is input as `test_clk`. When `AUD_DACLRCK` has a rising edge, the component sends an output signal via `dac_lrclk_rising_edge`. Simultaneously, when `AUD_DACLRCK` has a falling edge, the output is channeled through `dac_lrclk_falling_edge`.
