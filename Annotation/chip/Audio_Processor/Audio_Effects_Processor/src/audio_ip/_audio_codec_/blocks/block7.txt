Comment: 
This block of code controls audio data read and write readiness, and data retrieval for both left and right audio channels. It checks for the availability of data in both channels with `read_ready`, ensuring that there's at least one byte to read. Write readiness (`write_ready`) is confirmed if there's some free space in both channels. The retrieved data from both channels is assigned to `readdata_left` and `readdata_right`.
