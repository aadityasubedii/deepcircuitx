Comment: 
This block of code is used to manage the clock edges for a specific ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter). Leveraging the Altera UP Clock Edge module, the RTL block generates distinct signals upon detecting rising and falling edges of the test clock (AUD_ADCLRCK) which is connected to ADC's left-right clock input. The reference clock (CLOCK_50) and a reset signal control the execution of this operation. The output signals, adc_lrclk_rising_edge and adc_lrclk_falling_edge, are activated when a rising and a falling edge is detected respectively.
