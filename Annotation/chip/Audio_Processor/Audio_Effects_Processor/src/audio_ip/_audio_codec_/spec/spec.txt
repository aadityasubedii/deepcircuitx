Module name: audio_codec. 

Module specification: The "audio_codec" is a Verilog module that interfaces with an audio codec to handle audio data synchronization for both input (ADC) and output (DAC). This module's inputs include "CLOCK_50" (system clock), "reset" (module's state reset), "read_s" and "write_s" (signals indicating readiness to read and write audio data), "writedata_left" and "writedata_right" (24-bit data streams for audio channels), "AUD_ADCDAT" (input audio stream), "AUD_BCLK" (audio bit clock signal), "AUD_ADCLRCK" and "AUD_DACLRCK" (left/right clock signals for ADC and DAC respectively). The module's outputs are "read_ready" and "write_ready" (signals indicating system readiness to read or write data), "readdata_left" and "readdata_right" (24-bit output data for audio channels), "AUD_DACDAT" (output data stream for DAC).

Internally, the module uses various signals to facilitate audio data processing, like edges of clocks ("bclk_rising_edge", "bclk_falling_edge", etc.), indicators of data available for reading and writing, and the synchronization statuses of ADC and DAC (by "done_adc_channel_sync" and "done_dac_channel_sync" respectively). Furthermore, it leverages 'Altera_UP_Clock_Edge', 'Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer', and 'Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer' to handle clock edges, data deserialization from serial to parallel, and data serialization from parallel to serial respectively. Thus, allowing efficient reading and writing of audio data to and from the audio codec.
