    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"audio_codec\" module synchronizes audio data for reading and writing to an audio codec using both an ADC and a DAC. It leverages input signals for clocking, readiness control, and data sourcing, while using output signals to indicate readiness and provide data streams. Internally, it employs specific signals for edge detection, read-write capability indicators, and synchronization account. Key functionalities are driven by Altera_UP_Clock_Edge for edge monitoring, Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer for converting incoming serial data to parallel, and Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer for parallel to serial data conversion. Module achieves functional efficacies in audio data management."
