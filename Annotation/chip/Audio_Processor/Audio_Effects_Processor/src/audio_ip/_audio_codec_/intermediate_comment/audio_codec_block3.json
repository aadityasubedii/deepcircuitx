    "block_comment": "The block is an instantiation of an Altera_UP_Audio_In_Deserializer module. This design is associated with the task of deserializing incoming audio data. It leverages both clock edges of bit and left/right clocks for audio data sampling. Upon finishing channel synchronization marked by the 'done_channel_sync' flag, the serialized audio input data 'AUD_ADCDAT' is ready to be deserialized. Reading audio data is enabled based on whether there is space left in the FIFO queues for both left and right audio channels. After the reading process, the new deserialized audio data is passed out through the 'new_left_channel_audio' and 'new_right_channel_audio' ports."
