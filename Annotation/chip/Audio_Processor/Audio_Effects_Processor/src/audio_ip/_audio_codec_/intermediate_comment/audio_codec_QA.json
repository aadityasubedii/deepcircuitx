This module handles the synchronization of the Audio Bit Clock, Left/Right Clock and data for audio input (ADC) and output (DAC). This makes it possible to read and write audio data from and to the audio codec. The module contains two primary tasks regards to audio read and write:\n\n1. Audio Read: It uses an audio deserializer to convert the incoming serial audio data stream to parallel data for both left and right audio channels. The readiness of the data to be read is indicated by signals \"read_ready\", \"readdata_left\", and \"readdata_right\".\n\n2. Audio Write: It uses an audio serializer to convert parallel audio data to a serial stream for both left and right channels. The readiness of the system to accept data for writing is indicated by the \"write_ready\" signal. Consequently, the processed data is outputted via \"AUD_DACDAT\". This module uses the de-facto data width standard of 24 bits for audio data."
