    "block_comment": "This block of code defines an instance of the Altera_UP_Audio_Out_Serializer module named Audio_Out_Serializer which handles the serialization and output of audio data. It functions by receiving clock signals, reset signals, and data for the left and right audio channels, as well as information about the space available in the respective FIFOs. The module generates a bit clock, a left/right clock, and controls the enable signals for both channels based on the received data and the rising and falling edges of the respective clock signals. The resulting serialized audio data is output via the serial_audio_out_data signal."
