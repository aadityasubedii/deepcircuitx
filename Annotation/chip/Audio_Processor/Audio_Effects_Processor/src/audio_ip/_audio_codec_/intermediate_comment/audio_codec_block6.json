    "block_comment": "The function of this block of Verilog RTL code is to generate both the rising and falling edges for the Bit Clock (AUD_BCLK) using an instantiated module Altera_UP_Clock_Edge. The main clock signal (CLOCK_50) and a reset signal are passed to this module along with the Bit Clock (AUD_BCLK). As a result, the module provides a rising_edge and falling_edge signal which are active when there is an upward or downward transition in the Bit Clock signal respectively. The Bit Clock edges are then used for synchronous activities in relation to the Bit Clock operation.\n"
