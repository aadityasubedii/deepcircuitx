The block of code signals the completion of automatic initialization. The code implements this by assigning the 'finished_auto_init' signal high (true) once the 'rom_address_counter' equals 'MAX_ROM_ADDRESS', which indicates that the ROM address counter has reached its maximum limit, meaning that initialization of the ROM has been finished.
