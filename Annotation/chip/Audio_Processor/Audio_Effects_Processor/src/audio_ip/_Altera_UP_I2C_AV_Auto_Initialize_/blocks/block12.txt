The block of code acts as a state updater for the I2C auto-initiation process. The block is clock-driven and updates the state of the I2C auto-initiation (s_i2c_auto_init) upon a positive edge of the clock signal. If a reset signal is obtained, it forces the initiation state (s_i2c_auto_init) to transition to status checking state (AUTO_STATE_0_CHECK_STATUS). Otherwise, it simply updates the current state (s_i2c_auto_init) to the next desired state (ns_i2c_auto_init).
