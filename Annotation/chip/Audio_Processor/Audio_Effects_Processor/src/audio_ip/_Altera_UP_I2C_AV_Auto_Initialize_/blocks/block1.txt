This block enables the mapping of a Read-Only Memory (ROM) address to data, which is crucial in defining memory arrays in a hardware description language. The implementation relies on a case statement that depends on the value of 'rom_address_counter'. Each case assigns a specific value (in hex) to 'rom_data' upon the match of the case's value with 'rom_address_counter'. This typically symbolizes specific instruction sets or configurations stored in ROM. In the event of an unmatched address, it defaults to setting 'rom_data' to '26'h1000000'.
