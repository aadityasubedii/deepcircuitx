Module name: Altera_UP_I2C_AV_Auto_Initialize. 

Module specification: The Altera_UP_I2C_AV_Auto_Initialize module operates as an automatic initialization procedure for I2C audio-visual devices. Its functionality includes transitioning through different states to coordinate various conditions, such as sending start and stop bits, transferring bytes, waiting, increasing counters and resetting based on signals and data. 

Input ports include 'clk' for clock signal, 'reset' for resetting the state of the module, 'clear_error' for clearing any initialization error, 'ack' for acknowledgment signal after data transmission, and 'transfer_complete' for indicating the completion of a data transfer. 

Output ports include 'data_out' to output data to an I2C bus, 'transfer_data', 'send_start_bit', and 'send_stop_bit' to control I2C data transfers, and 'auto_init_complete' and 'auto_init_error' to signal the status of the initialization process.

Internal signals include 'change_state' to control state transitions, 'finished_auto_init' to indicate completion of initialization process, 'rom_address_counter' to track the ROM addresses, 'rom_data' to store data fetched from ROM, and 'ns_i2c_auto_init' and 's_i2c_auto_init' to modulate the current and next states of the Finite State Machine (FSM).

The code blocks comprise of a Finite State Machine (FSM) which dictates the sequence of initializing operations, transfer blocks dictating data transfer conditions and flow, and blocks handling error and complete signals. The module essentially handles tasks at a lower layer of the I2C communication protocol, preparing and sending necessary data over the I2C bus to initialize an audio-visual device.
