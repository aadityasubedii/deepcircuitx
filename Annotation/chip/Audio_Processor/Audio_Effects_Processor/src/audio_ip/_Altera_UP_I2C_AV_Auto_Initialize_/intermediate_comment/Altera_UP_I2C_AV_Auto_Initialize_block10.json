    "block_comment": "This block translates the data from rom_data bytes according to the state of the I2C auto-initialization process or performs a reset operation. It uses edge-sensitive always block that checks the state of 'reset', 's_i2c_auto_init' at each positive edge of 'clk'. If 'reset' is high, it clears 'data_out'. However, if 'reset' is low, based on the state of 's_i2c_auto_init', it defines the range of indices for 'rom_data' which is assigned to 'data_out'."
