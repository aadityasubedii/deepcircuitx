    "block_comment": "This code block checks the state of the automatic initialization of the I2C controller. It utilizes a ternary operator to set the 'auto_init_complete' signal high when the state of 's_i2c_auto_init' reaches 'AUTO_STATE_7_DONE'. This indicates that automatic initialization is complete when all seven stages are done."
