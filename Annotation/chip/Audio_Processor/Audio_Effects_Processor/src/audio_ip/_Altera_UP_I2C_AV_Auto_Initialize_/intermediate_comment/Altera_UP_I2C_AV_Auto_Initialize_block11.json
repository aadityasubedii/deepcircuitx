    "block_comment": "The Verilog RTL code implements a state machine for managing the initialization of an I2C interface. The FSM (Finite State Machine) transitions between various states based on certain conditions such as the completion of the auto-initialization, the status of the 'change_state' signal, the 'rom_data' bit states, or the I2C transfer completion status. For example, from the initial state, the FSM checks the status of 'finished_auto_init' and the bit state of 'rom_data[25]' to decide the next state. The states include sending a start bit, transferring bytes, waiting, sending a stop bit, increasing a counter and declaring the procedure done. Each state checks for specific conditions to determine the next state and loops back to the check status state or stays at the same state until the conditions are met for state change."
