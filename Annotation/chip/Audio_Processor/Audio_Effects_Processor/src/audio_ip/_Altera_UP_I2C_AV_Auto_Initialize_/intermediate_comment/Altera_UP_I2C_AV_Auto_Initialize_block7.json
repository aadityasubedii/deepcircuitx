    "block_comment": "The block's function is to control the send_stop_bit signal, which is based on reset and transfer status as well as the state of the s_i2c_auto_init. The implementation is carried out by always triggering at the rising edge of the clock. On assertion of 'reset' or 'transfer_complete', send_stop_bit is de-asserted. However, if neither are asserted and s_i2c_auto_init is in AUTO_STATE_5_SEND_STOP_BIT state, send_stop_bit gets asserted."
