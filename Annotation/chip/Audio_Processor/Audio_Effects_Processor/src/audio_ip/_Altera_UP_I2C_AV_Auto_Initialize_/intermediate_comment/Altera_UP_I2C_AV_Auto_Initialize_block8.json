    "block_comment": "This block maintains the state of the `send_start_bit` signal based on system status. On a rising edge clock event, the block assigns `send_start_bit` a false or true value conditionally. If the system is under a `reset` or `transfer_complete` state, `send_start_bit` is cleared to 0 to halt any start operation. Conversely, if the system is ready to send the start bit (indicated by `s_i2c_auto_init` being equal to `AUTO_STATE_1_SEND_START_BIT`), `send_start_bit` is set to 1 to initiate the transfer."
