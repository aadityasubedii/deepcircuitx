This block of code is used to configure a 400KHz clock generator in a Verilog design. Specifically, it sets the parameters for the clock's counter size and increment value. The counter size is determined by `COUNTER_BITS` which is set to 10, meaning the counter will be a 10-bit value. The increment value `COUNTER_INC` is set to `10'h001`, implying the counter is incremented by a value of 1 in every clock cycle.
