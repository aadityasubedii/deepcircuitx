Comment: 
This block of code is a sequential logic block that controls the data preparation for transfer based on system state and conditions. Whenever a positive edge of a clock signal (CLOCK_50) is detected, this block will react. If 'reset' is active, it sets 'data_to_transfer' to zero and 'num_bits_to_transfer' to zero as well. This effectively prepares the system for a new data transfer. If not in reset state, the block checks 'auto_init_complete'. If 'auto_init_complete' is not set (0), it copies 'auto_init_data' to 'data_to_transfer' and sets 'num_bits_to_transfer' to 7, initializing the data to be transferred.
