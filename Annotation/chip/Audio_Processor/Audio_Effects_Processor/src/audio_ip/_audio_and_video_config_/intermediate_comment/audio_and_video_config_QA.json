            "content": "Name of the module and its functionality is as follows: \nModule name: audio_and_video_config. \n\nExplanation: This module serves the purpose of transmitting audio and video configurations through an I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus. It accomplishes this by interfacing with the Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator, Altera_UP_I2C_AV_Auto_Initialize, and Altera_UP_I2C modules. The module uses an I2C bus to transfer data at a specific clock rate (400KHz). It initiates transmission of data when the auto-initialization protocol is complete. The configurations include parameters for audio line input/output, ADC/DAC path, power, data format, and samples control. These configurations are written to specific addresses in a ROM chip via the I2C bus. The code handles specific conditions of the I2C bus like generating start and stop conditions, acknowledgment, and error handling."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput Ports:\n1. CLOCK_50: This is the input clock signal of frequency 50 MHz. It acts as the main clocking signal for the module.\n2. reset: A digital signal used to reset the state of all internal registers of the module whenever it is high.\n\nInout Port:\n1. I2C_SDAT: This is the data line for the I2C communication protocol. It is bi-directional, meaning that it is used both for transmitting and receiving data.\n\nOutput Port:\n1. I2C_SCLK: This is the clock line for the I2C communication protocol. It regulates the timing of the bits transferred over the I2C data line (I2C_SDAT).\n\nExplanation:\nThe CLOCK_50 and reset inputs are fairly standard for any digital system, regulating its operation and allowing it to recover from errors, respectively. In this context, the reset port resets all the internal states of the module, while CLOCK_50 is used to synchronise the operations occurring within the module. I2C_SDAT is an 'inout' port (i.e., it can serve as both an input and output), acting as the data line for the I2C bus. Meanwhile, I2C_SCLK, the system's output, is the clock signal for the I2C communication, ensuring data transfer is coordinated correctly."
