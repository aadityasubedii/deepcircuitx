    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for the assignment of a start bit for data transmission. The assignment is directly derived from the state of the auto initialization start bit signal. Thus, the 'send_start_bit' is treated as a wire and takes the same binary value as 'auto_init_start_bit'. The functionality and state of 'send_start_bit' entirely depends on 'auto_init_start_bit'. Therefore, any changes in 'auto_init_start_bit' are reflected instantaneously in 'send_start_bit'."
