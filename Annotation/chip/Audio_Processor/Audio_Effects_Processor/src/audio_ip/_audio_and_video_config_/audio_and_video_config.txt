Module-level comment: The module, audio_and_video_config, transmits audio and video configurations via an I2C bus. Utilizing a 50MHz main clock (CLOCK_50) and reset signals as inputs, along with I2C_SDAT and I2C_SCLK lines for data and clock lines, the module handles audio/video settings including input/output, ADC/DAC paths, power, data format and sample controls. Internally generated signals dictate data transfer, start-stop conditions and error handling. Furthermore, the Altera_UP_Slow_Clock_Generator, Altera_UP_I2C_AV_Auto_Initialize, and Altera_UP_I2C modules are used for clock generation, auto-initialization and I2C control respectively with overall operation synchronized by CLOCK_50.
