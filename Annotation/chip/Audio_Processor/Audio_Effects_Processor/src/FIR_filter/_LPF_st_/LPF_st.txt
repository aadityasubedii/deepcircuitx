/*
 * LPF_st: Low Pass Filter using symmetric FIR structure
 * 
 * Implements a 37-tap LPF with:
 * - Tapped delay line for input samples
 * - Symmetric addition to reduce computations
 * - Coefficient multiplication via ROM lookup tables
 * - Pipelined adder tree for accumulation
 * - Control logic for data loading and processing
 * 
 * Processes 24-bit input to produce 35-bit filtered output
 * Uses clock enable for power management
