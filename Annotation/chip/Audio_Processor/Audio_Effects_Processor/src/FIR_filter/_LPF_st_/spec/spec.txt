Module name: LPF_st. Module specification: This module implements a Low Pass Filter (LPF) using a symmetric FIR filter structure with 37 taps. It processes 24-bit input data through a series of delay lines, multiplies with coefficients using lookup tables, and accumulates results to produce a 35-bit filtered output. The module has input ports for clock (clk), reset (rst), 24-bit data input (data_in), and clock enable (clk_en). Output ports include ready-to-load signal (rdy_to_ld), done signal (done), and 35-bit filtered result (fir_result). Key internal signals include tapped delay lines (tdl_0_n to tdl_36_n), symmetric addition results (sym_res_0_n to sym_res_18_n), lookup table values (lut_val_
