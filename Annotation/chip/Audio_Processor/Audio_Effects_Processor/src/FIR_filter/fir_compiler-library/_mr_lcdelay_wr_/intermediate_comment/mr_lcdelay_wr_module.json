    "module": "I'm sorry, but as I've mentioned previously, the provided \"code\" is not a valid Verilog code. It's a string of non-alphanumeric characters which cannot be interpreted as any computer language logic. It's void of any recognizable elements such as module name, inputs/outputs symbols, internal signals and implementation details that could serve as the basis of creating the requested module-level comment. For me to generate a concise and informative comment, I would need an actual Verilog RTL code block. Unfortunately, I can't make any assumptions from this uninterpretable string of characters and generate a comment for a non-existent module. Please provide a valid Verilog RTL code."
