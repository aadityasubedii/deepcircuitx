I apologize for any misunderstanding, but the provided input does not appear to be a valid Verilog RTL code. Instead, it looks like a string of binary or non-text characters. Due to this, it's not possible to generate a detailed specification for a Verilog module, as the requested information such as module name, functionality, input and output ports, internal signals, and overview of different code blocks can't be derived from the given input.

When providing your Verilog RTL code, please ensure it is in ASCII text format and that it accurately represents the structure and functionality of your design. An example of a standard Verilog RTL code is as follows:

```verilog
module adder (input [3:0] A, B, output [4:0] SUM);
  assign SUM = A + B;
endmodule
```

Following this example, the revised specification could look like this:

Module name: adder. Module specification: The 'adder' module is a simple digital circuit design that performs the addition of two 4-bit binary numbers. It has two input ports, 'A' and 'B', which are the numbers to be added, and one output port 'SUM', which holds the result of the addition. This module does not use any internal signals because it directly assigns the sum of 'A' and 'B' to 'SUM'. The overview of the code involves a single instantiation of an assign statement, which performs the summation operation. The module signature is defined at the top of the module, followed by the assign statement, and the endmodule keyword is used to define the end of the module.
