I'm afraid the provided text doesn't appear to be a Verilog RTL code. It seems to be composed of non-alphabetical characters and symbols. To generate a detailed specification of a Verilog module, we would need a valid Verilog code snippet that includes the module name, input/output declarations, and logic implementations, along with any available comments that provide additional context or clarify the function of specific lines of code.

Once you provide a valid Verilog RTL code, I'll then be able to provide a specification in the format you're asking: 

Module Name: 
Module Functionality: 
Input/Output Ports Explanation: 
Internal Signals Explanation: 
Overview and Function of Different Blocks: 

Please verify or rectify the Verilog code provided to continue the procedure.
