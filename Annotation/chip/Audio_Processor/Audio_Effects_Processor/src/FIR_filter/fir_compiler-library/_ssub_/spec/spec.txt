I am unable to extract any meaningful information from the provided Verilog code. It appears to be composed of non-ASCII characters, which makes it unreadable and unprocessable. 

Verilog code should be written in ASCII text and follow proper structure and syntax. Otherwise, it is impossible to deduce the name of the module, its functionality, input and output ports, internal signals, or the roles of different sections in the code.

If you have a valid Verilog code, I would be able to help you process the raw data and transform it into suitable formats. Please provide a readable and valid Verilog RTL code and I would be able to guide you appropriately.
