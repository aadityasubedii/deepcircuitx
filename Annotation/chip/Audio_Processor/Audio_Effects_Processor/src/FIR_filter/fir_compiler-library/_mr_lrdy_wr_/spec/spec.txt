I apologize, but I'm unable to provide a meaningful specification for the module based on the information given. The provided "original Verilog code" appears to be heavily corrupted or encoded, containing mostly non-readable characters and symbols rather than valid Verilog syntax. Without access to the actual, readable Verilog code and proper comments, it's not possible to determine the module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code structure.

To generate an accurate and detailed specification, I would need to see the actual Verilog code in its correct, readable format. If you have access to the uncorrupted version of the code, please share it, and I'll be happy to analyze it and provide a comprehensive specification as requested.
