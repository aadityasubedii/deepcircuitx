The provided Verilog code doesn't appear to be in valid format. To provide a thorough specification for the module, I need a valid Verilog RTL code snippet which includes the module name, its functionality, the input and output ports, the internal signals used within the module, and the blocks or sections in the code. 

Here is an example of a correct format for Verilog Code:
```verilog
module my_module(input wire clk, input wire reset, output reg out);
...
endmodule
```

If you could provide a valid Verilog RTL code, I would be able to create a detailed specification for the module.
