    "module": "I'm sorry, but the provided Verilog code seems to be in an incorrect format, possibly due to incorrect encoding or a mistake in copy-pasting. Without the correct Verilog code, it's not possible to generate a suitable module-level comment that describes its functionality and implementation details. \n\nHere is an example of a typical module-level comment for a valid Verilog code:\n```verilog\n/* \nModule-level comment: This is a simple D Flip Flop module named 'd_flip_flop'. \nIt receives a clock ('clk') and data ('d') as inputs and outputs the data ('q') synchronously with the clock. \nIt also receives a reset signal ('reset'), which resets the output to zero when activated. \nInternally, the implementation uses always blocks for synchronous reset and data update.\n*/\nmodule d_flip_flop (input wire clk, input wire d, input wire reset, output reg q);\n...\nendmodule\n```\n\nCould you please provide a valid Verilog code snippet so I can create a suitable module-level comment for you? Thanks!"
