I'm sorry, but the provided Verilog code seems to be in binary or some other format of encoding. I am unable to extract any information about the Verilog module from the provided code. The code should be in a readable format and / or structured as Verilog RTL code in order to generate the detailed specification.

For example, a correct Verilog RTL code format starts with a module and ends with endmodule. The module opening line should include the name of the module and its inputs and outputs.

```verilog
module moduleName (input [7:0] in1, input in2, output reg [7:0] out1);
...
endmodule
```

After correcting this, I would be able to provide the detailed specification for the Verilog RTL code module.
