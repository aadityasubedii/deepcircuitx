I apologize, but I cannot generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The original Verilog code you shared appears to be corrupted or encoded, containing a mix of non-printable characters, random text, and symbols that do not form valid Verilog syntax. Without proper, readable Verilog code, it's not possible to determine the module name, functionality, ports, internal signals, or code structure. To provide an accurate specification, I would need to see clear, uncorrupted Verilog RTL code with proper syntax, including module declarations, port lists, and actual logic implementation. If you have the correct Verilog code available, please share it, and I'd be happy to analyze it and generate a detailed specification as requested.
