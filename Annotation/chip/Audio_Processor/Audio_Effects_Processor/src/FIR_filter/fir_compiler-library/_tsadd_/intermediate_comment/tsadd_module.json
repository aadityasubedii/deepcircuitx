I would request you to provide a valid Verilog RTL code.\n\nHowever, considering the first given example:\n\n```verilog\nmodule Adder (\ninput [3:0] A,\ninput [3:0] B,\noutput [3:0] SUM\n);\n\nassign SUM = A + B;\n\nendmodule\n```\n\nThe module-level comment for this would be:\n\n```verilog\n// Module-level comment: This is an Adder module, takes two 4-bit inputs A and B, and outputs the 4-bit sum. The functionality is implemented simply using an assign statement to add input operands A and B directly assigning the result to SUM.\n```\nThis is within your specified limit of 100 tokens length and provides a concise overview of the module's design and working operation."
