As mentioned before, the provided text doesn't seem to be a valid Verilog RTL code but rather a garbled or encrypted text. I would request you to provide a valid Verilog RTL code.

However, considering the first given example:

```verilog
module Adder (
input [3:0] A,
input [3:0] B,
output [3:0] SUM
);

assign SUM = A + B;

endmodule
```

The module-level comment for this would be:

```verilog
// Module-level comment: This is an Adder module, takes two 4-bit inputs A and B, and outputs the 4-bit sum. The functionality is implemented simply using an assign statement to add input operands A and B directly assigning the result to SUM.
```
This is within your specified limit of 100 tokens length and provides a concise overview of the module's design and working operation.
