Without a valid Verilog code, it's impossible to determine what the module does, or how it achieves its functionality. A module-level comment requires a well-structured and human-readable Verilog RTL code. It contains some specifics about the module's functionality and its implementation details. Please provide valid Verilog RTL code to proceed."
