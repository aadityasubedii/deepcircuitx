I'm sorry, but the text that has been provided is not valid Verilog RTL code so I can't generate a detailed specification for it. 

To generate a detailed specification for a Verilog module, the code we need should look like this:
```verilog
// This is an example module
module example(input clk, reset, output reg y);

  // Internal signals
  reg [7:0] counter;

  always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset)
      counter <= 8'b0;
    else
      counter <= counter + 1;
  end

  // Output logic
  assign y = counter[7];

endmodule
```
In this case, we have a module named "example" which is a simple 8-bit counter. It has 2 inputs, a clock ("clk") and a reset signal ("reset"). On every positive edge of the clock, unless reset is high, the counter increments by one. The module has 1 output "y", which is the most significant bit of the counter. The internal signal is an 8-bit register "counter".

This is the kind of information I need to provide you with proper module specification. Your input though is garbled and doesn't resemble a Verilog RTL code. Could you please provide a valid Verilog code so I could help you with it? Thank you.
