I'm sorry, but the code you've provided does not appear to be valid Verilog RTL code. It seems to consist mainly of non-printable characters rather than recognizable RTL constructs. Consequently, it is impossible to extract the necessary information to fulfil the tasks you've mentioned.

For an effective analysis and documentation of the Verilog RTL code, we need:

- A valid Verilog RTL module with proper language constructs used per Verilog syntax.
- The presence of recognizable input and output port declarations inside the module.
- Valid internal signals declared using wire or reg.
- Segmented blocks of code serving individual functions.

Once provided with the correct, well-structured Verilog code, we can then proceed to further analyse and generate the required details including name of the module, its functionality, input and output ports, internal signals, and the various blocks of code in the module.
