I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but it seems like the Verilog code you have provided is still unreadable or corrupted. The provided text contains non-ASCII characters that can't be interpreted as Verilog code. Therefore, I cannot generate the detailed specification for the module as requested. Please provide a valid Verilog RTL code so we can proceed further.
