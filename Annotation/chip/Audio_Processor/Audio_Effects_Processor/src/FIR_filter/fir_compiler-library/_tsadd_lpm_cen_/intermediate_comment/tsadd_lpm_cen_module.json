    "module": "I'm sorry for the confusion, but the original Verilog code you provided previously is not recognizable as it is a mix of random characters and symbols. Therefore, I'm not able to generate a module-level comment based on that.\n\nFor a valid Verilog code like below:\n\n```verilog\nmodule top_module (\n    input wire clk,\n    input wire reset,\n    output reg out1\n  );\n\nreg internal_signal;\n\nalways @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin\n    if (reset) begin\n        out1 <= 1'b0;\n        internal_signal <= 1'b0;\n    end\n    else begin\n        out1 <= internal_signal;\n        internal_signal <= ~internal_signal;\n    end\nendmodule\n```\n\nA relevant module-level comment could be:\n\n```text\nModule-level comment: This is the top_module, a simple flip-flop circuit controlled by a reset signal. Upon receiving a reset, it sets 'out1' and 'internal_signal' to low. Otherwise, it toggles 'internal_signal' and reflects its value on 'out1' at each positive clock edge.\n```\n\nI hope the example above is helpful to you! Please provide a valid Verilog code so that I can generate a specific module-level comment for you."
