    "module": "I apologize for the confusion, but the provided Verilog code seems to be unreadable or incorrectly formatted. Normally, module-level comment generation requires understanding of the code's functionality and its implementation details. However, without valid and readable Verilog RTL code, it's not possible to produce a suitable module-level comment. Could you kindly provide the correctly formatted Verilog RTL code so that I can generate an accurate and insightful module-level comment?"
