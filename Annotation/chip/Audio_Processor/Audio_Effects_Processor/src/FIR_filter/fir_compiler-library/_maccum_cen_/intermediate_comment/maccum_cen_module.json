    "module": "Assuming we are referring to the ALU sample Verilog code provided earlier:\n\nModule-level comment: This is the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) module. It performs arithmetic and logical operations on two 32-bit inputs 'A' and 'B', using a 4-bit control signal. Through a case statement, it implements the addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations based on the control signal, writing the result to a 32-bit output 'result'. It is a purely combinational module with no internal state or time-dependent elements."
