Apologies for the misunderstanding but the provided "Verilog code" appears to be corrupted or encoded. It doesn't represent a valid Verilog RTL code. Verilog RTL codes as you may know are usually composed of human-readable ASCII text, not a series of special and non-printing characters. 

To generate a detailed specification from a Verilog module, please provide a valid Verilog code that I can analyze. It should include clear ASCII text that follows Verilog syntax, including a module declaration, input/output port declarations, and logic written inside the module.

For your guidance, here's a sample answer based on another piece of example code:
```verilog
module ALU(control, A, B, result);
  input [3:0] control;
  input [31:0] A, B;
  output reg [31:0] result;
  
  always @(*)
    case(control)
      4'b0000 : result = A + B;   // addition
      4'b0001 : result = A - B;   // substraction
      4'b0010 : result = A * B;   // multiplication
      default : result = 32'b0;
    endcase
endmodule
```
Module Name: ALU. Module specification: The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) module is designed to perform a variety of arithmetic and logical operations. It accepts three inputs - a 4-bit 'control' signal, and two 32-bit inputs 'A' and 'B'. Based on the 'control' signal, it performs addition, subtraction, or multiplication on the inputs 'A' and 'B', and outputs a 32-bit 'result'. The internal logic is handled within a case statement that depends on the 'control' signal. Defaults to zero if the 'control' doesn't match any known operation. The module is purely combinational with no internal state or time-dependent elements.
