Apologies for the confusion, but the code you've provided is not recognizable as Verilog RTL code. It appears to be mishandled, encrypted, or corrupted.

Given valid Verilog RTL code, a detailed specification would follow this format:

Module Name: XXX.
Module specification: This module is designed to... 

Input Ports:
1. input_port1: This input is used for...
2. input_port2: This input is used for...

Output Ports:
1. output_port1: This output is used for...
2. output_port2: This output is used for...

Internal Signals:
1. signal1: This signal is used for...
2. signal2: This signal is used for...

Blocks/Sections of the Code:
1. Initialization section: This part of the code is used for...
2. Computation section: This part of the code is used for...

If you can provide Verilog RTL code that is valid and readable, I'll be able to provide a precise and specific specification for your module.
