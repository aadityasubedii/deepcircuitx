I'm sorry, but the "Verilog code" provided is not recognizable. It's not properly encoded, and it seems like elements of the code are showing up as symbols or gibberish. For the best assistance, please provide the Verilog RTL code in a correct format. As an expert in hardware design, I can provide a detailed specification of the module once the properly formatted code is available.
