    "module": "Since the provided Verilog RTL code is not properly formatted and recognizable, I'm unable to extract detailed specifications or generate meaningful comments.\n\nHowever, I can provide a generic example of how to format comments for a module that is defined in the correct way. Let's take a counter module as an example:\n\n```verilog\nmodule counter (\n    input wire clk,\n    input wire reset,\n    output reg [7:0] counter_out\n);\n\n// This is the register that holds the counter value\nreg [7:0] cnt;\n\nalways @(posedge clk or negedge reset) begin\n    if (!reset) begin\n        cnt <= 8'b0;\n    end else begin\n        cnt <= cnt + 1;\n    end\nend\n\nassign counter_out = cnt;\n\nendmodule\n```\n\nThis could be commented as follows:\n\n**Module-level comment**: This module is a simple 8-bit counter. It increments the counter 'cnt' on every positive edge of the input clock 'clk', and the counter is reset to 0 when the input 'reset' goes high. Its current count value is accessible through the output 'counter_out'.\n\nThis brief module-level comment gives a general overview of the module's function and implementation. \n\nPlease, provide properly formatted Verilog RTL code for me to generate a meaningful and specific comment."
