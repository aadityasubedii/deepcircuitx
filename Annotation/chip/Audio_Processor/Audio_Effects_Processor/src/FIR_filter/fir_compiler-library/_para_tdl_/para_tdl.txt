Since the provided Verilog RTL code is not properly formatted and recognizable, I'm unable to extract detailed specifications or generate meaningful comments.

However, I can provide a generic example of how to format comments for a module that is defined in the correct way. Let's take a counter module as an example:

```verilog
module counter (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    output reg [7:0] counter_out
);

// This is the register that holds the counter value
reg [7:0] cnt;

always @(posedge clk or negedge reset) begin
    if (!reset) begin
        cnt <= 8'b0;
    end else begin
        cnt <= cnt + 1;
    end
end

assign counter_out = cnt;

endmodule
```

This could be commented as follows:

**Module-level comment**: This module is a simple 8-bit counter. It increments the counter 'cnt' on every positive edge of the input clock 'clk', and the counter is reset to 0 when the input 'reset' goes high. Its current count value is accessible through the output 'counter_out'.

This brief module-level comment gives a general overview of the module's function and implementation. 

Please, provide properly formatted Verilog RTL code for me to generate a meaningful and specific comment.
