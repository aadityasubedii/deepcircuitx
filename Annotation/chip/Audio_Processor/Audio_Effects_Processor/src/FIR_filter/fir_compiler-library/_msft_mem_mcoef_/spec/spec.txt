I am sorry, but, as previously mentioned, the provided content does not constitute valid Verilog code. Therefore, I am unable to determine the information required for your request (module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, and various code blocks) based on the existing data. 

To proceed with your request, please provide a correctly formatted, syntactically and semantically valid Verilog module.

Once the proper Verilog code is provided, I would be more than happy to help you analyze and understand it by providing a detailed specification as you requested. Don't forget to share any available comments or available documentation related to the code as it would further help in the analysis and understanding of the code.
