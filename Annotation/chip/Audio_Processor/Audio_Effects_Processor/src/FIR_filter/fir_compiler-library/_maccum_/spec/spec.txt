I apologize for any confusion caused, but it's not possible to generate a specification for the Verilog RTL code you've provided. The given data is garbled and non-readable, and doesn't seem to be valid Verilog RTL code. 

In usual situations, a specification would be generated as follows:

Module Name: [module name] 
Module Functionality: [A detailed explanation of what the module does].
Input Ports: [List of input ports along with their brief description]
Output Ports: [List of output ports along with their brief description]
Internal Signals: [Internal signals used in the module, their purpose and how they influence module operation]
Code Blocks/Sections: [Explanation of the different sections in the code and what each section does]

Unfortunately, without valid and understandable Verilog RTL code, it's impossible to provide you with accurate information. Please provide a valid RTL code segment for further assistance.
