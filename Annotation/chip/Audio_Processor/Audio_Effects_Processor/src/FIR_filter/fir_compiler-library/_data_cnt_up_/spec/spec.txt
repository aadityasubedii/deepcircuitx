I'm sorry, but it's impossible to generate the detailed specification you're asking for. The Verilog code you've provided is not in a correct formatâ€”it appears to be scrambled, binary, or encrypted data, rather than readable Verilog RTL code. 

To provide a schematic description of a Verilog module, we need a valid code with complete infrastructure including the name of the module, output and input ports, functionality of the module, internal signals, and various sections/blocks of the code. In this instance, the data you've provided doesn't contain discernible Information about the module.

Kindly provide a valid piece of Verilog RTL code and I'd be glad to help you understand and transform it into a detailed specification.
