Unfortunately, the provided Verilog code snippet is not valid nor does it depict any recognizable sequence from a Verilog HDL. This appears to be a series of non-programming symbols, which is not processable. As such, it's currently impossible to provide an accurate detailed specification for the module, name it, identify input and output ports, clarify their functionality, determine any internal signals or give an overview of various code blocks and their functions.

A proper Verilog code example would be incredibly beneficial. After receiving a valid code, I could provide a comprehensive specification of the module, stating:

Module name: [...] This module is created to [... (brief description of what the module does)]. The module's input and output ports include [...], which function to [... (explanation of port roles)]. There are several internal signals within the module: [...]. These signals are used to [... (explanation of their functionality)]. The code is broken into sections or blocks that are responsible for various functions, these include [...]. 

Please provide a valid Verilog RTL code example in order to continue with fulfilling the requirements as requested.
