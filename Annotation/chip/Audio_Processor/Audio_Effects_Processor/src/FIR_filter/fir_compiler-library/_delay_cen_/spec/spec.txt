I'm afraid it's not possible to generate a detailed specification for the module as per your request. The Verilog code that you've provided seems to be a garbled/non-readable text. It doesn't adhere to Verilog syntax and it's impossible to identify the name of the module, its functionality, the input and output ports, and the internal signals used, or to provide an overview of the different blocks or sections in the code and their functions based on this text. 

For processing the data correctly, we require correctly formatted, human-readable Verilog RTL code that adheres to the typical syntax and conventions of the language. Once valid code is provided, I would be able to complete your request and provide a detailed specification of the module as outlined in your question.
