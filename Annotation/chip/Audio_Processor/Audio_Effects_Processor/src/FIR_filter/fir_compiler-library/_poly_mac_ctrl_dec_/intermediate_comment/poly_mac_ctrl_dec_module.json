    "module": "I'm sorry, but as stated earlier, the provided \"Verilog code\" is not valid and appears to be scrambled or in an incorrect format. Therefore, it's impossible to generate a module-level comment that accurately reflects the purpose and implementation of the module. Valid Verilog RTL codes typically start with 'module' keyword followed by the module name, ports, and end with 'endmodule'. There would be necessary hardware logic declarations inside. Once you provide a valid Verilog RTL code, I'd be glad to assist with generating a precise module-level comment."
