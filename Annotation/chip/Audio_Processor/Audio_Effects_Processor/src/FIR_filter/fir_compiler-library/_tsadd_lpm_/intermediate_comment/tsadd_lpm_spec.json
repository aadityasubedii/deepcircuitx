The module has two input ports (clk and reset) and one output port (out). The 'clk' port is the clock input, driving the synchronous operations of the module, while the 'reset' port, when set high, resets the counter to 0. The 'out' port provides the current value of the counter. Internal to the module, a register 'temp' is defined to temporarily store the counter state. On each rising edge of the clock or when the reset is high, a combinational logic block updates 'temp': if reset is high, 'temp' is set to zero; else, 'temp' is incremented by 1. Consequently, the module could be separated into the description and initialization of ports, internal signals, and an always block expressing the main functionality.\n\nPlease, provide a valid and readable RTL Verilog code so I can assist you better.",

Hence, I'm not able to generate a detailed specification for the module as your request. \n\nHowever, I'll create a specification based on the example Verilog code I've provided earlier, to show you the format you're seeking:\n\nModule name: counter. \n\nModule specification: The 'counter' module is a simple 4-bit counter designed to increment on each rising edge of an input clock 'clk', assuming no active reset signal. The module has two input ports (clk and reset) and one output port (out). The 'clk' port is the clock input, driving the synchronous operations of the module, while the 'reset' port, when set high, resets the counter to 0. The 'out' port provides the current value of the counter. Internal to the module, a register 'temp' is defined to temporarily store the counter state. On each rising edge of the clock or when the reset is high, a combinational logic block updates 'temp': if reset is high, 'temp' is set to zero; else, 'temp' is incremented by 1. Consequently, the module could be separated into the description and initialization of ports, internal signals, and an always block expressing the main functionality.\n\nPlease, provide a valid and readable RTL Verilog code so I can assist you better."
