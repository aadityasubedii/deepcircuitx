I apologize, but I cannot generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The "original Verilog code" you've shared appears to be corrupted or encoded, containing a mix of non-readable characters and some readable text fragments. It does not resemble valid Verilog RTL code.

To create an accurate and detailed specification, I would need to see clear, readable Verilog code. A typical Verilog module would include:

1. A module declaration with a name
2. Port definitions (inputs and outputs)
3. Internal signal declarations
4. RTL code describing the module's functionality

Without this information in a readable format, it's not possible to determine the module's name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code structure.

If you have a proper Verilog code snippet, please provide it in a clear, text-based format. Then I'd be
