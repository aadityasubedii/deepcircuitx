Apologies for the confusion, but the text string you've shared doesn't seem to be valid Verilog code. It's filled with special symbols and non-readable characters, so it's impossible for me to derive any information regarding the module name, functionality, inputs/outputs, internal signals, or different blocks of the code. 

Please re-post or re-check the shared code, ensuring that it is Verilog RTL code and uses correct syntax. Only then can I help you generate a detailed specification for the module.
