Apologies for misunderstanding, but without the valid Verilog code and detailed specification, it's impossible to generate the module-level comment.

A typical module-level comment could look something like this:
```verilog
// Module-level comment: This module, named MODULENAME, performs FUNCTIONALITY. It takes in INPUTS as inputs, and generates OUTPUTS as outputs. The logic is implemented using a combination of boolean logic and storage elements, with submodules for specific functionality like SUBMODULENAME.
```

However, this is just a general example. To provide a specific comment, I'll need valid Verilog RTL code and the corresponding detailed specification. I will be able to produce a concise module-level comment promptly once these are available.
