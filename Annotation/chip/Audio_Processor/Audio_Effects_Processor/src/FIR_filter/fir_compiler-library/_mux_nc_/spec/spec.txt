I'm sorry, but the provided "Verilog" code appears to be scrambled or encrypted data, not a valid Verilog RTL code. It's not possible to provide a meaningful analysis or a specification based on this. 

I would be able to create a desired detailed specification, once you provide a valid Verilog RTL code.

Just as an additional best practice tip, Verilog code should be written in a legible manner, without obfuscation or encryption, to allow reuse and maintainability. Good Verilog code will also include comments to explain the purpose and behavior of modules and their elements (ports, internal signals, blocks etc.).

If you share valid Verilog RTL code, I'd be glad to help with analysis and generating a detailed specification.
