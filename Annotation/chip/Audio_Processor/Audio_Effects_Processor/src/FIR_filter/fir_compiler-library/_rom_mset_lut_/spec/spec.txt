I apologize, but I'm unable to generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The original Verilog code appears to be corrupted or encoded, consisting of random characters and symbols rather than valid Verilog syntax. Without readable RTL code, it's not possible to determine the module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code structure.

To create an accurate specification, I would need access to proper Verilog code that is correctly formatted and contains valid RTL syntax. If you have a valid Verilog code sample for this module, please provide it, and I'll be happy to analyze it and generate a detailed specification as requested.
