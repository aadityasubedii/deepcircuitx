    "module": "Sure, let's take the below Verilog code as an example.\n\n```verilog\nmodule adder (input [3:0] A,\n              input [3:0] B,\n              output [4:0] Sum);\n              \n  assign Sum = A + B; \n  \nendmodule\n```\nFor this code, here is the corresponding module-level comment:\n  \n**Module-level comment:** This is the 'adder' module, designed to perform addition of two 4-bit numbers. It takes two 4-bit inputs (A and B), and assigns the result of their addition to the 5-bit output called 'Sum'. This operation directly implements the addition using the \"assign\" keyword, allowing for the potential overflow by having the Sum bit-width one bit larger than A and B.\n\nPlease note that we have a constraint here in this task to keep the comment within 100 tokens. So it tries to be as concise as possible while also covering all important points. The details about the module name, functionality, input-output explanation, and implementation are included in the comment."
