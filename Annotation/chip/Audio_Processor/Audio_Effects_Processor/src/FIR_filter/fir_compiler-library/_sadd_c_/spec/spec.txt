I'm sorry, but the content you've provided is not a valid Verilog RTL code. It seems to be some sort of encoded or corrupted text. In order to provide a suitable specification, the RTL code should look similar to a valid Verilog module, such as:

```verilog
module ModuleName (input [3:0] A,
                    input [3:0] B,
                    output [4:0] Sum);
  
  assign Sum = A + B; 

endmodule
```

Therefore, due to the invalid nature of the input, it is currently impossible to generate a detailed specification containing the name of the module, explanations of functionality, details about input and output ports, internal signals, or blocks in your code.
