    "module": "I apologize, but I am unable to generate a meaningful module-level comment based on the information provided. The \"original Verilog code\" you shared appears to be corrupted or encoded, consisting of random characters, symbols, and text fragments rather than valid Verilog RTL code. Without a proper, readable Verilog module definition, I cannot determine the module's functionality or implementation details.\n\nTo create an accurate and informative module-level comment, I would need to see the actual Verilog code with clear module definitions, port declarations, and logical implementations. If you have the correct Verilog code available, please provide it in a readable format, and I'd be happy to analyze it and create a concise module-level comment describing its functionality and implementation."
