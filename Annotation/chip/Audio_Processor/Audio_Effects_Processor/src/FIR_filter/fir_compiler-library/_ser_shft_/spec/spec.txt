I'm sorry but the data you have provided is not valid Verilog code. To generate a concise detailed specification for a module, I require valid Verilog code along with relevant comments if available. Once I have these details, I'd be able to provide a comprehensive specification in the requested format: with module name, its functionality, input and output ports explanations, internal signals purposes, and an overview of different code blocks.

Please supply valid Verilog code for me to assist you further.
