I apologize, but I'm unable to generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The original Verilog code you shared appears to be corrupted or encoded in a way that makes it unreadable. It contains a mix of non-ASCII characters, symbols, and seemingly random text that does not resemble valid Verilog RTL code.

Without access to readable, valid Verilog code, I cannot accurately determine the module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code structure. To provide a detailed and accurate specification, I would need to see the actual, uncorrupted Verilog source code.

If you have the correct, readable Verilog code available, please share it, and I'd be happy to analyze it and provide a comprehensive specification for the module as requested.
