I apologize, but I'm unable to generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The code snippet you've shared appears to be corrupted or encoded in a way that makes it unreadable as Verilog RTL code. It contains many non-ASCII characters and symbols that are not typical in Verilog syntax.

To create an accurate and detailed specification, I would need to see valid, readable Verilog code. A proper Verilog module typically includes:

1. A module declaration with a clear name
2. Input and output port declarations
3. Internal signal declarations
4. Logical operations and assignments
5. Potentially, comments explaining the module's functionality

Without this information in a readable format, it's not possible to provide a meaningful specification that includes the module name, functionality explanation, port descriptions, internal signal explanations, and an overview of the code blocks.

If you have a proper
