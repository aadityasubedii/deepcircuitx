I really apologize but the Verilog code you provided seems to be corrupted or encoded wrongly because it contains non-readable characters and seems not to be proper Verilog code. To provide a proper detailed specification for the module, I need the Verilog code that is readable and valid Verilog RTL code.

Please provide an accurate Verilog RTL code so I can help you to generate a comprehensive and detailed specification for the module including the module name, simple explanation of the functionality, inputs/outputs ports along with their explanations, internal signals names and uses, and description of blocks or sections. In this way, I can help you to structure and organize the specification in a readable and understandable way.
