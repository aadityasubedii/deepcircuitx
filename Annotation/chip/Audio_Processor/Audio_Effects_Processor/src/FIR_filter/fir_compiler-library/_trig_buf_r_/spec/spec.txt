I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but the provided code is not a valid Verilog code. It consists of unreadable, scrambled characters and cannot be interpreted as a hardware design module in Verilog or any other known computer programming language. Therefore, it's impossible to extract any meaningful information about the module's name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or different blocks from the provided code.

A typical Verilog hardware description would look something like this:

```verilog
module exampleModule (input clk, input reset, output result);
    // Code block 1
    // Code block 2
    // ...
endmodule
```

However, the code snippet you've posted does not conform to this or any other known format, making it impossible to provide the information you're asking for. Please recheck the code and provide a valid Verilog RTL code for further assistance.
