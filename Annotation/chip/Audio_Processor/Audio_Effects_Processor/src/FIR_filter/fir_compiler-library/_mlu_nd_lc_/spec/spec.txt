I'm sorry, but it seems there's a misunderstanding. The text you have provided is not in a valid Verilog RTL code format. The Verilog code seems to be corrupted or encoded improperly. Due to that, I am unable to extract the necessary information such as module name, functionality, input and output ports, internal signals, etc. Therefore, I cannot provide the specifications as you've requested. If you provide a proper Verilog RTL code, I would be able to help you with the required information.
