It contains special or non-readable characters. Therefore, I cannot provide information on its input and output ports or their respective roles in the module. \n\nFor a real, valid Verilog RTL code, the input, output ports and their explanations would look something like this:\n\n```verilog\nmodule Calc(input wire [3:0] A, B,\n            output wire [7:0] Sum,\n            output wire OverFlow);\n\n// The rest of your code\n\nendmodule\n```\n\n1. Input ports: A, B. Explanation: These are 4-bit wide input ports that would typically be used as operands for an operation inside the module, such as addition or multiplication.\n\n2. Output ports: Sum, OverFlow. Explanation: 'Sum' is an 8-bit wide output port that is typically used to store and output the result of an operation, such as adding A and B. 'OverFlow' is a single bit output port used to indicate when a computation has resulted in a value that is too large to be represented with 8-bits in 'Sum'.\n\nAgain, please provide accurate Verilog RTL code so I can provide precise detail for your questions."

The provided information contains special or non-readable characters. Therefore, it's impossible to identify any internal signals or provide their respective explanations.\n\nHowever, in a typical valid Verilog RTL code, there would be internal signals used within a module. Here's an example of such a case:\n\n```verilog\nmodule Calc(input wire [3:0] A, B,\n            output wire [7:0] Sum,\n            output wire OverFlow);\n            \nwire [3:0] A_int, B_int;\nreg [7:0] sum_reg;\nassign A_int = A;\nassign B_int = B;\nassign Sum = sum_reg;\n// Insert logic\nendmodule\n```\nIn the provided example, the internal signals are:\n\n1. Internal signals: A_int, B_int. Explanation: These are internal wire variables used to buffer the inputs A and B respectively inside the module.\n2. Internal signals: sum_reg.

It's 8-bit wide, capable of storing a result of an operation, such as the addition of A and B.\n\nI hope this example clarifies your doubts about the internal signals. Could you please provide a valid Verilog RTL code for further and precise analysis?"
