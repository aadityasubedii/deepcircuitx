I'm sorry for any misunderstanding, but the provided data is corrupted and does not contain any Verilog RTL code, as it seems to be composed of random characters and symbols. Thus, it is impossible to generate a detailed specification of the module including info about the module name, explanation of functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, and code blocks.

To help you, we would need valid Verilog RTL code. Please provide a correctly formatted Verilog code snippet reflecting the actual hardware design, then I will be able to provide you with the specification according to the format you requested.

Module name: [module name]. Module specification: [module specification].
