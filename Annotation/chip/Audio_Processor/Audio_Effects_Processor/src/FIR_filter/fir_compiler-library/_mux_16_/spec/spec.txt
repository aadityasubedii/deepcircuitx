I apologize, but I'm unable to provide a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The original Verilog code appears to be corrupted or encoded, containing many non-ASCII characters and symbols that don't represent valid Verilog syntax. Without a properly formatted and readable Verilog code sample, it's not possible to determine the module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code structure.

To generate an accurate specification, I would need a clear, uncorrupted Verilog code sample. A typical Verilog module would have a structure similar to this:

```verilog
module module_name(
    input [width-1:0] input_port1,
    input input_port2,
    output [width-1:0] output_port1,
    output output_port2
);

// Internal signals
reg internal_signal1
