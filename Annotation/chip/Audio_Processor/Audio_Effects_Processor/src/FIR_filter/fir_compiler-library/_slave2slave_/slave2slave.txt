I'm sorry but it's not possible to generate a module-level comment with the provided information. The "Verilog code" given seems to be corrupted or not in a valid format. This makes it impossible to determine the functionality or implementation details of a module. Please provide a valid Verilog RTL code, and I would be happy to help generate a detailed module-level comment.
