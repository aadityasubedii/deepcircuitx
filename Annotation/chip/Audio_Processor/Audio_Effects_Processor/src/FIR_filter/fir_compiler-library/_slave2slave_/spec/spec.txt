I'm sorry for any misunderstanding, but the provided code seems to be in an unrecognizable format or corrupted. The content does not align with the syntax or structure of valid Verilog RTL code, making it impossible to extract the requested information regarding the module name, its functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, and different blocks in the code. Please provide a valid Verilog RTL code so I can generate the detailed specification for you.
