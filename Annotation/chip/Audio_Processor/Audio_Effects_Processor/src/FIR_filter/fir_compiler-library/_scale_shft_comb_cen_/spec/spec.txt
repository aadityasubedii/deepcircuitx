I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided text does not represent valid Verilog code. The text consists of special character sequences and lacks key elements of a Verilog code structure such as `module`, `endmodule`, variable declarations, and logic statements. 

In this scenario, it's impossible to extract and provide a valid module name, functionality, input-output ports, internal signals, or any details about the code structure. The provided text does not resemble any identifiable data or information regarding module's design and operation.

Could you please check and provide a legitimate Verilog RTL code? Then, I would be glad to conduct a thorough analysis, generate a detailed specification, and satisfy all your queries based on that.
