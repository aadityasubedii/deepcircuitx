    "module": "I apologize for any misunderstanding, but as currently provided, the Verilog RTL code seems corrupted or unreadable. This entails that I am unable to generate a concise module-level comment that describes its functionality and implementation details.\n\nIdeally, your request would be completed in the form as:\n\n`Module-level comment: // <module name>: A module for <functionality>. It achieves this via <implementation details>.`\n\nHowever, without valid Verilog RTL code, I cannot fill in the pertinent information (<module name>, <functionality>, <implementation details>). \n\nPlease provide a readable and valid Verilog RTL code so that I can assist you accurately."
