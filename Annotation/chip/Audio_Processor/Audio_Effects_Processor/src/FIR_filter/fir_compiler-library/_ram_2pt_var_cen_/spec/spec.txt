I apologize, but I cannot provide a meaningful specification for the module based on the given information. The provided "original Verilog code" appears to be corrupted or encoded, containing a mix of non-readable characters and some readable text fragments. It does not resemble valid Verilog RTL code.

Without access to proper, readable Verilog code, it's impossible to accurately determine the module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code structure. A valid Verilog module typically includes a clear module declaration, port definitions, and internal logic described using Verilog syntax.

To generate a detailed specification, I would need to see the actual Verilog code in its correct, readable form. If you have access to the proper Verilog code for this module, please provide it, and I'd be happy to analyze it and create a comprehensive specification based on the actual code contents.
