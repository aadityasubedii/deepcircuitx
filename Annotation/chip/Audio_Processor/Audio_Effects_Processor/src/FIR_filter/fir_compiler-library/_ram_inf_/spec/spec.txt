I'm sorry for any confusion, but I am unable to analyze the provided Verilog RTL code snippet. 

The text appears to be garbled or encrypted rather than being valid Verilog RTL code. In order to provide a comprehensive analysis of the code, including module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, and block overview, I would need a correct and readable Verilog RTL code sample.

Given a valid RTL code, the analysis could follow this format: 

Module name: [module name]. 

Module specification: This module is designed to [general functionality]. It includes the following input and output ports: [list and brief descriptions of each port]. Internally, the module uses signals such as [list and brief descriptions of each signal]. The code further bifurcates into various blocks or sections, each with its unique role, such as [list and brief descriptions of each block].

Please provide a valid Verilog RTL code, and I would be happy to offer further assistance.
