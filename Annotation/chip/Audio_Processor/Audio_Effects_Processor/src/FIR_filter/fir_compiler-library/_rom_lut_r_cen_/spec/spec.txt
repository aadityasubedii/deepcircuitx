Apologies for any confusion, but the provided Verilog code seems to be corrupted or improperly formatted. Given the text you've shared, it does not adhere to the common Verilog syntax, therefore it's not possible to analyze a valid module name, its functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or to provide an overview of code blocks and their functions. 

To provide an accurate specification of the module, there is need of a well-formatted, human-readable Verilog code that adheres to proper standards of coding in Verilog. Once such an example is provided, we would be happy to generate a detailed specification for the module based on the criteria outlined in your question. Only then we can follow the requested format: 

Module name: [module name]. Module specification: [module specification]. 

Currently unfortunately, this is impossible due to the quality of provided data, or more precisely, due to lack of proper Verilog code to work with.
