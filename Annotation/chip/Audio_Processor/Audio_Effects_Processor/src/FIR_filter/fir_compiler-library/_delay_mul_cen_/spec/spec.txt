Unfortunately, the "Verilog code" you provided can't be used to generate a specification. It doesn't look like Verilog code - it seems to be a string of random characters. Verilog code should consist of human-readable text that defines the structure and behavior of digital circuits. It often includes terms like 'module', 'input', 'output', 'wire', 'reg', 'always', 'begin', 'end', and other keywords, all of which are missing from your text. 

As such, I'm unable to generate a specification based on the given information. To facilitate efficient assistance, please provide valid Verilog RTL code.
