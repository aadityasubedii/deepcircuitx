    "module": "As I have already mentioned, the Verilog code you've provided is corrupt and unreadable. Hence, it is impossible for me to provide a module-level comment that describes its functionality and implementation details. \n\nIn general, a module-level comment for a readable and correct Verilog code might look like this:\n\nModule-level comment: \"This Verilog module, named `[module name]`, functions to `[describe the function]`. It takes `[input signals]` as input and provides `[output signals]` as output. It utilizes `[internal signals]` to `[describe how these signals contribute to the module functionality]`. The functionality is achieved through the `[describe the blocks or sections and their functions]`.\"\n\nThe supplied `'text'` placeholders need to be replaced by the specific details from your Verilog code. \n\nPlease provide a valid and correct Verilog RTL code snippet so I would be able to assist you in generating the specific module-level comments."
