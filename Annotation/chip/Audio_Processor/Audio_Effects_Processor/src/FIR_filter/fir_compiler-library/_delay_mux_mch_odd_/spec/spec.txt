I'm sorry, but the Verilog code you've provided is unreadable. It seems encoded or corrupted, and as a result, I can't extract any information about the module, its functionality, the input or output ports, any internal signals, or different blocks/sections within the code. 

Please provide a valid and correctly formatted Verilog code for my further analysis and to provide you with a detailed module specification.
