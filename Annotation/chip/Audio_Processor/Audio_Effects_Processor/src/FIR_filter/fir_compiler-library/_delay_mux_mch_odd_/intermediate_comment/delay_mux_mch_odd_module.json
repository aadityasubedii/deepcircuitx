    "module": "As I have mentioned earlier, the issue is that the provided Verilog code is unreadable or seems to be in an encoded or corrupted format. As a result, I am unable to generate a module-level comment that explains its functionality or the implementation details. \n\nPlease provide a valid, correctly formatted Verilog code. Then, I could further analyze it and provide a proper module-level comment or specification."
