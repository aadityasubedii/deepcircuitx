Given valid Verilog code, I could provide detailed specification including module name, functionality, input and output ports, internal signals, and sections in code. \n\nHere's an example of how such details might be provided if given a basic D flip-flop module:\n\nModule name: D_flip_flop. \nModule specification:\nThis module encapsulates the behavior of a D flip-flop. A D flip-flop is a basic storage element used in sequential logic circuits. \nIt has two inputs labeled 'd' and 'clk', and one output labeled 'q'. \nThe 'd' input represents the input data which is to be stored in the flip-flop. The 'clk' input is the clock signal, controlling when the flip-flop should store a new value. \nThe 'q' output then represents the stored data, updated at the rising edge of the 'clk' signal with the value from 'd'. \nThere are no explicit internal signals defined in this module, but the 'always' block implicitly creates a latch that is used to hold the value from the 'd' input until the next rising edge of the 'clk' signal. \nThe module can be divided into two parts: the input-output declarations and the 'always' block. The latter represents the sequential logic of the module, implementing the desired D flip-flop functionality.\n\nIf the provided Verilog codes were decipherable, I would have gladly generate a corresponding specification. For the best results, please provide valid Verilog RTL codes."
