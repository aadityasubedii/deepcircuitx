    "module": "I regret to inform you, but it's not feasible to generate a module-level comment considering the provided Verilog code. As mentioned earlier, the code you've shared is unreadable or encoded, making it impossible to understand what it entails, including the function and implementation details. Therefore, we can't provide an overview comment about the module's operation and design without the readable and decodable Verilog RTL code. Could you provide a clear Verilog RTL code instead so further processing can be done?"
