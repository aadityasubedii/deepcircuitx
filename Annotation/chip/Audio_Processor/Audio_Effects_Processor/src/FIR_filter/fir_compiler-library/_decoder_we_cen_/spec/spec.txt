I'm sorry, but the code you've provided doesn't seem to be valid Verilog RTL code. It consists of various special characters and doesn't adhere to standard Verilog syntax and structure. Hence, it's not possible to generate any module specifications based on it. 

Without a valid code, identifying components such as the module's name, functionality, input and output ports, internal signals, or dissecting the different blocks and their functions within the code is not feasible. 

Please ensure to provide a valid Verilog RTL code for a detailed analysis and module specification generation.
