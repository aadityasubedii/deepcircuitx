    "module": "I'm sorry, but as previously stated, the provided Verilog code is not in a recognizable format. It's impossible to generate a module-level comment without a clear Verilog RTL code that specifies the module's name, functionality, and implementation details. Furthermore, a module-level comment requires knowledge about the content and structure of the module, which the provided code snippet doesn't present. Please provide the correctly formatted and appropriate Verilog RTL code for me to generate a module-level comment."
