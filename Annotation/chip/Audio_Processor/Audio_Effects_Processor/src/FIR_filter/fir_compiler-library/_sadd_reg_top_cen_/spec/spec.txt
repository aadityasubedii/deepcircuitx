I'm sorry, but your provided Verilog code snippet is not valid, it appears to be garbled and non-understandable text. To provide further assistance, I need a valid Verilog RTL code which clearly demonstrates a module's name, functionality, the input and output ports, its internal signals, and the structure of the code. 

Once I have a valid Verilog RTL code, I will be able to generate a detailed specification for the module including all the necessary details such as module's name, its functionality, input and output ports, internal signals and operational blocks within the design. I would then structure it in the required format:

Module name: [module name]. Module specification: [module specification].
