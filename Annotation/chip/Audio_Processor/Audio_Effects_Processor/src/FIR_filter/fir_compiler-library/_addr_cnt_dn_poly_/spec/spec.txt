Apologies for any confusion, but the provided Verilog code is not valid. Actual Verilog code should be human-readable and consist of well-defined structures including modules, port declarations, signal assignments, and comments. The provided code string appears to be corrupted or encoded, which makes it impossible to extract the desired information. 

Hence, a detailed specification for the module couldn't be generated from this corrupted code. Please provide valid Verilog RTL code to proceed with the task. 

Once a valid Verilog RTL code is provided, the structure of the answer will be as follow:

Module name: [module name]
Module specification: [module specification]
This module performs [module functionality]. It has the following inputs and outputs 
- input [input1]: [explanation of input1]
- input [input2]: [explanation of input2]
- output [output1]: [explanation of output1]
Internally, there are following signals:
- [signal1]: [explanation of signal1]
- [signal2]: [explanation of signal2]
In terms of the code structure, it is divided into several blocks, each with a unique function. [Code structure and functionality details]
