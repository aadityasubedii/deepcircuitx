The state change in the counter occurs at the rising edge (also known as positive edge) of this clock signal.\n    \n- `reset`: This is an input signal that is used to reset or clear the counter. On the rising edge of this signal, the `out` signal is reset to `0000`.\n   \n- `out`: This is a 4-bit output signal (representing the count value).
