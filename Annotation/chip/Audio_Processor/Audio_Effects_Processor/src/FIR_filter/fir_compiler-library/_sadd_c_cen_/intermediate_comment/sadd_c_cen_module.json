    "module": "I apologize for the inconvenience, however, as I've previously mentioned, it's not possible to generate a concise module-level comment based on the Verilog code you provided since the code is not valid. It seems to contain corrupted or unreadable characters.\n\nOnce you provide valid Verilog RTL code, I can assist you with creating an appropriate and concise module-level comment. A general example of a module-level comment would be:\n\n\"Module-Level Comment: This `adder` module performs bit-wise addition of two 16-bit input data words (`a` and `b`), outputting the result (`sum`). It achieves its functionality via an always block for addition, executing whenever inputs change.\"\n\nThis example is clear, brief, and accurately reflects both the purpose and implementation of the module, providing a high-level overview of its operation and design. It remains within the 100 tokens limit. \n\nI encourage you to provide valid Verilog RTL code so that I can assist you more accurately."
