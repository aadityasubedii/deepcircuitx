I'm sorry, but the content you've provided is not a valid Verilog RTL code. It's just a series of unreadable characters. I'm unable to extract any meaningful information from it as is. 

It's essential to provide a valid Verilog RTL code with proper comments to generate a detailed specification for the module. For example, here's how information should be provided:

```verilog
//Module: Adder
//This module performs bit-wise addition of two input data words.
module adder(
 input [15:0] a,    // First input data word
 input [15:0] b,    // Second input data word
 output reg [15:0] sum  // output result of addition
);

// Logic for bit-wise addition
 always @(*)
 begin
   sum = a + b;
 end
endmodule
```

This code defines an adder module that performs bit-wise addition of two 16-bit input data words. There are two input ports, 'a' and 'b' that represent the two input data words respectively, and one output port 'sum' which is the result of the addition of 'a' and 'b'. The internal signal is 'sum' whose purpose is to store and output the result of the addition of the two input words. The code's main block is an always block that executes the addition operation whenever there's a change in the inputs.

Please ensure that the provided Verilog RTL code is valid and contains comments for clarity.
