I apologize, but I'm unable to generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The original Verilog code appears to be corrupted or encoded, and does not contain readable RTL code or comments. Without valid Verilog code, it's not possible to determine the module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code structure.

To create an accurate specification, I would need access to the actual Verilog RTL code with proper syntax and comments. If you have the correct, readable Verilog code available, please provide it, and I'll be happy to analyze it and generate a detailed specification for the module as requested.
