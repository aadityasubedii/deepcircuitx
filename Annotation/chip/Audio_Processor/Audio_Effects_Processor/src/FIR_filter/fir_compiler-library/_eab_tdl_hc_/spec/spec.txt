I'm sorry, but the provided Verilog RTL code seems to be in corrupted format, filled with unrecognizable characters. It does not follow the syntax of any known hardware description language. Therefore, I'am unable to give you the detailed specification for the module, including its name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, and an overview of code blocks, as I can't interpret the code. 
Please provide a valid Verilog RTL code and I'd be more than happy to help.
