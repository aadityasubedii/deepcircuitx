I apologize for the confusion, but the provided data doesn't seem to be valid Verilog RTL code. It appears to be corrupted or obfuscated in some way which makes it impossible to extract and interpret the necessary information. As such, I'm unable to generate a detailed specification for the module based on this data.

Please provide a clearly formatted and valid piece of Verilog RTL code if you would like a modular specification generated for it. Ideally, the code should be structured clearly with comments for module functionality, inputs, outputs, and internal signal usage. Once a valid code snippet is provided, I'll be more than happy to assist you with generating a detailed specification for it.

Your understanding and cooperation are highly appreciated.
