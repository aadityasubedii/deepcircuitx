    "module": "I apologize for the confusion, but due to the invalid nature of the provided Verilog RTL code, it's impossible to generate a coherent module-level comment that describes the module's functionality and implementation details. The given data appears to be corrupted or non-readable text, making it impossible to process or interpret.\n\nFor generating a module-level comment, please provide valid, readable, and structured Verilog RTL code with proper comments indicating its functionality, inputs, outputs, and internal signal usages. Hope with the correct inputs I will be able to help.\n\nApologies for the inconvenience, and thanks for your understanding."
