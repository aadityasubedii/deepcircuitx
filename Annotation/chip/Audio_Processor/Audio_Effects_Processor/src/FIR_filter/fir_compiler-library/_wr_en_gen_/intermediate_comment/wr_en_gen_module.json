    "module": "As previously mentioned, the data you have provided appears to be binary or encoded text, and is not human-readable or decodable to Verilog RTL code. It is not possible to generate a module-level comment or a description from this information. A proper Verilog RTL code and its detailed specification are needed to generate a high-level overview of the module's operation and design. The comment should ideally involve an explanation of what the module does and how it achieves its functionality. Providing them would highly help us to assist you in generating the required module-level comment."
