    "module": "I apologize, but I'm unable to generate a module-level comment based on the provided information. The Verilog code appears to be corrupted or encoded, making it unreadable. Without a valid, readable Verilog RTL code, I cannot accurately analyze the module's functionality or implementation details. To provide a meaningful module-level comment, I would need access to the original, uncorrupted Verilog code for the module. If you can provide a clear, readable version of the Verilog code, I'd be happy to assist in creating an appropriate module-level comment."
