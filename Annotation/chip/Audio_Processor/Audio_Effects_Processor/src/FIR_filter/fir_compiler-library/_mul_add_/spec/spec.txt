I apologize, but I cannot generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The "original Verilog code" you shared appears to be corrupted or encoded data, not valid Verilog RTL code. It contains numerous non-ASCII characters and random sequences that do not resemble Verilog syntax or comments.

Without access to the actual, readable Verilog code, it's impossible to accurately determine the module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code structure. A proper specification requires analysis of valid Verilog code.

If you have the correct, readable Verilog code available, please share it, and I'd be happy to analyze it and provide a detailed specification in the format you requested:

Module name: [module name]. Module specification: [module specification].

Once you provide the valid Verilog code, I can give you an accurate and comprehensive overview of the
