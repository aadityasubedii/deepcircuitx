I apologize, but I am unable to generate a concise module-level comment based on the information provided. The "original Verilog code" you shared earlier appears to be corrupted or encoded data, not valid Verilog RTL code. Without access to readable and valid Verilog code, it's not possible to accurately determine the module's functionality or implementation details.

To create an accurate and meaningful module-level comment, I would need to analyze proper Verilog code that describes the module's inputs, outputs, internal logic, and overall structure. 

If you have the correct, readable Verilog code available, please share it. Once you provide valid Verilog code, I'd be happy to analyze it and generate a concise module-level comment that describes the module's functionality and implementation details, keeping it within the 100-token limit as requested.

The comment would then be presented in the format you specified:

Module-level comment: [module-level comment].
