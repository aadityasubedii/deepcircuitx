I'm sorry, but the provided Verilog code is not in a readable format. It seems to be corrupted or encoded in a different format. Please provide a valid and readable Verilog code to generate a detailed specification of the module. The provided code should include the module name, functionality, input and output ports, internal signals, and different blocks/sections present in the module. Only then I would be able to parse and analyze it to provide you with the desired information.
