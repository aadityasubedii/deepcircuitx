I regret to inform you that the provided original Verilog code is in an incorrect format. The given code consists of non-readable characters which cannot be interpreted in the context of a Verilog RTL code. 

In order to generate a detailed specification, I need a valid Verilog RTL code. This includes a valid module definition, accurate I/O port definition, possible internal signals, and logic for the module's operation captured in a structured hardware description language.

Please provide a correct, readable RTL code example and I would be happy to help you generate the specification from that code.
