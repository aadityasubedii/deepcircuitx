    "module": "I regret to inform you that the given original Verilog code is not readable. It consists of non-readable characters which cannot be interpreted into a valid Verilog RTL code.\n\nTo create a concise, accurate module-level comment, I need a correctly formatted Verilog RTL code that has a defined module with clear functionality. The code should include definitions for input and output ports, possible internal signals and registers, and the logic for the operation of the module.\n\nCan you please provide a readable and valid Verilog RTL code so I can help you generate the module-level comment?"
