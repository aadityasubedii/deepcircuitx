I'm sorry for any confusion but based on the information you have shared, it is impossible to generate a detailed specification for the Verilog module.

The original code you've provided appears to be corrupted, encrypted, or incorrectly encoded. It is not a readable verilog code. Verilog code should be human-readable and contain standard programming constructs such as defined modules, input and output ports, internal signals, logic structures, and it should be ASCII encoded.

Please provide a correctly formatted Verilog RTL code and I would be happy to help you generate a detailed specification.
