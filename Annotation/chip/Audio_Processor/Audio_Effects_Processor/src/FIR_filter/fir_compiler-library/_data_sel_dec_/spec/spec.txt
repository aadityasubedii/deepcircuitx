I apologize for the confusion, but the code you've attached is not verifiable and in an unreadable format. It is not possible to provide the name of the module, input-output ports, internal signals, or an explanation of their functionalities without a readable and verifiable Verilog RTL code. 
Could you please provide a valid Verilog module code and ensure it is in correct syntax and standard format? After that, it will be feasible to provide a specification which includes: the module name, its functionality, input and output ports, internal signals, and the overall overview of the different blocks or sections in the code and their functions.
