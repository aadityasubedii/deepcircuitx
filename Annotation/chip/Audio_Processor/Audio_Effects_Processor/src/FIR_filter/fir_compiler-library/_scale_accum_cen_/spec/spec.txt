I'm sorry, but the provided text does not contain readable Verilog code. The characters appear to be in a corrupted format, or in a non-human-readable coding or encryption. Thus, it's impossible to extract/reframe any information such as 
1. the name of the module,
2. explanation of the module's functionality, 
3. input and output ports,
4. internal signals used,
5. different blocks or sections in the code and their functions.

In order to provide a detailed specification for the module, valid Verilog RTL code is required where I can extract the module name, its functionality, input-output ports, and internal signals from the actual RTL code and its comments.

Following is a correct example of how I would provide the specification given a valid Verilog RTL code.

Example:

*Module name*: AND_gate. 
*Module specification*: The AND_gate module performs a logical AND operation. The module has two inputs: 'a' and 'b', which are the signals to be ANDed together and one output: 'y', which is the result of the AND operation. There are no internal signals used in this module. The module consists of a single assignment statement that performs the AND operation, ensuring the output 'y' corresponds to the logical AND of input signals 'a' and 'b'. 

But without valid Verilog RTL code with useful comments this proper extraction of module specification is not possible.
