I apologize, but I'm unable to generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The code you've shared appears to be corrupted or encoded, containing many non-ASCII characters and symbols that don't represent valid Verilog syntax. Without readable, valid Verilog code, it's not possible to accurately determine the module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code structure.

To provide a proper specification, I would need to see the original Verilog code in a readable format. A valid Verilog module typically starts with the "module" keyword, followed by the module name, port list, and then the module implementation with clear signal declarations and logic.

If you can provide the Verilog code in its original, uncorrupted form, I'd be happy to analyze it and generate a detailed specification as requested, including the module name, functionality explanation, input/output ports, internal
