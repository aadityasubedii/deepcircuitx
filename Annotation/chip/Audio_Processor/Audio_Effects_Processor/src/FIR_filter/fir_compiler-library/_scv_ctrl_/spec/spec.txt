I’m sorry, but the Verilog RTL code provided above is corrupted or inappropriately encoded. Therefore, I cannot extract the details like the module name, its functionality, input and output ports, internal signals, or any other block of codes from it. It’s not possible to create any detailed specifications for the module without a valid and correctly formatted code. Please ensure the Verilog RTL code you provide is correctly formatted and clear.
