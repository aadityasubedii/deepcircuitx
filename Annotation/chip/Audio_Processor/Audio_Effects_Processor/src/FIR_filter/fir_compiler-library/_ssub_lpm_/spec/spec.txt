I'm sorry but the text you provided appears to be either garbled or encrypted data, and definitely not a valid Verilog RTL code. Without a proper readable Verilog RTL code, I can't provide a detailed specification of a module, its functionality, input-output ports, internal signals and partitioning/structuring of the code. Please ensure to provide a valid Verilog RTL code.
