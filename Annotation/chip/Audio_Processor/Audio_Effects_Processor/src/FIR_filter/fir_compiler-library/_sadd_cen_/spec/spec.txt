I'm sorry but the information you provided seems to be encoded or corrupted data rather than valid Verilog RTL code. If you provide the valid Verilog RTL code, I'd be able to help generate a detailed specification for the module including the module's name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, as well as overview of different blocks or sections in code and their functions. A valid Verilog RTL code should look something similar to this example:

```verilog
module ADDER (input [3:0] Operand_A, Operand_B, output [3:0] Result);
    assign Result = Operand_A + Operand_B;
endmodule
```

Once the valid Verilog code is provided, I will be able to fill the specification in the following format:

Module name: [module name]. Module specification: [module specification].
