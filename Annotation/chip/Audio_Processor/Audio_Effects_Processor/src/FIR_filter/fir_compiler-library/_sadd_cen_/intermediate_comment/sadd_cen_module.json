    "module": "As I noted earlier, the information you provided isn't a valid Verilog code. To construct a precise module-level comment, I'd need the valid Verilog RTL code. Once you provide that, I can generate a comment that describes its functionality and implementation details.\n\nHowever, based on the previous AND_GATE example I can provide a comment in the desired format:\n\nModule-level comment: \"This AND_GATE module performs a bitwise AND operation on two inputs. It has two input ports ('input1' and 'input2') and one output port ('output1'). The output is computed as the bitwise AND of the two input ports directly within the assign statement.\"\n\nThis outlines the functionality (the AND operation) and the implementation (how it uses the inputs and outputs to perform the AND operation). It's clear and concise and under 100 tokens. Please provide the correct Verilog code and I can generate a more applicable comment."
