I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The provided text appears to be encoded or scrambled and it doesn't resemble any Verilog RTL code. To generate a detailed specification for the module, we need a valid Verilog RTL code which usually includes structures such as modules, input/output ports, assign, initial, always blocks, etc. 

Unfortunately, without valid Verilog RTL code, it's impossible to provide the requested information including:

1. The name of the module.
2. A simple explanation of the module's functionality.
3. The input and output ports.
4. The internal signals used within the module.
5. An overview of the different blocks or sections in the code and their functions.

Please ensure the provided Verilog RTL source code is valid and unencoded. Once the correct Verilog RTL code is provided, we can generate a detailed specification for the module.
