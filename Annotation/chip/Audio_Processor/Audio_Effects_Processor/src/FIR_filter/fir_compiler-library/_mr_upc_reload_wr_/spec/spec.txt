I'm sorry, but the given "Verilog code" is not proper, and no valid information can be extracted from it. It seems to contain unsupported and non-standard characters. It is not actual Verilog RTL, which is used to describe the hardware structure and data flow of a circuit. 

The Verilog RTL code should include keywords such as `module`, `input`, `output`, `wire`, `reg` etc., along with structural and behavioural constructs. Therefore, it's not possible to produce a module name or specification from this. We would need valid Verilog RTL code for that. It's essential to provide valid Verilog code to get accurate analysis and answers for modules' name, functionality, input & output ports, internal signals, and an overview of the code's blocks or sections.

Please provide valid Verilog RTL for further assistance.
