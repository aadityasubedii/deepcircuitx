Kindly provide a proper Verilog RTL code in text format for us to proceed with the generation of a module specification. \n\nThe example looks similar to this format below:\n```verilog\nmodule counter (\n    input wire clk,\n    input wire rst,\n    output reg [7:0] count\n);\n    \n    // When reset signal is high, counter is in initial state\n    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin\n        if (rst) \n            count <= 8'b0;\n        else \n            count <= count + 1;\n    end\nendmodule\n```\n\nFor this code, a specification would be:\n\nModule name: Counter. \nModule specification: The Counter module is a simple up-counter synchronized with an input clock signal, `clk`. The counter increments its `count` of 8-bit value on each positive edge of the clock unless the reset signal, `rst`, is high. When `rst` is high, then `count` is reset to 0. This counter effectively operates based on the clock signal's positive edges and reset signal's state, providing a digital count output."
