    "module": "As previously stated, the provided Verilog code is not valid or readable. As your fellow expert in hardware design, I find it impossible to generate a module-level comment that describes both the functionality and implementation details of your module. \n\nPlease provide us with valid and correctly formatted Verilog RTL code, so I can help you generate a module-level comment according to your specifications. \n\nFurthermore, for the best possible outcome, try to ensure the code is well-commented, well-organized, concise, and accurately describes the module and its operation. This will make it easier for both the model and human developers to understand the code."
