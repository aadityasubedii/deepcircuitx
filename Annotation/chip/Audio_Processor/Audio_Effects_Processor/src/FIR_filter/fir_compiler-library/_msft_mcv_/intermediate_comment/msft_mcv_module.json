    "module": "I apologize, but I'm unable to generate a module-level comment based on the information provided. The Verilog code you shared appears to be corrupted or encoded, containing many non-ASCII characters and not resembling valid Verilog syntax. Without readable, valid Verilog code, it's impossible to accurately describe the module's functionality or implementation details.\n\nTo create a meaningful module-level comment, I would need access to the actual, uncorrupted Verilog source code. A proper Verilog module typically includes a module declaration, input and output port definitions, internal signal declarations, and the logic implementation.\n\nIf you have the correct Verilog code available, please share it, and I'd be happy to help you create a concise and accurate module-level comment that describes what the module does and how it achieves its functionality.\n\nModule-level comment: [Unable to generate due to unreadable code]"
