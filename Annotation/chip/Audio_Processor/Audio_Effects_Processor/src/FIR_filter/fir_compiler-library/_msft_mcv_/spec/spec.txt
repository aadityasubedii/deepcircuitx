I apologize, but I'm unable to generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The code you've shared appears to be corrupted or encoded in a way that makes it unreadable as Verilog RTL code. It contains many non-ASCII characters and does not resemble valid Verilog syntax.

To create a proper specification, I would need to see the actual, uncorrupted Verilog source code. A typical Verilog module would include a module declaration, input and output port definitions, internal signal declarations, and the logic implementation.

If you have the correct Verilog code, please share it, and I'd be happy to help you create a detailed specification including the module name, functionality explanation, input/output ports, internal signals, and an overview of the code structure.
