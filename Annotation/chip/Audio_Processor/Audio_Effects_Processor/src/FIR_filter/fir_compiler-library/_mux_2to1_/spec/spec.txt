I'm sorry, but the provided text is not a verifiable Verilog code. Verilog code has a specific syntax that includes keywords such as `module`, `input`, `output`, `wire`, `reg`, etc., along with ASCII characters. 

The text you have provided seems to be a string of unrecognizable and non-ASCII symbols and characters. 

Here is an example of how a proper verilog code looks like:

```verilog 
module adder(input wire [3:0] a, b, 
             output wire [3:0] sum,
             output wire carry);
    assign {carry,sum} = a + b;
endmodule
```

In this example:

Module name: adder. Module specification: This module implements a 4-bit adder. It has two 4-bit inputs: a and b. The sum of a and b is placed on the 4-bit output named sum, and the output carry signals if there was an overflow in the addition operation. 

Without a valid Verilog code, it's impossible to generate the detailed specification you requested. Please provide an appropriate Verilog code.
