    "module": "As mentioned in my previous responses, the provided Verilog code isn't valid and readable, which prevents me from analyzing it and generating a module-level comment. Once a valid, readable RTL Verilog code is provided, I could generate a module-level comment, which would essentially capture a summary of what the module does and how it achieves its functionality. The typical format would look like:\n\nModule-level Comment: \"This module is designed to perform *functionality*. It accomplishes this by *implementation details*.\"\n\nUnfortunately, without a clear, readable Verilog code, I can't fill out this template."
