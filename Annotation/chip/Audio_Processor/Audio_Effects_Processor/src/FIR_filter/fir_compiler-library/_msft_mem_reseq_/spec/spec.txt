I'm sorry for any misunderstanding, but as mentioned earlier, the provided code snippet is not a valid Verilog code and seems to be unreadable or possibly encrypted. Therefore, I'm unable to generate a detailed specification for the module as you requested. 

Once a valid, readable RTL Verilog code is provided, I will be able to provide a detailed specification, including the module name, functionality, input and output ports, internal signals, and an overview of the different blocks or sections in the code.

Typically, the format would look like:

Module Name: *Module name goes here*

Module Specification: This module is designed to *high level explanation of what the module does goes here*. The input ports are *list of input ports along with a brief explanation of each goes here*. The output ports are *list of output ports along with a brief explanation of each goes here*. The module uses several internal signals, including *list of internal signals along with a brief explanation of their purpose goes here*. The module consists of several blocks or sections including *list and brief explanation of different blocks or sections goes here*.

But unfortunately, I can't fill out this template without a clear, readable Verilog code.
