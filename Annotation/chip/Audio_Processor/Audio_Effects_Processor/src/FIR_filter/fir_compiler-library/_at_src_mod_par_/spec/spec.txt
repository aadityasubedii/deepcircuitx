I apologize, but I'm unable to generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The original Verilog code appears to be corrupted or encoded, containing many non-ASCII characters and symbols that don't represent valid Verilog syntax. Without access to the actual, readable Verilog RTL code, I cannot accurately identify the module name, its functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code blocks.

To provide a comprehensive and accurate module specification, I would need to see the correct, readable Verilog code. If you have a clean, text-based version of the Verilog RTL code, please share that instead. Once I have access to the proper code, I'd be happy to analyze it and provide a detailed specification in the format you requested:

Module name: [module name]. Module specification: [module specification].

This specification would include all the elements you've requested: the module
