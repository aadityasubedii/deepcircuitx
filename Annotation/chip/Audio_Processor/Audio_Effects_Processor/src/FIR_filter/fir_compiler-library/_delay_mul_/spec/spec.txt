I'm sorry for any misunderstanding, but the text provided as 'original Verilog code' doesn't contain any valid RTL Verilog code. It appears to be a sequence of random symbols and unidentifiable characters, none of which could be interpreted in the context of Verilog syntax. 

Therefore, it's impossible to generate a detailed specification for the module, including its name, functionality, input and output ports, internal signals, or distinct blocks within the code. 

To provide meaningful help, I would need correctly formatted Verilog that follows a structure similar to the below example:

```verilog
module MyModule(input wire i1, output wire o1);
    wire internalSignal;
    // ... code here ...
endmodule
```

In this case, I can provide a breakdown like:

Module name: MyModule. 
Module specification: This module takes an input `i1` and produces an output `o1`. Internally, it uses a wire named `internalSignal` to perform its operations. 

Please provide valid Verilog RTL code, so that we can generate a useful and practical module specification.
