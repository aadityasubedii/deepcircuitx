I'm sorry for misunderstanding, but the provided Verilog RTL code seems to be not valid. It shows a stream of undefined characters and symbols that don't make up valid Verilog RTL code. Due to this, I cannot identify the module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals and blocks or sections of the code. The provided information isn't suitable for generating module specification. Please provide a valid Verilog RTL code for further processing.
