    "module": "I'm sorry but as I mentioned earlier, the provided Verilog RTL code is not valid. It's written in an undefined format making it incomprehensible. As such, it's impossible to generate a module-level comment without accurate and readable Verilog RTL code.\n\nTo give you an idea, a module level comment format might look like this:\n\nModule-level comment: \n```\n/*\nModule Name: <module_name>\nPurpose: This module's role is to <functionality>.\nImplementation: This is achieved by employing <mechanism> to ... \nInputs: <input_port_names> - brief explanation\nOutputs: <output_port_names> - brief explanation\n*/\n```\nThis needs to be filled in with the appropriate data from the valid Verilog code. However, given the invalid Verilog RTL code provided, it's impossible to generate this at the moment.\n\nPlease provide the module's valid and correct Verilog RTL code in order to provide detailed specifications and comments."
