I'm sorry, but there is a misunderstanding. The provided content is not recognizable as Verilog RTL code. It appears to be encrypted or corrupted. Normally, Verilog code is written in plain text and can be interpreted easily. It's impossible to provide module name, functionality, its ports, internal signals, or its blocks on based the provided content.

You are asked to provide a valid Verilog source code, here's an example on how it should look like:

```verilog
module multiplier (
    input wire [7:0] a,
    input wire [7:0] b,
    output reg [15:0] product
);
    initial begin 
        product = a * b;
    end
endmodule
```

In the example given, the module name is 'multiplier', it takes two 8-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', performs multiplication and provides 16-bit 'product' as output.

PLEASE NOTE: This will only be possible if you provide a valid and correctly formatted Verilog RTL code. Please provide a valid source code to continue.
