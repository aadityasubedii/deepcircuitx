I apologize, but I cannot generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The text you've shared as "Original Verilog code" is not valid Verilog RTL code. It appears to be binary or encoded data rather than human-readable Verilog syntax.

To create a proper specification, I would need to see actual Verilog code containing:

1. A module declaration
2. Input and output port definitions
3. Internal signal declarations
4. The logic implementation of the module
5. Proper Verilog syntax and keywords

Without this information, it's not possible to determine the module's name, functionality, ports, internal signals, or code structure. If you have a valid Verilog RTL code snippet that you'd like me to analyze and create a specification for, please provide that, and I'd be happy to help.
