I'm sorry, but the Verilog code provided is not written in a comprehensible format. It consists of non-readable, non-decipherable symbols and characters. I'm unable to extract a module's name, its functionality, the input and output ports, the internal signals, or the structures and blocks present within the code. 

In a standard scenario, the format for the information you requested would be something as follows:

Module Name: Adder
Module specification: This module performs a simple binary addition operation.

Inputs: 
1. a[3:0] - A 4-bit binary number.
2. b[3:0] - Another 4-bit binary number.

Outputs: 
1. sum[3:0] - The 4-bit sum of a and b.
2. carry_out - The carry output from the addition.

Internal Signals: 
1. carry[3:0] - An internal signal to store the carry from each bit addition. 

Blocks:
1. For loop block to perform bit by bit addition and carry propagation. 

Please provide a valid, comprehensible Verilog RTL code, from which I can extract this information effectively.
