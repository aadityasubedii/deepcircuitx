I'm sorry, but the provided text is not intelligible Verilog RTL code. This text seems to be either scrambled or corrupted and would not be able to serve as input for any module recognition, functionality analysis or explaining its ports and signals. 

For your requested format to be filled correctly, a valid Verilog code is required. The piece of code should be in RTL (Register Transfer Level) style and contain clearly defined modules, ports, and descriptions (using comments in the code).

Here's the structure you should follow:

Module name: `<module_name>`
Module specification: `<module_spec>`

Inputs: 
- `<input1>` : `<description>`
- `<input2>` : `<description>`

Outputs: 
- `<output1>` : `<description>`
- `<output2>` : `<description>`

Internal signals:
- `<signal1>` : `<description>`
- `<signal2>` : `<description>`

Code Blocks:
- `<block1>` : `<description>`
- `<block2>` : `<description>`

This format helps to provide a detailed overview of the module's design and operation. However, valid and properly commented Verilog RTL code is a must to accurately fill the information details. 

Please provide appropriate RTL code adhering to the Verilog language syntax for further assistance.
