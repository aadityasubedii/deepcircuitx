Apologies for the confusion, but based on the Verilog RTL code you've provided, it's impossible to generate a detailed specification for the module in line with your request. 

The code you've provided appears as a sequence of unreadable characters. It doesn't follow the accepted syntax or format of Verilog code and so we can't identify any module names, functionalities, input/output ports, or internal signals with their corresponding explanations, let alone different sections in the code and their functions.

However, in terms of structure, the overview would be something like this if a proper Verilog code was provided:
Module name: [module name]
Module specification: This module serves the function of [simple explanation of the module's functionality]. It operates with the input ports [input ports] which represent [explanation of input ports] and the output ports [output ports] which serve [explanation of output ports]. The module includes the internal signals [internal signals], utilized for [purpose of the signals]. This code comprises several blocks or sections including [blocks or sections, and their functions].

Please, check the provided code again and ensure it's a valid and readable Verilog RTL code.
