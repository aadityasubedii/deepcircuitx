Unfortunately, the provided text does not represent a valid Verilog RTL code. The characters provided do not form a recognizable code, and therefore a detailed specification for the module, including the module name, its functionality, the input and output ports, internal signals, and description of the different blocks or sections, cannot be derived. 

If valid Verilog code were provided, the format of the analysis would be something like:

Module name: [module name]. 
Module specification: This module performs [simple explanation of functionality]. It uses input ports [list of input ports] which serve to [explanations of input ports], and output ports [list of output ports] which serve to [explanations of output ports]. This module also utilizes internal signals such as [internal signals] for the purpose of [their purposes]. The code can be divided into several blocks including [blocks or sections] each with unique functions [explanations of functions].

Please provide a valid Verilog RTL code for a comprehensive and detailed analysis.
