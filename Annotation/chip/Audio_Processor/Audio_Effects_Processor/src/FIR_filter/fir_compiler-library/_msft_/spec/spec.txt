I apologize, but I cannot generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The original Verilog code appears to be corrupted or encoded, containing many non-ASCII characters and symbols that are not valid Verilog syntax. Without being able to parse and interpret the actual Verilog code, it's not possible to accurately determine the module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code structure. To provide a meaningful specification, I would need a valid, readable Verilog code sample. If you have the original, uncorrupted Verilog code, I'd be happy to analyze it and provide a detailed specification for the module.
