I apologize, but I'm unable to generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The content you've shared appears to be encoded or encrypted, and does not contain readable Verilog RTL code or comments. Without access to properly formatted Verilog code, I cannot identify the module name, its functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code blocks.

If you have the original, unencoded Verilog code available, please share that instead, and I'll be happy to analyze it and generate a detailed specification in the format you've requested:

Module name: [module name]. Module specification: [module specification].

Once I have access to the proper Verilog code, I can provide an accurate and comprehensive
