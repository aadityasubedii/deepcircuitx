Apologies for the confusion, but as stated earlier, the provided Verilog code is unreadable due to its formatted or encrypted state, preventing me from rendering a specific module-level comment.

However, assuming you have the valid Verilog RTL code and a detailed specification, you can generate a module-level comment like the following example:

Input (tokenized):
```verilog
module AND_GATE(input wire a, input wire b, output wire z);
assign z = a & b;
endmodule
```
Output (Comment):
```verilog
/*
 * Module-level comment: This is the AND_GATE module. It performs a logical 'AND' 
 * operation on two single-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', and the result is output on 'z'.
 * The functionality is achieved through continuous assignment statement (assign z = a & b;)
 * which means the output 'z' always mirror the 'AND' operation result of 'a' and 'b'.
 */
```
This is just an example. For the actual task, the comments will need to be specifically tailored to the operational details of your Verilog RTL code.
