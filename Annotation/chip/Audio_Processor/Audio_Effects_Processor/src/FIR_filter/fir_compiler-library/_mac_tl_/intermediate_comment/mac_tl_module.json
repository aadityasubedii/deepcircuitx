    "module": "Apologies for the confusion, but as stated earlier, the provided Verilog code is unreadable due to its formatted or encrypted state, preventing me from rendering a specific module-level comment.\n\nHowever, assuming you have the valid Verilog RTL code and a detailed specification, you can generate a module-level comment like the following example:\n\nInput (tokenized):\n```verilog\nmodule AND_GATE(input wire a, input wire b, output wire z);\nassign z = a & b;\nendmodule\n```\nOutput (Comment):\n```verilog\n/*\n * Module-level comment: This is the AND_GATE module. It performs a logical 'AND' \n * operation on two single-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', and the result is output on 'z'.\n * The functionality is achieved through continuous assignment statement (assign z = a & b;)\n * which means the output 'z' always mirror the 'AND' operation result of 'a' and 'b'.\n */\n```\nThis is just an example. For the actual task, the comments will need to be specifically tailored to the operational details of your Verilog RTL code.\n"
