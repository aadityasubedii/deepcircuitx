I apologize for the confusion, but the provided data is not recognizable as Verilog RTL code. It appears to be a string of special characters and symbols, not a Verilog code. Therefore, I can't provide the requested details such as module name, its functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, and code blocks. 

The usual structure to provide such details from a valid Verilog code would look like the following:

1. Module name: [module name]
2. A simple explanation of the functionality: [functionality]
3. The input and output ports: [input/output ports] -> each with a brief explanation 
4. The internal signals used within the module: [internal signals] -> each with a brief explanation of their purpose
5. An overview of the different blocks or sections: [code blocks or sections] -> their function explained

Before proceeding, please provide a valid Verilog RTL code to accurately generate such an overview.
