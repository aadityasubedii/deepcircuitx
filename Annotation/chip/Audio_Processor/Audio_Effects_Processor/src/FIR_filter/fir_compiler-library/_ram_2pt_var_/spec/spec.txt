I apologize, but I cannot generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The content you've shared appears to be corrupted or encoded data, not valid Verilog RTL code. Without access to the actual Verilog code, it's impossible to accurately identify the module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code blocks.

To create a proper specification, I would need to see the original, uncorrupted Verilog code. This code should include clear module definitions, port declarations, signal assignments, and logic implementations. Once provided with valid Verilog RTL code, I'd be happy to analyze it and generate a comprehensive specification as requested.

In the absence of proper code, I cannot provide any meaningful information about the module's design or operation. If you have access to the correct Verilog code, please share it, and I'll be glad to help you create a detailed specification
