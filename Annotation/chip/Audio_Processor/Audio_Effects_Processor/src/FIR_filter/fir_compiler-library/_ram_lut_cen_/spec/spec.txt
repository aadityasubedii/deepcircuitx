I'm afraid the information provided is not in the form of a valid Verilog code and doesn't provide the necessary information to derive the module name, its functionality, or any input/output ports or internal signals. The Verilog code consists of special non-alphanumeric characters, which make it essentially unreadable and impossible to analyze. 

In order to generate the detailed specification you are requesting, I would need a valid Verilog code. The valid Verilog code should be in a proper syntax that includes the name of the module, functionality of the module, descriptions of input/output ports, internal signals, and different blocks or sections in the code.

Once the valid Verilog code is given, I would be able to provide the details in the format you requested, such as:
Module name: [module name]. Module specification: [module specification].
