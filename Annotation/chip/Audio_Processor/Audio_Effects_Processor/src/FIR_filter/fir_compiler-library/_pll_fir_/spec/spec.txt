I apologize, but I'm unable to provide a detailed specification for the module based on the given information. The code you've shared appears to be corrupted or encoded, containing non-readable characters and fragments that do not resemble valid Verilog RTL code. Without access to properly formatted, readable Verilog code, it's not possible to accurately determine the module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code structure.

To generate a meaningful specification, I would need to see the correct, readable version of the Verilog RTL code for this module. If you have the proper code available, please share it, and I'll be happy to analyze it and provide a comprehensive specification as requested.
