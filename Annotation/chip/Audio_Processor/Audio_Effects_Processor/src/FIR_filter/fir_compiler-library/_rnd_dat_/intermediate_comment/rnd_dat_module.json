    "module": "Unfortunately, as I've said earlier, the provided code is not a valid Verilog RTL code hence it's impossible to provide a concise module-level comment. In Verilog RTL code, commentary is usually included as brief explanations of the code's functionality and implementation details.\n\nHowever, for a functional code such as:\n\n```verilog\nmodule example(input i1, input i2, output o1);\n    wire w1;\n    assign w1 = i1 & i2;\n    assign o1 = w1;\nendmodule\n```\n\nA potential module-level comment could look like:\n\n\"Module-level comment: This 'example' module takes two inputs (i1 and i2), performs a bitwise AND operation on them using an internal wire (w1), and assigns the result to the output (o1). The code is straightforward with the use of 'assign' statements to accomplish the desired functionality.\"\n\nPlease provide a valid Verilog RTL code for me to generate a module-level comment specific to that code."
