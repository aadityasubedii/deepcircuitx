I apologize, but I'm unable to generate a detailed specification for the module based on the provided information. The "original Verilog code" you shared appears to be corrupted or encoded data rather than readable Verilog RTL code. Without access to the actual, readable Verilog code and its associated comments, I cannot accurately determine the module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code structure.

To provide a comprehensive and accurate module specification, I would need the correct, readable Verilog RTL code. If you have the actual Verilog code available, please share it, and I'll be happy to analyze it and generate a detailed specification as requested.
