The provided Verilog code seems to be of invalid format. It is not possible to identify a legitimate Verilog RTL code pattern in the text. For this reason, I cannot generate any detailed specification about module name, functionality, its inputs and outputs, internal signals used, or any blocks or sections identification in the design. It appears to be binary or non-character encoded data. Kindly recheck the Verilog RTL code you wanted to provide. It should resemble a textual format similar to the Verilog code structure:

```verilog
module [module_name](
    input [input_ports],
    output [output_ports]
);
    // Code blocks and internal signals
endmodule
```

With a valid piece of Verilog RTL code, I am confident that I can provide a comprehensive overview of the module and its constituents.
