I'm sorry, but the given code is not valid Verilog code. It includes a lot of unrecognizable characters, making it impossible for me to identify the module name, its functionality, the input and output ports, the internal signals used within the module, or any different blocks or sections in the code and their functions. 

To perform an analysis and generate a detailed specification, I need a valid Verilog RTL code. Please provide the correct code for further assistance. As a general guide, Verilog code starts with "module" keyword and should contain recognizable Verilog constructs.
