    "block_comment": "The block of code represents an initial block in Verilog, which is executed at the initialization of the simulation. The function of this block is to control the GTS_int signal initially. After a delay of units equivalent to TOC_WIDTH, GTS_int value is toggled. This is achieved through the use of Verilog's initial construct and delay mechanism denoted by '#'."
