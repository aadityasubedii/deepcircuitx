    "module": "Module-level comment: \"Module decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix serves as a part of a larger digital communication or control interface. Its functionality is inferred from input-output ports: receives 7-bit address, 16-bit data input, clock signal and other digital & analog inputs, controls operations with a write enable and enable signals, and outputs various status signals along with 5-bit channel and 16-bit data outputs. Yet, abstraction level of this module requires detailed comments or implementation to identify precise functionality.\""
