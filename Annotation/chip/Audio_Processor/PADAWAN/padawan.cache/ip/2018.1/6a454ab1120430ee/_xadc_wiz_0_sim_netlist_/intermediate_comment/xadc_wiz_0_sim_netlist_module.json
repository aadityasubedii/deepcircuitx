    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, \"decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix\", interfaces with an ADC for data operations. It uses input signals such as address, data, clock, writing enable signals, and analog voltages. Outputs are status and data signals, including end-of-sequence and end-of-conversion signals. The module utilizes an XADC and several JTAG and internal controls. Additionally, a global module initializes and manages the JTAG and global signals. Detailed functionality depends on specific use context."
