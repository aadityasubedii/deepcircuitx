    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\n// Module 'decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix' forms an Analog to Digital Converter using Xilinx 7SERIES XADC. The module accepts analog inputs, increments in address and data inputs then creates conversion outputs along with status indicators for alarm, end of conversion, end of sequence and data readiness. It manages unconnected JTAG interface, over-temperature and alarm signals internally. This implementation initializes XADC instance 'inst' with specific parameters and maps these to the top level design. Module 'glbl' is included for overall Xilinx's design controls.\n"
