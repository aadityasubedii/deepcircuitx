Module name: decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix.

Module specification: The decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix module is a design utilizing an XADC (Xilinx's Analog to Digital Converter) from 7SERIES of Xilinx, encapsulating the operation of A/D conversion with both analog and digital inputs and outputs. This module accepts data inputs, most of which are standard controls such as input address (daddr_in), input data (di_in), data clock (dclk_in) and data write enables (den_in, dwe_in). It also accepts auxiliary analog inputs (vauxp3, vauxn3) and moreover analog input pairs (vp_in & vn_in) for the A/D converter. On the other side, the module generates busy status (busy_out), channel out (channel_out), data out (do_out), and a number of status signals such as alarm (alarm_out), end of conversion (eoc_out), end of sequence (eos_out) and data ready (drdy_out). Internally, it maintains several wired signals related to the JTAG debug interface (NLW_inst_JTAGBUSY_UNCONNECTED, NLW_inst_JTAGLOCKED_UNCONNECTED, NLW_inst_JTAGMODIFIED_UNCONNECTED), over-temperature control (NLW_inst_OT_UNCONNECTED), alarm conditions management (NLW_inst_ALM_UNCONNECTED), and potentially multiplexer address bus (NLW_inst_MUXADDR_UNCONNECTED), however, all these signals remain unconnected in the provided code. The module instance 'inst' runs the XADC instance with initialization parameters and maps the internal inputs and outputs. The second part of the code defines the 'glbl' (global) module for Xilinx's design, which governs general purpose signals and behaviors.
