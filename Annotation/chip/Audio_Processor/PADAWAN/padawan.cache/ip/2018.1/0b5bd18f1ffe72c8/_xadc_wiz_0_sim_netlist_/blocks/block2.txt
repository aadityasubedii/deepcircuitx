Comment: 
This block of code initiates the values of GSR_int and PRLD_int. Initially, it assigns both GSR_int and PRLD_int a '1'b1 (binary 1) value, effectively setting them high. After a delay, equal to the value of ROC_WIDTH, it assigns them a '1'b0 (binary 0) value, thereby setting them low. This suggests that it's likely used for setting up initial conditions or a reset sequence in the broader context of the code.
