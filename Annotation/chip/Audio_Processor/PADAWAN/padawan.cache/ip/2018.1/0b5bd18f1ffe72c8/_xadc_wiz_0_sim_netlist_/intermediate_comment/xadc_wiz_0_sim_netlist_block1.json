    "block_comment": "The block of code primarily serves as a delay function in a simulation. It makes use of the Verilog behavioral construct 'initial' to start a sequence of commands at t=0. The variable 'GTS_int' is assigned an initial value of 1, then after a delay equal to the value of 'TOC_WIDTH', 'GTS_int' is reassigned as 0, simulating a high-to-low transition in the signal. The duration of the high period is determined by the total bits in 'TOC_WIDTH'."
