    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix' module is an implementation of a Xilinx 7-Series FPGA XADC, used for analog-to-digital conversion. It interfaces with digital signals using input ports including control, data, clock, reset signals, and a pair of analog inputs. The module produces output status, alarm and data signals. It includes an XADC 'inst' configured with specified parameters and several unused/unconnected internal wires for future use. A global settings module 'glbl' for global FPGA signals is also defined."
