Comment: 
This Verilog block initializes a digital logic signal 'GTS_int'. The signal is initially set to the boolean value of 1 (high) and after a delay period defined by the parameter 'TOC_WIDTH', it is reset to 0 (low). The delay in the signal assignment emphasizes this block's utility in timing control.
