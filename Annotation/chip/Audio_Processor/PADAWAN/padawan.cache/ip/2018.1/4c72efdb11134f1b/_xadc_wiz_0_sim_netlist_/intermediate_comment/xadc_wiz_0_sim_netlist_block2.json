    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes the synchronous reset (GSR_int) and parallel load (PRLD_int) signals for a device. At the beginning of operation, it sets both signals to high ('1'). Following a delay determined by ROC_WIDTH, both signals are then set to low ('0'), indicating the end of initialization."
