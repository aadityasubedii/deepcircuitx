    "block_comment": "This block initializes General Set Reset (GSR) and Parallel Load (PRLD) signals. At the start, both the GSR and PRLD signals are set high to their respective initial values. After a delay proportional to ROC_WIDTH time unit, these signals are set back to low, hence allowing for setting and resetting of the system."
