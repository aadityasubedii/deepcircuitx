    "spec": "Module name: decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix. \n\nModule specification: The decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix module appears to be a framework for a digital communication or data processing system. Its exact functionality is not explicitly defined from the provided code, but based on input and output, it seems designed for handling data read or write actions coupled with control signals and status indication outputs.\n\nInput Ports: It features multiple input ports. 'daddr_in' ([6:0]) is a 7-bit address input, likely directing data read or write actions. 'dclk_in' operates as a clock signal for synchronizing data processing. 'den_in' could be a data enable signal, controlling when data can be read or written. 'di_in' ([15:0]) is a 16-bit data input for the data to be processed or stored. 'dwe_in' might be a data write enable signal, signaling when data can be written into the module. 'vauxp3' and 'vauxn3' may represent auxiliary power or control signals. 'vp_in' and 'vn_in' are likely positive and negative voltage inputs, respectively.\n\nOutput Ports: Its output ports include 'busy_out', potentially indicating that the module is currently processing data. 'channel_out' ([4:0]) might represent the communication channel through which data is provided or selected. 'do_out' ([15:0]) is a 16-bit output, which could be the processed or read data. 'drdy_out' could be a data ready signal, indicating the output data's readiness. The functions of 'eoc_out' and 'eos_out' aren't clear from the provided code but could signal the end of specific operations. 'alarm_out' might be an alert signal triggering upon detection of abnormal conditions.\n\nInternal Signaling: The provided code does not identify any internal signals; however, they are typically declared using the \"wire\" or \"reg\" keywords, controlling internal data flow or logic.\n\nCode Overview: Without more context, it's difficult to set a clear overview of this module. The provided Verilog module code outlines an interface, but lacks an implementation that establishes functionality or internal structure. Nonetheless, it provides a framework for a digital communication or data processing system.\n",
