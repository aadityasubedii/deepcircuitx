Module Name: decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix and glbl.

Module Specification:

The module decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix is a primitive XADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) instantiation with specific initialization parameters set. It is designed to take in digital inputs, including addresses and data, and analog inputs. Its purpose is to convert an analog input into a digital output. 

Its key input ports contain daddr_in for providing data address, dclk_in serves as the data clock, den_in enables data transmission, di_in sends the digital data, dwe_in enables or disables data writing, and among analog inputs, vauxp3 and vauxn3 are auxiliary positive and negative inputs while vp_in and vn_in are regular inputs. 

The output ports include busy_out to signal the operation of the module, channel_out indicating the current channel being converted, do_out returning the converted digital output, drdy_out indicating the readiness of data, eoc_out notifying the end of conversion, eos_out signalling the end of sequence, and alarm_out giving out abnormality signals.

Internally, the module uses signals like NLW_inst_JTAGBUSY_UNCONNECTED, NLW_inst_JTAGLOCKED_UNCONNECTED, NLW_inst_JTAGMODIFIED_UNCONNECTED, NLW_inst_OT_UNCONNECTED, NLW_inst_ALM_UNCONNECTED, NLW_inst_MUXADDR_UNCONNECTED representing various unconnected and operation signals.

The module named glbl simulates global parameters and states commonly found in FPGA, like Global Set/Reset(GSR), Global Tri-State(GTS), and Program Reload(PRLD). It acts as a top-level structure for FPGA's global signals and simulates the timing conditions for programing processes. Its key internal signals include GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int representing global set/reset, global tri-state, and load pulse for the shift register. It also emulates JTAG signals like JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL, JTAG_RESET_GLBL, JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL, JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL, JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL are controlling the state transitions of JTAG. JTAG user-defined signals like JTAG_USER_TDO1_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO2_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO3_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO4_GLBL are likely intended for custom testing scenarios.

Both of these modules play vital roles in providing analog-to-digital conversion and platform-level signal manipulation, respectively, and reflect complex yet effective FPGA hardware design intricacies.
