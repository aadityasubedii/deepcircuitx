    "block_comment": "This Verilog block controls a global test signal (GTS_int). Initially, it sets the GTS_int signal to high (1'b1) and after a delay defined by the TOC_WIDTH parameter value, it sets the signal to low (1'b0). The implementation uses an initial block which ensures this sequence is carried out once in the simulation at the very start. This entire operation is done sequentially and the delay is synchronous, controlled by the # symbol followed by the TOC_WIDTH."
