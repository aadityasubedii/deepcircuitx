Explanation: This module appears to be for a primitive XADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) instantiation with specific initialization parameters set. It takes in digital inputs, including addresses and data, and analog inputs. Outputs include various status flags (busy, alarm, etc.) and converted digital data. The converter is likely used to read some physical variable (such as voltage or temperature) and convert it to digital form for processing. Extra unconnected ports seem to suggest that it may have been a part of a larger design before.\n\nModule name: glbl. Explanation: This module seems to simulate global parameters and states commonly found in FPGA, like Global Set/Reset(GSR), Global Tri-State(GTS), and Program Reload(PRLD). This module mainly serves as a top-level structure simulating the global signals of an FPGA and timing conditions for simulating configuration processes. It emulates JTAG(Test Access Port) related signals as well."
