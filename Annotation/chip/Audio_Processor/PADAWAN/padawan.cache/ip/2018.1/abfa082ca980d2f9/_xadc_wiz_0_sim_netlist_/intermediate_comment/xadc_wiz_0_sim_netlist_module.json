    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nModule decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix is an XADC interface for digital and analog data conversion. It achieves this by taking digital and analog inputs, performing the conversion, and providing status flags and converted data as outputs. \n\nModule glbl simulates global FPGA parameters like reset, tri-state, and program reload signals. It achieves this by manipulating internal registers, allowing custom JTAG operations, and emulating global FPGA programing and debugging signals."
