Comment: 
This block of code serves as a time-delayed switch for the GTS_int variable. Initially setting GTS_int to high (`1'b1`), it then uses an implicit delay denoted by `#(TOC_WIDTH)` before it switches GTS_int to low (`1'b0`). The delay length is determined by `TOC_WIDTH`, with the exact length depending on the value of this macro at runtime.
