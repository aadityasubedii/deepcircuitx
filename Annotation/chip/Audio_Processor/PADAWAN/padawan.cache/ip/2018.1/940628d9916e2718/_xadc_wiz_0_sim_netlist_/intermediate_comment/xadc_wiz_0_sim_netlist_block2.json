    "block_comment": "The given Verilog code block initialized two signals, `GSR_int` and `PRLD_int`, to high (1). After a delay of `ROC_WIDTH` units, these signals are set low (0). This is generally used for synchronous resets or preload commands in hardware configurations, ensuring the system begins in a known state before normal operation starts."
