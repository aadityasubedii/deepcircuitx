Module name: decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix and glbl.

Module specification: 

The first module, `decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix`, is a custom module utilizing Xilinx's XADC feature for analog-to-digital conversion tasks. Its operation is dictated by initial definitions for XADC with hex values and it uses multiple input/output ports for different purposes. These include `daddr_in` (address input), `dclk_in` (clock input), `den_in` (enable signal input), `di_in` (data input), `dwe_in` (data write enable input signal), `vauxp3/ vauxn3` (differential input signals for the auxiliary analog inputs of the XADC), `vp_in/vn_in` (analog input signals for XADC), `busy_out` (output port indicating whether the XADC is busy or not), `channel_out` (output indicating which channel data is being output from), `do_out` (output data), `drdy_out` (data ready output signal), `eoc_out/eos_out` (signals indicating end of conversion or end of a sequence) and `alarm_out` (alarm output signal). 

Internally, it uses control and data signals connected to the XADC for data operation and some dummy signals that are not connected anywhere in the block of code. 

The second module, `glbl`, is a standard Xilinx module which holds declarations for the global signals used in the design. This module includes global signals like `GSR`, `GTS`, `GWE`, `PRLD` that have control functions such as synchronous reset, tri-state, enable writes and preloading respectively. It also includes FPGA configuration and programming signals like `PROGB_GLBL`, `CCLKO_GLBL`, `FCSBO_GLBL`, `DO_GLBL`, `DI_GLBL` and multiple `JTAG_` signals used for testing and programming via JTAG interface. Some internal versions of the control signals are also initialised in the initial-begin-end code blocks of the glbl module for specific lengths of time.
