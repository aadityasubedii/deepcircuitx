    "module": "Module-level comment: The module 'decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix' uses Xilinx's XADC for analog-to-digital conversions and control signals by defining an array of initial hex values for the XADC. It utilizes various input/output ports for data operation, control signals, and conversion tracking. The 'glbl' module holds global signals for control operations and configurations, plus JTAG interface signals for testing and programming. These are initiated within initial-begin-end code blocks for specific process timings. The design encapsulates usage of XADC and global signal controls for FPGA operations and configurations."
