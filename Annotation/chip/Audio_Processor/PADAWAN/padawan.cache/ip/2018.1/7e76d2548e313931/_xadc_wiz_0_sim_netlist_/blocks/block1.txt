This Verilog code block is essentially a delay logic that is meant to generate a specific period of delay determined by 'TOC_WIDTH'. Initially, the signal 'GTS_int' is set high, and after the delay equal to the value defined by 'TOC_WIDTH', 'GTS_int' is set low. Thus, the purpose of this block is to produce a timed high-to-low digital signal.
