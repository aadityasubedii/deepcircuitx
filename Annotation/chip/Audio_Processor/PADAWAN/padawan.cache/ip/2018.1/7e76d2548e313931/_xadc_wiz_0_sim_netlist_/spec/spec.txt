Module name: decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix and glbl.

Module specification:

The `decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix` module simulates an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). It translates analogue signals, such as sound or light, into a digital signal. Input ports include a 7-bit digital address `daddr_in`, a digital clock `dclk_in`, a digital enable input `den_in`, 16-bit digital input `di_in`, a digital write enable `dwe_in`, auxiliary positive and negative voltage inputs `vauxp3` and `vauxn3`, and positive and negative voltage inputs for the ADC `vp_in` and `vn_in`. The output ports include signals indicating the busy status `busy_out`, channel number `channel_out`, 16-bit digital output `do_out`, Data Ready `drdy_out`, End of Conversion `eoc_out`, End of Sequence `eos_out`, and Alarm `alarm_out`. This module is initialized with several constants and uses primitive ADC - `XADC`.

The `glbl` module is a global control module that manages Global set reset(GSR), Global 3-state(GTS), PRLD, and JTAG signals. These signals are often used in FPGA designs for managing operations like debug, program, and testing. This module doesn't have any input ports. Output ports include signals `GSR`, `GTS`, `PRLD`, and the global JTAG data output signal `JTAG_TDO_GLBL`. The module contains an initial block for initializing GSR and PRLD signals with respect to the ROC_WIDTH timing, and a separate initial block for initializing the GTS signal with respect to TOC_WIDTH timing. The module also manages JTAG signals for various JTAG operation stages including capture, reset, shift, update, and run test, as well as JTAG output signals that are left unconnected or are in the high impedance mode.
