Module-level comment: The module 'decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix' functions as an ADC converter converting analog signals into digital, using an XADC primitive and various IO ports for data input, output, control, and status monitoring. The 'glbl' module is a global control module managing GSR, GTS, PRLD, and JTAG signals for FPGA operational control and testing. It uses internal signals for timing control, and JTAG operation management, as well as high-impedance JTAG outputs. Both modules contain explicit initial blocks for timing and sequence control.
