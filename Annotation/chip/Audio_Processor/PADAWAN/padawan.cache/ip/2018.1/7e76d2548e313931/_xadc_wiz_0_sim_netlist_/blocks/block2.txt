Comment: 
This block of code performs an initial set and reset of two internal signals, 'GSR_int' and 'PRLD_int', in a Verilog design. Starting with both signals at '1', they are then forced to '0' after a delay determined by 'ROC_WIDTH'. The delay functionality is achieved by using an initial block with '#' time delay to ensure synchronous reset of 'GSR_int' and 'PRLD_int'.
