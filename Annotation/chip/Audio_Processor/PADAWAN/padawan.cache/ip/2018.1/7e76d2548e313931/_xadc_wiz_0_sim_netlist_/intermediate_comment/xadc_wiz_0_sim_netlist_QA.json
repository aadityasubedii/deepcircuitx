An ADC converts an analogue signal, like a sound picked up by a microphone or light entering a digital camera, into a digital signal.Numerous inputs and outputs have been declared, and some of them are wired to an instance of ADC primitive (Signified by XADC). It also uses other modules which are not connected, and finally the module appears to be initialized with some constants.\n\nFor glbl - This module seems to be a global control module that manages Global set reset(GSR), Global 3-state(GTS), PRLD, and JTAG signals. These signals are often used in FPGA designs for managing operations like debug, program, and testing. There are initial blocks provided to handle the initialization of these signals. An initial condition is applied to the GSR and PRLD signals, as well as the GTS signal, controlling the timing of these operations through ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH."
