This block of code initializes and manages the global tristate (GTS) signal. It initially sets the GTS_int signal to high or '1' and after a delay defined by TOC_WIDTH, it sets the GTS_int to '0'. This is implementation of a simple delay module where GTS_int acts as an enable signal that stays high for a time period specified by TOC_WIDTH and then goes low.
