Module name: decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix

Module specification: The 'decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix' module is designed to interface with Xilinx XADC (Analog to Digital Converter) on FPGA hardware. It uses multiple communication protocols for reading from and writing to the registers in the device. This module uses seven key input ports: a 7-bit address bus (`daddr_in`), clock signal (`dclk_in`), enable signal (`den_in`), a 16-bit input data (`di_in`), write enable signal (`dwe_in`), and two analog inputs (`vauxp3`, `vauxn3`). It uses seven output ports: busy signal (`busy_out`), 5-bit channel indicator (`channel_out`), a 16-bit output port (`do_out`), data ready signal (`drdy_out`), end-of-conversion signal (`eoc_out`), end-of-sequence signal (`eos_out`), and an error signal (`alarm_out`). The module uses internal signals which are mostly unconnected, and mainly used as placeholders for optional features or to provide error monitoring capacity. This module mainly consists of active low set/reset signal generation, JTAG state transition control, state control conditions, and outputs for various condition checks.


Module name: glbl

Module specification: The 'glbl' module is a Xilinx global utility, assisting in maintaining the global settings across the design. It does not have any input ports but uses several output ports such as `GSR, GTS, PRLD` for global FPGA behavior, JTAG operation related signals for device debugging and `JTAG_USER_TDO1_GLBL - JTAG_USER_TDO4_GLBL` for providing the testing status. This module also uses internal signals for the JTAG state transitions, controlling the test data outputs of the JTAG interface. The code consists of various initial blocks that are responsible for set/reset signal generation, JTAG state transition controls, and other condition checks.
