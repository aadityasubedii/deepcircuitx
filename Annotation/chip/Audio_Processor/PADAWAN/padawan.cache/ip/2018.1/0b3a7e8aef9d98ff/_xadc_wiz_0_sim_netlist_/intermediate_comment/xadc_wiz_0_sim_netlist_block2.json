    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for initiating values of two signals, 'GSR_int' and 'PRLD_int'. The initiation is done in synchronous digital design to keep the signal value stable before they are called to act. Here, an 'initial begin-end' block is used to assign both signals, 'GSR_int' and 'PRLD_int', an initial value of 1'b1 (boolean 1). After a delay equal to the width of ROC (ROC_WIDTH), the signals are RESET or given a value of 1'b0 (boolean 0). This is typically done to let the system stabilize before starting any actual operation."
