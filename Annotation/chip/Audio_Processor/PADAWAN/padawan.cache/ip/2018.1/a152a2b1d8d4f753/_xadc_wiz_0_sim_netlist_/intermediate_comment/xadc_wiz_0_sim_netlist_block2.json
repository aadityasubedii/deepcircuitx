    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes specific conditions in a module. Initially, it sets both the GSR_int and the PRLD_int registers to be '1'. After a delay of ROC_WIDTH time units, these registers are then reset to '0'. This delay may be used to establish a startup reset condition and then run the subsequent process in the module."
