Module name: decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix and glbl.

Module specification: 

The "decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix" is a Verilog RTL module which functions as an Analog to Digital Converter. This unit essentially converts analog differential inputs (vauxp3 and vauxn3) into digital data. The main activity revolves around an instance of a "Black Box" type, XADC (Xilinx's generic ADC unit), initialized with specific hexadecimal values. The instance handles the physical conversion process by taking advantage of the FPGA's inbuilt XADC capabilities.

Input Ports: 
The ADC entity incorporates signals such as Digital Address (daddr_in), Clock (dclk_in), Enable (den_in), 16-bit wide Data Input (di_in), Write Enable (dwe_in), and Analog inputs for interpolation. Also, power signal inputs (vp_in and vn_in) are provided as inputs to the module.

Output Ports: 
Several output signals serve to communicate the state of the ADC. These include the Busy signal (busy_out), Channel Information (channel_out), 16-bit wide Digital Output (do_out), Data Ready signal (drdy_out), End of Conversion signal (eoc_out), End of Sequence signal (eos_out) and an Alarm signal for error alerts (alarm_out).

Internal Signals: 
Several internal utility signals like JTAGBUSY_UNCONNECTED, JTAGLOCKED_UNCONNECTED, JTAGMODIFIED_UNCONNECTED, OT_UNCONNECTED, NLW_inst_MUXADDR_UNCONNECTED are present to facilitate debugging, others are wired as placeholders for future functionalities and some, duplicated as wires from ports.

The ADC's structure primarily involves I/O signal designing which interfaces with the XADC unit. The flow is regulated by the progression of the clock signal (dclk_in) and the activation of the enable signal (den_in).

The "glbl" module encapsulates global signals like GSR, GWE and manages JTAG interface details. It contains parameters ROC_WIDTH, TOC_WIDTH which control reset and configuration along with reg signals for JTAG interface.

In summary, these modules depict a Verilog RTL design for an ADC conversion process featuring an array of necessary signalling and an effectively managed globalisation module for entire FPGA handling.
