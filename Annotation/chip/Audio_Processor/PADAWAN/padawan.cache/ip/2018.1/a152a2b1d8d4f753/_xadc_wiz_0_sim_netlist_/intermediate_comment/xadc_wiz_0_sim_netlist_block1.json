    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to perform an initial power-on reset. It initially sets the GTS_int variable to 1 (logic high), waits for a duration determined by the TOC_WIDTH constant (designed to model real-world propagation delay), then resets GTS_int to 0 (logic low). This reflects the typical operation of many digital systems where certain signals are temporarily asserted high upon startup, then dropped low after a specific interval for system initialization purposes."
