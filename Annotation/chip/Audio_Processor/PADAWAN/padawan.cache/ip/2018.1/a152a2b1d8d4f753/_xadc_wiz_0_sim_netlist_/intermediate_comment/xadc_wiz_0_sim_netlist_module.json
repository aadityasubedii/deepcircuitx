    "module": "Module-level comment: The module \"decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix\" functions as an Analog to Digital Converter leveraging Xilinx's XADC. It receives analog inputs, converts to digital data, and provides channel information and alerts via output signals. The \"glbl\" module manages FPGA's global signals and JTAG interface. Both modules utilize wired signals alongside clock and enable controls for seamless operations, with placeholder internal signals provisioned for future functionalities."
