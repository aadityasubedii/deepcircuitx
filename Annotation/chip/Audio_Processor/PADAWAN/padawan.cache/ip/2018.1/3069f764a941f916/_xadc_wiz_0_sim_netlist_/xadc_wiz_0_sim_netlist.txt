Module-level comment: The module "decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix" employs a Xilinx XADC primitive for analog to digital conversion using inputs like data address, clock, and main and auxiliary analog signal inputs. The conversion process state is reflected through outputs like busy-out, data-out, end of conversion and sequence signals etc. The "glbl" module is utilized for FPGA system-wide control like global set/reset, tri-state, preload control and manipulation of global FPGA programming and debugging via JTAG signals. Both modules use internal registers and signals to manage their functionality.
