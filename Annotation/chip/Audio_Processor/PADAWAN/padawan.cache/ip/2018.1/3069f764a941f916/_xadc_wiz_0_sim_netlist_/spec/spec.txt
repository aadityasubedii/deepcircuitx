Module name: decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix.
Module specification: This module implements a Xilinx 7 series FPGA primitive, XADC, which serves as an analog to digital converter. Input ports to this module are daddr_in, dclk_in, den_in, di_in, dwe_in, vauxp3, vauxn3, vp_in, and vn_in which provide a 7-bit address for a data register, clock signal, enable signal, 16-bit data input, write enable signal, auxiliary analog inputs and main analog inputs respectively. The output ports from this module are busy_out, channel_out, do_out, drdy_out, eoc_out, eos_out, and alarm_out, which reflects the state of the ADC indication if it is still busy, the channel to which data-in was directed, 16-bit output data, data ready signal, end of conversion and end of sequence signals, and an alarm signal respectively. Module makes use of internal signals such as NLW_inst_JTAGBUSY_UNCONNECTED, NLW_inst_JTAGLOCKED_UNCONNECTED, NLW_inst_JTAGMODIFIED_UNCONNECTED, NLW_inst_OT_UNCONNECTED, NLW_inst_ALM_UNCONNECTED, NLW_inst_MUXADDR_UNCONNECTED which are currently unused. The main block of the module uses these inputs to initialize the XADC primitive for analog to digital conversion.

Module name: glbl.
Module specification: The glbl module is a global control utility module which provides signals that are universal in nature and serves for controlling device behavior and configuration. The core I/Os constituting this module are GSR, GTS, PRLD dealing with global set/reset, global tri-state functionality, and preload functionality, global FPGA programming signals like PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, FCSBO_GLBL, DO_GLBL, DI_GLBL, and JTAG interface signals like JTAG_TDO_GLBL, JTAG_TCK_GLBL, JTAG_TDI_GLBL, JTAG_TMS_GLBL, JTAG_TRST_GLBL. The internal workings of the functionality is managed by internal registers GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int and several JTAG related registers like JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL, JTAG_RESET_GLBL, JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL, JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL, JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL, JTAG_SEL1_GLBL, JTAG_SEL2_GLBL, JTAG_SEL3_GLBL, JTAG_SEL4_GLBL and JTAG_USER_TDO_GLBL. Essentially, this module controls the overall device behavior, programming, and debugging functionality of the FPGA system.
