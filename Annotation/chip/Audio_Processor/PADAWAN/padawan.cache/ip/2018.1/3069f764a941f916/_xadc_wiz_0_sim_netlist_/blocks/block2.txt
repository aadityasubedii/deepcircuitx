Comment: 
This block initializes and manipulates GSR_int and PRLD_int signals. The function of this block is to initialize GSR_int and PRLD_int to a high ('1') state at the start. After a certain delay (ROC_WIDTH), they are then set to a low ('0') state. The implementation leverages the initial begin and end in Verilog, which sets up initial values for the GSR_int and PRLD_int signals, and executes a time delay, specified by a parameter ROC_WIDTH, before changing their states.
