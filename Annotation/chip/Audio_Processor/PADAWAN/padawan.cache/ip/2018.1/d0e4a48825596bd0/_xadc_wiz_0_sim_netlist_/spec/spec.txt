Module name: decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix and glbl. 

Module Specification: The 'decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix' module is an instantiation of the Xilinx XADC for on-chip analog monitoring operations like temperature, voltage and so on. It functions on various inputs like data address, clock, enabled signals and in response provides output signals for alarm, busy out, channel out etc. The input ports include 7-bit 'daddr_in' (data address), 'dclk_in' (data clock), 'den_in' (enable signal), 16-bit 'di_in' (data input), 'dwe_in' (write enable signal), 'vauxp3', 'vauxn3' (auxillary analog input terminals), 'vp_in', 'vn_in' (analog differential voltage inputs). The output ports encompass 'busy_out', 5-bit 'channel_out', 16-bit 'do_out' (data out), 'drdy_out' (data ready out), 'eoc_out' (End of Conversion signal), 'eos_out' (End of Sequence signal), 'alarm_out'. Internal signals include NLW_inst_JTAGBUSY_UNCONNECTED, NLW_inst_JTAGLOCKED_UNCONNECTED, NLW_inst_JTAGMODIFIED_UNCONNECTED, NLW_inst_OT_UNCONNECTED, 7-bit NLW_inst_ALM_UNCONNECTED, 5-bit NLW_inst_MUXADDR_UNCONNECTED, which further assist in operations like JTAG interaction, timekeeping, alarm, multiplexing etc. It hosts XADC primitive from Xilinx with specific set values for registers like INIT_40, INIT_41 etc.

The 'glbl' module manages global signals for FPGA simulation in Verilog including global set/reset (GSR), global tri-state (GTS) etc. Although no explicit input or output ports are mentioned, there are several internal signals like 'CCLKO_GLBL', 'FCSBO_GLBL', 'DO_GLBL', 'DI_GLBL' which are utilized for JTAG communication, and many more such as 'JTAG_TDO_GLBL', 'JTAG_TCK_GLBL', 'JTAG_TDI_GLBL', 'JTAG_TMS_GLBL', 'JTAG_TRST_GLBL', 'JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL', 'JTAG_RESET_GLBL', 'JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL', 'JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL', 'JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL' that are integral to operating the JTAG interface. This module is essential in testbenches as it provides a necessary facet of simulating the behaviour of global signals.
