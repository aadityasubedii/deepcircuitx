    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the Global Tristate (GTS) internal signal for a specific duration. Initially, the GTS_int signal is set to high indicating that the outputs are to be placed in a high impedance state. After a time delay equivalent of the digit represented by TOC_WIDTH, it transitions the GTS_int to low, which will enable the data output signals."
