    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThis is the top-level module 'decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix'. Functionality is inferred due to absence of inline comments, but expected to deal with data processing based on inputs of address, data signals, control signals. Outputs could be status signals, indications of readiness or end of data transmission, and error alerts. The implementation details are not known as no internal logic signals are present. We recommend more detailed comments in the code or related design documents for clear understanding."
