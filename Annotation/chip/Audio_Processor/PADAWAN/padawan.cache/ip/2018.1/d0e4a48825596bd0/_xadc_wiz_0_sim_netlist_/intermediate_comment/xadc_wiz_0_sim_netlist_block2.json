    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code primarily functions to initialize the signals GSR_int and PRLD_int. The implementation begins with setting both of these signals to 1 initially. After a delay given by ROC_WIDTH, the signals are reset to 0. This behavior primarily serves as an initial setup and reset procedure for the signals."
