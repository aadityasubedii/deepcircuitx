    "spec": "Module Name: decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix\n\nModule Specification: \n\nThe 'decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix' module is a digital system potentially related to a communication or conversion process. The module operates using a digital clock 'dclk_in', with data being written to the module through 'di_in' when 'den_in' (Data enable) and 'dwe_in' (Data Write Enable) are asserted. The module seems to handle certain channels which are specified by 'channel_out.' The module reports its operational status with 'busy_out' and indicates the end of conversion or sequence using 'eoc_out' and 'eos_out,' respectively. An alarm signal 'alarm_out' is produced in the event of an error.\n\nThe module has several input ports, including a 7-bit digital address 'daddr_in,' a digital clock 'dclk_in,' a data enable signal 'den_in,' a 16-bit data input 'di_in,' a data write enable signal 'dwe_in, auxiliary signals 'vauxp3' and 'vauxn3,' and positive and negative voltages input 'vp_in' and 'vn_in.' On the other hand, output ports include a busy status 'busy_out,' a 5-bit channel output 'channel_out,' a 16-bit data output 'do_out,' a data-ready signal 'drdy_out,' end of conversion signal 'eoc_out,' end of sequence signal 'eos_out,' and an alarm signal 'alarm_out.'\n\nThe given Verilog code does not define or use any internal signals. No different blocks or sections were found in the provided code since it is only the module declaration containing the input and output ports. The complete implemented code of the module would present the internal signals, blocks, and specific operations performed by the module. The functions and roles of different signals have been predicted based on typical usage in digital system design, and precise functionality can be accurately determined with a detailed module definition or operational description.",
