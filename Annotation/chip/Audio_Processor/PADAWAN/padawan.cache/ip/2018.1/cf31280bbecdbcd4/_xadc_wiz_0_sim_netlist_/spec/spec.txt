Module name: decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix and glbl. 

Module specification: 

The module "decalper_eb_ot_sdeen_pot_pi_dehcac_xnilix" is an XADC (Xilinx Analog-to-Digital Converter) interface module with specific functionality in a typical Xilinx FPGA design. Its input ports include standard control inputs such as 'daddr_in' (7-bit digital address for XADC), 'dclk_in' (clock), 'den_in' (data enable signal), 'di_in' (16-bit data input), and 'dwe_in' (data write enable signal). It also has analog inputs, which are chiefly 'vauxp3', 'vauxn3' (auxiliary analog input channel), 'vp_in', and 'vn_in' (primary analog input channels). Output ports consist of 'busy_out' (busy status of XADC), 'channel_out' (currently selected XADC channel info), 'do_out' (16 bit data output), and flags for data status and various conditions such as 'eoc_out' (end of conversion), 'eos_out' (end of sequence), and 'alarm_out' (alarm signal). Internal signals are used for JTAG interface and alarm status control, and these signals are left unconnected in this case.

The "glbl" module generates some critical global signals, JTAG interface pins and states signals in Xilinx FPGA designs. It contains input control signals ('PROGB_GLBL' - global program reset input, 'CCLKO_GLBL', 'FCSBO_GLBL', 'DI_GLBL' - FPGA configuration inputs, 'JTAG_TDI_GLBL', 'JTAG_TMS_GLBL', 'JTAG_TCK_GLBL', 'JTAG_TRST_GLBL' - JTAG interface inputs) and output signals ('GSR', 'GTS', 'PRLD' - related to FPGA config and reset, 'DO_GLBL' - JTAG data output, 'JTAG_TDO_GLBL' - JTAG interface output). It also controls internal signals related to JTAG states and operations.

The XADC module interfaces with an XADC device, controlling and monitoring the analog-to-digital conversions. The 'glbl' module handles configuration-related actions and JTAG operations of FPGA. The 'glbl' module is initialized with 'GSR' and 'GTS' signals, indicative of the typical initial setting in a Xilinx FPGA design.
