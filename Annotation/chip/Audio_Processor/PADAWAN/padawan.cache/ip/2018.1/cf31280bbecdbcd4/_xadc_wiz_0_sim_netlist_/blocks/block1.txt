This block is initialized to facilitate a delay function in digital circuits. It operates by initially assigning the 'GTS_int' signal a value of 1'b1. After a delay period defined by 'TOC_WIDTH', the signal 'GTS_int' is reset to 1'b0. This design simulates a clock pulse or Toggle-On-Clock (TOC) behavior, where 'GTS_int' is active (1) for a period before turning inactive (0).
