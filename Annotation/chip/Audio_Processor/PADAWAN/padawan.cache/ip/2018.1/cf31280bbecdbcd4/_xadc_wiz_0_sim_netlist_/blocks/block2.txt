This block of code performs initialization of two variables, GSR_int and PRLD_int, within the initial block. At the start, it sets both variables to a 1-bit binary value of 1, implying that they are initialized to true. Then, after waiting for the amount of time specified by the value of ROC_WIDTH, it resets both variables to a 1-bit binary value of 0, meaning they are set to false. This delay in initialization ensures synchronization with the chip's timing parameters.
