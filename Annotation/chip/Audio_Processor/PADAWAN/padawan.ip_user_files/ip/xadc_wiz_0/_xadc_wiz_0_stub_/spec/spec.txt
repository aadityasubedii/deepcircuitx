Module name: xadc_wiz_0

Module specification: The xadc_wiz_0 module appears to function as an interface for an XADC (Xilinx Analog-to-Digital Converter) wizard device on a Xilinx FPGA. This module takes several inputs, some of which are digital, while others represent the positive and negative inputs for an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The input ports include; a 7-bit digital address input (daddr_in), digital clock input (dclk_in), digital enable input (den_in), a 16-bit data input (di_in), digital write enable (dwe_in), positive analog voltage input (vauxp3), negative analog voltage input (vauxn3), positive and negative inputs for the ADC (vp_in, vn_in). The output ports comprise of; a busy signal (busy_out), a 5-bit channel indicator (channel_out), a 16-bit digital output (do_out), digital ready signal (drdy_out), end-of-conversion and end-of-sequence signals (eoc_out, eos_out) and an alarm signal (alarm_out). Information regarding internal signals or separate functional blocks within the module cannot be extracted from the provided module definition, as they require explicit definitions or declaration within the body of the code, which is not included here. The overall role of the module is likely managing the data flow to and from an ADC, controlling the conversion process, and transmitting the relevant status signals.
