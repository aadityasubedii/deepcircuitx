    "module": "Module-level comment: This collection of modules are responsible for clock management within the FPGA system. 'clk_wiz_0' generates two stable clock outputs from a main clock input using a sub-module 'clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz', which handles clock buffers, multiplication and division through internal signals and instances of primitive components (IBUF, BUFG, and MMCME2_ADV). 'glbl' module manages global controls like set/reset, tri-state, program load signals and JTAG operations using internally controlled signals and sets initial values for some of these signals."
