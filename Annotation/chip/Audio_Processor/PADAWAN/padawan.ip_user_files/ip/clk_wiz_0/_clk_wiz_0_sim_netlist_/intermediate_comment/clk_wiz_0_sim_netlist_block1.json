    "block_comment": "This block of code is an initial block set up to perform an operation at the beginning of simulation or synthesis. It first sets the signal 'GTS_int' high, then delays for a time period specified by 'TOC_WIDTH', after which it sets 'GTS_int' back to low. The '#(TOC_WIDTH)' function signifies a delay for a number of time units defined by TOC_WIDTH before setting 'GTS_int' to low. The initial construction allows these commands to be executed at the start of the simulation."
