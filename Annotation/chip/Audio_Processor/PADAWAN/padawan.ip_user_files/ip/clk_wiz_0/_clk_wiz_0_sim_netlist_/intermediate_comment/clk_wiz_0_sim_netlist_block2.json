    "block_comment": "The function of this block of code is initial setup, performed once at the beginning of the simulation. It sets `GSR_int` and `PRLD_int`, two internal signals, to logic high. After a delay approximated by parameter `ROC_WIDTH`, these signals are reset to logic low. Implementation-wise, this block employs an `initial` statement \u2013 typical in Verilog for setting up initial conditions, or running procedural code at the simulation start. The delay is implemented using the `#` syntax, simulating the passing of time in hardware operation. This approach provides a way to model asynchronous reset and setup sequences."
