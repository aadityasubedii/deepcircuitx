Module name: clk_wiz_0, clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz, glbl. 

Module specification: 

1. clk_wiz_0: This module is used for clock management in the system. It receives the main clock input through the 'clk_in1' port and produces two primary output clocks 'clk_out1' and 'clk_out2'. A 'locked' signal is also outputted to indicate when the output clocks are stable and running at their specified frequencies. The sole internal signals are the same as the I/O ports which are used within this module.

2. clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz: This is the sub-module within the 'clk_wiz_0' which takes care of specific clocking functionalities including clock buffers, clock multiplication and division. It has similar input and output ports like 'clk_wiz_0'. Additionally, there are several internal signals within this module that aid the clock management functions such as CLKIN, CLKFBOUT for feedback path, CLKOUTs (outputs for generated clocks) and several unused outputs of the MMCME2_ADV primitive. This module also encapsulates several instances of primitive components, such as input and output buffers (IBUF, BUFG) and a Mixed-Mode Clock Manager (MMCME2_ADV).

3. glbl: This module primarily handles global signals that orchestrate the overall functioning of the FPGA, like global set/reset (GSR), global tri-state (GTS), Program Load (PRLD), as well as JTAG signals used for programming or debugging purposes. It has no explicit input ports, but includes output ports GSR, GTS, and PRLD. The internal reg type signals, like GSR_int, GTS_int, and PRLD_int, regulate the global set/reset, tri-state, and program load functionalities respectively. The JTAG_* signals cater to the JTAG interface operations. The 'glbl' module does also handle an initial procedure to set and reset the GTS and GSR signals.
