Module name: clk_wiz_0. 

Module specification: The clk_wiz_0 is a clock wizard module primarily designed to generate two output clocks (clk_out1, clk_out2) based on a single input clock (clk_in1). The input clock serves as the base frequency from which the other output clocks are derived. The module enables phase alignment with an automatically determined feedback source (internal or external). It simplifies clocking design and reduces the need for several features like dynamic phase shift, clock switchover, dynamic reconfiguration, AXI interface, power down, and reset facilities that are typically used in more complex modules. The module has three output signals: clk_out1, clk_out2, and a 'locked' signal. The 'locked' output indicates the lock status of the phase-locked loop inside the clock wizard, implying that the output clocks are operating at the correct frequency and phase. The module structure is very straightforward with a direct instance implementation of the clock wizard under the alias 'clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz' which connects to the input and output ports. The module doesn't make use of any internal signals, making it quite simplified and direct in its operations.
