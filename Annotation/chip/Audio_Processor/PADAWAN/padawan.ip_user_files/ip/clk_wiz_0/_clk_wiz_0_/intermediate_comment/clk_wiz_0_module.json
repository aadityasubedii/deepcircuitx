    "module": "Module-level comment: The clk_wiz_0 module is a straightforward clock wizard. It has an input clock 'clk_in1' and generates two output clocks 'clk_out1' and 'clk_out2'. It employs phase alignment and autonomously decides the feedback source. The 'locked' output signal reflects the phase-locked loop status. This module doesn't utilize internal signals, and its clean design omits features like dynamic phase shift, clock switchover, dynamic reconfiguration, AXI interface, and reset functionality. The core implementation leverages a monolithically instantiated clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz unit directly linked to input and output ports."
