It also has a \"locked\" output for indicating the lock status of the phase-locked loop inside the clock wizard. The clock wizard's configuration details are provided in the inline comments. It uses phase alignment, and is configured to automatically decide whether to use internal or external feedback. It also does not use several features such as dynamic phase shift, input clock switchover, dynamic reconfiguration, AXI interface, power down, and reset. It outputs a \"locked\" signal, indicating whether the output clocks are in the correct phase and frequency."
