Module name: clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz. 

Module specification: The clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz module is a clock generation and control module primarily used for FPGA designs with Xilinx-specific components. It takes one input clock signal - 'clk_in1', and generates two output clocks - 'clk_out1' and 'clk_out2'. It also provides a 'locked' output that indicates the stability of its operation. 

The module comprises several internal signals. 'clk_in1_clk_wiz_0' is a buffered version of the input clock signal while 'clk_out1_clk_wiz_0' and 'clk_out2_clk_wiz_0' carry the generated clock signals. Signals 'do_unused', 'drdy_unused', and 'psdone_unused' are related to the Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) and phase-shift capabilities of the clock wizard but aren't used in this context. 'locked_int' indicates the locked status of the advanced Mixed-Mode Clock Manager (MMCME2_ADV). 'clkfbout_clk_wiz_0' and 'clkfbout_buf_clk_wiz_0' are used for feedback control within the MMCME2_ADV whereas signals like 'clkfboutb_unused', 'clkout0b_unused', 'clkout1b_unused', 'clkout2_unused' and so on are unused outputs of the MMCME2_ADV. 

The module can be logically divided into different sections. First, an input buffer (IBUF) instance is used to generate a stable internal version of the primary clock input. Then, the MMCME2_ADV instance is used to generate and control multiple output clocks based on the provided configurations. Following that, the clock distribution is handled using buffer instances (BUFG). This structure allows the clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz module to serve multiple clock domains as per their specific needs.
