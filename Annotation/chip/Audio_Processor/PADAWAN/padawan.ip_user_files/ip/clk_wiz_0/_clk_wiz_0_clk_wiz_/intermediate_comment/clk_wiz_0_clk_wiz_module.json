    "module": "Module-level comment: This is the clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz module, a clock management unit for FPGA designs. It takes a single input clock, 'clk_in1', and generates two individual clock outputs, 'clk_out1' and 'clk_out2', and a 'locked' signal. It uses an IBUF to buffer the input clock, an MMCME2_ADV instance to generate the output clocks, and additional BUFG units for clock distribution. Unused outputs and advanced controls like DRP and phase shift aren't utilized in this design."
