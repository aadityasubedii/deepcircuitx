It uses Xilinx-specific components, specifically, an input buffer (\"IBUF\") and an advanced Mixed-Mode Clock Manager (\"MMCME2_ADV\"), to manage and manipulate the clock signal. The module also has a \"locked\" output that indicates if the clock module is under stable operation. Buffer components (\"BUFG\") are also used for clock signal distribution. This module can be used in FPGA designs where specific and multiple clock domains are required."
