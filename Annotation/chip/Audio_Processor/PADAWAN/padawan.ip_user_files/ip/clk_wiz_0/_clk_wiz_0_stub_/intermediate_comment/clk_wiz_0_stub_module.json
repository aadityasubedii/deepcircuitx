    "module": "Module-level comment: The module 'clk_wiz_0' is intended to perform clock-related functions, receiving input clock 'clk_in1' and presumably generating output clocks 'clk_out1' and 'clk_out2'. The 'locked' output typically signals a stable generated clock. However, as of now the module lacks internal implementation to perform any specific functionality, serving as a base layout for further development."
