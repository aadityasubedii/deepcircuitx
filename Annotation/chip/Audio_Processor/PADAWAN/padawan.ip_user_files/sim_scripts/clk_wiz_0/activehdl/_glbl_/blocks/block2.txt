Comment: 
This is an initialization block in Verilog that sets up certain signals for the rest of the circuit design. It starts with the signals `GSR_int` and `PRLD_int` set to 1 (or high), which typically used for setting a 'global system reset' and 'preload', respectively. A delay of `ROC_WIDTH` time units is then introduced, following which `GSR_int` and `PRLD_int` are set back to 0 (or low), indicating the end of initial setup phase. This kind of block is often used in synchronizing operations at the beginning of a testbench or simulating reset conditions.
