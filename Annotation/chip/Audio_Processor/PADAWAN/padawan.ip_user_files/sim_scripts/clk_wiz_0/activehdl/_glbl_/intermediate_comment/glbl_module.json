    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'glbl' module functions as a global signal handler and JTAG interface state controller in digital designs. It initializes internal signals like GSR_int, GTS_int, and PRLD_int which in turn drive main output signals. The values of these internal signals are toggled as per specified ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH parameters. Furthermore, the module defines and manages the states of the JTAG interface through a series of dedicated registers, facilitating efficient system testing and debugging operations."
