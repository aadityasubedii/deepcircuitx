Module name: glbl. 

Module specification: The 'glbl' module acts as a global wrapper for digital design which handles several global signals such as ROC_WIDTH, TOC_WIDTH, GSR, GTS, GWE, and PRLD. It mainly governs initializations and operations of signals and states associated with JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) operation. Although there are no explicitly defined input and output ports, several registers and wires serve as implicit inputs and outputs. Signals GSR, GTS, PRLD, and PLL_LOCKG are prime outputs that act as drivers. PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, FCSBO_GLBL, DO_GLBL, DI_GLBL are wire signals serving as inputs/outputs, whereas JTAG related signals defined as wires generally act as system inputs. 

Internal registers include GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int and various JTAG state corresponding registers including JTAG_SEL and JTAG_USER_TDO. GSR_int and GTS_int are used for routing the output signals GSR, GTS and they are toggled at specified intervals governed by ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH parameters. JTAG state registers handle operation states for JTAG interface. 

The initialization blocks in the code handle the initial set up of registers like GSR_int, GTS_int, and PRLD_int and also specify the timing details for JTAG operations. 

Overall, the 'glbl' module plays a crucial role in managing global signals and setting up signal states for JTAG operations, making it integral in testing and verifying digital designs.
