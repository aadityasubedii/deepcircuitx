Comment: 
This block initializes and manages the internal global tristate (GTS) signal. Initially, it sets the GTS_int signal to be high (1). Then, after a delay period of TOC_WIDTH time units, the GTS_int signal is set to low (0). The TOC_WIDTH time units are user-defined and may correspond to clock cycles or other time-based systems employed in the design.
