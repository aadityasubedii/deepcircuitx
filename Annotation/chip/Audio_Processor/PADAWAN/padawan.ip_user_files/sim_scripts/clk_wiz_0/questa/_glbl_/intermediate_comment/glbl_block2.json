    "block_comment": "The block of code accomplishes an initial set-up activity for two internal signals, `GSR_int` and `PRLD_int`. The code initiates by setting both signals to binary 1, implying an active or 'true' state. Following a delay equal to `ROC_WIDTH`, the signals are then reset to binary 0, transitioning them to an inactive or 'false' state. This block, therefore, allows for an initialization period before the signals are used in subsequent operations. The delay in resetting the signals assures that other dependent events have time to settle for accurate operation."
