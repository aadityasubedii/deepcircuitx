    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code acts as a power-on reset mechanism for the GTS_int signal. Upon initialization of the system or module, it sets the GTS_int signal to high. After a delay equal to TOC_WIDTH in time units (indicating the length of the reset pulse), the signal is then set back to low, thus indicating the end of the reset period."
