Module-level comment: The 'glbl' module provides global control and testing signals for a Verilog RTL design including JTAG, GSR, GTS, PRLD operations. Global signals are defined and initialized through initial condition blocks, with exact timing controlled by ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH parameters. Additionally, respective global signals are assigned with internal register signals for state control and operations. The module doesn't have explicit I/O ports as it operates at a global level, defining signal behavior across the design.
