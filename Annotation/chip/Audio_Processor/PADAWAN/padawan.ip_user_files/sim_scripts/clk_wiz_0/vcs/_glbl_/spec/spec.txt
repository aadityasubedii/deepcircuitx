Module name: glbl. 

Module specification: The glbl module serves as a top-level configuration and control unit in a design system. It is responsible for managing signals related to the device's global operations like Global Set Reset (GSR), Global 3-state (GTS), and Programmable Reload (PRLD). The module does not have any explicitly declared input or output ports. Implicit input signals include global control signals (GSR, GTS, GWE, PRLD), configuration signals (PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, FCSBO_GLBL), data signals (DO_GLBL[3:0], DI_GLBL[3:0]), and JTAG control signals. Potential output signals include PLL_LOCKG, GSR, GTS, and PRLD, which can behave as control signals for other parts of the system.

Internal signals in this module include various sets of registers, namely GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int that control the initial state of the system, unused JTAG control signals and user-defined output signals. Bi-directional signal PLL_LOCKG can provide status of a PLL block. 

The code blocks are mainly initializing the GSR_int, PRLD_int and GTS_int signals and after certain delay, determined by parameters ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH, these signals are reset. The delay hence signifies some initialization period/function for other modules or overall device which this module caters to, making it an essential part of the system initialization phase. 

Although many signals are assigned, the specific functions or inter-module connections are not elaborated in this module. Detailed functionality for these would depend on the context of the overall system where this module gets integrated into.
