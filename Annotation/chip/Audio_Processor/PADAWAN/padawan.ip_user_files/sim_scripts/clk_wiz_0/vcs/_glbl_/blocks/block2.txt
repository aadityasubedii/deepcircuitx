Comment: 
This block of code is initializing or resetting the digital system. It sets the `GSR_int` and `PRLD_int` to logic high ('1') initially, then after a delay defined by `ROC_WIDTH`, it resets them to logic low ('0'). This corresponds to an asynchronous reset functionality, often used in sequential logic design, where `GSR_int` could be a global system reset and `PRLD_int` could be a preload signal, for initialization of a finite state machine or similar structure.
