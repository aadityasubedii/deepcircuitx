It controls and modifies specific signals related to the device's global operations. Some of those functionalities cover Global Set Reset (GSR), Global 3-state (GTS), Programmable Reload (PRLD), and operations related to the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) or on-chip debugger. Based on the specified `ROC_WIDTH` and `TOC_WIDTH`, it toggles the state of GSR, GTS and PRLD respectively, after a certain delay. It seems to be related to device configuration timing or initialization period."

Therefore, analyzing the context of the code, we can say:\n\nInput Ports: GSR, GTS, GWE, PRLD, PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, FCSBO_GLBL, DO_GLBL, DI_GLBL, JTAG_TDO_GLBL, JTAG_TCK_GLBL, JTAG_TDI_GLBL, JTAG_TMS_GLBL, JTAG_TRST_GLBL. There are no explicit input ports, but these wire declarations might be driven by some other modules in the system.\n\nExplanation: \n1. GSR, GTS, GWE, PRLD - These are global control signals, possibly related to reset, tri-state, write enable, and programmable reload controls respectively.\n2. PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, FCSBO_GLBL - These signals might be used for the functionality of the module outside, perhaps for configuration operations.\n3. DO_GLBL[3:0], and DI_GLBL[3:0] - These are 4-bit vectors, probably used for Data Out and Data In operations respectively.\n4. JTAG_TDO_GLBL, JTAG_TCK_GLBL, JTAG_TDI_GLBL, JTAG_TMS_GLBL, JTAG_TRST_GLBL - These are likely Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) control signals, often used for on-board debug activities and interfacing.\n\nOutput Ports: PLL_LOCKG, GSR, GTS, PRLD. They are not explicitly declared as output ports in the module but based on their usage in the module logic, they can function as outputs.\n\nExplanation: \n1. PLL_LOCKG - This signal could be a status signal indicating the lock status of a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) in system level integration.\n2. GSR, GTS, PRLD - These signals are assigned in the module and might be essentially used as control signals by other parts of the system.\n\nPlease note in Verilog, ports can be implicitly defined using wire or reg statements and their role (input or output) really depends on the context or how they are used. Hence, it's important to review the entire system-level connections in which this module will be integrated."

Initially, these signals are set and after a delay, determined by ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH parameters, these signals are reset.

We don't have information about how this will be used.\n\n- PLL_LOCKG is a Bi-directional signal with weak pull high and strong pull low strength.
