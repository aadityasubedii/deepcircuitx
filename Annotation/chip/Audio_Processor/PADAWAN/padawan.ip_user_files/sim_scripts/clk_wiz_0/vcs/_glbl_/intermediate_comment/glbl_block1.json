    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for generating a ground test signal (GTS) pattern. Initially, the signal `GTS_int` is set high (1'b1). After a delay given by `TOC_WIDTH` (Time On Chip), the signal `GTS_int` is set low (1'b0). The use of a delay mechanism helps to generate this pulsating signal pattern."
