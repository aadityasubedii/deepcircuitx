    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'glbl' module is a control unit handling global signals like GSR, GTS, PRLD for system configurations and JTAG operations. Operates by initialising these to high, then toggling to low states after imparted delays set by ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH parameters. Functions as a part of system initialization process. Uses internal signals, many of which remain unused in this context. Detailed functionality is context-dependent as per system design."
