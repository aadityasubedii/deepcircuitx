It does this primarily using wires and registers. The module also contains initialization sequences to set certain registers ('GSR_int', 'PRLD_int' and 'GTS_int') which may be specific control and administration signals in the broader system, with delays defined by parameters 'ROC_WIDTH' and 'TOC_WIDTH'.
