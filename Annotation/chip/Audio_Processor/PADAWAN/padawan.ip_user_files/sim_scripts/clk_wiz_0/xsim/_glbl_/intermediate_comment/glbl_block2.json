    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes and manages the general set/reset (GSR) and parallel load (PRLD) signals in a digital logic circuit. Once the simulation begins, the GSR and PRLD signals are initially set to high ('1'). Then, after a delay defined by ROC_WIDTH, both are reset to low ('0'). The delay simulates the actual propagation delays in hardware circuitry. This design pattern is commonly used for testing in RTL verification."
