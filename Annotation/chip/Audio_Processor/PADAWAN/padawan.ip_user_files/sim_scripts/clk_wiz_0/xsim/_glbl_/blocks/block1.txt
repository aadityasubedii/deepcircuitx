This block of Verilog code initializes the variable 'GTS_int' to high (1'b1), waits for a certain amount of time (represented by 'TOC_WIDTH'), and then sets 'GTS_int' to low (1'b0). The usage of delay control '#(TOC_WIDTH)' suggests a synchronization operation which ensures the correct sequence the processor is following, possibly for safe hardware gating and/or reduction in power consumption.
