    "spec": "Module Name: glbl\n\nModule Specification: The 'glbl' module is a control module that seems to be managing global signals for a larger chip design, including parameters related to the JTAG (Joint Test Action Group - a standard for testing PCBs) and other internal control signals. \n\nDespite lacking proper input-output port declarations, the module uses various internal signals for inter-module interactions. These are primarily comprised of wire and register declarations named `GSR`, `GTS`, `PRLD`, `PROGB_GLBL`, `CCLKO_GLBL`, `FCSBO_GLBL`, `DO_GLBL`, `DI_GLBL`, `JTAG_TDO_GLBL`, `JTAG_TCK_GLBL`, `JTAG_TDI_GLBL`, `JTAG_TMS_GLBL`, `JTAG_TRST_GLBL`. In the specific context of the overall design, these signals may serve as inputs and outputs, which are assigned with the help of internal registers such as `GSR_int`, `GTS_int`, `PRLD_int`.\n\nFurthermore, the code contains a list of JTAG related register declarations, including `JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL`, `JTAG_RESET_GLBL`, `JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL`, `JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL`, `JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL`, `JTAG_SEL1_GLBL`, `JTAG_SEL2_GLBL`, `JTAG_SEL3_GLBL`, `JTAG_SEL4_GLBL`, `JTAG_USER_TDO1_GLBL`, `JTAG_USER_TDO2_GLBL`, `JTAG_USER_TDO3_GLBL`, `JTAG_USER_TDO4_GLBL`. These registers enable more finely-grained control over the JTAG operations.\n\nThe top of the code defines the module and sets the `timescale`. Following this, two parameters `ROC_WIDTH` and `TOC_WIDTH` are declared to define delays. There are two initial blocks that set up initial state and delay condition for `GSR_int`, `PRLD_int` and `GTS_int` registers. Wire assignments are made to access/update the states of these registers potentially for use in other modules. Note that these are educated insights about functionality and may vary based on the broader design context where the module is used.",
