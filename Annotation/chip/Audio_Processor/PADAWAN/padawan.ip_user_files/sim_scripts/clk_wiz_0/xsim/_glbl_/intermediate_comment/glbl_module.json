    "module": "Module-Level Comment: The 'glbl' module manages global signals within a larger chip design, including JTAG and other control signals, without explicit input-output ports. It uses internal wires (`GSR`, `GTS`, `PRLD`, etc) and registers (`GSR_int`, `GTS_int`, `PRLD_int`, etc) for inter-module communication, and controls JTAG operations through a series of JTAG-related registers. Delays are defined by parameters `ROC_WIDTH` and `TOC_WIDTH`, used in initializing certain registers in the dedicated initial blocks."
