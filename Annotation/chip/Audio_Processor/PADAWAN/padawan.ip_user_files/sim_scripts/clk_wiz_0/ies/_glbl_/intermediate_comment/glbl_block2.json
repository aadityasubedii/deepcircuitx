    "block_comment": "The block initializes and then immediately resets the Global Set Reset (`GSR_int`) and Parallel Load (`PRLD_int`) internal signals in a synchronous digital circuit. Initially, both `GSR_int` and `PRLD_int` are set to high (1'b1) after which a delay equal to `ROC_WIDTH` is introduced. Following this delay, `GSR_int` and `PRLD_int` are both reset to low (1'b0), which in a broader circuit context, might be used for placing the system in a known state before actual operation begins."
