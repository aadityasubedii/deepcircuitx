Comment: 
The block of Verilog code is an initialization sequence to control a global tristate (GTS) internal signal. Initially, the GTS_int signal is set high (1), indicating that all outputs are to be tristated or disconnected. After a delay equivalent to the width of the time to output (TOC_WIDTH), the GTS_int signal is set low (0), thereby enabling the outputs.
