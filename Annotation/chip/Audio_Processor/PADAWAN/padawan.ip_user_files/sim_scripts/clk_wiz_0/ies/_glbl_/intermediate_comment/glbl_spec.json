    "spec": "Module name: glbl. \n\nModule specification: The \"glbl\" module in Verilog acts as a potential global configuration or control module. It does not contain any explicitly defined input or output ports; however, it defines and manages certain signals which suggest it may control the global parameters or behaviors in a larger design. Parameters ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH are used to control some kind of timing or control aspects, intentionally not defined in this module. The global control signals like GSR (Global Set/Reset), GTS (Global Tri-State), GWE (Global Write Enable), and PRLD (Pre-Load) are defined, with GSR and GTS specifically initialized within the module. The module also involves PLL-related signals, p_up_tmp, and PLL_LOCKG which suggest it might be interacting with a phase-lock-loop in the larger design. \n\nCertain JTAG-related signals are declared in the module that could be for interfacing with JTAG for debugging or testing purposes. Multiple other signals and registers, generally prefixed with \u201cGLBL,\u201d are declared but not assigned or highly utilized within this module, suggesting they might serve as internal connections to other modules in a broader design. Notably, the module also contains initialization blocks for GSR_int, PRLD_int, and GTS_int signals, implying its pivotal role in controlling the initial condition of global signals in the larger hardware design. The exact functions and interactions would become clear if seen in the wider design context.",
