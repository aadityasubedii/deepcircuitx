    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"glbl\" module functions as a global controller, manipulating timing and control signals. With parameters ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH, it controls GSR(Globally Set/Reset), GTS(Global Tri-State), and PRLD(Pre-Load signals). Signals such as PLL_LOCKG and p_up_tmp hint at a relationship with a PLL. The module also maintains JTAG-related signals for testing and debugging. Further, it includes initialization blocks for GSR_int, PRLD_int, and GTS_int signals, suggesting the role in setting up initial states in the wider hardware design. The module's exact operation depends on the broader system context."
