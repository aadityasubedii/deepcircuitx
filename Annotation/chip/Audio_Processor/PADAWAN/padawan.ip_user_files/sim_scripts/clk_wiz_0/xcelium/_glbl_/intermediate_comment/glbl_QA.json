Explanation: The 'glbl' module handles some fundamental configurations and controls for a digital system implemented in FPGA. It defines and controls several parameters and signals such as GSR (Global Set/Reset), GTS (Global Tri-State), and PRLD (Parallel Load). The module also seems to manage clock configuration (CCLKO_GLBL) and JTAG communication (including TDO, TCK, etc.). The GSR and PRLD signals are initially set high then go low after a delay defined by ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH respectively, while GTS initially starts high and goes low after a period defined by TOC_WIDTH. Overall, the 'glbl' module seems to be managing global controls and settings for FPGA devices."

However, there are internal wires and reg declared which may be connected to other modules through hierarchal references.\n\nExplanation of some of the signals used in the module include:\n\n1.

The JTAG signals (JTAG_TDO_GLBL, JTAG_TCK_GLBL, JTAG_TDI_GLBL, JTAG_TMS_GLBL, and JTAG_TRST_GLBL): These are related to the JTAG interface, which is used for on-chip debugging and testing.\n\nIn addition, it uses strength attributes for its wires: weak1, weak0, strong1, strong0.\n\nAgain, without specific hardware context or module instantiation, it\u2019s hard to definitively describe inputs and outputs.
