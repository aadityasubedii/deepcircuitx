    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes the GSR_int and PRLD_int registers at the beginning of the simulation. The initial statement assigns each bit of these registers to be 1, enabling these registers. After a delay specified by ROC_WIDTH time units, the GSR_int and PRLD_int registers are cleared by assigning them 0. This enables any after operations that rely on the reset state of these registers."
