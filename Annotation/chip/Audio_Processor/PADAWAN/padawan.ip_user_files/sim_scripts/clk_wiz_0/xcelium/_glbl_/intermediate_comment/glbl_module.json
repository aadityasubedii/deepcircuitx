    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'glbl' module establishes central configurations and controls for FPGA-based systems. It manages signals like GSR (Global Set/Reset), GTS (Global Tri-State), PRLD (Parallel Load), and JTAG interfaces. Initial states are set using reg variables (GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int), with delays defined by ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH parameters. The module doesn't have explicit ports; connectivity relies on hierarchical references."
