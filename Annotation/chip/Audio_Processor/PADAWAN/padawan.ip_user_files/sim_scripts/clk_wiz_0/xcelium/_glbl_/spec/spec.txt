Module name: glbl

Module specification: The 'glbl' module is primarily responsible for the setup and control of several core configurations and signals at the global level in FPGA-based digital systems. Most importantly, it handles the signals GSR (Global Set/Reset), GTS (Global Tri-State), and PRLD (Parallel Load). However, it should be noted that this module does not explicitly define any input or output ports in the conventional sense, and its connectivity relies on hierarchical references to its internal signals.

Signal GSR is a global reset signal, GTS is a global tri-state control signal, and PRLD is a parallel load control signal. Their states are controlled and delayed in accordance to the parameters ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH. The module also features several JTAG-related signals for on-chip debugging and testing capabilities. Implementation of customized functionalities seems to be suggested by signals like JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL, JTAG_RESET_GLBL, JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL, JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL, JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL, and others.

The Verilog code consists of initial blocks to establish initial states for the control signals, followed by delay conditions. These blocks work in conjunction to ensure the accurate timing and initial states for the control signal operations. Other signals such as PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, FCSBO_GLBL, DO_GLBL, DI_GLBL, are also declared in the code but their specific functionality isn't detailed in the given module.

In summary, the 'glbl' module serves as a pivotal part in global control signal management, initial state setup and delay implementation, particularly for FPGA-based digital systems. Further contextual information may be required for a more comprehensive understanding of some of the signals and their roles in the overall system.
