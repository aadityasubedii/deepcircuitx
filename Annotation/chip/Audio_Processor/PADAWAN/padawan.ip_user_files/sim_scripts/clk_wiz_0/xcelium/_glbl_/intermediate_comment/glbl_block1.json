    "block_comment": "The block of code provides a delay scheme for signal activation. The operation begins with the `GTS_int` signal initialized to '1' in the initial statement, which effectively turns on or activates the signal. After this, a time delay defined by `TOC_WIDTH` is initiated, at the end of which, the `GTS_int` signal is reset back to '0', effectively deactivating the signal. This delay mechanism is typically used in synchronizing timing events or sequencing operations in digital hardware scenarios."
