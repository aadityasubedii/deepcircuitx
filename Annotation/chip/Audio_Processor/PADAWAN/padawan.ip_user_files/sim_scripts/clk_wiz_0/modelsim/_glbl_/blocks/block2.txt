Comment: 
This block of code is primarily responsible for initialization and timing simulation. Specifically, it starts by setting the GSR_int and PRLD_int to their reset state '1'. After a certain delay (equivalent to the ROC_WIDTH), these values are reset back to '0'. The implementation is achieved using the 'initial' keyword in Verilog, which allows the specified operation to occur at the start of the simulation. The '#' represents the time delay feature used to specify the delay between different operations, in this case, the setting and resetting of GSR_int and PRLD_int variables.
