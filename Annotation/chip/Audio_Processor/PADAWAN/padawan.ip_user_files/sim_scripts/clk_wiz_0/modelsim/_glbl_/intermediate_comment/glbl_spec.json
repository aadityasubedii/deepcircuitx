    "spec": "Module name: glbl. \nModule specification: The 'glbl' module serves the role of a global system controller for a digital design. The module seems to handle system initialization and enablement of control signals. Particularly, it manages the Global Set-Reset (GSR), Global 3-state (GTS), and Preload (PRLD) functions of the system. The module also engages with a JTAG interface for testing/debugging purposes. There are no defined explicit input ports for this module, but internal registers like GSR_int, GTS_int, and PRLD_int play the role of pseudo input signals controlling the operation. \n\nOutputs are GSR (Global Set-Reset signal), GTS (Global three-state signal), PRLD (Preload signal), PLL_LOCKG (Phase Locked Loop lock signal), PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, FCSBO_GLBL, DO_GLBL, DI_GLBL (JTAG control and data lines), and JTAG_TDO_GLBL, JTAG_TCK_GLBL, JTAG_TDI_GLBL, JTAG_TMS_GLBL, JTAG_TRST_GLBL (JTAG interface signals). Notably, 'GSR', 'GTS', and 'PRLD' are internally controlled by 'GSR_int', 'GTS_int', and 'PRLD_int' respectively. \n\nInternal signals are employed to orchestrate the functionality of the module. These signals include intermediary functions like GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int and JTAG-related operations like JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL, JTAG_RESET_GLBL, JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL, JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL, JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL and selector signals like JTAG_SEL1_GLBL to JTAG_SEL4_GLBL and user digital output signals like JTAG_USER_TDO1_GLBL to JTAG_USER_TDO4_GLBL. \n\nThe module's structure comprises two main distinct blocks, with initial blocks enabling system initialization via the activation of GSR (Global Set Reset) and PRLD (PreLoad) functions, and subsequent deactivation of the same. Another initial block enables the Global Three State (GTS) function and then disables it. The precise interaction of these control signals with the broader system would depend upon the larger context of the design.\n",

Explanation: There are no explicit input ports in this module.\n\nInteracting elements that could be considered as inputs:\n1. GSR_int\n2. GTS_int\n3.
