Module-level comment: This 'glbl' module controls system-wide initialization and control signals primarily the GSR, GTS, and PRLD. Internal intermediary signals like GSR_int, GTS_int, and PRLD_int help achieve this functionality. The module also interfaces with JTAG for testing/debugging, enabled by several JTAG-related signals. The structure mainly includes two initial blocks setting and resetting the GSR, PRLD, and the GTS function. This module acts as a crucial global controller in the broader digital design setup.
