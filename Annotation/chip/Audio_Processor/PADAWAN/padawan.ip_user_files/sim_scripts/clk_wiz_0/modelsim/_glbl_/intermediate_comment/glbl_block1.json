    "block_comment": "This block of code is a delay operation for the GTS_int signal. It starts by initializing the GTS_int signal to a high state (`1'b1`). It then waits for a period specified by `TOC_WIDTH` after which the GTS_int signal is set to a low state (`1'b0`). This method essentially operates as a timer that changes the state of the GTS_int signal after the elapse of certain timing conditions."
