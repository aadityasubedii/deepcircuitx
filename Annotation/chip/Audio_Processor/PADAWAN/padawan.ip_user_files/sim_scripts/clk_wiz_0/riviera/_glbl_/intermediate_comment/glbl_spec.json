    "spec": "Module name: glbl. \n\nModule specification: The 'glbl' module in Verilog serves as a controller or top-level module, initialising and conditioning the state of global control signals like GSR (GeNeral Set-Reset), GTS (Global Three-state), GWE (Global Write Enables), PRLD, amongst others for system-wide use in FPGA design. Moreover, this module also manages the state of JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) signals. \n\nDespite lacking explicit input or output declarations, the 'glbl' module manifests several signals that connect with various system-wide components. Signals such as GSR, GTS, GWE, PRLD and others like PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, FCSBO_GLBL, DO_GLBL, DI_GLBL etc., are assumed inputs shared across modules. On the other hand, signals such as JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL, JTAG_RESET_GLBL, JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL, JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL, JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL, JTAG_SEL1_GLBL, JTAG_SEL2_GLBL, JTAG_SEL3_GLBL, JTAG_SEL4_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO1_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO2_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO3_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO4_GLBL are internally generated and are expected to be used globally throughout the system. \n\nInternally, the 'glbl' module uses signals such as GSR, GTS, GWE, PRLD for control and synchronization and PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, FCSBO_GLBL, DO_GLBL, DI_GLBL for data and configuration operations. GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int are internal registers controlling the state of GSR, GTS, and PRLD respectively. Additionally, JTAG signals are used for system-level communication activities like testing and debugging. \n\nThe module's code primarily features two 'initial' blocks setting initial values and transitions of GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int signals, effectively conditioning the state of GSR, GTS, PRLD signals for the system-wide use. In sum, the 'glbl' module defines and controls global signals that link to multiple hardware modules, facilitating comprehensive FPGA operations.\n",

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nThe 'glbl' module does not explicitly define any input or output ports using standard Verilog `input` or `output` declarations. However, it defines several internal wires and registers which are not inputs or outputs in a strict sense, but are implied to connect to other modules or system-wide components.\n\n1. Input ports: None explicitly defined in the module. But there are implied global input signals inferred through their usages. \n   Explanation: In this code, no input ports have been declared. But, signals like GSR, GTS, GWE, PRLD, PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, FCSBO_GLBL, DO_GLBL, DI_GLBL, JTAG_TDO_GLBL, JTAG_TCK_GLBL, JTAG_TDI_GLBL, JTAG_TMS_GLBL, JTAG_TRST_GLBL etc., indicates global signals that can be shared by multiple modules.\n\n2. Output ports: None explicitly defined in this code, but some signals are implied to be outputs.\n   Explanation: Similar to inputs, no discrete output ports have been declared. But there are numerous signals like JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL, JTAG_RESET_GLBL, JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL, JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL, JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL, JTAG_SEL1_GLBL, JTAG_SEL2_GLBL, JTAG_SEL3_GLBL, JTAG_SEL4_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO1_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO2_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO3_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO4_GLBL etc. that are reg-type indicating these might be fed into other modules or system wide operations.\n\nNOTE: This module is more of a definitional or behavioral module rather than an interface with explicit inputs and outputs. It appears to be defining global variables and signals that are expected to be used globally throughout the system. For this reason, it's not straightforward to classify signals as conventional inputs or outputs. Instead, the connections are likely inferred by their use in the overall system design."
