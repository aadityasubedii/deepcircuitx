The module manages control signals that are used across the design such as the GeNeral Set-Reset (GSR), Global Three-state (GTS), and the configuration-related programming signals (PRLD, among others).

However, it defines several internal wires and registers which are not inputs or outputs in a strict sense, but are implied to connect to other modules or system-wide components.\n\n1. Input ports: None explicitly defined in the module. But there are implied global input signals inferred through their usages. \n   Explanation: In this code, no input ports have been declared. But, signals like GSR, GTS, GWE, PRLD, PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, FCSBO_GLBL, DO_GLBL, DI_GLBL, JTAG_TDO_GLBL, JTAG_TCK_GLBL, JTAG_TDI_GLBL, JTAG_TMS_GLBL, JTAG_TRST_GLBL etc., indicates global signals that can be shared by multiple modules.\n\n2. Output ports: None explicitly defined in this code, but some signals are implied to be outputs.\n   Explanation: Similar to inputs, no discrete output ports have been declared. But there are numerous signals like JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL, JTAG_RESET_GLBL, JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL, JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL, JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL, JTAG_SEL1_GLBL, JTAG_SEL2_GLBL, JTAG_SEL3_GLBL, JTAG_SEL4_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO1_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO2_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO3_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO4_GLBL etc. that are reg-type indicating these might be fed into other modules or system wide operations.\n\nNOTE: This module is more of a definitional or behavioral module rather than an interface with explicit inputs and outputs. It appears to be defining global variables and signals that are expected to be used globally throughout the system. For this reason, it's not straightforward to classify signals as conventional inputs or outputs. Instead, the connections are likely inferred by their use in the overall system design."
