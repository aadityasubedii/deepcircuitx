    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'glbl' module is a top-level controller that initializes and manages global signals of FPGA configurations, including GSR, GTS, GWE, PRLD, and JTAG signals. These signals serve various functions, including system reset, three-stating global I/Os, testing, and debugging. Implementation involves defining internal registers (GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int) and initial blocks to control signal states, enabling use across multiple modules for robust FPGA operations."
