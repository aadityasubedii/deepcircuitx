    "block_comment": "The block is an initial block in Verilog that is used to define the initial state of the GTS_int signal. At simulation start, the signal GTS_int is initially set high (\"1\"). Then, after a delay equivalent to the width of Time of Circuit (TOC_WIDTH), the signal is set low (\"0\"). Having such a design provides a reliable way to produce a delayed response in simulation for the signal GTS_int."
