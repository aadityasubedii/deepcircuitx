Comment: 
This block of code is used for initialization purposes in a Verilog module. It begins by setting system reset (`GSR_int`) and parallel load (`PRLD_int`) to a binary value of one, thus initiating the reset and preload process. After a delay equal to the width of the ring-oscillator (`ROC_WIDTH`), both `GSR_int` and `PRLD_int` are set to a binary value of zero, ending the initial reset and preload procedures. This implementation uses the `initial begin` and `end` statements for establishing the initial conditions of the hardware design.
