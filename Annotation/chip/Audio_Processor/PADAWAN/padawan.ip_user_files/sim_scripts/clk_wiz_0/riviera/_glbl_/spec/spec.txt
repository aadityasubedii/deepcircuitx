Module name: glbl. 

Module specification: The 'glbl' module in Verilog serves as a controller or top-level module, initialising and conditioning the state of global control signals like GSR (GeNeral Set-Reset), GTS (Global Three-state), GWE (Global Write Enables), PRLD, amongst others for system-wide use in FPGA design. Moreover, this module also manages the state of JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) signals. 

Despite lacking explicit input or output declarations, the 'glbl' module manifests several signals that connect with various system-wide components. Signals such as GSR, GTS, GWE, PRLD and others like PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, FCSBO_GLBL, DO_GLBL, DI_GLBL etc., are assumed inputs shared across modules. On the other hand, signals such as JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL, JTAG_RESET_GLBL, JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL, JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL, JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL, JTAG_SEL1_GLBL, JTAG_SEL2_GLBL, JTAG_SEL3_GLBL, JTAG_SEL4_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO1_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO2_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO3_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO4_GLBL are internally generated and are expected to be used globally throughout the system. 

Internally, the 'glbl' module uses signals such as GSR, GTS, GWE, PRLD for control and synchronization and PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, FCSBO_GLBL, DO_GLBL, DI_GLBL for data and configuration operations. GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int are internal registers controlling the state of GSR, GTS, and PRLD respectively. Additionally, JTAG signals are used for system-level communication activities like testing and debugging. 

The module's code primarily features two 'initial' blocks setting initial values and transitions of GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int signals, effectively conditioning the state of GSR, GTS, PRLD signals for the system-wide use. In sum, the 'glbl' module defines and controls global signals that link to multiple hardware modules, facilitating comprehensive FPGA operations.
