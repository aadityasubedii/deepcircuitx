    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for generating a Global Tristate (GTS) signal for a digital system. This function is especially beneficial in synchronizing entire systems. In terms of implementation, this block first sets the 'GTS_int' signal to logic high. After a delay of 'TOC_WIDTH' time units, it changes the 'GTS_int' signal to logic low. This specific timing control helps in defining the execution sequence of events within a given system."
