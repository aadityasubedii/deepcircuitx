There are no explicitly defined input and output ports. Signals like GSR, GTS, PRLD, PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, DO_GLBL, DI_GLBL and others could potentially act as either inputs or outputs.\n\nThe module comprises of several internal signals. These include GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int which hold states of global control signals. There are also signals for JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) for testing integrated circuits like JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL, JTAG_RESET_GLBL, JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL, JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL, JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL. Furthermore, there are register selectors for in-chip circuits for testing like JTAG_SEL1_GLBL, JTAG_SEL2_GLBL, JTAG_SEL3_GLBL, JTAG_SEL4_GLBL and outputs for the same like JTAG_USER_TDO1_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO2_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO3_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO4_GLBL.\n\nThe module has two initial blocks indicating behavior of GSR, GTS and PRLD signals for ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH time units. Initially, both GSR and PRLD are set and reset after ROC_WIDTH time. Similarly, GTS is set initially and reset after TOC_WIDTH time units. Here, ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH are user-defined parameters governing widths of these signals. Presence of these initial blocks suggest synchronization of important operations at the system level.",

It has wires for Global Set/Reset (GSR), Global Tri-State (GTS), active-low asynchronous preset (PRLD) and other various input-output and control signals. Additionally, several registers are defined that might be used to internally maintain the state of these global control signals.
