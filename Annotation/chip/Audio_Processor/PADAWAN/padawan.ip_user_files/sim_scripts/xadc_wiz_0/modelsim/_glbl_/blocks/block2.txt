Comment: 
This block initializes and resets the GSR_int and PRLD_int signals. It begins by setting both signals to high voltage level '1'. After a delay equal to the width of the ring oscillator (ROC_WIDTH), the block sets GSR_int and PRLD_int to low voltage level '0', effectively resetting them. This code block will be executed once when simulation is started.
