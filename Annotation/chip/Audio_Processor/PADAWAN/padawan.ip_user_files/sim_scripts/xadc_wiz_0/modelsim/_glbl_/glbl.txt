Module-level comment: The 'glbl' module acts as a top-level controller, defining global signals. It uses internal registers (GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int) to control the states of GSR, GTS, PRLD signals. It includes JTAG signals for chip testing and selectors for in-chip circuits. Initial blocks synchronize GSR/PRLD and GTS for ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH time, crucial for system-wide operations.
