Parameters ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH are set which are used to control delay times. This module is primarily defining and initializing global control signals (such as GSR, GTS, JTAG related signals) and keeps them at reset state initially. The operations in the initial blocks suggest that after a certain delay, the GSR, PRLD, and GTS signals are reset to 0. There seems to be an implementation of JTAG state machine signals, but their particular functionality isn't defined in this code block. Also, the module includes definitions for various wires and registries, such as for JTAG related signals and user definable outputs, and it configures particular signal strengths for some of these using assign statements. Please note that without more context or comments, it is difficult to define with certainty the detailed functionality and purpose of each signal."
