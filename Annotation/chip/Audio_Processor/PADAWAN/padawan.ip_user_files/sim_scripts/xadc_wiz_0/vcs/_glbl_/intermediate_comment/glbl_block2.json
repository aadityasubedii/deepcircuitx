    "block_comment": "This block of code is centered around initializing and resetting internal control signals. Initially, it sets the GSR_int and PRLD_int signals to high, effectively enabling globally set/reset and preloading. After a delay equivalent to the size of the ring oscillator circuit (ROC_WIDTH), the signals are reset, thus disabling the global set/reset and the preload feature. This sequential operation ensures that all flip-flops in the FPGA are set to a known state before regular operation begins."
