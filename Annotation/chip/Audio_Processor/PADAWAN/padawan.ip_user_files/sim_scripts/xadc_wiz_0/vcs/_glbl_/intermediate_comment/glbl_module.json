    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'glbl' module serves as a global control structure within an FPGA, operating with internally defined signals and parameters. Initial blocks set and reset control signals `GSR_int`, `PRLD_int`, and `GTS_int` with respective delays. Signals related to programming, phase synchronization, data flow, and JTAG interface are also defined and utilized. This module appears to be key in managing FPGA's internal controls and communication mechanisms, although its specific interactions within a larger framework are not defined here."
