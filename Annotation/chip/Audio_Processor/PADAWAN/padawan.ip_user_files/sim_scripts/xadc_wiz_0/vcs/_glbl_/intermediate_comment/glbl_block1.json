    "block_comment": "The block initializes and controls the behavior of the signal `GTS_int` over a specific simulation time period. Initially, `GTS_int` is set to a high-level `1'b1`. After a delay period denoted by `TOC_WIDTH`, the same signal `GTS_int` is set to a low-level `1'b0`. The purpose of this block is to generate a temporary high-level pulse on `GTS_int` for the duration defined by `TOC_WIDTH` in order to simulate specific timing conditions."
