GSR, GTS, PRLD: These are wire signals and are used as global set/reset, tri-state and preload signals respectively, governing overall operation. Their logic versions named GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int are used to drive these signals.\n2. GWE: Another wire signal, perhaps represents Global Write Enable. Its function is not clear in the given context.\n3. p_up_tmp, PLL_LOCKG: Posedge triggered update temp wire used for a tri-state bus with a weak pullup. PLL_LOCKG follows this signal's state.\n4. PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, FCSBO_GLBL: These seem like global configuration signals but their role is unclear from the given context.\n5. DO_GLBL, DI_GLBL: 4-bit data out and data in signals respectively but their purpose is unclear without further context.\n6. JTAG_TDO_GLBL, JTAG_TCK_GLBL, JTAG_TDI_GLBL, JTAG_TMS_GLBL, JTAG_TRST_GLBL: Typical JTAG interface signals representing data out, clock, data in, mode select and reset respectively.\n7. JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL, JTAG_RESET_GLBL, JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL, JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL, JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL: These are JTAG TAP controller state signals, likely used for state machine operation.\n8.

Possibly used to control different JTAG scans or operations.\n\nPlease note, without additional context or comments it's challenging to ascertain the exact purpose of these signals.
