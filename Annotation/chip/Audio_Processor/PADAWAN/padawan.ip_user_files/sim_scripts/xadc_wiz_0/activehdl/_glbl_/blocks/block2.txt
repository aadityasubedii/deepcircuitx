The block of code is an initial block meant to initialize the GSR_int and PRLD_int signals. It does so by initially setting these signals to a binary '1'. After a delay, denoted by '#(ROC_WIDTH)', these signals are set to a binary '0'. This method is typically used in simulation procedures to ensure stable initial conditions for the subsequent operations of a Verilog RTL design.
