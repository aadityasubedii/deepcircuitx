    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to manage global tristate signals (GTS) in the initial state. At the beginning, it sets the 'GTS_int' signal high ('1'b1), effectively enabling the tristate buffer, then after a delay defined by 'TOC_WIDTH', it drives the 'GTS_int' signal low ('0'b0), which disables the tristate buffer. This toggling mechanism is crucial for controlling the sharing of a single line among multiple outputs."
