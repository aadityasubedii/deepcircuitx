Module Name: glbl

Module Specification: The 'glbl' module appears to be a top-level or global configuration module. As the name suggests, it likely handles different global signals and configurations. The specific functionality of the module is unclear, due to the lack of detailed comments and context, however some inferences can be made based on conventions and the given code. 

Though specific input and output ports are not explicitly listed in the original Verilog code, there are signals which could potentially be classified as input, output, or inout. However, without further context, it is challenging to confirm these. Commonly, JTAG signals could represent inputs and outputs, where 'JTAG_TCK_GLBL','JTAG_TDI_GLBL', 'JTAG_TMS_GLBL' and 'JTAG_TRST_GLBL' could serve as input signals and 'JTAG_TDO_GLBL' potentially being an output signal. 'p_up_tmp' and 'PLL_LOCKG' could represent tri-state (input/output) signals. 

The internal signals used in the module vary from configuration signals such as 'GSR', 'GTS', 'PRLD', to tri-state signals like 'p_up_tmp' and 'PLL_LOCKG', and JTAG related signals ('JTAG_TDO_GLBL', 'JTAG_TCK_GLBL', etc). These signals likely handle global set/reset, tri-state, communications via JTAG interface, and related operations.

Looking at the code blocks, there are declarations, assignments, and two 'initial' blocks which initialize the 'GSR_int', 'PRLD_int', and 'GTS_int' values after certain delay specified by 'ROC_WIDTH' and 'TOC_WIDTH' respectively. It's assumed that these delays are part of global configuration or a synchronization mechanism. 

In essence, the 'glbl' module might serve as a central control module dealing with global configurations, interfacing and state control in a larger system. To ascertain precise details and functionality, a more comprehensive code with clarified port usage and detailed comments would be required.
