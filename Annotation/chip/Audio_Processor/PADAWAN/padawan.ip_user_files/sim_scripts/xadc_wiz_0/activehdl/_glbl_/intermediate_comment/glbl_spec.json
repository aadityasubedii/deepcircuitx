    "spec": "Module Name: glbl\n\nModule Specification: The 'glbl' module appears to be a top-level or global configuration module. As the name suggests, it likely handles different global signals and configurations. The specific functionality of the module is unclear, due to the lack of detailed comments and context, however some inferences can be made based on conventions and the given code. \n\nThough specific input and output ports are not explicitly listed in the original Verilog code, there are signals which could potentially be classified as input, output, or inout. However, without further context, it is challenging to confirm these. Commonly, JTAG signals could represent inputs and outputs, where 'JTAG_TCK_GLBL','JTAG_TDI_GLBL', 'JTAG_TMS_GLBL' and 'JTAG_TRST_GLBL' could serve as input signals and 'JTAG_TDO_GLBL' potentially being an output signal. 'p_up_tmp' and 'PLL_LOCKG' could represent tri-state (input/output) signals. \n\nThe internal signals used in the module vary from configuration signals such as 'GSR', 'GTS', 'PRLD', to tri-state signals like 'p_up_tmp' and 'PLL_LOCKG', and JTAG related signals ('JTAG_TDO_GLBL', 'JTAG_TCK_GLBL', etc). These signals likely handle global set/reset, tri-state, communications via JTAG interface, and related operations.\n\nLooking at the code blocks, there are declarations, assignments, and two 'initial' blocks which initialize the 'GSR_int', 'PRLD_int', and 'GTS_int' values after certain delay specified by 'ROC_WIDTH' and 'TOC_WIDTH' respectively. It's assumed that these delays are part of global configuration or a synchronization mechanism. \n\nIn essence, the 'glbl' module might serve as a central control module dealing with global configurations, interfacing and state control in a larger system. To ascertain precise details and functionality, a more comprehensive code with clarified port usage and detailed comments would be required.\n",

All signals are declared either as `wire` or `reg` without specifying the direction. In ideal circumstances, to determine the role of the port (be it input, output, or inout), one needs to see its usage in the context of the module like how it's driving other modules or how it's being driven. But unfortunately, the given code doesn't provide enough context to speculate about input or output ports.\n\nHowever, there are certain signals that can be inferred based on general circuit design conventions, for instance, JTAG signals like `JTAG_TCK_GLBL`,`JTAG_TDI_GLBL`, `JTAG_TMS_GLBL`,`JTAG_TRST_GLBL` are generally used as input signals in a design. Similarly, `JTAG_TDO_GLBL` is generally used as an output signal.
