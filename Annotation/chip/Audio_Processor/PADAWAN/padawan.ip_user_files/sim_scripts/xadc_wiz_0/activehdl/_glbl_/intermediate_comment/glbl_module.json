    "module": "Module-level Comment: The 'glbl' is a global configuration module handling several system-wide signals. The module utilizes internal signals including set/reset ('GSR_int', 'PRLD_int'), tri-state control ('GTS_int'), and JTAG interface signals for operation. Its function is initialized in two stages, controlled by 'ROC_WIDTH' and 'TOC_WIDTH'. Typically, glbl manages global states, deals with JTAG interfacing, and exerts system control; however, a more intricate explanation needs explicit port definition and elaborated code."
