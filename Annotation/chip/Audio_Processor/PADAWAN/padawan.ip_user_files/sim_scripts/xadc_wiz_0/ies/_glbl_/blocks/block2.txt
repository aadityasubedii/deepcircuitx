Comment: 
This block of code is a part of an initial block providing the initial setup of sequential circuits in Verilog. It sets the initial states of GSR_int and PRLD_int signals to high (1'b1), waits for a specific duration equivalent to ROC_WIDTH, then subsequently sets these signals to low (1'b0). This mechanism is often used for global set/reset (GSR) and parallel load (PRLD) functions in digital systems' startup sequences.
