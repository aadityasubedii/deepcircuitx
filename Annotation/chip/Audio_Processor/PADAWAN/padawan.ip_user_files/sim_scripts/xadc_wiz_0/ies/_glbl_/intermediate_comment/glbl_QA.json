'GWE': The purpose of this signal is not defined in the module, but usually it represents \u201cGlobal Write Enable\u201d in memory systems.\n4. 'PRLD': This usually stands for ParaLlel LoaD.

'PLL_LOCKG': PLL lock signal often represents that the Phase Lock Loop has attained stable frequency and phase. It's weakly driven by 'p_up_tmp'.\n7. 'PROGB_GLBL', 'CCLKO_GLBL', 'FCSBO_GLBL', 'DO_GLBL', 'DI_GLBL': Not explicitly used in the code, but they seem to be related to programming control.\n8. 'GSR_int', 'GTS_int', 'PRLD_int': Internal versions of GSR, GTS, PRLD signals, used for assignments and manipulation within the module.\n9. 'JTAG_TDO_GLBL', 'JTAG_TCK_GLBL', 'JTAG_TDI_GLBL', 'JTAG_TMS_GLBL', 'JTAG_TRST_GLBL': JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) interface signals used for on-chip debug and testing purposes.\n10.
