    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to set the GTS_int signal, which is initially set high, and then set low after a delay period. The delay is defined by the parameter TOC_WIDTH. This process is implemented using an initial block, which will execute at time 0, and a delay control statement (#), which introduces the desired delay before changing GTS_int to low."
