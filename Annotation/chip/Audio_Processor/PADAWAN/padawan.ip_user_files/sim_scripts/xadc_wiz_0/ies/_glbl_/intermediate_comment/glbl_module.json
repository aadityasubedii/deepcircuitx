    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'glbl' module serves as a global controller within an FPGA, manipulating a variety of wires and registers for overall control, including the global set/reset (GSR), global tri-state (GTS), and programming functions. Values initially set in the module dictate behavior of various control signals. The module interfaces with a JTAG for chip-level testing and programming. It primarily consists of a declaration section defining the various components, and an initialization section setting up initial states. Delays for GSR and GTS are controlled by ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH parameters respectively."
