Module name: glbl. 

Module specification: The ‘glbl’ module acts as a global controller for an FPGA or similar programmable digital logic device. It defines several parameters, wires, and registers, to perform control functionalities like global set/reset (GSR), global tri-state (GTS), programming enable (PRLD), clock (CCLKO), and more. The 'glbl' module uses implied output ports like GSR, GTS, PRLD, PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, and other JTAG related signals for overall control functionalities and testing. The input ports include registers in the JTAG family: JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL, JTAG_RESET_GLBL, JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL, JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL, JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL which perform corresponding control operations. 

Internally, the module uses signals like ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH for delay control. GSR, GTS, and PRLD for global set/reset and parallel load functionalities. JTAG related signals for on-chip debug and testing. Furthermore, it involves user-defined JTAG output signals for customizable debugging or testing signals. The states and values of these variables are initially set in the module.

The module consists of different blocks primarily declaration and initialization sections. The declaration section defines all the parameters, wires, and registers used in the module. The initialization section initializes all the inputs, outputs, and internal registers. The delay widths for the global reset and tri-state controls are specified by the ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH parameters respectively. Additionally, a JTAG interface is also incorporated for chip-level testing and programming. Overall, the module lays the groundwork for a complex system's global control.
