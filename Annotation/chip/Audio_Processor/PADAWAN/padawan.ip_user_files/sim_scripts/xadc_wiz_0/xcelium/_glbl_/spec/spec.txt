Module name: glbl. 

Module specification: The 'glbl' module is a standard system component typically present in Xilinx FPGA designs. It does not possess any explicit input or output ports. This module is primarily used for controlling global properties such as reset (GSR), tristate (GTS), and configuration-related signals. 

The 'glbl' module contains multiple internal signals and registers. GSR_int and GTS_int are initialized to high and then set low after a pre-specified period, operating as the internal version of global reset and tristate signals respectively. There is also an internal signal for preloading values, PRLD_int. Another set of signals revolves around JTAG operations for testing, debugging, and accessing the FPGA states, including signals for capturing, resetting, shifting, updating, run testing, selection lines and user data registers. 

This module consists of mainly two initial blocks. The first block initializes GSR_int, PRLD_int to high and then sets them low after ROC_WIDTH delay, simulating a reset operation. The second initial block is similar, but it works with GTS_int and uses TOC_WIDTH as delay, controlling the default state. 

The 'glbl' module syntax relies heavily on parameterized delays and internal signal assignments providing their strengths, making the module highly flexible and capable of integrating with a variety of digital designs seamlessly.
