Module-level comment: The 'glbl' module manages global properties in Xilinx FPGA designs without explicit I/O ports. It utilizes internal signals for global reset (GSR_int), tristate (GTS_int), preloading values (PRLD_int), and JTAG operation control. Initial blocks implement parameterized delays for GSR, GTS, and PRLD to simulate reset operations. Inputs and outputs are internally assigned with strong and weak strengths, enhancing the module's flexibility for integration with various digital designs.
