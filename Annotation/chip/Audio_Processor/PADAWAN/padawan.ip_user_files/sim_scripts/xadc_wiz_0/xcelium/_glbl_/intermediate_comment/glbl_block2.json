    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes certain control signals in a synchronous system. The GSR_int and PRLD_int signals are initially set to high, then they're delayed by the amount of time specified in ROC_WIDTH, and finally, are set to low. The initial keyword in Verilog denotes the block is only executed once at the start, useful for setting an initial state. The delay '#' is used to model propagation delays through the hardware elements."
