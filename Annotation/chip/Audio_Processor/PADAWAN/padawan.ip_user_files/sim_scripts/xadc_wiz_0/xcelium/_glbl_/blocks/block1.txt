Comment: 
The block of code initially forces a logic high state to the signal GTS_int. After a delay determined by TOC_WIDTH, GTS_int then transitions to a logic low state. The delay is coded using the Verilog '#' delay mechanism, thus facilitating simulation of communication delays or timing constraints inherent in the actual hardware implementation.
