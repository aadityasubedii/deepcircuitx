Explanation: The 'glbl' module is part of the standard system setup and it is often times included in Xilinx FPGA designs. It is typically used for global reset (GSR), global tristate (GTS), and configuration-related signals. These global signals are commonly used for synchronous resets or to set default states. This module doesn't contain any explicit functionality in its definition, but it plays a critical role in controlling global properties of the design."
