This block of code is meant to instantiate two binary signals (GSR_int and PRLD_int) and initialize them to logic high (1'b1), effectively resetting the logic system undergoing operation. It then turns these signals off after a delay equivalent to the width of the ring oscillator (ROC_WIDTH). In this way, it sets the initial conditions for the digital system, allowing for a predictable and controlled start to the operations. As such, this initialization and reset process is vital for system stability and reliable function.
