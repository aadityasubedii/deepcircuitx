Module-level comment: The 'glbl' module is a global control module for digital circuit designs. It uses internal registers and parameters to perform operations like Global Set/Reset, Global 3-state, Parallel Load, and JTAG debugging. Initialization is achieved through 'initial' blocks for setting and releasing these controls based on ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH parameters. JTAG signals are used for on-chip debugging. Outputs are inferred from internal registers with values assigned within the module.
