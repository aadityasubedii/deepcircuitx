Module name: glbl.

Module specification: The glbl module appears to serve as a global control module for a digital circuit design, including parameters, wire, and register declarations for various operations. It is instantiated without explicit input or output ports, but it uses parameters as inputs and internal registers as outputs. Key internal signals include GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int, controls for Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) operations, several JTAG selector signals, and user-specific Test Data Outputs (TDO). The functionality of this module is determined by the two 'initial' blocks. 

Input parameters ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH can be considered as inputs and set the release time for the GSR, GTS, and PRLD signals. Wire signals like JTAG signals(JTAG_TDI_GLBL, JTAG_TCK_GLBL, etc.) can also serve as inputs.

The module does not have explicit output ports but signals like GSR, GTS, PRLD, and JTAG_TDO_GLBL can be assumed as potential outputs, as the assigned values originate from within the module.

Internal signals like GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int control global Set/Reset, Global 3-state and Parallel Load signals. Other internal signals link to JTAG operations which are used for on-chip debugging functionalities. Signals starting with JTAG are used for the controls of JTAG operations, while the signals JTAG_USER_TDOx_GLBL are user-specific test data outputs.

Within the scope of this module, multiple initial blocks are used to define the initial status of the declared registers GSR_int, GTS_int, and PRLD_int and schedule their release after specific delay periods defined by ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH parameters. These operations naturally define the behaviour of the global control signals GSR, GTS, PRLD generated by this module.
