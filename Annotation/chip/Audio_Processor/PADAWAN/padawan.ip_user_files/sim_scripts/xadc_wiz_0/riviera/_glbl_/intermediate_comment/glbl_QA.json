Internal signals: `GSR_int`, `GTS_int`, `PRLD_int`\nExplanation: These signals are used as an intermediate stage between the external input signals and the model's outputs (`GSR`, `GTS`, `PRLD`). They might represent internal stages of a state machine operating GSR (Global Set/Reset - a signal that sets/resets all the flip-flops in the FPGA), GTS (Global Tri-State - a signal to put all outputs in high impedance state), and PRLD (Parallel load - a signal to load parallel data).\n\n2. Internal signals: `JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL`, `JTAG_RESET_GLBL`, `JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL`, `JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL`, `JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL`\nExplanation: These signals are associated with JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) operations, which are commonly used for on-chip debugging functionalities. The specifics of how these are being used would depend on the broader context, but general operation includes capturing and shifting data, running tests, and resetting or updating the system.\n\n3. Internal signals: `JTAG_SEL1_GLBL`, `JTAG_SEL2_GLBL`, `JTAG_SEL3_GLBL`, `JTAG_SEL4_GLBL`\nExplanation: These signals might be selectors or multiplexers used in the context of JTAG operations for selection of different test data inputs. \n\n4. Internal signals: `JTAG_USER_TDO1_GLBL`, `JTAG_USER_TDO2_GLBL`, `JTAG_USER_TDO3_GLBL`, `JTAG_USER_TDO4_GLBL`\nExplanation: Again referring to JTAG operations, these signals suggest user-specific Test Data Outputs (TDO). Test Data Output is typically the output data from the device being tested or debugged.\n\n5. Internal signals: `p_up_tmp`\nExplanation: Temporary tri-state output drive strength signal used to assign a drive strength to another signal.\n\nBear in mind these interpretations are logical deductions from the given code.
