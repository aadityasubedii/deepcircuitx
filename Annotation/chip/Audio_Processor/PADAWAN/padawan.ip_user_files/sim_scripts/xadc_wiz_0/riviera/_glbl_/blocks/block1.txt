Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for the initialization and control of the internal signal 'GTS_int'. At the start, 'GTS_int' is initially set to 1 (logic high), indicating that the system is in a standby or idle state. After a certain period, dictated by the 'TOC_WIDTH' time constant, 'GTS_int' switches to 0 (logic low), moving the system into an active or operational state. This block's functionality thus provides a controlled delay mechanism to ensure that the system only operates after the necessary prep time has elapsed.
