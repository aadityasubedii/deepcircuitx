Module name: glbl. 

Module specification: The 'glbl' module serves the functionality of a global control system or configuration unit for the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), and possibly considered for test access and control purposes during hardware debugging and testing phases. 
The module itself does not explicitly define input and output ports. However, it does define several signals (wire and reg type) which may be used as inputs or outputs in the context of a larger hardware design. 

The internal signals declared include GSR, GTS, PRLD, and their corresponding internal signals GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int, which are used to control states of the FPGA (like Reset, Test, and Preload). It also uses standard JTAG interface signals (JTAG_TDO_GLBL, JTAG_TCK_GLBL, JTAG_TDI_GLBL, JTAG_TMS_GLBL, JTAG_TRST_GLBL), and state controlling signals for a typical JTAG state machine (JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL, JTAG_RESET_GLBL, JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL, JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL, JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL). 

There are four JTAG selection signals (JTAG_SEL1_GLBL to JTAG_SEL4_GLBL) which indicate the usage for choosing different JTAG modules or functionalities. Along with that, it has user-definable Test Data Out signals for the JTAG interface (JTAG_USER_TDO1_GLBL to JTAG_USER_TDO4_GLBL). 

The code also presents two initial blocks for setting and controlling the timing of the states of GSR_int, PRLD_int, and GTS_int signals with time intervals determined by ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH parameters. 

This module's primary role seems to manage the timing and control signal states for synchronous operations, hinting towards a focal role in a larger hardware design setup.
