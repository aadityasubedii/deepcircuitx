    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'glbl' module acts as a global control and configuration unit for an FPGA, managing key control signals (like GSR, GTS, PRLD) and JTAG protocol related signals for hardware testing. Timing is regulated by the parameters ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH. The module does not define explicit I/O ports but utilizes internal signals which may serve as I/O in a larger design context.\n"
