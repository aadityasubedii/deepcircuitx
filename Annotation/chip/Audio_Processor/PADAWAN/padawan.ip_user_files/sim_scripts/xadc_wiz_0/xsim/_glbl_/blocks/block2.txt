Comment: 
This initial block in Verilog is used to perform a reset-like operation and preload action. Initially, it sets 'GSR_int' and 'PRLD_int' to high logic level (1'b1), implying global set/reset and preload respectively. After a certain delay equivalent to 'ROC_WIDTH', these both signals are pulled low (1'b0), indicating the end of the set/reset and preload operations.
