However, it does define several signals (wire and reg type) which may be used as inputs or outputs in the context of a larger hardware design. \n\nThe internal signals declared include GSR, GTS, PRLD, and their corresponding internal signals GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int, which are used to control states of the FPGA (like Reset, Test, and Preload). It also uses standard JTAG interface signals (JTAG_TDO_GLBL, JTAG_TCK_GLBL, JTAG_TDI_GLBL, JTAG_TMS_GLBL, JTAG_TRST_GLBL), and state controlling signals for a typical JTAG state machine (JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL, JTAG_RESET_GLBL, JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL, JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL, JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL). \n\nThere are four JTAG selection signals (JTAG_SEL1_GLBL to JTAG_SEL4_GLBL) which indicate the usage for choosing different JTAG modules or functionalities. Along with that, it has user-definable Test Data Out signals for the JTAG interface (JTAG_USER_TDO1_GLBL to JTAG_USER_TDO4_GLBL). \n\nThe code also presents two initial blocks for setting and controlling the timing of the states of GSR_int, PRLD_int, and GTS_int signals with time intervals determined by ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH parameters. \n\nThis module's primary role seems to manage the timing and control signal states for synchronous operations, hinting towards a focal role in a larger hardware design setup.",
