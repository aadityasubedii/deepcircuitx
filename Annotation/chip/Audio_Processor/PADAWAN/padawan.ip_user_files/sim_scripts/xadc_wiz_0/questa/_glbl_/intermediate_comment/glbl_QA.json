However, it appears to be a global control module used for setting up various global control signals, possibly for chip level or design level control. It defines several parameters, wires, and registers mainly related to system-wide controls such as Global Set/Reset (GSR), Global Tri-state (GTS), and PRLD function. It also involves JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) signals supporting JTAG boundary scan for hardware debugging and system verification. The module also has initial blocks to set initial conditions for GSR, GTS, and PRLD signals."
