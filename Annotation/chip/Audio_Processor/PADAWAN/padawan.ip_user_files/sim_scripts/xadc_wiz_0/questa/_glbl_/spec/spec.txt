Module name: glbl.

Module specification: 

The 'glbl' module is a global control module which is likely to be instantiated at a top-level module and used throughout the design. The module does not have explicitly defined input or output ports. However, it makes use of various wire and reg variables like GSR, GTS, GWE, PRLD, PROGB_GLBL, and JTAG related signals typically used in testing and debugging. 

In terms of functionality, the 'glbl' module sets up various global control signals like Global Set/Reset (GSR), Global Tri-state (GTS), and another control signal PRLD. The parameters ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH are used to initialize GSR, GTS, and PRLD respectively. It is involved in potentially supporting JTAG boundary scan for hardware debugging and system verification. 

This module also makes use of JTAG signals such as JTAG_TDO_GLBL, JTAG_TCK_GLBL, JTAG_TDI_GLBL, JTAG_TMS_GLBL, JTAG_TRST_GLBL to control different states of a JTAG state machine. In addition to these, it also makes use of signals Selector signals like JTAG_SEL1_GLBL, JTAG_SEL2_GLBL, JTAG_SEL3_GLBL, JTAG_SEL4_GLBL and other user-defined signals JTAG_USER_TDO1_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO2_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO3_GLBL, JTAG_USER_TDO4_GLBL. 

The code is mainly divided into two initialization blocks that set initial conditions for GSR, GTS, and PRLD signals. It is therefore designed to control the overall behavior of the system by setting up global controls and initial states. The specific assignment to the global signals finally drives these global control signals.
