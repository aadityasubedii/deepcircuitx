    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'glbl' module acts as a global controller, with key global signals like GSR (Global Set/Reset), GTS (Global Tri-state), and PRLD control. It consists of initialization blocks that set default-based conditions as per ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH parameters for these controlling signals. The module also handles JTAG operations with signals for various JTAG states. While it lacks explicit I/O ports, it operates through internal signals, likely triggered from higher-level design modules for debugging and system-wide control."
