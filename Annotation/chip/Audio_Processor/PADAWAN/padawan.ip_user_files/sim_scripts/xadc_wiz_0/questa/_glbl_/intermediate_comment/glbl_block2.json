    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to initialize and reset specific digital signals in a Verilog RTL design. The code sets the GSR_int and PRLD_int signals to high (1'b1), effectively initializing them. After a delay determined by ROC_WIDTH, these signals are reset to low (1'b0), indicating they are in an idle state and ready for further operations."
