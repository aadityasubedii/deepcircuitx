Comment: 
The block of code initiates a reset sequence for the GTS_int signal. To achieve this, the code initially sets the GTS_int signal to 1 (active high), waits for a delay period equivalent to the 'TOC_WIDTH' parametric value, and then resets the GTS_int signal to 0 (active low). This course of action ensures that any following logic dependent on GTS_int starts from a known state.
