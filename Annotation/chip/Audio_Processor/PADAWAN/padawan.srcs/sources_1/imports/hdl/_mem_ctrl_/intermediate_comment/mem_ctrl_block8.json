    "block_comment": "This block initializes the memory band's value to zero at the start of the simulation. The keyword 'initial' is used in Verilog RTL design to set a value at the start of the simulation, before any other operations are carried out. In this case, it sets 'mem_bank' to zero. This could be used for a system that's designed to start with no memory allocation, to maintain a stable, predictable initial state."
