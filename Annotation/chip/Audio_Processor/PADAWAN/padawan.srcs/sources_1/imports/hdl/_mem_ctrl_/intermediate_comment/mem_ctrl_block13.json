    "block_comment": "The code block sets the initial value of 'delete_clear' signal to zero. In Verilog, \"initial\" is a keyword that sets up initial condition(s) for a simulation. Here, the \"delete_clear\" signal is initially being set to 0, meaning the clearing operation for a delete command does not happen when the system begins operation. The operation or effects caused by this signal will take place with the specific control logic or in response to a change in some other conditions or signals."
