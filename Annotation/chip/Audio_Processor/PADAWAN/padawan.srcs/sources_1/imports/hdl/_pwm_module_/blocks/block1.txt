Comment: 
This Verilog block manages a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal generation. It increments the PWM_ramp counter at every rising edge of the clock, and sets the output, PWM_out, high if the incoming PWM (new_pwm) is greater than the ramp value. If the ramp value (PWM_ramp) reaches 0, it resets to the input PWM value (`new_pwm` being loaded with `PWM_in`), essentially setting the boundaries for the next PWM cycle.
