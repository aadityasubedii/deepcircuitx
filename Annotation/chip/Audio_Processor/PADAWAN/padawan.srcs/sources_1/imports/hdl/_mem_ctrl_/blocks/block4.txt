This block of code handles the reset and address increment logic for an address block running at 44kHz. When a reset 'rst' is signalled or 'address_enable' is turned off, the address block 'addrblock44khz' is reset to zero. When 'increment' is set to 1, the address block increments by 1, as long as the address block value is less than the 'max_block'. If 'increment' is set to 1 and the address block equals to or exceeds 'max_block', the address block is reset back to zero. This implements a wrap-around logic when the maximum address block has been reached.
