Module-level comment: This is the AnalogXADC module, performing analog-to-digital conversion of signals from auxiliary channel 3 using the XADC wizard in Xilinx FPGA, governed by a 100MHz clock signal. It ingests analog signals from differential inputs (vauxp3/vauxn3), converts them to digital, and stores the 11-most significant bits in 'aux_data'. It achieves this with the aid of internal signals, such as 'enable' for conversion initiation, 'ready' to signify conversion completion, and 'Address_in' to specify the input channel. An additional 'CLK_AUDIO' output is synchronized with conversion readiness for signal availability.
