    "block_comment": "This block represents a sequential circuit that is triggered at the positive edge of the clock signal CLK100MHZ. It checks the `ready` signal and, if high, extracts middle bits from `data_o` to `aux_data`. Additionally, it assigns the `ready` signal to `CLK_AUDIO` each clock cycle. This logic is stored in flip-flops as it is enclosed within the always block driven by the rising edge of the clock."
