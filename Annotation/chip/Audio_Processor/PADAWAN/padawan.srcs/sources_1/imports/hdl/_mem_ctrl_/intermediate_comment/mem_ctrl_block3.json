    "block_comment": "This block of code is mainly responsible for enabling the RAM write function at every positive edge of the 100MHz clock signal. It accomplishes this function by assigning the delayed write enable signal (WEn_d1) to the RAM write enable (RamWEn) signal whenever the 100MHz clock signal experiences a positive edge transition."
