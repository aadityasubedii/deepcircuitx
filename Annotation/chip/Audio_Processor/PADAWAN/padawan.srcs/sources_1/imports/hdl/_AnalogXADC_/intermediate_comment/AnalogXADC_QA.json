The module waits for the ready signal before saving the 11 MSB (Most Significant Bits) of the Data output of the XADC to aux_data. Additionally, it outputs a CLK_AUDIO signal, which is synchronous with the ready signal from the XADC module. The address input of the XADC is initialized to 'h13, setting the XADC channel to aux channel 3. The analog input channels to be read from are vauxp3 and vauxn3. The conversion operation is initiated and controlled by a 100MHz clock signal CLK100MHZ."

The analog signal to be converted to digital is connected here.\n\n2. vauxn3: This is the negative input for auxilliary channel 3, counterpart to vauxp3. A reciprocal of the signal applied to vauxp3 is connected here to form the differential pair.\n\n3. CLK100MHZ: This is the input clock signal that drives the XADC, operating at a frequency of 100 MHz. This clock signal determines the rate at which the XADC completes an analog to digital conversion.\n\nExplanation: These inputs provide the control signal (CLK100MHZ) and the data (vauxp3 & vauxn3) to the module that it uses to perform the analog-to-digital conversion process.\n\nOutput ports:\n\n1. aux_data: This is the digital representation of the analog input signal that has been read and converted by the XADC. It is a vector of 11 bits.\n\n2. CLK_AUDIO: This is a clock output that is synchronous with the XADC's ready signal, indicating when the converted data is available to be read.\n\nExplanation: These outputs provide the digital representation of the analog input signal (aux_data), and a signal (CLK_AUDIO) that indicates when the digital data is ready to be read from aux_data."
