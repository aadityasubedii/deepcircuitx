It uses a counter, 'PWM_ramp', that increments with every positive edge of the clock. This counter is compared with the input value, 'PWM_in', at the start of every cycle, reset when it reaches zero, and sets the output 'PWM_out' to 1 if 'PWM_in' is greater than 'PWM_ramp'. This type of PWM generation is often used in digital control and switching applications."
