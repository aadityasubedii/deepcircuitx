    "spec": "Module name: pwm_module. \n\nModule specification: The 'pwm_module' in Verilog is designed to generate Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) signals for digital control and switching applications. It uses an 11-bit wide input port 'PWM_in', which determines the duty cycle of the output PWM signal, and a clock input 'clk' that guides the transition of states within the model. The computed PWM signal is outputted through the output port 'PWM_out'. Internally, the module utilizes two registers: 'new_pwm' and 'PWM_ramp'. 'new_pwm' is assigned the value of 'PWM_in' and regulates the duty cycle, while 'PWM_ramp' acts as a counter that increments with the positive edge of the clock. An 'always' block ensures that if 'PWM_ramp' equals zero, 'new_pwm' takes the value of 'PWM_in', and 'PWM_ramp' increments by 1. The block then compares 'new_pwm' and 'PWM_ramp'; if 'new_pwm' is larger, 'PWM_out' is set to 1, creating a PWM signal with a period defined by the meeting point of 'new_pwm' and 'PWM_ramp'.",
