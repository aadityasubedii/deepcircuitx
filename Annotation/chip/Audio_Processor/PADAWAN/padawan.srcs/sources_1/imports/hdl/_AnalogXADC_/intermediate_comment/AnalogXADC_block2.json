    "block_comment": "This block of code appears to be instantiation of an XADC wizard module in a Verilog design which is used to interface with the Xilinx analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The ADC's internal register address is passed through 'Address_in', and it operates in sync with a 100 MHz clock signal ('CLK100MHZ'), and is only enabled when 'enable' is active. The input to the digital writing process is always 0 ('di_in' and 'dwe_in'), suggesting that the ADC is being used strictly for data reading. The outputs 'vauxp3' and 'vauxn3' are presumably the differential outputs from auxiliary channel 3, suggesting a multi-channel operation. No alarms are being dealt with in this block of code. At the output side, 'data_o' is the digital output of the ADC process, 'ready' is an output indicating data is ready to be read, and 'enable' is switching when end of conversion operations. The other outputs are left unconnected showing they are not in use in this context."
