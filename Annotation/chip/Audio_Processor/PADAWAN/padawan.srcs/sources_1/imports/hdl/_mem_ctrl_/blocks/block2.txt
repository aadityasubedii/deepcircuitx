Comment: 
The given block of Verilog RTL code principally forms state machine with different states such as WAIT, BANK, FLAG, INC_BLOCK, and DELETE to manage data operations with a memory bank. The operations are synchronized with a 100MHz clock, and react to a reset signal, involving writing to and reading from a memory bank through associated control signals. These operations can be recording (writing data to a memory block), playing (reading data from a memory block), deleting (prepping a block for deletion), and acknowledging deletion, among others. State transitions are checked and updated based on various predicate conditions. Furthermore, manipulation of the memory bank index, 'mem_bank', and control of data processing flags, such as 'counterEnable', and 'get_data', are carried out within the state specifications. The state machine ensures methodical data flow control and the management of memory operations.
