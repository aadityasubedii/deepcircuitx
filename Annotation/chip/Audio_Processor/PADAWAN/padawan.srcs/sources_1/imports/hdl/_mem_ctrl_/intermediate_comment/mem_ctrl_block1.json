    "block_comment": "This is a block of a clocked logic which is being executed at every positive edge of a 100MHz clock. It incorporates a counter which is reset when 'counterEnable' is disabled or when 'counter' reaches a threshold of 60. If 'counterEnable' is set and 'counter' is less than 60, 'counter' gets incremented at every clock cycle and no activity on 'delay_done' output. However, when 'counter' hits the threshold, it resets and signals that delay is done by setting 'delay_done' to 1."
