This block initializes the Address_in value to a hexadecimal value of '13'. The code assigns a 7-bit hexadecimal value '13' to Address_in in the initial simulation time, setting the starting stage for the operation of the design. The hex value represented as 'h13' is translated to its binary equivalent during execution of the Verilog code. This process is executed at the initiation of the simulation process, affecting subsequent operations that may use the Address_in variable.
