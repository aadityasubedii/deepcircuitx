    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'pwm_module' generates a PWM signal based on the 'PWM_in' input while driven by the 'clk' signal. It employs two internal registers: 'new_pwm', which mirrors 'PWM_in', and 'PWM_ramp', a counter that increments with each clock cycle. Within an 'always' block triggered by the clock's positive edge, 'new_pwm' is updated when 'PWM_ramp' resets, and 'PWM_out' is determined by comparing 'new_pwm' and 'PWM_ramp'. This configuration results in a PWM signal with a varying duty cycle."
