    "spec": "Module name: AnalogXADC. \n\nModule specification: The AnalogXADC module uses the XADC wizard in Xilinx FPGA to convert analog voltage values from the auxp3/vauxn3 inputs into digital values. This module processes signals driven by a 100MHz clock signal (CLK100MHZ) and is designed for reading signal values from auxiliary channel 3. The analog-to-digital conversion starts when an internal 'enable' signal is activated. When the conversion is done, the 'ready' internal signal goes high indicating completion. The analog input is taken from differential inputs, vauxp3 and vauxn3. The converted digital output, represented by the 11 Most Significant Bits (MSB) of the 'data_o' internal signal, is stored in 'aux_data' and is available to the external modules when the 'ready' signal goes high. Another output, CLK_AUDIO, synchronized with the 'ready' signal, is provided to indicate the availability of new converted data. The Address_in signal is internally initiated to 'h13 to set the channel to AUX channel 3. The internal signals work together judiciously to enable control and facilitate monitoring of the analog-to-digital conversion process. The code involves assigning values to internal signals, handling the timing of operations, and assembling the converted outputs.
