It handles commands for \"playing\", \"recording\", and \"delete\" operations, and has various controlling signals like \"RamWEn\" (RAM Write Enable), \"RamOEn\" (RAM Output Enable), and \"RamCEn\" (RAM Chip Enable). It also has an address handling mechanism for controlling and deleting memory blocks. The controller operates in different states to manage these operations. It essentially is an interface between the system and the memory, managing the memory blocks to ensure data is correctly recorded, played, or deleted as per the commands."
