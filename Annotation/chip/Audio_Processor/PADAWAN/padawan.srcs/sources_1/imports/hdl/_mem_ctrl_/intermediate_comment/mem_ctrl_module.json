    "module": "Module-level comment: The `mem_ctrl` module is a memory controller designed to manage play, record, and delete operations on a memory subsystem. It uses a Finite State Machine model with states such as BANK, DELETE, WAIT, and INC_BLOCK. Inputs like `playing`, `recording`, and `delete` direct the module's operations. Outputs such as `RamCEn`, `RamWEn`, `get_data`, and `addrblock44khz` control memory operations. Internal signals like `address_enable`, `count`, `pstate` and `increment` help ensure synchronization and control flow. This setup allows efficient control of memory states and operations."
