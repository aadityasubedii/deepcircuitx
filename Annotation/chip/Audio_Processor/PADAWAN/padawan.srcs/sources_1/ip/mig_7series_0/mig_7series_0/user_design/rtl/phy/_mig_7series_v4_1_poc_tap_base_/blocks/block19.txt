Comment: 
This block of code is primarily responsible for assigning the value of a signal. Specifically, it leverages the 'assign' keyword of Verilog to assign the value of the 'run_too_small_r' signal to 'run_too_small'. This operation gets carried out continuously so if 'run_too_small_r' changes at any future point in time, 'run_too_small' will also get updated instantaneously.
