Comment: 
This block is a flip flop that captures and stores the value of `mc_ref_zq_wip_ns` at the rising edge of the clock signal `clk`. The value held by `mc_ref_zq_wip_ns` is transferred to `mc_ref_zq_wip_r` exactly at the moments when `clk` signal makes a transition from low to high. This is a typical means of synchronizing signals within digital circuits. In this case, the signal `mc_ref_zq_wip_ns` is sampled and stored in `mc_ref_zq_wip_r` every clock cycle.
