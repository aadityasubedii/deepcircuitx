    "block_comment": "This block is utilized for data assignment in Verilog. It assigns the value of the variable `poc_sample_pd_r` to the variable `poc_sample_pd`. The `assign` statement in Verilog specifies continuous assignment in which changes to the righthand side variable (`poc_sample_pd_r`) are continuously reflected onto the lefthand side variable (`poc_sample_pd`). With this statement, whenever the value of `poc_sample_pd_r` changes, the new value is automatically propagated to `poc_sample_pd`.\n"
