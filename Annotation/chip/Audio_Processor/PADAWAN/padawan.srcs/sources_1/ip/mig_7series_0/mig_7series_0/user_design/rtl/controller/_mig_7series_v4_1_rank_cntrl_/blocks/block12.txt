Comment: 
This block of code generates a refresh request for memory calibration. It does this by carrying out a logical AND operation on the completion status of initial calibration (init_calib_complete) and either the NOR operation result of refresh request per bank (refresh_bank_r), or the result of a logical AND operation between the inequality comparison of refresh_bank_r and the bank width section of nREFRESH_BANK and the negation of rank busy status (my_rank_busy).
