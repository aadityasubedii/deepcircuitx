It adjusts the timing of read data capture to ensure proper alignment with the memory clock. The module performs edge detection, pattern matching, and delay adjustments on a per-byte and per-bit basis. It supports multiple ranks and handles both DDR3 and DDR4 memory types. The calibration process involves incrementing delays, detecting data patterns, finding valid eye regions, and centering the read capture point within the eye. The module uses both IDELAY and PHASER_IN delays to achieve fine-grained timing adjustments."
