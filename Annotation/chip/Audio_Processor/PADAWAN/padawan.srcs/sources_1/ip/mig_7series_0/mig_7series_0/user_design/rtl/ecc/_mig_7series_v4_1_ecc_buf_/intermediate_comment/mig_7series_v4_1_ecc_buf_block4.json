    "block_comment": "This block acts as a data copy function, specifically designed to read and reformat incoming data. By constantly monitoring the read data signal (rd_data), it iteratively steps through each segment of incoming data, copying and reshaping it into a payload structure with a different width. The process occurs over a loop defined by the double of clock cycle parameter (2*nCK_PER_CLK), thus ensuring efficient pipeline management and smooth data flow."
