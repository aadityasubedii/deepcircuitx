    "block_comment": "This block defines an instance of the `mig_7series_v4_1_arb_mux` module named `arb_mux0`. The module serves to handle arbitration and multiplexing tasks within the `mig_7series_v4_1` component. Design parameters like transaction clock quality, read-write latency, burst mode, row-column-bank dimensions, DRAM type, error correction capability, and address/command mode are passed into the module. Internal signals related to column-row-bank addressing, command signals, data buffer addressing and periodic read are connected to the specific sub-module. Other control signals are also bound within this module instance allowing it to interact with other components in a larger system. Most notably, it interacts with numerous banks machines, rank configurations, and row command controls, enabling it to handle various memory-related operations\u001b."
