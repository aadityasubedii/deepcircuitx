This block of code represents a pipeline stage in a Verilog design. It is designed to capture the value of `data_bytes_r1` at the rising edge of the clock and after a delay specified by `#TCQ`, the captured value is assigned to `data_bytes_r2`. This process is integral in sequential logic design to synchronize data flow in accordance with the clock signal.
