This block implements a resettable, clock-driven multiplexer for selecting a 'victim' value from a specified set. During a reset, it sets 'sel' to zero. On each positive edge of the input clock, if a reset is not triggered, it arrays across the data width DQ_WIDTH, incrementing by byte size, then arrays within each byte to check if each bit position matches the 'victim' selection. If a match is found, the corresponding 'sel' value is set high; otherwise, it is set low.
