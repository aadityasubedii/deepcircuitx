The block of code captures the functionality of a counter in a Verilog design. On a positive clock signal, the counter resets if the reset command is triggered, and its bits are set to 0. If the counter has reached a preset maximum value specified by NUM_SAMPLES_CNT, it also resets back to 0. If neither condition holds true then, in the case a variable 'complex_sample_cnt_inc' is high, the counter increments its value by 1.
