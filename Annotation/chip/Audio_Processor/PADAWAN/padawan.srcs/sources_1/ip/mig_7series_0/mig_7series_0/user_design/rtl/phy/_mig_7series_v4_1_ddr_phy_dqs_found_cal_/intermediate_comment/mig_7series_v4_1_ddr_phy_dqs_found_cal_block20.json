    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is primarily responsible for memory operation retry count management. The block is triggered at each positive edge of the clock signal. If the reset signal is high, or a rank operation is complete, the retry count is reset to zero. However, if neither of these conditions are met and certain other predicated conditions related to the read byte data offset and the data query strobe are satisfied, the retry count is incremented. For all other conditions, the retry count remains constant."
