This block is designed to assign data offsets from two sources (final_data_offset and final_data_offset_mc) to different ranks when HIGHEST_BANK equals 3. The implementation uses a loop that iterates over the range of RANKS. In each iteration, specific bits from each rank of the two sources are assigned to corresponding parts of respective outputs (rd_data_offset_ranks and rd_data_offset_ranks_mc). The assignment operation employs a bit slicing technique that selects a 6-bit wide segment from each rank and assigns it to part of each output per rank.
