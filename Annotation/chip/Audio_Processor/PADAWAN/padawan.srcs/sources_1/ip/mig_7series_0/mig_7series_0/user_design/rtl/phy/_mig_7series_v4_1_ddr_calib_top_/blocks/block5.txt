This block handles the control logic for the 'skip_cal_tempmon_samp_en' signal based on certain conditions. When a rising edge of the clock (clk) arrives, the block checks a series of conditionals. If either a reset ('rst') condition is present or the 'tempmon_done_skip' is true, the 'skip_cal_tempmon_samp_en' signal is set to '0' with a delay defined by TCQ. If the 'samp_en_cnt' equals 260 in decimal, the 'skip_cal_tempmon_samp_en' is set to '1' with the same TCQ delay. In all other cases, 'skip_cal_tempmon_samp_en' is set to '0'.
