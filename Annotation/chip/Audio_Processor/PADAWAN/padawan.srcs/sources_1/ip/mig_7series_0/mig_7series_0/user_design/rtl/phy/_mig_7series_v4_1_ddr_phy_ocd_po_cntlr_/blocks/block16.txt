Comment: 
This Verilog block is responsible for defining a synchronous flip-flop with a delay. The output of this flip-flop, named `ninety_offsets_final_r`, is updated with the value of `ninety_offsets_final_ns` at every rising edge of clock signal, `clk`. The value is updated after a delay specified by the parameter `#TCQ`.
