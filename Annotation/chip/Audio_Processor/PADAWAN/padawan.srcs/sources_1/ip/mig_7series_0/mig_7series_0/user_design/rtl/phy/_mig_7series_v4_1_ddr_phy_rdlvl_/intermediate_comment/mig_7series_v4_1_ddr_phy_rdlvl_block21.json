    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for managing samp_edge_cnt1_en_r signal based on certain conditions. Upon a positive edge clock cycle, if a reset signal (rst) is initiated, the samp_edge_cnt1_en_r signal is set to 0, otherwise further conditions are checked. If the samp_edge_cnt0_r equals a constant defined as DETECT_EDGE_SAMPLE_CNT0 and sr_valid_r2 or mpr_valid_r2 are true, then samp_edge_cnt1_en_r is set to 1, else it remains at 0. The timing control (marked by #TCQ) ensures the concrete time required to change the signal value."
