    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code assigns the current stable state of the \"maint_ref_zq_wip_r\" signal to the \"maint_ref_zq_wip\" signal. It's a simple wire assignment operation. Whenever there's a change in the value of the \"maint_ref_zq_wip_r\" signal, that new value immediately gets propagated to the \"maint_ref_zq_wip\" signal. This ensures the \"maint_ref_zq_wip\" always reflects the current state of \"maint_ref_zq_wip_r\" in real-time."
