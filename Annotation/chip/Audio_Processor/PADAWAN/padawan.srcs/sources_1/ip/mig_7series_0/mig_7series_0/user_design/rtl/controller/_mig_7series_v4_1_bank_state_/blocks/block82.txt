Comment: 
This block creates a synchronous register to hold the value of 'rcd_timer_ns'. The register value is updated at the positive edge of the 'clk' signal. This implies that the 'rcd_timer_ns' value is sampled and updated in 'rcd_timer_r' every time the clock signal rises from low to high (posedge). The '#TCQ' term represents a delay period, meaning that the update happens after a delay of 'TCQ' time units.
