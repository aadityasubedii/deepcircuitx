    "block_comment": "The code block is designed for setting up two memory slots in operations where ODT (On-Die Termination) is enabled. Implementation-wise, it initiates the 'gen_dual_slot_odt' process when the variable 'nSLOTS' equals 2, meaning it activates the process for two memory slots. The performance of ODT is optimized, which is especially crucial when mitigating signal integrity issues in high-speed operations."
