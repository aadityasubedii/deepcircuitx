    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code functions as a counter controlling the number of reads in a read leveling stage 2 mechanism. The counter is reset when a reset signal is asserted or when the system is in a \"read wait\" state. It's also designed to decrement the number of reads under the condition of nonzero count and neither of the full flags `phy_cmd_full` or `phy_ctl_full` being asserted. Furthermore, the counter sets to its maximum limit when the system is in a \"read\" state, or either of the full flags `phy_cmd_full` or `phy_ctl_full` is asserted and a new burst read signal is received. The signal changes take effect at the rising edge of the clock and after a delay defined by `TCQ`."
