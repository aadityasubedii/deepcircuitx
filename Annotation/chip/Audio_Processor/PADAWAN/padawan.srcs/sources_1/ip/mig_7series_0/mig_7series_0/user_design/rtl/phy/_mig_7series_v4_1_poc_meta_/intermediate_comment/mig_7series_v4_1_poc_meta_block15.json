    "block_comment": "The block of code handles updating the value of the `window_center_r` register. This occurs at the positive edge of the clock cycle, effectively creating a sampling event at every periodical rise of the `clk` signal. The value that is used to update the `window_center_r` register is `window_center_ns`, but the assignment is delayed by a period defined by `#TCQ`, meaning the actual assignment takes place this many time units after the rise of the `clk`. This implementation allows for controlled timing adjustments in the hardware design."
