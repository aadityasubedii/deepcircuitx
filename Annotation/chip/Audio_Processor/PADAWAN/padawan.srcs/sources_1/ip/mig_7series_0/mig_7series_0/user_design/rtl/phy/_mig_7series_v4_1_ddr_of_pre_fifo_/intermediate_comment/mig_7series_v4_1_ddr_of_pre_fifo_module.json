    "module": "Module-level comment: The module, `mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_of_pre_fifo`, is a pre-FIFO buffer for DDR operations in Xilinx 7 Series MIG. It manages read and write operations with signals indicating empty, full, and almost-full states. Parameters specify size and multiplexing. Internal signals, pointers, and conditions govern data flow. Implemented with registers for data storage, a counter for entry tracking, and adhering to timing constraints, it achieves efficient memory buffering for DDR applications."
