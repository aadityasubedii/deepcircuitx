Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for updating the 'compare_err_pb_latch_r[pb_r]' based on the current state and several conditional checks. At every positive edge of the clock, it checks for specific states such as 'FINE_PI_INC', 'FINE_PI_DEC', and whether 'cnt_wait_state' is false and the current state is either 'FINE_PI_INC_WAIT' or 'FINE_PI_DEC_WAIT'. If these conditions are met, it resets 'compare_err_pb_latch_r[pb_r]' with a delay of '#TCQ'; otherwise, it stores the bit value of 'compare_err_pb[pb_r]' into 'compare_err_pb_latch_r[pb_r]' with the same delay, providing a kind of latching mechanism.
