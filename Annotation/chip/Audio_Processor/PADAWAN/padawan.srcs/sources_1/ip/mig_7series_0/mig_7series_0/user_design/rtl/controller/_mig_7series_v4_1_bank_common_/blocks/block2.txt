This block handles the update of a hardware timer. Leveraging the rising edge of the clock signal, it assigns the `rfc_zq_xsdll_timer_ns` delay to the register `rfc_zq_xsdll_timer_r` after the delay period, specified by the parameter `TCQ`. This allows the sync of timer data in the scope of a clock cycle.
