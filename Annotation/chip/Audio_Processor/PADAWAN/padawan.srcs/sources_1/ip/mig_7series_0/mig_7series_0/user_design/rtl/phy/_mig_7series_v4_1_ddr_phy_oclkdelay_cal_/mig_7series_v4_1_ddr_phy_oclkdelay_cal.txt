Module-level comment: This module performs DDR physical layer clock delay calibration for 7-series FPGA memory interfaces. It uses multiple sub-modules to handle edge detection, sampling, data control, and phase optimization. The module implements a complex state machine to manage calibration stages, including initial delay setting, limit detection, and fine-tuning. It processes input data, controls phase-shifting elements, and generates calibration results and debug information to optimize DDR interface timing.
