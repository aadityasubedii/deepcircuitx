    "block_comment": "This block controls the counter that tracks row selection within complex data read in memory operations. The counter, `complex_row_cnt_ocal`, is reset to zero under a few conditions: a reset signal, an increment in the `wr_victim_inc` coupled with the counter hitting its upper limit, lack of completion signal from read-level one, the pulses indicating completion of PRBS read-level, or completion of complex byte reading. When `prbs_rdlvl_done` is asserted along with certain other conditions, including the counter for stage-1 write-read operations meeting a threshold during initialization or incrementation in the complex sample counter, the row counter is allowed to increment if it has not hit the upper limit."
