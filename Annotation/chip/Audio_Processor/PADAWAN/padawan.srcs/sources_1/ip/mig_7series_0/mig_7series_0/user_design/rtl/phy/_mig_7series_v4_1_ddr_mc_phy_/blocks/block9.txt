This block defines a DDR PHY logic unit with designated BYTE_LANES. This DDR PHY logic unit is responsible for interfacing transaction-level commands with byte-lane level signals, performing operations like write levelling, generating IDLE delays, setting up burst modes and more. This implementation covers different parameters including data control, bitlanes, bank type, clock ratio, offset, array mode, data rate and width, as well as idle delay types and values, etc. It also allows fine-grained configurability with the presence of each parameter as an independent variable.
