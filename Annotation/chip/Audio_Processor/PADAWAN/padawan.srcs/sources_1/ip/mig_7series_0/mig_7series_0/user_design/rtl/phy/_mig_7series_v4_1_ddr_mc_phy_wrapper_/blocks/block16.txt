Comment: 
The block of code serves as a multiplexer for memory clock enable signals (mux_cke). It remaps the original mux_cke signals into a wider bit-width wire (mux_cke_remap) in accordance with the specified CKE_WIDTH and the number of clock cycles per enable signal (nCK_PER_CLK). The remapping is achieved through a for loop that assigns the value of the original mux_cke signals to corresponding slices of the expanded mux_cke_remap wire, essentially repeating each original clock enable signal for the duration of the CKE_WIDTH.
