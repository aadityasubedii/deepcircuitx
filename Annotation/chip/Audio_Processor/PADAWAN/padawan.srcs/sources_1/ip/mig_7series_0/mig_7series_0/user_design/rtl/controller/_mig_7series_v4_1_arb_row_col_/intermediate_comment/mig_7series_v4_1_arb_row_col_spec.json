    "spec": "Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_arb_row_col.\n\nModule specification: \n\nThe 'mig_7series_v4_1_arb_row_col' module primarily handles the arbitration and scheduling of memory commands in a Memory Interface Generator (MIG) design specifically for the 7 series FPGA families. This involves controlling priority scheduling between column (write/read command) and row (activate/precharge command) arbitration, considering a number of parameters such as command mode, data width, latency, and clock cycles. \n\nThis module has several input ports including clock(`clk`), reset(`rst`), signals for requests to row, insert maintenance read, column and rank-to-rank transfer (`rts_row`, `insert_maint_r`,  `rts_col`, `rtc`), and column write ready (`col_rdy_wr`). The module outputs include signal for row request grants (`grant_row_r`), sent row and column commands (`sent_row`, `sent_col`), valid signals for rank configuration (`rnk_config_valid_r`), and control signals for sending various commands (`sent_row`, `sending_row`, `sending_pre`, `grant_col_r`, `sending_col`, `sent_col`, `sent_col_r`, `grant_col_wr`, `send_cmd0_row`, `send_cmd1_row`, `send_cmd2_row`, `send_cmd0_col`, `send_cmd1_col`, `send_cmd2_col`, `send_cmd3_col`, `send_cmd2_pre`, `insert_maint_r1`, `sending_pre`, `grant_pre_r`), enable signals for chip selects (`cs_en0`, `cs_en1`, `cs_en2`, `cs_en3`), column channel offset(`col_channel_offset`), and signals for rank to rank config (`rnk_config_strobe`, `rank_config_valid_r`, `rnk_config_kill_rts_col`).\n\nThe module uses several internal signals as controls or intermediaries for the logic, such as a chain of delay signals (`rnk_config_strobe_r`) for controlling the timing of rank configuration commands, `block_grant_row` and `block_grant_col` for temporarily blocking the grant for row or column requests under certain conditions, `rnk_config_kill_rts_col_lcl` to block column requests while a config command is being issued, `granted_row_ns`, `granted_col_ns`, `granted_row_r`, `granted_col_r` to control the sequence of granting row or column requests, `sent_row_lcl` and `sent_col_lcl` to determine whether a row or column request is being sent, `insert_maint_r1_lcl` for ensuring the maintenance read gets a chance to transmit in the subsequent clock cycle after it arrives, and `sent_row_or_maint`, `sent_row_or_maint_r` for handling both row and maintenance commands simultaneously.\n\nThe module comprises different blocks of code that perform specific functions such as arbitration ('row_arb0', 'pre_arb0', 'col_arb0', 'config_arb0') for managing the round-robin sequence of each type of request (such as row, precharge, column, config), delay elements, and some specific functionality based on the address command mode and number of clock cycles per clock.",

It is a pulse signal to indicate the start of rank configuration.\n4. rnk_config_valid_r: Rank-config valid signal. Indicates the validity of the rank configuration.\n5. grant_col_r: Bank array. It is the grant output for column requests. One for each bank machine.\n6. sending_col: Indicates sending of column commands.\n7. sent_col: Indicates Sent column command.\n8. sent_col_r: D register output for sent_col - sent column command delayed by a clock cycle.\n9. grant_col_wr: Grants column write.\n10. sending_row: Control signal to indicate the transition of sending row commands.\n11. send_cmd0_row, send_cmd1_row, send_cmd2_row: It is a flag to send command-0, command-1, command-2 respectively for row.\n12. send_cmd0_col, send_cmd1_col, send_cmd2_col, send_cmd3_col: It is a flag to send command-0, command-1, command-2, command-3 respectively for column.\n13. send_cmd2_pre: It is a flag to send command-2 for precharge. \n14. cs_en0, cs_en1, cs_en2, cs_en3: Chip selects enables 0 to 3. Control the enable of the  chip selects.\n15. col_channel_offset: Output signal to indicate the column channel offset.\n16. insert_maint_r1: It helps to decide which level of command register to use.\n17. rnk_config_kill_rts_col: Whenever a rank config is issued, it kills the column requests.\n18. sending_pre: Control signal to indicate the transition of sending precharge commands.\n19. grant_pre_r: it's the grant to precondition request. \n\nThe signal names starting with 'rts' are generally requests for something, those starting with 'grant' are generally granting of the corresponding request. Signals starting with 'send_cmd' generally deal with sending of command signals. 'r' at the end of signals generally indicates it's a register value. Signals with 'sent' generally indicate something has been sent. 'cs' generally refers to chip select. Signals with 'sending' depict that something is in process of being sent and 'cs_en' stands for the chip select enable signals. \n\nThose are general trends and the specific functionality can vary depending on the implementation."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \n1. `rnk_config_strobe_r`: This is a register array used as a delay chain for controlling rank configuration commands timing.\n\nExplanation: This signal basically takes `RNK2RNK_DLY_CLKS` cycles before allowing another rank configuration command to be issued. This delay mechanism implies that if a rank configuration strobe signal comes in, it will need to wait out `RNK2RNK_DLY_CLKS` clock cycles before another one can be launched. This ensures proper timing between rank configuration commands, complying with the specified delay requirements.\n\n2. `block_grant_row` and `block_grant_col`: This wire is used to temporarily block the grant for row or column requests when the respective command mode and clock condition applies. \n\nExplanation: They are used to control the interleaved scheduling between row (activate/precharge command) and column (write/read command) grants, this is particularly useful for memory scheduling algorithms to optimize the memory performance.\n\n3. `rnk_config_kill_rts_col_lcl`: The signal is even asserted under local conditions calculated in the current module.\n\nExplanation: This local signal will be assigned to the output pin rnk_config_kill_rts_col and this output signal is a control signal which blocks column requests when there's a config command being issued, this is done for ensuring the prioritized execution of the rank to rank config.\n\n4. `granted_row_ns`, `granted_col_ns`, `granted_row_r`, `granted_col_r`: These signals control the sequence of granting row or column requests.\n\nExplanation: Their values will determine if the request is accepted or not. Then their corresponding '_r' signals are a clock-delayed version of these, which stores the last state of the signals for use in the next clock cycle, here TCQ is the parameter that provide those delays.\n\n5. `sent_row_lcl` and `sent_col_lcl`: These signals determine whether a row or column request is being sent. \n\nExplanation: This will be decided based on whether a grant has been received and there is no blockage. The blockages in this module occur if the rank configuration command is executed simultaneously which has a higher priority.\n\n6. `insert_maint_r1_lcl`: This signal is the delayed version of insert_maint_r.\n\nExplanation: This signal is being used to ensure that the maintenance read gets a chance to transmit in the subsequent clock cycle after it arrives.\n\n7. `sent_row_or_maint` and `sent_row_or_maint_r`: These signals create an OR functionality by including both row and maintenance commands.\n\nExplanation: They are used to ensure that row or maintenance command gets sent. Here, 'sent_row_or_maint_r' is a clock-delayed version of 'sent_row_or_maint'. This delay mechanism is vital for accommodating certain timing constraints mandated by the memory standard."

This involves controlling priority scheduling between column (write/read command) and row (activate/precharge command) arbitration, considering a number of parameters such as command mode, data width, latency, and clock cycles. \n\nThis module has several input ports including clock(`clk`), reset(`rst`), signals for requests to row, insert maintenance read, column and rank-to-rank transfer (`rts_row`, `insert_maint_r`,  `rts_col`, `rtc`), and column write ready (`col_rdy_wr`). The module outputs include signal for row request grants (`grant_row_r`), sent row and column commands (`sent_row`, `sent_col`), valid signals for rank configuration (`rnk_config_valid_r`), and control signals for sending various commands (`sent_row`, `sending_row`, `sending_pre`, `grant_col_r`, `sending_col`, `sent_col`, `sent_col_r`, `grant_col_wr`, `send_cmd0_row`, `send_cmd1_row`, `send_cmd2_row`, `send_cmd0_col`, `send_cmd1_col`, `send_cmd2_col`, `send_cmd3_col`, `send_cmd2_pre`, `insert_maint_r1`, `sending_pre`, `grant_pre_r`), enable signals for chip selects (`cs_en0`, `cs_en1`, `cs_en2`, `cs_en3`), column channel offset(`col_channel_offset`), and signals for rank to rank config (`rnk_config_strobe`, `rank_config_valid_r`, `rnk_config_kill_rts_col`).\n\nThe module uses several internal signals as controls or intermediaries for the logic, such as a chain of delay signals (`rnk_config_strobe_r`) for controlling the timing of rank configuration commands, `block_grant_row` and `block_grant_col` for temporarily blocking the grant for row or column requests under certain conditions, `rnk_config_kill_rts_col_lcl` to block column requests while a config command is being issued, `granted_row_ns`, `granted_col_ns`, `granted_row_r`, `granted_col_r` to control the sequence of granting row or column requests, `sent_row_lcl` and `sent_col_lcl` to determine whether a row or column request is being sent, `insert_maint_r1_lcl` for ensuring the maintenance read gets a chance to transmit in the subsequent clock cycle after it arrives, and `sent_row_or_maint`, `sent_row_or_maint_r` for handling both row and maintenance commands simultaneously.\n\nThe module comprises different blocks of code that perform specific functions such as arbitration ('row_arb0', 'pre_arb0', 'col_arb0', 'config_arb0') for managing the round-robin sequence of each type of request (such as row, precharge, column, config), delay elements, and some specific functionality based on the address command mode and number of clock cycles per clock."

Signals Bank Row Requests. One for each bank machine.\n4. insert_maint_r: Insert Maintenance Read signal. Outputs of arbitration for a read command.\n5. rts_col: Bank array. Signals Bank Column Requests. One for each bank machine.\n6. rtc: Bank array. These are the Rank to Rank transfer signals. Acts as signal for config grants. One for each bank machine.\n7. col_rdy_wr : Bank array. Signals Column write ready. One for each bank machine.\n\nOutput Ports:\n1. grant_row_r: Bank array. It is the grant output for row requests. One for each bank machine.\n2. sent_row: Outputs of arbitration for a read command. Signals Read command sent.\n3. rnk_config_strobe: Rank-config strobe signal. It is a pulse signal to indicate the start of rank configuration.\n4. rnk_config_valid_r: Rank-config valid signal. Indicates the validity of the rank configuration.\n5. grant_col_r: Bank array. It is the grant output for column requests. One for each bank machine.\n6. sending_col: Indicates sending of column commands.\n7. sent_col: Indicates Sent column command.\n8. sent_col_r: D register output for sent_col - sent column command delayed by a clock cycle.\n9. grant_col_wr: Grants column write.\n10. sending_row: Control signal to indicate the transition of sending row commands.\n11. send_cmd0_row, send_cmd1_row, send_cmd2_row: It is a flag to send command-0, command-1, command-2 respectively for row.\n12. send_cmd0_col, send_cmd1_col, send_cmd2_col, send_cmd3_col: It is a flag to send command-0, command-1, command-2, command-3 respectively for column.\n13. send_cmd2_pre: It is a flag to send command-2 for precharge. \n14. cs_en0, cs_en1, cs_en2, cs_en3: Chip selects enables 0 to 3. Control the enable of the  chip selects.\n15. col_channel_offset: Output signal to indicate the column channel offset.\n16. insert_maint_r1: It helps to decide which level of command register to use.\n17. rnk_config_kill_rts_col: Whenever a rank config is issued, it kills the column requests.\n18. sending_pre: Control signal to indicate the transition of sending precharge commands.\n19. grant_pre_r: it's the grant to precondition request. \n\nThe signal names starting with 'rts' are generally requests for something, those starting with 'grant' are generally granting of the corresponding request. Signals starting with 'send_cmd' generally deal with sending of command signals. 'r' at the end of signals generally indicates it's a register value. Signals with 'sent' generally indicate something has been sent. 'cs' generally refers to chip select. Signals with 'sending' depict that something is in process of being sent and 'cs_en' stands for the chip select enable signals. \n\nThose are general trends and the specific functionality can vary depending on the implementation."

                    "text": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \n1. `rnk_config_strobe_r`: This is a register array used as a delay chain for controlling rank configuration commands timing.\n\nExplanation: This signal basically takes `RNK2RNK_DLY_CLKS` cycles before allowing another rank configuration command to be issued. This delay mechanism implies that if a rank configuration strobe signal comes in, it will need to wait out `RNK2RNK_DLY_CLKS` clock cycles before another one can be launched. This ensures proper timing between rank configuration commands, complying with the specified delay requirements.\n\n2. `block_grant_row` and `block_grant_col`: This wire is used to temporarily block the grant for row or column requests when the respective command mode and clock condition applies. \n\nExplanation: They are used to control the interleaved scheduling between row (activate/precharge command) and column (write/read command) grants, this is particularly useful for memory scheduling algorithms to optimize the memory performance.\n\n3. `rnk_config_kill_rts_col_lcl`: The signal is even asserted under local conditions calculated in the current module.\n\nExplanation: This local signal will be assigned to the output pin rnk_config_kill_rts_col and this output signal is a control signal which blocks column requests when there's a config command being issued, this is done for ensuring the prioritized execution of the rank to rank config.\n\n4. `granted_row_ns`, `granted_col_ns`, `granted_row_r`, `granted_col_r`: These signals control the sequence of granting row or column requests.\n\nExplanation: Their values will determine if the request is accepted or not. Then their corresponding '_r' signals are a clock-delayed version of these, which stores the last state of the signals for use in the next clock cycle, here TCQ is the parameter that provide those delays.\n\n5. `sent_row_lcl` and `sent_col_lcl`: These signals determine whether a row or column request is being sent. \n\nExplanation: This will be decided based on whether a grant has been received and there is no blockage. The blockages in this module occur if the rank configuration command is executed simultaneously which has a higher priority.\n\n6. `insert_maint_r1_lcl`: This signal is the delayed version of insert_maint_r.\n\nExplanation: This signal is being used to ensure that the maintenance read gets a chance to transmit in the subsequent clock cycle after it arrives.\n\n7. `sent_row_or_maint` and `sent_row_or_maint_r`: These signals create an OR functionality by including both row and maintenance commands.\n\nExplanation: They are used to ensure that row or maintenance command gets sent. Here, 'sent_row_or_maint_r' is a clock-delayed version of 'sent_row_or_maint'. This delay mechanism is vital for accommodating certain timing constraints mandated by the memory standard."

This involves controlling priority scheduling between column (write/read command) and row (activate/precharge command) arbitration, considering a number of parameters such as command mode, data width, latency, and clock cycles. \n\nThis module has several input ports including clock(`clk`), reset(`rst`), signals for requests to row, insert maintenance read, column and rank-to-rank transfer (`rts_row`, `insert_maint_r`,  `rts_col`, `rtc`), and column write ready (`col_rdy_wr`). The module outputs include signal for row request grants (`grant_row_r`), sent row and column commands (`sent_row`, `sent_col`), valid signals for rank configuration (`rnk_config_valid_r`), and control signals for sending various commands (`sent_row`, `sending_row`, `sending_pre`, `grant_col_r`, `sending_col`, `sent_col`, `sent_col_r`, `grant_col_wr`, `send_cmd0_row`, `send_cmd1_row`, `send_cmd2_row`, `send_cmd0_col`, `send_cmd1_col`, `send_cmd2_col`, `send_cmd3_col`, `send_cmd2_pre`, `insert_maint_r1`, `sending_pre`, `grant_pre_r`), enable signals for chip selects (`cs_en0`, `cs_en1`, `cs_en2`, `cs_en3`), column channel offset(`col_channel_offset`), and signals for rank to rank config (`rnk_config_strobe`, `rank_config_valid_r`, `rnk_config_kill_rts_col`).\n\nThe module uses several internal signals as controls or intermediaries for the logic, such as a chain of delay signals (`rnk_config_strobe_r`) for controlling the timing of rank configuration commands, `block_grant_row` and `block_grant_col` for temporarily blocking the grant for row or column requests under certain conditions, `rnk_config_kill_rts_col_lcl` to block column requests while a config command is being issued, `granted_row_ns`, `granted_col_ns`, `granted_row_r`, `granted_col_r` to control the sequence of granting row or column requests, `sent_row_lcl` and `sent_col_lcl` to determine whether a row or column request is being sent, `insert_maint_r1_lcl` for ensuring the maintenance read gets a chance to transmit in the subsequent clock cycle after it arrives, and `sent_row_or_maint`, `sent_row_or_maint_r` for handling both row and maintenance commands simultaneously.\n\nThe module comprises different blocks of code that perform specific functions such as arbitration ('row_arb0', 'pre_arb0', 'col_arb0', 'config_arb0') for managing the round-robin sequence of each type of request (such as row, precharge, column, config), delay elements, and some specific functionality based on the address command mode and number of clock cycles per clock."
