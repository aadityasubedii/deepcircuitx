    "block_comment": "This block of code is a register update for the signal `ecc_status_valid`. It describes that the signal `ecc_status_valid` is assigned the value of `ecc_status_valid_ns` at the positive edge of `clk`, with the delay defined by `#TCQ`. It works as a flip-flop capturing the signal at specific clock edges, incurring delay based on the time constant `TCQ`. This is utilized to align the signal in accordance to the clock, ensuring synchronous communication."
