    "module": "Module-level comment: mig_7series_0 is a memory interface generator (MIG) for FPGA systems interacting with a DDR2 memory module. It interfaces with applications and DDR2 memory via a variety of input and output ports, handling application commands, memory operations, and data transfers. Request signals are used for self-refresh, calibration, and refresh activities, while control signals manage the memory. Note: The code lacks internal signals and procedural blocks."
