    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a nested loop operation in Verilog, designed to generate row addresses for a certain operation. The outer loop traverses over clock cycles defined by 'nCK_PER_CLK', while the inner loop generates addresses for each 'ROW_WIDTH'. These row addresses are incremented one at a time, meaning each row address corresponds to one clock cycle. Since both loops use unit increments, the block essentially implements a full traversal of a 2D grid with 'nCK_PER_CLK' columns and 'ROW_WIDTH' rows. The nested loops ensure that operations associated with every possible address within the specified range will be performed."
