Comment: 
This block of code functions as a synchronous counter. The counter incrementally counts at the rising edge of a given clock "clk" under specific conditions. If a reset "rst" is enabled or a certain condition "device_temp_sync_r4_neq_r3" is met, the counter is set back to zero. Alternatively, if every bit of sync_cntr is not true (i.e., the counter has not reached its maximum count), it increments the counter by one.
