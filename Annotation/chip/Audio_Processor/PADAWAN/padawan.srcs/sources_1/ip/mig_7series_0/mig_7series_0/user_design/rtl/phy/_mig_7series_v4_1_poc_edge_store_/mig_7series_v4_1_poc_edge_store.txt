Module-level comment: The 'mig_7series_v4_1_poc_edge_store' module manages edge triggering in synchronous digital systems, crucial for memory interface generators in 7-series FPGA. It takes in various inputs like clk, run_polarity, select signals, tap, run and calculates internal signals like trailing_edge and run_end_this. Next state and previous state of output signals (fall_lead, fall_trail, rise_lead, rise_trail) are managed through dedicated registers and computations respectively. The updated registers are clocked with a delay of TCQ providing the exact triggering times for the subsequent processes.
