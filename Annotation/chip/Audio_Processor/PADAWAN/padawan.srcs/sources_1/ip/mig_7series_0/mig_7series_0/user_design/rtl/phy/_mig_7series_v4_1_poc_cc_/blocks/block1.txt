This block of Verilog code is responsible for updating a debugging process under certain conditions. If the reset is on (rst is high), it initializes the dbg_poc_ns to zero. If not, it updates the debug variables with current status from the 899 to the 100th bit. It further monitors a condition if a ready signal from the edge detection module is available and the concerned lane is less than 8. If this condition is true, it rearranges rank and boundaries of each lane. Furthermore, it calculates and updates new values for window and edge centers. The data for edge, window centers, right, and left boundaries are extracted from different indexes and widths in the dbg_poc_ns and assigned accordingly.
