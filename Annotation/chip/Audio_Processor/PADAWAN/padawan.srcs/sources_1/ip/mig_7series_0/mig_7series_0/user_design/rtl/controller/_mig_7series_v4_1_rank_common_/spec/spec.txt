Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_rank_common. 

Module specification: This module delivers functionality for memory interface operations targeted at 7 Series FPGAs. The operations managed by the module include refresh request handling, ZQ command processing, and handling self-refresh entry and exit for DDR3 memory along with a periodic request feature to refresh the memory content. 

Input Ports: The module is synchronized by clock (clk) and reset (rst) signals. The completion of the initial calibration is indicated by init_calib_complete. Refresh requests are triggered by app_ref_req. Similarly, ZQ calibration commands are triggered by app_zq_req and self-refresh requests are initiated through app_sr_req. The memory maintenance operations are triggered by insert_maint_r1. An array of signals named refresh_request is utilized to trigger a refresh for each rank of memory. The signals slot_0_present and slot_1_present provide if the memory slots are occupied. Periodic read operations for each memory rank are initiated through an array of signals named periodic_rd_request.

Output Ports: The module outputs maint_prescaler_tick_r which provides a maintain prescaler tick. maint_zq_r, maint_sre_r, and maint_srx_r, indicate an ongoing ZQ calibration operation, self-refresh entry operation, and self-refresh exit operation respectively. A maintenance request is indicated by maint_req_r. The rank currently undergoing maintenance is indicated by maint_rank_r. The signal clear_periodic_rd_request is used to clear the periodic read request.

Internal Signals: The internal signals are employed for numerous operations; for instance, signals like maint_prescaler_r, maint_zq_r_lcl, maint_sre_r_lcl, maint_srx_r_lcl, maint_req_r_lcl, maint_rank_r_lcl, and app_sr_active_r are used to store the current status of the module operations. These statuses consist of maintenance prescaler status, ZQ calibration operation state, self-refresh entry and exit state, maintenance request state, maintained rank state, and active self-refresh request status.

Blocks in the code: The code consists of multiple blocks, each handling a specific function. For instance, the 'maint_prescaler' block manages the maintenance prescaler operations, the 'refresh_timer' controls the memory refresh timer, the 'zq_cntrl' block handles ZQ calibration operations. Similarly, the 'sr_cntrl' manage self-refresh operations, 'maintenance_request' block initiates the memory maintenance request and the 'periodic_read_request' block controls the periodic read operations.
