    "module": "Module-level comment: This module performs DQS signal detection and calibration for DDR memory interfaces. It finds and adjusts DQS timing across multiple ranks and banks by iteratively decrementing read data offsets, detecting DQS signals, and fine-tuning their position. The module implements a state machine for initial detection, fine adjustment, and error handling. It manages multiple banks and ranks, calculates final read data offsets, and provides control signals for the memory interface system. The calibration process ensures proper synchronization between data and strobe signals for reliable data transfer."
