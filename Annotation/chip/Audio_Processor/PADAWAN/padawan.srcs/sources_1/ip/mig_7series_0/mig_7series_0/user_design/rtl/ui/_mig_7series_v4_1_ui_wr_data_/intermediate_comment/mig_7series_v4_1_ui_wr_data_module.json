    "module": "Module-level comment: The mig_7series_v4_1_ui_wr_data module handles the writing of data in a memory interface generator (MIG) system, serving as a critical component in FPGA applications. The module manages various stages of write operations using multiple input and output ports, and internal signals, executing control buffers and counters, data index operations, and enabling ECC. The code is partitioned into blocks performing key tasks like synchronization, memory buffer controls, logic for read and write indices, and ECC handling, offering efficient design and precise memory write operations."
