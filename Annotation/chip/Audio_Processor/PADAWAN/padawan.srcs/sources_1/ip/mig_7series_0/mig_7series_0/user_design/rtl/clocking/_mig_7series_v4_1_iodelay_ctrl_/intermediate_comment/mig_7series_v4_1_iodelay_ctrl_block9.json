    "block_comment": "This block of code is a conditional clock generator subsystem using a Mixed-Mode Clock Manager (MMCME2_ADV). When a condition (REF_CLK_MMCM_IODELAY_CTRL) is true, a clock signal is generated with specific configurations like frequency, phase, duty cycle, and more. The MMCME2_ADV is configured with various properties such as bandwidth, cascade setup, compensation type, startup wait time, multiplication and division factors, phases, and clock cycle properties.  It generates two clock signals: clk_ref_mmcm_300 and clk_ref_mmcm_400, both of these clocks are used elsewhere in the system. The block also maintains an internal feedback loop for clock signal and implements reset mechanism on system reset (sys_rst_act_hi)."
