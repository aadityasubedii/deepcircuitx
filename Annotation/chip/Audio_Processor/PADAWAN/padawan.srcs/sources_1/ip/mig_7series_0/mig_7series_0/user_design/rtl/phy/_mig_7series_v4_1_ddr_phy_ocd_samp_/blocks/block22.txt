This code block is responsible for creating a delay which is triggered when a positive edge of the clock is detected. It does this by using the nonblocking assignment operator "<=" to assign the delayed value of 'samp_done_ns' to the 'samp_done_r' register. The delay is specified by '#TCQ', which could be an integral constant or a preprocessed macro and represents the time delay in units of simulation ticks. It's important to note that in practical hardware this would be synthesized out as most synthesis tools don't honor delay statements in RTL.
