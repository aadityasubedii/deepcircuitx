    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for maintaining the address count of a data buffer. The process is event-driven, i.e., upon change in either the current address count (data_buf_addr_cnt_r), reset event (rst), or when a write operation is accepted (wr_accepted). In normal operation, the next state of address count (data_buf_addr_cnt_ns) is made equal to the current address count. In the case of reset, it is forced to 0. On accepted writes, it is incremented by 1, effectively pushing the write operation into the next address of the buffer."
