Comment: 
This block is a synchronous reset block, that performs actions on the positive edge of the mmcm_ps_clk clock signal. Internally, it resets the 'rising_clk_seen' signal to zero, indicating that the positive edge of a clock signal has not been detected yet. It also resets 'q1_delayed' signal to an unknown state.
