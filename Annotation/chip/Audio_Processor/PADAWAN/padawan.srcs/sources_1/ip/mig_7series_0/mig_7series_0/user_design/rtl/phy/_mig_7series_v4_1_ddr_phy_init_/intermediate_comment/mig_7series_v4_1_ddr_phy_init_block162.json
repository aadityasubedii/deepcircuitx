    "block_comment": "This block functions as a delay flip-flop for control signal 'cnt_pwron_cke_done_r'. The block is activated at the rising edge of the 'clk' signal, at which point it takes the value of 'cnt_pwron_cke_done_r' and, after a delay specified by 'TCQ', assigns this value to 'cnt_pwron_cke_done_r1'."
