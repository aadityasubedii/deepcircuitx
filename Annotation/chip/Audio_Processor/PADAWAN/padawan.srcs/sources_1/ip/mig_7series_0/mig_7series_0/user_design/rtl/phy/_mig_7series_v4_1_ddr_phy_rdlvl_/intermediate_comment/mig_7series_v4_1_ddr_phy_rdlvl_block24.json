    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is set to manage the operation control of circuits based on the state change events (rising and falling edges of the signal). This control relates to two main components, specifically an old signal receiver (old_sr) and a previous signal receiver (prev_sr), with the focus being the matching and differentiation of their rising and falling operations. If the current operation matches the previous operation, old_sr_match or prev_sr_match is set to 1, otherwise reset to 0. Further, the design includes a reading and leveling moderation clause that maintains the status of prev_sr or old_sr when specific conditions are met (represented as `~mpr_valid_r1 && mpr_rdlvl_start && ~mpr_rdlvl_done_r`). After evaluating each individual operation, a cycle operation match (cyc2) is generated by cascading all individual matches. Finally, if the signal receiver is valid at the end of the process, certain differentiation operations are initiated (old_sr_diff and prev_sr_diff), which essentially checks if there are any changes in the cycle operation. Otherwise, these differentiation registers are reset to 0."
