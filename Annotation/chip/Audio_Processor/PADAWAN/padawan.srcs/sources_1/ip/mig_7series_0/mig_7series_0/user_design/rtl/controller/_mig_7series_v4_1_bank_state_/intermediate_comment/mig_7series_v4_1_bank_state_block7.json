    "block_comment": "This Verilog block regulates the condition under which the `ofs_rdy_r` signal goes high. The logic is triggered at the positive edge of the clock cycle. On receipt of a reset signal (`rst`), `ofs_rdy_r` is immediately deasserted. Otherwise, `ofs_rdy_r` is enabled when none of the following conditions are met: `phy_cmd_mac_full_r` and `phy_mac_ctl_full_r` are not asserted, and `phy_mc_data_full` is not asserted while `rd_wr_r` is. This implementation ensures that `ofs_rdy_r` signal is reflective of the system's ready state."
