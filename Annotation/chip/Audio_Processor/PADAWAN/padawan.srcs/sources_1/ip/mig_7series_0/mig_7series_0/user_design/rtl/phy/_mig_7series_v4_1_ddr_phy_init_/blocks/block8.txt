Comment: 
The block is designed to activate clock division on incoming clock signals in a non-mirrored DDR3 DRAM system. It relies on the constants "DRAM_TYPE" and "CA_MIRROR" to determine if it should execute: if DRAM_TYPE isn't "DDR3", or if "CA_MIRROR" isn't set to "ON", then the block activates. The loop runs for the number of clock cycles specified by "nCK_PER_CLK", incrementing a genvar "r" on each cycle. Always at the positive edge of the "clk" signal, which implies this block's functionality is synchronous to the rising edge of the clock signal.
