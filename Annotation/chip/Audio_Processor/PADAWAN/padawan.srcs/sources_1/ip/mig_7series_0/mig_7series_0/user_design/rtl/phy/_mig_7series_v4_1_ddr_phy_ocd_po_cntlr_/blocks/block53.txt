Comment: 
This block is used to assign the value of the variable 'cmplx_samples_done_r' to another variable 'ocal_num_samples_done_r'. This is done using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog which performs continuous assignment. The value of 'ocal_num_samples_done_r' will continuously get updated as the value of 'cmplx_samples_done_r' changes.
