The block manages the enable signal for an on-chip clock of a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) generator within a complex operation and reset situation. The statements are primarily driven by a rising clock edge and manipulate the binary register 'prbs_gen_oclk_clk_en'. Depending on certain conditions, like count values, operation states, read/write operation flags, and calibration completion flags, the logic either disables (sets value to 0) or enables (sets value to 1) the oclk clock of the PRBS generator after a defined clock quarter cycle (TCQ).
