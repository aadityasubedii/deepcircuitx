    "block_comment": "This block handles the registration of the next state logic for the rank configuration (rnk_config_r) based on clock (clk) signal transitions. Upon every positive edge of the clock signal, the block creates a delay equal to the value of TCQ (time required to propagate through the combinational circuit) before assigning the value of the next state (rnk_config_ns) to rnk_config_r. This implementation ensures that state updates are synchronous with the rising-edge of the clock cycle."
