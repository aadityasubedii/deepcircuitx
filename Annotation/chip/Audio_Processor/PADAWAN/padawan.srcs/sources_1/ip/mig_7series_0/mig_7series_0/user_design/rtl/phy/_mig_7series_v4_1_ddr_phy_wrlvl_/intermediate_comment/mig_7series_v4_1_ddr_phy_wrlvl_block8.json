    "block_comment": "This block of code is a clocked process that updates the status of the signal `flag_ck_negedge` based on different conditions. It uses a conditional if-else structure which triggers on the positive edge of `clk` and checks for various conditions. If `rst` or certain leveling states (`wl_state_r` or `wl_state_r1`) are present, `flag_ck_negedge` is set to 0 after a certain clock quantum (`#TCQ`). Alternatively, if `rd_data_previous_r[dqs_count_r]` is high and either `stable_cnt` is non-zero or the state is in fine-decrementing state or fine decrement waiting state, or it is in coarse incrementing state, `flag_ck_negedge` is set to 1 after a clock quantum. Lastly, if `rd_data_previous_r[dqs_count_r]` is low and `stable_cnt` is 'd14 (decimal 14), `flag_ck_negedge` is set to 0."
