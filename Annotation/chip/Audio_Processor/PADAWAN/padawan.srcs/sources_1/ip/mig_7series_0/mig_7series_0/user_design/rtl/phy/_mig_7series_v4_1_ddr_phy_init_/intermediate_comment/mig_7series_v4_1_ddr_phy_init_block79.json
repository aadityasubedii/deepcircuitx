    "block_comment": "This block of code is a sequential logic circuit that performs clocked signal delay and calibration for a complex_oclkdelay_calib_start signal. It uses nonblocking statements to maintain correspondence between complex_oclkdelay_calib_start_r1 and complex_oclkdelay_calib_start_int, and between complex_oclkdelay_calib_start_r2 and complex_oclkdelay_calib_start_r1. The delay is defined by the time constant represented by TCQ. The always block ensures that these assignments occur at each rising edge of the clock signal (posedge clk), which is how the delay and calibration are achieved."
