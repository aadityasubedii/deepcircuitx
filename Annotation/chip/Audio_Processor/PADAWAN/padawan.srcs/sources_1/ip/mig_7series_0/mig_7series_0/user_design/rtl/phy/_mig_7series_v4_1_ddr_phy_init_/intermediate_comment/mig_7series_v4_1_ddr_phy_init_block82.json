    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a counter, `complex_num_reads_dec`, in a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) system. It mainly operates under a positive edge triggered clock and a synchronous reset. When `rst` is high, the counter is initialized to 1. For specific states, specifically `INIT_RDLVL_COMPLEX_READ_WAIT` & `INIT_RDLVL_STG1_WRITE_READ`, or `INIT_RDLVL_COMPLEX_ACT_WAIT`, and some state-associated conditions, the counter is updated with the value of `complex_num_reads`. If the state is `INIT_RDLVL_COMPLEX_READ` and the counter is non-zero, it is decremented by 1 at each clock cycle. The added delay `#TCQ` before the assignments indicates the application is timing critical."
