    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for ensuring the detection validity of idel mpr pattern (idel_mpr_pat_detect_r). The pattern detection is reset to 0 under three conditions: system reset (rst), when the system is in CAL1_MPR_NEW_DQS_WAIT or inhibit_edge_detect_r mode. In addition, if the system is in rising or falling states for mpr_rd but is not stable yet, or in pattern detect mode but the idel pattern detection status is not yet validated, then the detection is also reset to 0. Lastly, if the system is in a stable state, but the previous rise and fall conditions of mpr do not agree with those of mux, it indicates the detection of a valid idel mpr pattern, and thus, the idel_mpr_pat_detect_r is set to 1."
