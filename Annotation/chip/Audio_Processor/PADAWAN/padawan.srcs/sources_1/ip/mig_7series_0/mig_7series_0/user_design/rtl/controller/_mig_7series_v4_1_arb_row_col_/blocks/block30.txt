Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for the assignment of the `insert_maint_r1` signal. Specifically, it assigns the value of the local signal `insert_maint_r1_lcl` to the global signal `insert_maint_r1`. This operation is synchronous and happens every clock cycle with the updated value of `insert_maint_r1_lcl`.
