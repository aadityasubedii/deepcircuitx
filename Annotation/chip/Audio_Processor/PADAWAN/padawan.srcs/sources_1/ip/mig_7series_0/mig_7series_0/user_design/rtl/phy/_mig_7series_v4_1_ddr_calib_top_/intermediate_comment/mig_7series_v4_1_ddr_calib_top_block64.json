    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of the `prbs_rdlvl_done` signal. The value assignment is determined by a ternary operation, which uses the `SIM_CAL_OPTION` string comparison as its condition. If `SIM_CAL_OPTION` matches \"FAST_CAL\", `prbs_rdlvl_done` is assigned the value of `rdlvl_stg1_done`. Otherwise, it's assigned the value `prbs_rdlvl_done_complex`."
