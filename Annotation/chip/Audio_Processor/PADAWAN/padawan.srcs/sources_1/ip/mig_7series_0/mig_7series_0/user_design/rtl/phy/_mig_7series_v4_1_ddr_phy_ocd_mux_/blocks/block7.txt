Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used to create registering or latching logic for a signal named 'po_wait_ns', using the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk'. The value of 'po_wait_ns' is being stored and updated at every positive edge of the clock signal 'clk'. The delay control expression '#TCQ' is specifying the delay between the clock signal's rising edge and the time point where 'po_wait_ns' is sampled and its value passed to 'po_wait_r'.
