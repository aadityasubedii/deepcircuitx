Comment: 
This block of code assigns to `rst_ref[0]` the value stored at the `RST_SYNC_NUM-1` index from the `rst_ref_sync_r[0]` array. This block essentially transfers a previously synchronized reset signal to an array element, which could be used elsewhere in the code for signal handling and resetting specific components of the chip design.
