    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a runtime wrapper (rtw) timer in verilog. It begins a generate statement, which enables conditional compile-time instantiation of hardware based on parameters or static values and labels it as 'rtw_timer'. It declares a register 'read_this_rank', which can be used to hold states, values, or can be triggered on various edge transitions. The register can be typically used for storing or manipulating data throughout the execution of the code."
