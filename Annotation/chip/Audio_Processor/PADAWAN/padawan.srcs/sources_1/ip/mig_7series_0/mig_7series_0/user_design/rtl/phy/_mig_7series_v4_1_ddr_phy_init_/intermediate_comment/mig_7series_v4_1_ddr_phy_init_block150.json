    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling the Write Done (WD) signal during the initialization and Rank Done Level (RDLVL) stages of a memory system. With a synchronous design, the actions are triggered on the positive edge of a clock signal. If the circuit is in idle state, last byte is done, there's a complex byte read done, PRBS RDLVL is over, or RDLVL stage 1 rank is done, the WD signal is cleared. Otherwise, if the circuit is in the RDLVL stage 1 with write and read process ongoing, the WD signal is set high conveying that Stage 1 writing is done.\n"
