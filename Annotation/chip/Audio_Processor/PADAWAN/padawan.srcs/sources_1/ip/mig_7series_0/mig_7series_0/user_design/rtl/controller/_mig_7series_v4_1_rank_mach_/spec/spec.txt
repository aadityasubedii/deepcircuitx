Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_rank_mach.

Module specification: The mig_7series_v4_1_rank_mach module is part of the Memory Interface Generator (MIG) used for DDR memory controllers in Xilinx 7-series. This specific module manages ranks in DDR memory operation. It accepts a variety of inputs, including action control (act_this_rank_r), periodic read, refresh, impedance control (ZQ), and self-refresh requests from the system (app_periodic_rd_req, app_ref_req, app_zq_req, app_sr_req), clock signal (clk), control signals like row and column commands, as well as read/write controls for different ranks (rd_this_rank_r, wr_this_rank_r), and system states (like init_calib_complete, rank_busy_r). In response to these inputs, it outputs a series of control signals such as maintenance request (maint_req_r), periodic read operation needed (periodic_rd_r), inhibiting signals for operations (inhbt_act_faw_r, inhbt_rd, inhbt_wr) and others. Internally, the module uses signals like maint_prescaler_tick_r and refresh_tick for managing the timing of the operations, and collects various requests using refresh_request, periodic_rd_request, and clear_periodic_rd_request internal signals. This module is divided into two main sections, firstly the "rank_cntrl" generate block which spawns `mig_7series_v4_1_rank_cntrl` instances each for a rank to handle rank-specific operations. Secondly, it invokes a `mig_7series_v4_1_rank_common` instance to handle common operations across all the ranks. This design effectively manages DDR memory operation by controlling different ranks based on the requests and states of the system.
