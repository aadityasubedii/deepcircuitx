Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code instantiates the module 'mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_wrcal', which performs a Write Leveling calibration process on a DDR memory interface. This Write Leveling calibration operation is essential for synchronizing data write events with data strobes in the DDR memory interface. To achieve this, the module takes a number of parameters like TCQ, nCK_PER_CLK, CLK_PERIOD, and others that define the timing and data width characteristics of the memory system. The module also uses several input-output signals to control and monitor the calibration process including start signal, sanity check, done notification, error flags, read and write requests, and data inputs/outputs.
