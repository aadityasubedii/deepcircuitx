    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs a reset functionality for a pipeline stage calibration register (`pi_rst_stg1_cal_r[2]`) in a digital system. On every rising edge of the clock (`clk`), the register is evaluated. If there is a reset (`rst`), a particular condition on `pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1[2]`, or a `fine_adjust`, the register is asynchronously reset to '0'. Otherwise, if certain conditions relating to data start conditions (`pi_dqs_found_start`, `dqs_found_start_r`, `pi_dqs_found_any_bank_r[2]`, `~pi_dqs_found_all_bank[2]`) or a read byte offset compared against `(nCL + nAL - 1)` are met, the register is set to '1'. The resets and sets use a time delay defined by `#TCQ`."
