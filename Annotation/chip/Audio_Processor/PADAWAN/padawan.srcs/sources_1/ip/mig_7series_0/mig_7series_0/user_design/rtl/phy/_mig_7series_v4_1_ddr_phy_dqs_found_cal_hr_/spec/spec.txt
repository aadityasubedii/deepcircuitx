Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_dqs_found_cal_hr. Module specification: This module performs DQS (Data Strobe) signal calibration for DDR memory interfaces. It detects DQS signals across multiple banks and ranks, calculates read data offsets, and implements fine adjustment for optimal DQS detection. The module takes inputs such as clk (clock), rst (reset), pi_dqs_found_start (start signal), and pi_dqs_found_lanes (DQS found status for each lane). It outputs signals including pi_rst_stg1_cal (reset for stage 1 calibration), rd_data_offset (read data offsets), pi_dqs_found_done (calibration complete), and pi_dqs_found_err (error signal). Internally, it uses signals like dqs_
