    "spec": "Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_round_robin_arb. \n\nModule specification: The mig_7series_v4_1_round_robin_arb module implements a round-robin arbitration scheme guaranteeing fair servicing of requests (`req`) from multiple requestors, with the number of requestors defined by parameter `WIDTH`. \n\nThe module observes the following input ports. Port `clk` is the synchronization clock signal. Port `rst` is the reset signal. Port `req` ([WIDTH-1:0]) represents request signals from the masters. Port `disable_grant` is for disabling the grant signal. Port `current_master` ([WIDTH-1:0]) holds the index of the currently served master. Port `upd_last_master` is a control signal for updating the record of the last served master.\n\nThe module actuates the following output ports. Port `grant_ns` ([WIDTH-1:0]) represents the next state grant signal. Port `grant_r` ([WIDTH-1:0]) gets allocated to the requestor after a stipulated delay (TCQ). Port `last_master_ns` represents the next state 'last served master'.\n\nInternally, the module uses the following signals. Signal `dbl_last_master_ns` (double 'last served master' signal) and `dbl_req` (double request signal) serve in the calculation of the inhibit signal. Signal `inhibit` decides which signal to be granted next. Signal `inh_group` is used in the inhibit calculation loop. Signal `last_master_r` stores the information about the last served master.\n\nThe module comprises of blocks for signal manipulation, grant issuance based on a signal, and provisions for updating last served master details. The primary function of the blocks revolves around managing request signals, and granting them in a round-robin fashion ensuring fairness and efficiency. Assertion blocks for validation of grant signals and last_master signals are also present.",

In this, `WIDTH` number of requestors will submit requests (`req`). The arbitration scheme guarantees that every request gets served by the round-robin fashion. The output of the module is a grant signal (`grant_ns, grant_r`) which indicates which request is currently being served. This grant can also be disabled using the `disable_grant` signal input. The `current_master` signal indicate who was served last time and the signal `last_master_ns` looks at the last request served to decide the next request to serve ensuring the round-robin manner. The requesters (`req`) are served in a fair round-robin order according to the `WIDTH`."

It is an array with width defined by parameter WIDTH.\n4. disable_grant: This signal is for disabling the grant signal. When this signal is high, the grant signal will not be asserted even if there is a request.\n5. current_master: This signal holds the index of the master currently being served.\n6. upd_last_master: This is a boolean signal to update the 'last master served\u2019 record.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. grant_ns: This is a next state grant signal of the requesting masters. It is an array with a width defined by the parameter WIDTH. \n2. grant_r: This is a signal which gets allocated to the requestor after the TCQ delay. It represents the served request.\n3. last_master_ns: This is a signal representing the next state 'last served master'. It serves as an intermediate signal for updating the last served master.\n\nExplanation: The inputs consist of signals that the module observes to carry out its operation i.e these are the control and data signals which come into the module.

Its main role is to help in the calculation of the inhibit signal which in turn determines the generation of grant signals.\n\n2. dbl_req: This signal is obtained by doubling/concatenating the request signal (req). Similar to dbl_last_master_ns, this helps in the calculation of the inhibit signal.\n\n3. inhibit: This is a signal which inhibits the issuance of grant signals (grant_ns and grant_r) to the master who was served last. The calculation of this signal considers the sequence of requests made and the mastering sequence to decide the next master in line in a fair manner considering the round-robin scheme.\n\n4. inh_group: This is a wire array signal used to calculate individual bits of the inhibit signal inside the generated loop. This wire is derived from a combination of the request signals (dbl_req) and last master signals(db_last_master_ns).\n\n5. last_master_r: This is a registered signal which holds the value of the last_master_r. Its value changes at the edge of clock signal with a delay defined by the TCQ parameter.
