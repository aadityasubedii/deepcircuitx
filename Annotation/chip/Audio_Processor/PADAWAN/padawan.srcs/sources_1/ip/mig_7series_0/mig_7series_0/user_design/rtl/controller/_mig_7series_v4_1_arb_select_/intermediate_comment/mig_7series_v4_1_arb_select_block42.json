    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a flip-flop that latches the value of col_rmw_ns at the rising edge of the clock signal. The delay parameter #TCQ determines the time that the flip-flop takes to reflect an updated value in col_rmw_ns. This behavior is required in synchronous digital designs to ensure that the signal propogates and settles before being sampled in the next clock cycle."
