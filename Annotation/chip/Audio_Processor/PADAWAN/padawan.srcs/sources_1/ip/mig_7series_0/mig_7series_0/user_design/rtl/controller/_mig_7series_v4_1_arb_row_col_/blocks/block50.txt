Comment: 
This block is responsible for capturing the `rnk_config_strobe_ns` signal into the first bit of the `rnk_config_strobe_r` register on the rising edge of `clk`. Utilizing a delay model, the captured signal is propagated after a delay equivalent to `#TCQ`, ensuring the signal reflection corresponds to the actual propagation delay in a real-world scenario. This block is an integral part of synchronous design ensuring data integrity across clock domains and mitigating the risk of metastability issues.
