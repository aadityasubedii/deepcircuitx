    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog RTL code handles the assignment of the 'samples' and 'samps_solid_thresh' registers based on a condition. The implementation uses the generate construct for conditional instantiation/assignment. When the 'CCENABLE' signal is 0, indicating no characterization, the 'samples' and 'samps_solid_thresh' are assigned values from 'SAMPLES' and 'SAMPS_SOLID_THRESH' limited by 'SAMPCNTRWIDTH'. If 'CCENABLE' is not 0, the characterization block is included but is currently empty."
