    "block_comment": "The block conditionally assigns a value to the variable `raw_not_ecc`. If the ECC_TEST is set to \"OFF\", then `raw_not_ecc` is assigned a binary vector of zeros of width `2*nCK_PER_CLK`. Otherwise, `raw_not_ecc` is assigned a segment of the `wr_buf_out_data` variable, starting from `WR_BUF_WIDTH-1` and extending `2*nCK_PER_CLK` bits towards the least significant bit. Hence, this block manages the error-checking condition and data extraction based on that condition."
