Comment: 
This block of code represents a clocked sequential logic for error management, where the variable 'pi_dqs_found_err_r[1]' is updated. If a reset signal ('rst') is received, the error flag 'pi_dqs_found_err_r[1]' is cleared. In case that the reset signal is not active, a check is performed on the condition of 'pi_dqs_found_all_bank[1]' and whether the current 'retry_cnt' equals a constant defined as 'NUM_DQSFOUND_CAL', and whether 'rd_byte_data_offset' is less than sum of 'nCL' and 'nAL' subtracted by one. If these conditions are satisfied simultaneously, the error flag is set.
