    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a Generate/If/For loop structure for the purpose of creating a multiplexer (mux). The mux is employed in a clock divider circuit that specifically handles a quartet of clock pulses per individual clock cycle (nCK_PER_CLK == 4). The implementation involves a loop that iterates over the range of the data path's width (DRAM_WIDTH), incrementing one by one. For each iteration, a read process (gen_rd_4) is invoked."
