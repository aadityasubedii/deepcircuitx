Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_calib_top. Module specification: This module serves as the top-level calibration module for a DDR (Double Data Rate) memory interface. It orchestrates various calibration processes including write leveling, read leveling, DQS (Data Strobe) calibration, and temperature monitoring. The module integrates several sub-modules to perform these calibration tasks, manages calibration sequences, and handles timing adjustments for different aspects of the DDR interface. Key input ports include clock (clk), reset (rst), and various status signals from DDR interface components. Output ports comprise calibration control signals, memory interface signals, and debug outputs. Internal signals are used for inter-module communication, state management, and calibration process control. The module is structured into several main blocks: initialization logic, write leveling, read leveling, DQS calibration,
