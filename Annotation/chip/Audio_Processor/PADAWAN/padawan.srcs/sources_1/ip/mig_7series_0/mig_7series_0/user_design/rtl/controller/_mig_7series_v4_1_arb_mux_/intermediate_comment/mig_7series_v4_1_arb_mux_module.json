    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\n// The 'mig_7series_v4_1_arb_mux' module is a DDR3 memory interfacing arbiter that routes inputs to relevant outputs based on control, calibration and addressing signals. It utilizes two logic blocks 'mig_7series_v4_1_arb_row_col' and 'mig_7series_v4_1_arb_select' for handling row, column operations and arbitration selection. Various internal signals assist in chip selection and granting commands. It significantly contributes to memory operations by managing read/write cycles, real-time clock synchronization, and maintenance requests."
