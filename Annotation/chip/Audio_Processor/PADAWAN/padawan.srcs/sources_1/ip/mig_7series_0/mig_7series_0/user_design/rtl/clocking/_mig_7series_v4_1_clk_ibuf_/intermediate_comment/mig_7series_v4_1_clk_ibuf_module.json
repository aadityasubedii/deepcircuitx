    "module": "Module-level comment: This module 'mig_7series_v4_1_clk_ibuf' performs clock buffering for MIG designs by accepting differential, single-ended, or internal clock inputs. Depending on the 'SYSCLK_TYPE' parameter, differential input (sys_clk_p/sys_clk_n) is conditioned via IBUFGDS, single-ended input (sys_clk_i) through IBUFG, or internal input directly assigned. The conditioned clock output is captured by an internal signal 'sys_clk_ibufg' and provided to output 'mmcm_clk'. This module adapts to varied design demands with great versatility."
