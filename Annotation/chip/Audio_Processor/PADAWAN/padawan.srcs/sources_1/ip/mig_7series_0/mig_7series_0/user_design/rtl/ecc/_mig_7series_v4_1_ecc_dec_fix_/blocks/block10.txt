This block of code is used to declare and initialize the Hamming code computation matrix. It is implemented using two genvar variables, 'n' and 'p', and a two-dimensional wire array that makes up the Hamming matrix, 'h_matrix'. The size of the matrix is determined by the previously defined constants 'ECC_WIDTH' and 'DATA_WIDTH'.
