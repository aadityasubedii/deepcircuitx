    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the control process for self-refresh entry (sre). It uses a combination of registered requests and wires to accept or reject new self-refresh requests. Implementation of this is done via a generate-begin block, containing a nested begin-end block for request logic, where 'sre_request_r' registered variable holds the status of the request, 'sre_clears_sre_request' clears the request when maintenance mode initializes, and 'sre_request_ns' determines the next state of the request. There's a condition for the 'sre_request_r' to stay HIGH, unless cleared by 'sre_clears_sre_request' signal. New requests are accepted if 'app_sr_req' is HIGH, calibration is complete, and the maintenance mode isn't activated."
