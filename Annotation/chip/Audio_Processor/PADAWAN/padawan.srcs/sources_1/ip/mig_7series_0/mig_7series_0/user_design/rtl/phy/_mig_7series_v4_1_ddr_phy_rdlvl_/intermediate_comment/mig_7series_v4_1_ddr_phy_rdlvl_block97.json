    "block_comment": "This block of code manages delay-controlled data signals in synchronization with a clock's rising edge. It proceeds by registering the 'dqs_po_dec_done', 'fine_dly_dec_done' flags into different stages of pipeline. It also incorporates conditional logic to control the 'fine_dly_dec_done' update depending on the condition of 'PI_DIV2_INCDEC'. By using delay elements, it accomplishes the continuous fine delay adjustments for process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations."
