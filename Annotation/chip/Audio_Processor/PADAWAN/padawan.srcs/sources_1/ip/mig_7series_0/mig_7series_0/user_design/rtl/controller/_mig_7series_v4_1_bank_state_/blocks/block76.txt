This block handles updating the 'phy_rddata_valid_r' and 'rd_rmw_r' signals on the rising edge of the clock cycle. Using always @(posedge clk) directs the logic to be executed after each positive edge of the clock signal. It uses a delay variable 'TCQ' that provides a transfer delay to the signals 'phy_rddata_valid' and 'rd_rmw', therefore updating 'phy_rddata_valid_r' and 'rd_rmw_r' to hold their respective delayed values in a synchronous manner.
