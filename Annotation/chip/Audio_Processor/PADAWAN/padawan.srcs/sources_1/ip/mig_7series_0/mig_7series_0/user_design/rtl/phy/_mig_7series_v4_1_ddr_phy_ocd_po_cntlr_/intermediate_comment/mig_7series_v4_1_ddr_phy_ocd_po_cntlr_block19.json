    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is responsible for transferring the stored value from a register to an output wire. The function of the block is to assign the current ready state of the edge detector to an output wire `ocd_edge_detect_rdy` through a non-blocking assignment. The register `ocd_edge_detect_rdy_r` might be updated at some point of the code, storing a temporary value representing if the edge detector is ready to proceed. This output is valuable for components interfaced with it to proceed corresponding tasks when ready."
