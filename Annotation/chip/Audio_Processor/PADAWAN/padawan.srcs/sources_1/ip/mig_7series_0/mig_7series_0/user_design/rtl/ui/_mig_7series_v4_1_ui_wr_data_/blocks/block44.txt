Comment: 
This block of code is designed to implement a flip-flop circuit. The circuit updates its output (wr_data_addr_r) at the positive edge of the clock signal (clk), and the delay is determined by the value of TCQ. This mechanism ensures data synchronization with the clk signal, maintaining system integrity.
