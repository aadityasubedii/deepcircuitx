This block of code enables the selection of the correct edge for triggering purposes. It uses a ternary operator to determine whether to use the trailing or leading edge of the right side based on the value of the 'use_noise_window' signal. If 'use_noise_window' is set to true, 'rise_trail_right' is assigned to 'right', otherwise, 'rise_lead_right' is selected. This enables the system to dynamically adapt to signal conditions and environmental factors for precision.
