    "block_comment": "The given block assigns a constant binary value '1111' to a specific range of elements within the 'pi_phase_locked_lanes' bit-array. This block effectively forces the top four lanes (from 'HIGHEST_LANE_B1' to 'HIGHEST_LANE_B1 + 4 - 1') of 'pi_phase_locked_lanes' to '1', marking them as locked. This is implemented using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog to map the constant value to the specified index range in the bit-array."
