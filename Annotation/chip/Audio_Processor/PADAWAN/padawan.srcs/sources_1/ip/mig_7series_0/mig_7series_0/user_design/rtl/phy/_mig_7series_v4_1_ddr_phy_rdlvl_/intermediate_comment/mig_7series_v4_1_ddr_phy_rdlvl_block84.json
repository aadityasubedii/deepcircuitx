    "block_comment": "This block of code is a sequential logic block, which is triggered by the rising edge of a clock signal. It primarily manages several conditions to update the value of register 'regl_dqs_cnt'. When a reset signal 'rst' is received, when 'done_cnt' reaches zero, or when 'mpr_rdlvl_done_r1' is true while 'mpr_rdlvl_done_r2' is false, the 'regl_dqs_cnt' register is reset to zero. If 'cal1_state_r' equals 'CAL1_REGL_LOAD', 'regl_dqs_cnt' equals 'DQS_WIDTH'-1 and 'done_cnt' equals '4'd1, the 'regl_dqs_cnt' will be set to zero when 'regl_rank_cnt' is not 'RANKS'-1, else it keeps its former value. If 'cal1_state_r' equals 'CAL1_REGL_LOAD', 'regl_dqs_cnt' is not equal to 'DQS_WIDTH'-1 and 'done_cnt' is '4'd1, 'regl_dqs_cnt' will be incremented by 1. For all other situations, the register 'regl_dqs_cnt' maintains its original value."
