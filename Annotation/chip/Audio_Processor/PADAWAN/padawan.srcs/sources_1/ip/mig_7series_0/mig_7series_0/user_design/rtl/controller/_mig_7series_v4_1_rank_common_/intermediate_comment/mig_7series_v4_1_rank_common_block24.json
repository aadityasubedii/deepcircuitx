    "block_comment": "The block of code declares an output signal `app_sr_active` and corresponding internal register `app_sr_active_r` in Verilog. `app_sr_active` is the output that is visible outside this module while the register `app_sr_active_r` is used within the module to hold or store the value of `app_sr_active` across clock cycles for stable operation. It is typical to use this kind of setup in synchronous design to avoid the issues of combinational loops and to maintain data integrity across sequential logic circuits."
