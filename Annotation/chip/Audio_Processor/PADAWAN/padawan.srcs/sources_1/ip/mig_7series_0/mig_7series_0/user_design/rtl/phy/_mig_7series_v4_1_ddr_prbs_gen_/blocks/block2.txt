Comment: 
This block of Verilog code defines a combinational block that assigns logic values to eight pairs of rising and falling edges arrays (dout_rise0-dout_rise3, dout_fall0-dout_fall3) for a data width defined by `DQ_WIDTH`. It loops over `DQ_WIDTH` and, for each iteration, does a selective assignment based on the switching value of the array `sel`. If `sel[i]` is true then 'dout_o' bit from 7 to 0 are connected to 'dout_rise' or 'dout_fall' of respective index, otherwise bits from 15 to 8 of 'dout_o' are connected. In this way, the block creates rising and falling edge-sensitive bit patterns for the output arrays.
