    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mig_7series_v4_1_ecc_gen' module generates Hamming codes for ECC operations. It is parameterized by CODE_WIDTH, ECC_WIDTH, and DATA_WIDTH denoting total, error, and data bits, respectively, in the ECC code. It processes these inputs by utilizing registers (seen0, trig1, ones), local parameters (COMBOS_3, COMBOS_5), and functions (factorial, combos, next_combo) to compute a Hamming matrix, saved to 'ht_matrix', and outputted as 'h_rows'. This forms the ECC generation logic with error detection and rectification potential.\n"
