This block of code generates the center for the data eye using the `center` function. This center is represented by the wire `window_center_ns` which has a width of `TAPCNTRWIDTH:0`. The function `center` takes three arguments - `left`, `center_diff_r`, and `TAPSPERKCLK`, which handle the processing of the Nyquist sampling point location in the I/O clock domain.
