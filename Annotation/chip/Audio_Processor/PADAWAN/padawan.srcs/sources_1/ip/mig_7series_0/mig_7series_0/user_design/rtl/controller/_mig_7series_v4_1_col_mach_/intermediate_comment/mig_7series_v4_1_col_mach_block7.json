    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for a clocked register operation in a digital circuit. It performs a register update at every positive edge of the clock signal, 'clk'. The new state of 'rd_data_addr' register is determined by the content of 'rd_data_addr_ns', and the update takes place after a time delay specified by 'TCQ'. The delay represents the clock to Q delay in the system, which ensures the stability of the register update with respect to the clock signal."
