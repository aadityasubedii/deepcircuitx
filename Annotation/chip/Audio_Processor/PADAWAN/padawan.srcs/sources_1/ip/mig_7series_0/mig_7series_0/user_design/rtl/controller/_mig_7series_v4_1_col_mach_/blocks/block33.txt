Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for updating the `sent_col_r1` signal in synchronization with the positive edge of the `clk` (clock) signal. The change is delayed by a time specified by the variable `TCQ`, which suggests that it is a technology-specific parameter (typically, this represents Time Clock to Q, a measure of how long it takes for a change at the clock input to affect the output in flip-flops and registers). The RTL block uses a non-blocking assignment which ensures that `sent_col_r1`'s update will not cause an immediate change in observed behavior within the same simulation time step; instead, it will have the updated value in the next simulation time step, contributing to consistent and predictable simulation results.
