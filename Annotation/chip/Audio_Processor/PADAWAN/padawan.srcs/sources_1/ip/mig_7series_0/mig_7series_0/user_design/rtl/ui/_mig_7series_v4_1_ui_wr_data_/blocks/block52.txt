Comment: 
This block of code is essentially a flip-flop that latches the state of `app_raw_not_ecc` signal. In response to any change in `app_raw_not_ecc`, the code captures its state and assigns it to `app_raw_not_ecc_r1` at each triggering clock cycle. Specifically, it's implemented using an `always @` statement in Verilog which triggers upon any changes in `app_raw_not_ecc` allowing the `app_raw_not_ecc_r1` to update immediately.
