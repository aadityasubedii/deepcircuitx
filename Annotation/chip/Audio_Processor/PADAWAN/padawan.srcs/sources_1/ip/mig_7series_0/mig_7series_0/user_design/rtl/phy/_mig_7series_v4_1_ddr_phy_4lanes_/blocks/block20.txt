Comment: 
This block of Verilog code functions to assign different values to various data control variables based on the PRESENT_DATA_D condition. The block employs a conditional structure, where variables `D_of_data_full`, `D_of_ctl_full`, `D_of_data_a_full`, `D_of_ctl_a_full`, and `D_pre_data_a_full` are assigned specific values when `PRESENT_DATA_D` is true. Alternatively, these variables are assigned a different set of values when this condition is false, effectually manipulating the flow of data and control within the design based on the state of `PRESENT_DATA_D`.
