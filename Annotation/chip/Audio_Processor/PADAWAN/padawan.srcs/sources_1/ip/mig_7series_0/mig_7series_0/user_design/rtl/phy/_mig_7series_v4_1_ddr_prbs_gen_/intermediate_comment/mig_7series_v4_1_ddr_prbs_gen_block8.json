    "block_comment": "The function of this line of Verilog RTL code is to assign the value of the register `prbs_ignore_first_byte_r` to the wire `prbs_ignore_first_byte`. The implementation of this assignment is straightforward. In this line, `prbs_ignore_first_byte_r` acts as the source; its current value is retrieved, and then this value is put on the wire `prbs_ignore_first_byte`. This assignment always happens when there is a change in `prbs_ignore_first_byte_r`, resulting in the wire `prbs_ignore_first_byte` mirroring the value of `prbs_ignore_first_byte_r`."
