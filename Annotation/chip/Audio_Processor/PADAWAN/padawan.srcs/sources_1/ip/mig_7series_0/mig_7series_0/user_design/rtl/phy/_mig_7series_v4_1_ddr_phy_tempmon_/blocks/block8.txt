Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is a synchronous counter with reset capability, specifically designed to count the number of samples enabled during temperature monitoring and under certain conditions. It is triggered by the rising edge of the clock signal. When the reset signal is active, the counter is set to zero. However, when the reset signal is not active, if the temperature monitoring sample is enabled, the 'SKIP_CALIB' status is TRUE, and the count value hasn't reached 5, the counter increments by 1, thereby counting the number of temperature samples enabled.
