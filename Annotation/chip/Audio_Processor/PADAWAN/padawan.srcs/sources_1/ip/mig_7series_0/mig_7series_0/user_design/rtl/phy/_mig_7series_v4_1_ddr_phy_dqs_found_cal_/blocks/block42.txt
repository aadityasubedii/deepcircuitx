Comment: 
This block of Verilog code functions as a synchronous digital logic that resets and sets the 'dqs_found_done_r' flag based on several conditional checks. The flag reset occurs with the rising edge of the clock cycle if the reset signal is active. However, if all data strobe signals are found ('pi_dqs_found_all_bank'), the count of ranks equals the maximum ranks minus one, 'init_dqsfound_done_r1' is high, and the fine adjustment state is done, 'dqs_found_done_r' is set high in the next clock cycle. If these conditions are not met, 'dqs_found_done_r' remains low, indicating the data strobe signal discovery procedure is still in progress. Additionally, '#TCQ' represents the delay in the assignment operation.
