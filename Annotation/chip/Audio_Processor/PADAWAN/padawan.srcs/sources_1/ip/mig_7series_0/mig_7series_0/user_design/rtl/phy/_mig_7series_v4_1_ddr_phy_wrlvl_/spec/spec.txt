Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_wrlvl. Module specification: This module implements write leveling functionality for a DDR memory interface, adjusting DQS signal timing relative to the clock for optimal data capture during writes. It uses a state machine to incrementally adjust fine and coarse delay taps, detecting edges in received data to determine optimal timing. The module supports multiple ranks and includes features for initial calibration, fine-tuning, and error handling. Key inputs include clk, rst, phy_ctl_ready, wr_level_start, and rd_data_rise0, while outputs include wrlvl_byte_done, wr_level_done, and various debug signals. Internal signals such as wl_state_r, wl_tap_count_r, and corse_cnt manage the state machine and delay adjustments. The module
