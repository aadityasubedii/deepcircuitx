    "block_comment": "This block is a flip-flop, specifically designed for registering the next state of the zq_request signal. It takes a clock signal (`clk`) and works on the rising edge (`posedge`) of this clock cycle. The result is stored back in zq_request_r. The assigned value is the current state of `zq_request_ns` after a delay specified by `#TCQ` (likely a timing constant representing the time cycle quantity), providing a basic mechanism for signal synchronization in sequential digital logic circuits."
