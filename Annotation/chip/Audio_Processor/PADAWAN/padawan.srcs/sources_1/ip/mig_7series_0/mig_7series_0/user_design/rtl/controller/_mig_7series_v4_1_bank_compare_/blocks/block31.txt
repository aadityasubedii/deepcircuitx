The block of code is responsible for updating and storing a logical block request size at every positive edge transition of the system clock. It utilizes blocking assignments with a synchronous delay described by a #TCQ time-constant to ensure that 'req_size_ns' is assigned to 'req_size' at the exact time it turns true. This operation guarantees the accuracy and stability of 'req_size'. The block then uses a continuous assignment operation to directly link the value of 'req_size' to 'req_size_r_lcl'. Hence, any changes in 'req_size' are immediately reflected in 'req_size_r_lcl'.
