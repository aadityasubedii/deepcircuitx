    "block_comment": "This block of code constitutes a register update in a clocked always block. Upon the positive edge of a clock signal (clk), the value of 'col_cmd_ns' is lagged by a certain delay defined by #TCQ and then assigned to 'col_cmd_r'. This implementation behaves as a delay flip-flop, assuring the synchronization of 'col_cmd_r' with the clock, while introducing a delay equivalent to #TCQ in propagating the next state value from 'col_cmd_ns'."
