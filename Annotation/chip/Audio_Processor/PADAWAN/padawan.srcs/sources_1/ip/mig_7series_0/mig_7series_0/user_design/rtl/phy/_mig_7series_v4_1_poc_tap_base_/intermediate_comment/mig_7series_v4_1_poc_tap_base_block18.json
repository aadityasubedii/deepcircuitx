    "block_comment": "This block primarily manages a flip-flop for signal polarity in a synchronous circuit. A rising edge clock trigger has been employed to execute this, indicating that the flip-flop updates on every clock cycle's rising edge. This execution depends on the 'run_polarity_ns' condition, with a delay defined by the parameter 'TCQ'."
