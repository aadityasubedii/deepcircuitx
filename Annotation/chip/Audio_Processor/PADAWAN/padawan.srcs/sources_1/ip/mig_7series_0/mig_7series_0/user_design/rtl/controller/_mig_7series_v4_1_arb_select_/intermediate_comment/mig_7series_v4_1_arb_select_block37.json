    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for handling memory read and write operations under different scenarios based on the value of the `EVEN_CWL_2T_MODE` flag. If `EVEN_CWL_2T_MODE` is set to \"ON\", assignments are made to different variables with values from corresponding registers (_r suffix). These variables include information for periodic read, bank address, row address, column size, row, and data buffer address among others. If `EVEN_CWL_2T_MODE` is not \"ON\", the assignments take values from non-sticky versions of the same registers (_ns suffix). The information is then used to conduct the memory operations necessary."
