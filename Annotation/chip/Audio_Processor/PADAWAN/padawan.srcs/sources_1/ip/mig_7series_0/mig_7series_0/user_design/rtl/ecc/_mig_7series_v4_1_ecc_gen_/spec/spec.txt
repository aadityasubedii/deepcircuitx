Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ecc_gen. 

Module specification: The 'mig_7series_v4_1_ecc_gen' module serves as a Hamming code generator for an Error-Correction Code (ECC) system. The module is parameterized by three compile-time constants: CODE_WIDTH, ECC_WIDTH, and DATA_WIDTH. CODE_WIDTH refers to the overall width of the ECC code, comprising data and ECC bits. ECC_WIDTH signifies the count of bits in the ECC code dedicated to error detection and correction, while DATA_WIDTH represents the quantity of data bits in the ECC code. The module outputs 'h_rows', which encompasses the generated Hamming matrix used for ECC operation. Within the module, internal signals like `ht_matrix`, `seen0`, `trig1`, `ones`, `COMBOS_3`, and `COMBOS_5` exist. 'ht_matrix' stores the generated Hamming matrix, while 'seen0', 'trig1', and 'ones' are registers used inside 'next_combo'. 'COMBOS_3' and 'COMBOS_5' are local parameters storing specific combinations for the Hamming matrix. The Verilog code contains distinct blocks for combination logic (eg. factorial, combos, next_combo) and Hamming matrix generation. Overall it forms the logic to calculate ECC for given data with error detection and correction capability.
