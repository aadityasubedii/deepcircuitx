Comment: 
This block of code is a register update module for `victim_sel` and `victim_byte_cnt`. The function of this block is governed by the system clock (`clk`). Upon system reset (`rst`), it initializes `victim_sel` and `victim_byte_cnt` to zero. Under normal operation, without certain write and read level operations completed (`~stg1_wr_done && ~prbs_rdlvl_done` or `prbs_rdlvl_done && ~complex_wr_done`), it updates the `victim_sel` with references varied between `wr_victim_sel_ocal`, `wr_victim_sel` based on the situation, leaving `victim_byte_cnt` zeroed. If the system is in the initialization state (`init_state_r == INIT_RDLVL_COMPLEX_ACT`) or read address reset (`reset_rd_addr`), it selects between `complex_ocal_rd_victim_sel` and `rd_victim_sel` to update `victim_sel` and `victim_byte_cnt` zeros out.
