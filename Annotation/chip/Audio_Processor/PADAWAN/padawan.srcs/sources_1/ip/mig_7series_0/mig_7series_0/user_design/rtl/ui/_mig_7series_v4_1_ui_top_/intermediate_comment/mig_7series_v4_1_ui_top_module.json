    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mig_7series_v4_1_ui_top' module interfaces with the memory controller. It manages address generation, read/write timings, buffering, and orchestrates error correction, refresh, self-refresh, and ZQ calibration requests. Via 30 diverse input and 25 output parameters, it communicates with other modules, while internal signals facilitate internal operation. Its code is divided into different blocks: a generate condition and three other blocks (ui_cmd0, ui_wr_data0, ui_rd_data0) which manage command, write, and read requests respectively."
