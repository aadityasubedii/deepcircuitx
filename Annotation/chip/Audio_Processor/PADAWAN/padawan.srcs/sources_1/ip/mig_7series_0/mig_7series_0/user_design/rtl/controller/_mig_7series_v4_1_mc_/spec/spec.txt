Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_mc. Module specification: This module is a memory controller for DDR3 SDRAM, handling command and data operations for memory access, including read and write operations, refresh, and maintenance tasks. It integrates several sub-components like rank_mach, bank_mach, and col_mach to manage different aspects of memory control. The module has numerous input ports including clk, rst, cmd, data_buf_addr, bank, col, rank, row, wr_data, and wr_data_mask for controlling memory operations. Output ports include accept, rd_data, wr_data_addr, mc_ras_n, mc_cas_n, mc_we_n, mc_address, mc_bank, and mc_wrdata for interfacing with the memory and providing status information. Internal signals such as act_this_rank_
