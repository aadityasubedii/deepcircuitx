    "block_comment": "This block of code is handling Ready-To-Send (RTS) column signaling for a network router interface. The condition for `rts_col` to assert is determined by several factors: if it's not currently in the process of sending a column (`~sending_col`), if there's a demand request or an override demand (`demand_ok || override_demand_r`), if there's a column command ready-to-send signal (`col_cmd_rts`), and if the offset is ready (`ofs_rdy_r`), assuring all conditions are met before forwarding data."
