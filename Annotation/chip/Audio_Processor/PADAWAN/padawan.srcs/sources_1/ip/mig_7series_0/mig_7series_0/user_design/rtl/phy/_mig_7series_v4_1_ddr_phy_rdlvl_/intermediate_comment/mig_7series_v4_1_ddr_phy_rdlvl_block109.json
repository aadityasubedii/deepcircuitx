    "block_comment": "This block of code is generating a time-multiplexing read interface for a DRAM system. It utilizes a 'generate' loop to consistently read the DRAM data for the rising edge of the clock signal, and delays the reading by a delay time TCQ. The reading occurs from a position determined by the multiplication of the DRAM_WIDTH and the value of rd_mux_sel_r, offset by a genvar index mux_i. The read data is then used to update the respective bits of the mux_rd_rise0_r array. The read operation is synchronous and updates on the positive edge of the clock signal."
