    "block_comment": "This block of code is a Register Transfer Level (RTL) asynchronous delay flip-flop in Verilog. When a positive-edge (rising edge) of the `clk` signal is detected, it captures and holds the value of `pre_bm_end_ns`, introducing `#TCQ` delay/nanoseconds. It stores this value into the `pre_bm_end_r` register for usage in the following clock cycle. This forms an essential part of the synchronous digital system design allowing stateful behavior and dataflow management."
