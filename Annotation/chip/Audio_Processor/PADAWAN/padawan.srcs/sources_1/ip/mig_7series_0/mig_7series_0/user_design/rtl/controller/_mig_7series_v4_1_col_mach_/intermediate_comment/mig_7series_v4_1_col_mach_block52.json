    "block_comment": "The block of code acts as a data signal controller. It is programmed to continuously monitor the value of the 'sent_col' signal. Whenever there is a change in the 'sent_col' signal, the block immediately updates the value of the 'dq_busy_data' variable with the new value of 'sent_col'. This real-time updating ensures the signal value in 'dq_busy_data' is always synchronized with 'sent_col'. This mechanism is efficiently achieved by using an 'always' block triggered by the 'sent_col' signal."
