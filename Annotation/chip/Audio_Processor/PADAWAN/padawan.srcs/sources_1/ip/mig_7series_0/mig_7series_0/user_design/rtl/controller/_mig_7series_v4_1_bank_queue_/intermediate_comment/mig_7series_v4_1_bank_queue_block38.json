    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code manages the state updates in the tail of a queue. The \"always\" block is sensitive to various signals like accepting requests, bitmap end signals, or reset conditions etc. If there's a system reset, the 'tail_ns' is set to a value based on whether ID equals 'nBANK_MACHS'. In normal operation, 'tail_ns' is initially assigned the local 'tail_r_lcl' value. However, under certain conditions involving request acceptance or bitmap end signals and other states like local idling or busy read buffers, 'tail_ns' is updated accordingly to be either 0 or 1."
