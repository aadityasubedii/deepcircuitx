    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for marking the end of data processing. It achieves this by comparing the value of a registered data count (`data_cnt_r`) to a constant value `ONE` that is re-sized to match the data count width. When the data count equals `ONE`, `data_end` will be asserted which indicates the completion of data handling."
