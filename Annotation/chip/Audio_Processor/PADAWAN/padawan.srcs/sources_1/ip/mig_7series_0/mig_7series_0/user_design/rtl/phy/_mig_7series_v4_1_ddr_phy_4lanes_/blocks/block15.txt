Comment: 
This block of code controls the assignment of `_phy_ctl_wd` based on the `HIGHEST_LANE` condition. When `HIGHEST_LANE` is greater than 1, `_phy_ctl_wd` is assigned a concatenation of a subset of `phy_ctl_wd`, `data_offset`, and another subset of `phy_ctl_wd`. If `HIGHEST_LANE` equals 1, `_phy_ctl_wd` is directly assigned the value of `phy_ctl_wd`.
