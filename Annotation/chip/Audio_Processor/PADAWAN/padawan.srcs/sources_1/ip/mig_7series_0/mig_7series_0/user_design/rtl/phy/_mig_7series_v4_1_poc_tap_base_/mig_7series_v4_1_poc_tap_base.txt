Module-level comment: This module, "mig_7series_v4_1_poc_tap_base", is a component of a Memory Interface Generator (MIG) for 7-series FPGA devices. It generates control signals, implements phase-locked loop (PLL) control, maintains counters, and performs data sampling and signal conditioning. Inputs like 'pd_out' and 'clk' enable operations like phase shifting and system resets. Outputs like 'psincdec' and 'psen' are used for controlling the MIG operations. Internal signals like 'samp_wait_ns' and 'samp_wait_r' facilitate complex operations. Implementation involves state-machine logic for sequencing operations, reset logic, and case-sensitive blocks for state management.
