    "block_comment": "This block of code tracks stable cycles of specific states in a memory controller design. Upon the rising edge of the clock, if a reset signal is asserted, or if any of the Write Leveling (WL) states or memory read data conditions are met, the stable counter (stable_cnt) is reset. Meanwhile, if certain other conditions related to WL states and the read data are fulfilled, and if the stable counter hasn't reached its max value of 14, the counter increments."
