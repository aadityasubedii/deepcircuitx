[Function of the block] This block of Verilog code is a conditional statement for a clock divider circuit, specifically for the scenario where the number of clock pulses per clock cycle (nCK_PER_CLK) is equal to 2. [Implementation details of the block] The block uses a labeled begin-end statement (gen_mux_div2), indicating that it will trigger a separate block of code (not shown here) for handling the functional logic corresponding to a divisor of 2. In this context, gen_mux_div2 will likely contain logic to generate a clock signal that is half the frequency of the input clock.
