    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs debugging of tap values for both first and second edges for a specific DQS (Data Quick Switch) width. In implementation, it uses a for loop to iterate over each DQS 'ce_i' from 0 to a predefined DQS_WIDTH. For each 'ce_i', if the first edge is found, the first edge's tap value is captured with a delay of 'TCQ' into 'dbg_cpt_first_edge_taps'. Similarly, if the second edge is found, the second edge's tap value is captured in the same manner into 'dbg_cpt_second_edge_taps'. This allows for capturing and debugging of tap values for each edge under specific conditions."
