    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code aims to assign a value to 'rmw_rd_done' under certain conditions. If the variable 'CWL' equals to 8, a procedural assignment to 'rmw_rd_done' is triggered by any changes in the signal 'my_rmw_rd_ns'. The new value for 'rmw_rd_done' is set to whatever the current value of 'my_rmw_rd_ns' is. This block enables synchronization and update in the system."
