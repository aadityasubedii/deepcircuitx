This block handles the update of the read buffer index in every clock cycle. Upon the rising edge of the clock signal ("posedge clk"), the value of 'rd_buf_indx_ns' is assigned to 'rd_buf_indx_r' after TCQ (Technology Clock to Q) delay. This hardware behavior ensures updates to the read buffer index are synchronized with the system clock.
