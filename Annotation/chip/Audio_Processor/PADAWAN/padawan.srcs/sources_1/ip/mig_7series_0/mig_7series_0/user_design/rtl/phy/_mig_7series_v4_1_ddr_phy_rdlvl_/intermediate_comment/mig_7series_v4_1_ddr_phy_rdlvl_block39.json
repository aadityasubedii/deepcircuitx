    "block_comment": "This Verilog block of code implements a register for storing a data match status signal. The register updates on the rising edge of the clock signal, thus making it a synchronous register. It utilizes delay modelling with the use of #TCQ to represent the register's clock-to-Q delay, which simulates propagation delay. The data being stored in the register is the 'idel_pat_data_match', possibly indicating a pattern match status in idle state."
