    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for clock-driven register updates of the 'starve_limit_cntr_r' register. Specifically, the 'starve_limit_cntr_r' register is updated with the value of 'starve_limit_cntr_ns' at the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk'. The '#TCQ' delay specified in the code makes the change in value synchronous with the clock cycle. The register might be part of a larger state machine or flow control in a digital system."
