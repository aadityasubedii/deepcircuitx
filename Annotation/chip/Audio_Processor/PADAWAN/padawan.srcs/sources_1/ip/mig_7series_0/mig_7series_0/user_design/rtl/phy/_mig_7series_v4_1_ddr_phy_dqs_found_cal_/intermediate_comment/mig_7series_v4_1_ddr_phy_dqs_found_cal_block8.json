    "block_comment": "The block of code performs the assignment of a specific bit range from the `final_data_offset[i]` corresponding to the value of `final_do_index[i]` to `final_do_cand[i]`. Implemented as an always block with a case statement, it handles 3 options: when `final_do_index[i]` is 3'b000, 3'b001, and 3'b010, `final_do_cand[i]` is assigned `final_data_offset[i]`'s 6-bit slice starting respectively from the 0th, 6th, and 12th bit. For all other cases, `final_do_cand[i]` is assigned the default value of 'd0."
