Comment: 
This block of code serves the purpose of conditionally triggering computations based on the variable 'nBANK_MACHS'. If the value of 'nBANK_MACHS' exceeds one, the group of statements within the block named 'compute_demanded' is executed. The 'generate if' statement in Verilog acts as a conditional compiler directive, enabling synthesis of different blocks of code based on the specified condition. The usage of the 'begin' keyword indicates the start of the block of code under the condition and the label 'compute_demanded' helps in identifying this block of code. The block of code under this statement may include computations or operations that are specific to scenarios where multiple bank machines need to be addressed.
