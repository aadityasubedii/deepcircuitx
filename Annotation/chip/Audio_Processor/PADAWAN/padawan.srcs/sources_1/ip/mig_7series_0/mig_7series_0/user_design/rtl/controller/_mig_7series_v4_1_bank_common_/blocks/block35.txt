This block of code monitors and tracks the idle status of multiple bank machines. The counter, `idle_cnt`, is initialized to zero each time there's a change in `idle_r`. It then iterates over `nBANK_MACHS` to check the idle status for each one. If a particular bank machine is idle (indicated by `idle_r[i]` being true), it increments `idle_cnt` by one.
