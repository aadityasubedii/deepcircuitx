    "block_comment": "This block of code is a sequential logic unit that updates a write back address (`wb_wr_data_addr_ns`) based on certain conditions. The code employs an `always` block that is sensitive to reset (`rst`), write-back data address (`wb_wr_data_addr_r`), write address latch enable (`wr_data_addr_le`), or the write address pointer (`wr_data_pntr`). Inside the `always` block, `wb_wr_data_addr_ns` is first assigned the value of `wb_wr_data_addr_r`. It's then updated under two different conditions: if a reset (`rst`) is triggered, `wb_wr_data_addr_ns` is set to 0, otherwise if `wr_data_addr_le` is enabled, `wb_wr_data_addr_ns` takes on the value of `wr_data_pntr`."
