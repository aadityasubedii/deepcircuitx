Without the full context of what's happening before and after this piece of code, it's difficult to definitively determine its full purpose or functionality. However, based on the given string 'cmp_err_2to1', this appears to be a label for a begin-end block in an 'else' branch of a condition. The actual operations this block will perform are not visible as no code was provided inside this block. Please provide more context or the full block of code for accurate description.
