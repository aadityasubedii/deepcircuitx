    "block_comment": "This block is a sequential logic meant for resetting the stage 1 calibration for the \"pi\" (Phase Interpolator) when either a reset signal (`rst`) or a fine adjustment signal (`fine_adjust`) is asserted. The implementation utilizes triggering at the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`). At the rising edge of the clock, if either `rst` or `fine_adjust` is high, stage 1 of the calibration is reset (`pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1[2]` is set to 0). Also, when the calibration stage 1 was previously reset and found no DQS signal across all banks (`~pi_dqs_found_any_bank_r[2]` & `~pi_dqs_found_all_bank[2]`), it continues to reset. Conversely, if the calibration stage 1 was previously reset, it will no longer do so on the subsequent clock cycle (`pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1[2]` is set to 1)."
