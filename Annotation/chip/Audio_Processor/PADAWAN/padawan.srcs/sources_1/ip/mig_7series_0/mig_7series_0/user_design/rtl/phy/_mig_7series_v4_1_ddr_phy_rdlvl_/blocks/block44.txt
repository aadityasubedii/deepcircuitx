Comment: 
This block is used for signal pattern matching in a synchronous design. It works by comparing pattern rise and fall signals on every clock edge. If the pattern signal matches with the sampled signal, a match is recorded, if not then it logs a mismatch. This is done separately for four types of signals: pat0_rise0, pat0_fall0, pat0_rise1, and pat0_fall1. The module uses '%4' to loop through the patterns sequentially.
