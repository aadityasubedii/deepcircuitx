Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for the control of a counter, 'rnk_cnt_r,' based on different signals under a clock edge. Whenever there's a positive edge in the 'clk' signal, this block initiates its operation. If a reset signal 'rst' is high, the counter 'rnk_cnt_r' is reset to 0. If a 'init_dqsfound_done_r' signal is high, the counter remains unchanged. However, if a 'rank_done_r' signal is high, it increments the counter 'rnk_cnt_r' by one.
