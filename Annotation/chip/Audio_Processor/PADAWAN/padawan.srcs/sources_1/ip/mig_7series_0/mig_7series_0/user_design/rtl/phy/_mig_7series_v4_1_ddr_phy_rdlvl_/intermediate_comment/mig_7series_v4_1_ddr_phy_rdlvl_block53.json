    "block_comment": "The block of code determines whether a pattern data match has occurred. The statement is executed whenever there is a change in any variable in the sensitivity list, marked by the wildcard character (*). The outcome, `idel_pat_data_match`, is a logical OR operation of `idel_pat0_data_match_r` and `idel_pat1_data_match_r` values. This operation marks a match if either, or both, of the input patterns match. The operation is delayed by `TCQ` time units to account for any clocking or synchronization requirements, giving it a non-blocking nature."
