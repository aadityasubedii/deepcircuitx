    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code handles the registering of the next-state \u2018poc_error_ns\u2019 value into the current-state register \u2018poc_error_r\u2019. The block\u2019s function is triggered at the positive edge of the clock signal, conforming to standard digital synchronous design methodology. Under delay modeling, the register value change happens after a delay specified by the '#TCQ' timing control, which is used to represent the time required for the signal to propagate through a component in a real-world hardware situation."
