    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code manages the reset and configuration of tap counters for a data qualification system. Firstly, it waits for a positive edge on the clock signal. If the reset signal is high, it resets the tap counters by initiating a loop that iterates over a predetermined width (DQS_WIDTH), repeatedly setting two specific tap counters (po_coarse_tap_cnt and po_fine_tap_cnt) to zero. If the reset signal is not high, but the second calibration is complete (indicated by cal2_done_r) and not marked as completed in the next clock cycle (~cal2_done_r1), the same tap counters are set to the values of wl_po_coarse_cnt_w[i] and wl_po_fine_cnt_w[i] respectively."
