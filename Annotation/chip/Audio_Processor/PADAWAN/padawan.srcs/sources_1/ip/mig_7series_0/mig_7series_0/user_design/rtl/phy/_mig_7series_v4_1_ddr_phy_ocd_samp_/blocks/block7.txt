This block of code functions as a sequential logic block that updates the state machine's current state (`sm_r`) upon the positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`). The implementation utilizes a non-blocking assignment (`<=`) to ensure that all such assignments occur simultaneously at the end of the time step, maintaining proper synchronization with the clock (`clk`). The delay specified by `#TCQ` denotes a clock-to-Q delay, ensuring that the new state (`sm_ns`) updates according to the system's intrinsic timing constraints.
