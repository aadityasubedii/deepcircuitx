    "block_comment": "This Verilog block serves as an error detector for digital data streams. The block responds to a positive edge clock signal, comparing several types of incoming and outgoing data, as well as resetting or updating the error comparison based on a variety of conditions. If any of the conditions for resetting the error comparison are met (reset signal high, new counter, or various program state identifiers), the comparison error for the current data bit is set low. If a read operation is valid and the compared data doesn't match, it flags an error by setting the comparison error high."
