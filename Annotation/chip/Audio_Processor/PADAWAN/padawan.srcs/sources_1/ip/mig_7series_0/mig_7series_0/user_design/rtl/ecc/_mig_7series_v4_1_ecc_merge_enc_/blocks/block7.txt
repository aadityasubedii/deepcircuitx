Comment: 
The block of code aims to assign data from a write data bus (`wr_data`) to a specific subset of a larger data structure (`merged_data`). The assignment occurs at the specific bit-width offsets, determined by the product of a factor (`h`) and the payload width. The range of the assignment is computed by subtracting the data width from the payload width. This approach allows efficient handling and allocation of data into the `merged_data` structure, particularly within large datasets or when handling high data packet volumes.
