The block of Verilog RTL code primarily acts as a conditional gating circuit. If the number of clock cycles per clock read from 'nCK_PER_CLK' equals 4 and if the 'ADDR_CMD_MODE' does not equal "2T", only then will the operations within the block 'pre_mux' be executed. Internally, the block defines a register 'pre_cmd_r' which is initialized to zero. The size of this register equates to 'OUT_CMD_WIDTH'.
