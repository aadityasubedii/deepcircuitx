    "block_comment": "The given Verilog block manages the state update of a certain signal named `second_half_ns` based on various condition statements. In the default scenario, `second_half_ns` is assigned the current state of `second_half_r`. If reset (`rst`) is high, `second_half_ns` is directly set to 0. On the other hand, if reset is not high, `second_half_ns` is derived by performing an exclusive OR operation between `phy_rddata_en_1` and `second_half_r`."
