Comment: 
The block serves as an edge-triggered reset handler, specifically for the idelay_ld_rst signal. It works synchronously with the positive edge of the phy_clk clock signal. When the rst signal is high, it sets the idelay_ld_rst to a high state after a delay of 1 time unit. Alternatively, when the rst_r4 signal is high, it sets the idelay_ld_rst to a low state after the same delay.
