    "block_comment": "This block of code controls a register that stores the current temperature. The temperature value is reset to zero whenever the reset signal (`rst_r2`) is asserted when `xadc_clk` rises. However, if the system state (`tempmon_state`) is in the READ state, it will update the temperature register with the value from the `xadc_do_r` bus, specifically bits [15:4]. Thus, the temperature is either held at zero during a reset, or updated from the specified bits of the `xadc_do_r` bus."
