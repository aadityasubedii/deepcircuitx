    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a register for a write request. Utilizing a positive-edge triggered flip-flop, it copies the value of the write request (`req_wr_ns`) into the write request register (`req_wr_r_lcl`) at the next clock cycle (`clk`). Notably, it uses the `<=` non-blocking assignment, ensuring all values are updated simultaneously at the end of the time step. This assists in maintaining synchronicity in sequential designs. It also incorporates a delay (`#TCQ`) to guarantee timing control."
