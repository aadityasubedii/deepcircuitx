    "block_comment": "The provided code block displays a message indicating the completion of the PHY write calibration process. It begins by monitoring for a rising edge event on `wrcal_done` signal. If there is a rising edge event and the system is not in a reset state (`rst` is False) and the Write Leveling (`WRLVL`) is turned \"ON\", it then prints out a notification message \"PHY_INIT: Write Calibration completed at %t\" where `%t` is replaced by the current simulation time fetched by `$time`."
