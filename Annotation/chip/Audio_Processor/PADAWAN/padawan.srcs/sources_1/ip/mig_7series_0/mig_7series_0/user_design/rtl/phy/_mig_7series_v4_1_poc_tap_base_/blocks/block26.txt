This block of code is responsible for updating the output 'pd_out_r' on the positive edge of the clock signal. It applies a delay, defined in the time constant 'TCQ', before propagating the signal 'pd_out' to 'pd_out_r'. This is achieved through the non-blocking assignment operator '<=', which schedules an update to 'pd_out_r' for the future simulation time.
