    "block_comment": "This block handles the conditions for updating a variable named 'complex_odt_ext' based on system initialization states. It operates synchronously with the rising edge of a clock signal, 'clk'. When a reset signal, 'rst', is HIGH, or when the initialization state, 'init_state_r', is either in 'INIT_RDLVL_COMPLEX_PRECHARGE' or 'INIT_PRECHARGE', 'complex_odt_ext' is set to zero after a delay unit '#TCQ'. In a specific configuration where the 'rdlvl_stg1_done_r1' flag is triggered and both 'stg1_wr_rd_cnt' equals 1 and 'init_state_r' equals 'INIT_RDLVL_STG1_WRITE', 'complex_odt_ext' is set to 1 after a '#TCQ' delay."
