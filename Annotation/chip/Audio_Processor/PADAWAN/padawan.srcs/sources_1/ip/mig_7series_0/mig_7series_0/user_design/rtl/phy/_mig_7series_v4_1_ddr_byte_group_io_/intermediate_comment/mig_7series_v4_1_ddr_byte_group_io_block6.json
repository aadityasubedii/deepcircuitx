    "block_comment": "The block of code mainly configures and controls the OSERDES (output serializer) modules of a digital system. The number of active bitlanes is determined by the condition of the PO_DATA_CTL parameter. If PO_DATA_CTL is true, the code instantiates an OSERDESE2 module with certain configuration parameters set true and assigns it to a variable `oserdes_slave_ts`. In the next stage, the code traverses across the bitlanes array up to a length of `NUM_BITLANES`. For each active bitlane, the code further defines two types of OSERDESE2 modules, based on DDR (Double Data Rate) and SDR (Single Data Rate) settings. According to the PO_DATA_CTL flag, one of two modules is instantiated for each bitlane - their configurations differ chiefly in their `INIT_OQ` and `SRVAL_OQ` parameters."
