This block of code is primarily responsible for assigning predefined signals to debug signals. This is accomplished by means of the "assign" statement in Verilog, which permanently links the right-hand side to the left-hand side. Here, "wrcal_start" and "wrcal_done" are assigned to "dbg_wrcal_start" and "dbg_wrcal_done" respectively.
