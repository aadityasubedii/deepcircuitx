The block of code enables data read from the physical layer when the interface buffer is not empty. This is implemented via an 'assign' keyword in Verilog which assigns value to a wire continuously. The value assigned to 'phy_rddata_en' is the inverse of 'phy_if_empty', implying that when the interface buffer is not empty (denoted by 'phy_if_empty' being 0), the physical layer data read enable ('phy_rddata_en') will be active (1).
