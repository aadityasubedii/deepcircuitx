    "block_comment": "The provided block of code appears to be missing. However, I can provide a general outline on how one should approach generating the brief summary.\n\nFor example, if the code block was a finite state machine (FSM), you might say:\n\n\"This block of code defines a finite state machine for managing system states. It uses a case statement within an always block to react to state changes during the positive edge of a clock cycle. The FSM states are represented by parameters for readability and maintainability.\"\n\nIn this case, the function of the block is defining a FSM and the implementation details include the use of a case statement within an always block reacting to state changes with the positive clock edge, with states represented by parameters for enhanced readability and maintainability."
