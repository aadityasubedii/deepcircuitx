Comment: 
This code block governs the operation of a temperature monitor in a state machine design pattern. The state machine progresses through stages: `INIT_IDLE`, `REQUEST_READ_TEMP`, `WAIT_FOR_READ`, and `READ`, controlled by input variables `sample_en` and `xadc_drdy_r`. Initially, it resides at `INIT_IDLE`, and upon receiving a sample enable (`sample_en`), it requests a temperature read. It then waits for the read acknowledgement (`xadc_drdy_r`) before reading the value and reverting to the idle state. Exceptional cases default back to the `INIT_IDLE` state, ensuring stability.
