Comment: 
This block of code splits the read data depending on the number of clock cycles per clock (nCK_PER_CLK). If four clock cycles per clock are specified, the read data is divided into eight groups (four rising and four falling), each representing a different data width (DQ_WIDTH) segment. If there are two clock cycles per clock, the read data is divided into four groups (two rising and two falling). The 'assign' statement is used in both cases to assign the segmented read data to the respective variables.
