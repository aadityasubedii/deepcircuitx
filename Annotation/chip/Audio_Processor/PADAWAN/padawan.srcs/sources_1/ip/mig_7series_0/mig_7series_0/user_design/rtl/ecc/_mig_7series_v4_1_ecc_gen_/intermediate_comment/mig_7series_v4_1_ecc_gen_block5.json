    "block_comment": "The provided block of Verilog RTL code is used to create a hot temperature matrix. It achieves this function by using the 'assign' keyword, which is a continuous assignment statement in Verilog that assigns the resultant of the operation to the left-hand side variable whenever change occurs on the right-hand side. Here, the code assigns a specific value to the 'n'th index of an array named 'ht_matrix'. The value being assigned consists of a 3-bit wide binary string of all ones, concatenated with a binary string of zeroes which is (ECC_WIDTH - 3) bits wide."
