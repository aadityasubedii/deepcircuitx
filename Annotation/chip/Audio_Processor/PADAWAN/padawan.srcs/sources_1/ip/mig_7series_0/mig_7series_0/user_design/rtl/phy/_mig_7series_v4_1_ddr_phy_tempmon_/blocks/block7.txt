Comment: 
This block implements a synchronous-reset master flip-flop control for a temperature monitor system. Upon activation of the positive edge of the clock, it checks for a reset condition. If reset is active, it sets `tempmon_done` to a delay-queued low signal. Alternatively, if the counter `sample_en_cnt` equals 5 and the SKIP_CALIB is set to TRUE, it sets `tempmon_done` to a delay-queued high signal, indicating the temperature monitor task is complete.
