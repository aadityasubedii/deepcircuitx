Comment: 
This block of code declares a region named 'occupied_counter' with a register called 'occ_cnt_ns'. The register 'occ_cnt_ns' has the range of addresses or bits from 0 to 'DATA_BUF_ADDR_WIDTH'. It seems to serve the purpose of keeping the count of occupied places in data buffer as the name suggests. The use and update of this register would be governed by the logic implemented in other parts of the Verilog code, allowing it to correctly count and store the number of occupied places within the buffer.
