This block acts as a register for the 'maint_rdy' signal with a delay element. It gets triggered on the rising edge of the 'clk' signal, thus implementing synchronized capturing of the 'maint_rdy' signal value. It also introduces a delay equivalent to the `TCQ` time constant, forming a single-stage pipeline to smooth out potential jitter in 'maint_rdy'.
