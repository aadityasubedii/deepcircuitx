Comment: 
This line of code assigns a state to the memory controller's read operation. The `mc_read_idle` signal is assigned the value of `mc_read_idle_r`, effectively defining the current idle status of the read operation from the memory controller. This line will either indicate that the memory controller's read operation is in idle state or not, depending on the value of `mc_read_idle_r`.
