    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code facilitates customized data transformation and transfer depending on whether the data mask port is in use or not. Specifically, if the USE_DM_PORT flag is set to 1, then the data output 'out_dm' and the timestamp 'ts_dm' are assigned with specific bits from the 'mem_dq_out' and 'mem_dq_ts' arrays using the 'FULL_MASK_MAP'. A nested 'for' loop then processes these data and timestamp elements into the \u2018phy_dout\u2019 output port. The specific details extracted from 'mem_dq_out' and 'mem_dq_ts' are acquired via index arithmetic expressions dependent on loop variables 'm' and 'n'."
