This block works on creating three first-in-first-out (FIFO) modules (phy_ctl_pre_fifo_0, phy_ctl_pre_fifo_1, phy_ctl_pre_fifo_2), all based on the mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_of_pre_fifo function, for handling data in a sequential, organized manner. The modules utilize a 25ns clock cycle (TCQ) with a depth of 8 and varying data widths (32-bit, 6-bit, 6-bit respectively). Each FIFO module features a reset signal, a write-enable signal, and data-in/data-out signals. The FIFOs are filled up according to the phy_ctl_wr signal and the full_in status is represented by phy_ctl_full_temp array. Different input data (phy_ctl_wd, data_offset_1, data_offset_2) are used for the FIFOs and the output data are obtained from the FIFOs through phy_ctl_wd_of, data_offset_1_of, data_offset_2_of respectively.
