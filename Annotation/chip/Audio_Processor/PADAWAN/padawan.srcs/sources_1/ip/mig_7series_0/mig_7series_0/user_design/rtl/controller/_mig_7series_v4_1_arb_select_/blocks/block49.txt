Comment: 
This block of Verilog code represents a state update logic inside memory subsystem, which controls reading and writing data, and issuing commands based on control signals. If the reset signal 'rst' is active, it clears select control signals. Select signals like 'col_periodic_rd_ns', 'col_cmd_ns', 'col_rmw_ns', 'col_size_ns', 'col_row_ns', 'col_rd_wr_ns', and 'col_data_buf_addr_ns' are updated based on the 'rst' signal and the previous state. Additionally, if any of the bank machines grants access ('grant_col_r'), fields such as periodic read command, command address, read/write bit, row address, size and data buffer address are updated from the requested values. This block indeed is driven by a variety of condition-dependent signal updates.
