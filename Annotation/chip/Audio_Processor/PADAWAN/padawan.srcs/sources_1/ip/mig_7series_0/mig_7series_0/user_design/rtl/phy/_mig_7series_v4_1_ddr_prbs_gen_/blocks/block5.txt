Comment: 
This block of code determines the selection logic mode for a victim in a memory system, specifically when the `FIXED_VICTIM` parameter is set to true. The block is deployed inside a generate construct in Verilog, which allows for conditional compilation based on the `FIXED_VICTIM` value. It begins a named block `victim_sel_fixed` when `FIXED_VICTIM` is true, implying that a fixed victim selection policy is implemented in this scope.
