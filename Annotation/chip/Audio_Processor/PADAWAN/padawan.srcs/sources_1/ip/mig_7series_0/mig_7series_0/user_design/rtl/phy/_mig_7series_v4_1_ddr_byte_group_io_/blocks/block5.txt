This block of Verilog code is dedicated to creating an instance of an OSERDESE2 primitive for high-speed serialization and deserialization, operating in a conditional true state when Control Output Data (PO_DATA_CTL) is enabled. For this implementation, it identifies the different parameters of the OSERDESE2 primitive. These parameters include data rate, data width, initialization values,enabling tri-state mode, etc., which are set according to the definitions in parentheses. This serialized block sends data out of the FPGA faster than the FPGA core's clock speed. The clock speed, divided clock clockdiv, and reset are input directly into the primitive as dynamic I/O. Ports D1-D8 are data input and T1-T4 are used for tri-stating data output. TBYTEOUT and TBYTEIN control serialization/deserialization of a byte.
