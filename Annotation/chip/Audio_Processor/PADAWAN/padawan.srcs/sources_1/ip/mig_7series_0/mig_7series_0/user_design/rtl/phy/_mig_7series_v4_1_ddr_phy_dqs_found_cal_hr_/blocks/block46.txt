Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code serves the purpose of implementing a rank-done signal as part of a memory controller or similar system. It does so by triggering off the positive edge of a system clock. It has a set of conditional branches that determine the signal's assignment. If the system is in a reset state, or if an initialization has been completed and the rank count matches the preset rank value, the rank-done signal is reset. If the memory interface (pi_dqs) for all banks has successfully found a data strobe (DQS), and it hasn't done so in the previous cycle, the rank-done signal is set. In all other cases, the rank-done signal is reset.
