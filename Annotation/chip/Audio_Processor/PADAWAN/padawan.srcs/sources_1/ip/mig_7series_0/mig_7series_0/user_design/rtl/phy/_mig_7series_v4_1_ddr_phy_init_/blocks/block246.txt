Comment: 
This block of code triggers a display message to confirm a successful phase lock condition after calibration in a high-speed IO system. It operates on the rising edge of the signal 'pi_calib_done_r1', implying that the phaser calibration is now completed. Upon encountering a positive edge, it evaluates the reset condition '!rst'. If no reset is present, a message is printed noting the successful phase lock and the simulation time of the event.
