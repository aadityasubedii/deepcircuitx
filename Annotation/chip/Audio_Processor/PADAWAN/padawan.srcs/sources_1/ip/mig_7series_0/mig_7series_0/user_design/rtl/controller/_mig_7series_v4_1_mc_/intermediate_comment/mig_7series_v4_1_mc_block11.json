    "block_comment": "This block is tasked with the function of data assignment and error checking control. It essentially checks if Error Correction Coding (ECC) is set to \"OFF\" and if so, assigns the relevant data reads and write, masks and also defines the error checking values. The condition is checked using an if clause within a generate statement and upon the condition being true, connection assignments are done using 'assign' keyword for read data, write data, write data mask, and the ECC detection flags. These assignments are straightforward direction linkages from their corresponding physical or input data."
