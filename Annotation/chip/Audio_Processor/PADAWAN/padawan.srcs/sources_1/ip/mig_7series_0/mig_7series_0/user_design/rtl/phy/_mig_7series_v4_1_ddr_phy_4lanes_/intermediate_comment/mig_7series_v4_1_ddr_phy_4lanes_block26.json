    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for initializing four variables (A_pi_rst_div2, B_pi_rst_div2, C_pi_rst_div2, D_pi_rst_div2) to zero. These variables might be reset lines or control signals utilized later in the logic design. This implementation is simply achieved by setting each of the four variables to '1'b0', indicating a binary zero in Verilog code, following the event trigger always @ (*). The 'always @ (*)' statement implies that these assignments occur all the time/continuously, any change in all input signals would trigger this block."
