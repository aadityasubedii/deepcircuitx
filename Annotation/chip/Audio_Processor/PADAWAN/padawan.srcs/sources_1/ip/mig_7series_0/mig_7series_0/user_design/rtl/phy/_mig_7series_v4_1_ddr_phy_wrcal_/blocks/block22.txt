The block of code implements a pattern match operation specifically for a configuration where the no. of clock cycles per clock (nCK_PER_CLK) is 4. Using a loop, it generates a set of pattern matching operations for the width of the DRAM. Each iteration in the loop represents an operation for a bit position corresponding to the iteration number, thus achieving the functionality across the breadth of the DRAM.
