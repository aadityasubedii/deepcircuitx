It handles various operations related to the memory banks of the device. These operations include managing memory idle states, as well as handling different types of commands such as read, write and refresh. It also manages priority operation insertions, maintains queue ordering for memory requests, and implements timers for different operations. Furthermore, it includes provision for clock domain handling and timing parameters. Parameters, input and output signals are defined in the module to manage the complexity of the memory interface."
