This block of Verilog RTL code is a circuit description for a flip-flop that gets updated at every positive edge of a clock signal. If a reset signal is detected, the output 'cke_r' is set to high (1). If no reset signal is present, 'cke_r' takes its value from an input 'cke_ns'. Essentially, this block is implementing a D Flip Flop with a synchronous reset functionality.
