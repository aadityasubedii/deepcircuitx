    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code forms part of a Data DQ bus signal section and sets conditions for when an Input FIFO (First-in-first-out) read enable signal should be toggled. The block assigns a concatenation of different data signals to the `of_dqbus` of width 40 bit. In the second part, the `ififo_rd_en_in` gets assigned depending on `if_empty_def` status. If the Input FIFO is not empty then all the other read enable signals from the other banks and lanes must be high, along with the byte read enable signal, to enable the current FIFO read. Conversely, if the Input FIFO is empty, then one or more high signals from the other read enable signals can enable the current FIFO read."
