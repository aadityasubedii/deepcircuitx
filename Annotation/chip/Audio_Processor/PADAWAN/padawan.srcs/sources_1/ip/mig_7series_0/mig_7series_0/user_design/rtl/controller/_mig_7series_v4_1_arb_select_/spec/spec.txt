Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_arb_select. Module specification: This module is part of a Memory Interface Generator (MIG) system for Xilinx 7 series devices, designed for DDR3 memory interfaces. It handles command, address, and configuration selection for memory access operations. The module takes inputs such as clock (clk), reset (rst), calibration status (init_calib_complete), various request and grant signals for row and column operations, maintenance signals, and configuration inputs. It outputs signals for column operations (col_periodic_rd, col_ra, col_ba, col_a, col_rmw, col_rd_wr, col_size, col_row, col_data_buf_addr, col_wr_data_buf_addr), memory controller signals (mc_ras_n, mc_cas_n, mc_we_n
