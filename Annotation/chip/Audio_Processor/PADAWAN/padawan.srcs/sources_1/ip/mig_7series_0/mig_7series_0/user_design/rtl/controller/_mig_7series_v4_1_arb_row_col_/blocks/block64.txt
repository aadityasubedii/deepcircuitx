Comment: 
This line of code is an assignment operation that sets the value of `sent_row` to the current value of `sent_row_lcl`. It implements a continuous assignment statement, which means that the operation is constantly active and any changes in the value of `sent_row_lcl` are immediately reflected in `sent_row`.
