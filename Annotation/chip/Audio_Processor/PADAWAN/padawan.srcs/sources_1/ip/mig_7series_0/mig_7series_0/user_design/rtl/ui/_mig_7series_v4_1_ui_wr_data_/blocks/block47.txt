This block of Verilog code serves as a D-type flip-flop for handling write data addresses in a synchronous digital circuit. The code captures or latches the value of 'wr_data_addr' at every positive edge of continuous time, thereby functioning as a data storage block. The stored value persists till the next positive edge detects a new value for 'wr_data_addr', which then updates the output, 'wr_data_addr_r'.
