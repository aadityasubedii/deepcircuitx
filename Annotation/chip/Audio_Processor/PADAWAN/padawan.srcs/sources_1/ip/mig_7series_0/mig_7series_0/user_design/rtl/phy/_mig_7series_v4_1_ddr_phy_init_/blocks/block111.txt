The Block is designed to control the status of burst_addr_r, which is probably an address for a burst operation, based on various conditions of a system. The control is executed on the positive edge trigger of 'clk'. When either 'rst' is high, or 'wrcal_done' is triggered, 'burst_addr_r' will be set to 0. If the 'init_state_r' is in any of the indicated initialisation states, 'burst_addr_r' is set to 1. On the other hand, if 'rdlvl_wr_rd' and 'new_burst_r' are both high, 'burst_addr_r' inverts its current status. In all other states, 'burst_addr_r' is set to 0.
