Comment: 
The block of code generates a double width vector representing two copies of `last_master_ns`. This is accomplished using the concatenation operator `{}` in Verilog which combines two `last_master_ns` signals into `dbl_last_master_ns`. Moreover, it defines a register `dbl_req` with double the `WIDTH` bits of the system.
