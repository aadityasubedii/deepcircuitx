    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for implementing a retry counter in a Verilog system where the count is conditionally incremented under specific conditions. When reset is initiated or when a rank is completed ('rst' or 'rank_done_r' are high), the retry counter ('retry_cnt[20+:10]') is reset to zero. If neither reset nor rank completion has occurred, and the read byte data offset is greater than a specific latency factor, and all bank data strobes haven't been found ('pi_dqs_found_all_bank[2]' is low), the retry count is incremented. In all other cases, the retry count maintains its current value."
