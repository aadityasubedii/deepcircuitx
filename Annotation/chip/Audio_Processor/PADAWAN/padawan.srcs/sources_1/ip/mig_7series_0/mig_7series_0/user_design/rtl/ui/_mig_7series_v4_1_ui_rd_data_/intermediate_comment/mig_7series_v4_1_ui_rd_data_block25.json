    "block_comment": "The block of code controls the assignment of the 'rd_buf_in_data' output based on the condition of the 'ECC' signal. It checks if the 'ECC' is turned off and populates the 'rd_buf_in_data' by concatenating 'rd_data' with a certain number of zeroes. The number of zeroes attached depends on the difference between 6 and a parameter named 'REMAINDER.' If 'ECC' is not 'OFF,' the condition in the block of code will not be met, and no action will be taken in this specific block."
