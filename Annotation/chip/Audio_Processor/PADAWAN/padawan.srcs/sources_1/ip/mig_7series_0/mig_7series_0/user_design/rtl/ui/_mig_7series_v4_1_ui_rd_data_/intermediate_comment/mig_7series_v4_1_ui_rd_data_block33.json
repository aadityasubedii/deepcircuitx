    "block_comment": "The block of code describes a part of a RAM module, specifically the write address logic for the status RAM. The write address for the status RAM is determined based on whether the RAM initialization is completed or not. If the RAM initialization (`ram_init_done_r_lcl`) is done, the write address (`status_ram_wr_addr_ns`) is assigned the value of `rd_buf_wr_addr`. In case the RAM is still not initialized, the lower 5 bits of `rd_buf_indx_r` are assigned to the write address. This logic ensures accurate assignment of write addresses based on the readiness of the RAM."
