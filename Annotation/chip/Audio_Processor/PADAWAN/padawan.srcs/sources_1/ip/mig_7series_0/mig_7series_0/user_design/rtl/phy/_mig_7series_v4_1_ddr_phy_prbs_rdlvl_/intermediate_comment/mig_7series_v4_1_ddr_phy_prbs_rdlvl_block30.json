    "block_comment": "This block of code conducts data comparison and error detection based on certain reset conditions and signal data readings in the DQS Receiver. When a reset signal or new DQS count appears, or when it's in certain states during phase interpolator adjustment, the error comparative bit for each data phase boundary is reset. However, when a valid read occurs post two clock cycles, a comparison is made between the captured and expected waveform on both rising and falling within all the 4 bit lanes. If any mismatch is recorded, an error bit is flagged up."
