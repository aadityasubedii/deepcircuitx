Comment: 
This block of code assigns the value of the `ocd_ktap_left` signal to the `ktap_at_left_edge` wire. The operation happens continuously during the operation of the chip. This is implemented using the `assign` keyword, commonly used in Verilog for continuous assignments. The left-hand side of the `=` symbol is the target of the assignment, which acts like a wire that takes on the value of the expression on the right-hand side of the `=` symbol. In this case, the `ocd_ktap_left` signal.
