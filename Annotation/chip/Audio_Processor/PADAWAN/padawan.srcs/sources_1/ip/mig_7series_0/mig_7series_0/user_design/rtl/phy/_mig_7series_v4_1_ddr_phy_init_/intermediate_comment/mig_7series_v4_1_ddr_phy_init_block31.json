    "block_comment": "This block of code serves as a control logic component for a memory initialization sequence in a digital system. On every clock positive edge, it checks if the current state of the system (`init_state_r`) matches any of the pre-defined initialization states, or if a read leveling write (`rdlvl_wr`) and new burst (`new_burst_r`) flag combination is detected. In such cases, it intelligently manipulates two write enable signals (`phy_we_n[0]` and `phy_we_n[1]`) with specific timing delays (`#TCQ`). Particularly, it sets the first signal (`phy_we_n[0]`) to active (low, `1'b0`) and the second signal (`phy_we_n[1]`) to inactive (high, `1'b1`). For all other states, both signals are set to inactive. This helps control read or write operations on the physical memory cells during specific states of the system initialization or memory leveling operations."
