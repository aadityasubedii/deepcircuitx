    "block_comment": "This block of code handles storage of write data mask in synchronization with the clock's positive edge. It implements this by updating the masked register 'wr_data_mask_r' at every positive edge of the clock signal 'clk'. The update delay is defined by 'TCQ', which could represent a technology-specific Clock-to-Q-output delay."
