    "block_comment": "The block of code is set to execute based on the condition defined by the macro `HIGHEST_BANK` equaling 3. If this condition is met, the following code would be executed. The specifics of what this block does however, isn't clear without more context as the code within the block isn't provided. The implementation is realized using a conditional generate construct in Verilog, which allows certain parts of the hardware to be conditionally included or excluded, thus creating a conditional hardware design structure based on the requirement `HIGHEST_BANK` being 3."
