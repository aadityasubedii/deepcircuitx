    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for synchronizing a request command (`req_cmd_ns`) to the clock, ensuring that the value of `req_cmd_ns` is stored in `req_cmd_r` each positive edge of the clock (`clk`). Specifically, it is a flip-flop whose output (`req_cmd_r`) changes only at the rising edge of the input clock signal (`clk`). Furthermore, it introduces a delay of `#TCQ`, a predefined delay cycle that likely corresponds to the system clock period, hence providing synchronization between various components operating under this clock in the overall system."
