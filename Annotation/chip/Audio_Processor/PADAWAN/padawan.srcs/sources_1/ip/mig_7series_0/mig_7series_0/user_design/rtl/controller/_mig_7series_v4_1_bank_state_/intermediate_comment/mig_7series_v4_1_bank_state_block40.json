    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for precharging the bitline end markers in a memory system. The `precharge_bm_end` signal is assigned if either the read-preamble (rp) timer equals a defined maximum value (`ONE[RP_TIMER_WIDTH-1:0]`) or if a start_pre signal is initiated and the negative read-preamble clock cycle count (`nRP_CLKS_M2`) equals zero. The use of the `assign` keyword indicates this operation is continuous, tying precharge_bm_end's value directly to the states of the conditions."
