    "block_comment": "This block of code is a flip-flop design that updates the value of `cnt_wrcal_rd` on the rising edge of a clock signal. It works by checking whether the `cnt_wait` signal is at a specific decimal value (4, in this case) and, if so, assigns the result to `cnt_wrcal_rd` after a delay of `TCQ` time units."
