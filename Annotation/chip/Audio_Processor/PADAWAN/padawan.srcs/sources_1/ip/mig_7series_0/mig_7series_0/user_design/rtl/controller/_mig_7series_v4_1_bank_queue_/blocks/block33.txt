This block of code implements a flip-flop design pattern in a Verilog RTL code. More specifically, it defines when the idle_r_lcl signal will be updated: the signal changes at the positive edge of the clock cycle signal (clk). Additionally, there's a delay of time units, representative of the Clock to Q delay (#TCQ), before the input (idle_ns_lcl) is assigned to the idle_r_lcl signal. In simpler terms, this block models a flip-flop that captures the input idle_ns_lcl on the rising edge of clk signal after a delay (#TCQ) and assigns it to output idle_r_lcl.
