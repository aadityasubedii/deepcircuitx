The function mod_sub performs a modulus subtraction operation on two input variables a and b within a custom base. It takes two variables a and b of width TAPCNTRWIDTH and another integer input 'base', and returns a result of the same width. The function implementation utilizes a conditional operator to evaluate the result: If 'a' is greater than or equal to 'b', it subtracts 'b' from 'a'; otherwise, it adds the difference of 'b' and 'a' to 'base' to perform a mod subtraction.
