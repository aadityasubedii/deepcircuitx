    "block_comment": "The block of code is a simple clock-driven operation in a Verilog module. The function of this code block is to assign new read data values to `rd_data_upd_indx_r` during the rising edge of the clock cycle, with some given time delay denoted by `#TCQ`. The way this block implements its function is by using an 'always' control block that gets activated at every positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. Then it assigns the value of the variable `new_rd_data` to `rd_data_upd_indx_r` after a delay of `#TCQ` time units."
