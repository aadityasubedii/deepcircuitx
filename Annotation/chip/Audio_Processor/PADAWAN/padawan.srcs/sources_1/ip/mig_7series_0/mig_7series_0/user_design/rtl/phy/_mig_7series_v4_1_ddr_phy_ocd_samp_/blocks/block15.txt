Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for latch operation on a variable named 'rd_victim_sel_r'. It does this by capturing the value of the non-blocking statement 'rd_victim_sel_ns' on the rising edge of a clock signal 'clk'. This operation is typical in digital design to control data flow and synchronicity. The delay model '#TCQ' is used, which represents a delay between the time the event (in this case, the rising edge of 'clk') occurs and the time when the right-hand side ('rd_victim_sel_ns') is evaluated and assigned to the left-hand side ('rd_victim_sel_r').
