    "block_comment": "The given block of code is used to assign the value of the signal 'end_rtp_lcl' to the signal 'start_pre_wait'. The assignment operation is performed continuously as it's an 'assign' statement, automatically updating 'start_pre_wait' whenever 'end_rtp_lcl' changes. It primarily acts as a wire connecting 'end_rtp_lcl' to 'start_pre_wait'."
