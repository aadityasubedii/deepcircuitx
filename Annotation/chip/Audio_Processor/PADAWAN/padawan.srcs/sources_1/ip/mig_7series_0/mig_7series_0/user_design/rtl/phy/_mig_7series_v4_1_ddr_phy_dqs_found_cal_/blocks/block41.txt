The block of code serves as a conditional directive for hardware generation based on a predefined parameter, 'HIGHEST_BANK'. The condition is only met if 'HIGHEST_BANK' equals 3. This directive is typically used to customize hardware structures, such as determining the number of memory banks or enabling certain modules, under different parameterized configurations. However, the implementation details of the action taken when the condition is met are not provided within the context of this code block.
