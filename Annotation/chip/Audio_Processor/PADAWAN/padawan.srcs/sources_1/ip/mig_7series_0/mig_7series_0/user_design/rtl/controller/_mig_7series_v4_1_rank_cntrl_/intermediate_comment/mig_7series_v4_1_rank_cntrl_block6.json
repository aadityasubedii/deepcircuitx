    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the counter operation for periodic read requests. The counter, `periodic_rd_cntr1_ns`, is usually updated with the value of `periodic_rd_cntr1_r`. However, when a clear periodic read request signal (`clear_periodic_rd_request`) is received, the counter gets incremented by 1, signaling for a new read request in the next state."
