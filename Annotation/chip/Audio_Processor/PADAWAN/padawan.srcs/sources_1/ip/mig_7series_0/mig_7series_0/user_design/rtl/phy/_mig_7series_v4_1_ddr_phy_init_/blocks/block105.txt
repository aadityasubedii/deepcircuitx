Comment: 
This Verilog block coordinates a counter called `complex_row_cnt` that is reset under certain conditions, and increments under specific others. On every positive edge of the `clk` clock cycle, if there is a reset '`rst`', or read leveling hasn't been done '`~rdlvl_stg1_done_r1`', or if read leveling based on a pseudorandom binary sequence is done '`prbs_rdlvl_done`', the counter `complex_row_cnt` is reset. However, if the write-read count equals 22 and either the initialization state is at a specified wait condition and the `complex_wait_cnt` equals 15, or an internal reference request for complex read level is sent '`complex_rdlvl_int_ref_req`', the counter increments by 1. In all other states, the counter will reset.
