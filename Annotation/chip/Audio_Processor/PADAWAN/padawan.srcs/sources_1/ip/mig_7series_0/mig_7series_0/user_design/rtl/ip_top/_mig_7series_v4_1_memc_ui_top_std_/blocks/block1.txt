This block is an instantiation of mig_7series_v4_1_ui_top module, which serves as the main interface for DDR memory controller. The module primarily facilitates data transmission and readability between memory and FPGA. Implementation wise, it is characterized by numerous input/output ports. Data and address information are passed via 'wr_data', 'data_buf_addr', 'rank', among others. Commands for read/write operations are handled by 'cmd'. The module also leverages a set of ready and acknowledge signals like 'app_wdf_rdy' and 'app_ref_ack' to address flow control, and utilizes ECC for error detection and correction.
