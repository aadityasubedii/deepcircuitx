    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog block is responsible for writing data into the physical layer when two conditions are met: the complex clock delay calibration is not finished and the physical data storage is not full. Specifically, it accomplishes this by checking if \"complex_oclkdelay_calib_done\" is false and \"phy_data_full\" is not true, and if both are the case, assigns prbs_o (a generated test pattern) to \"phy_wrdata\" as long as these conditions are satisfied. The time constant TCQ is used to define the delay for the assignment. This block is part of a larger code block entitled \"wrdq_div1_2to1_wrcal_first\".\n"
