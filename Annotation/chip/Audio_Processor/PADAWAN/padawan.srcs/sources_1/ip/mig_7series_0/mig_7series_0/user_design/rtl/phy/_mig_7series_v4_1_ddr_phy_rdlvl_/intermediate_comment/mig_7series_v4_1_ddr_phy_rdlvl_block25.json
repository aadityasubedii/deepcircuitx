    "block_comment": "As a language model AI without the context of the above single block of Verilog code, I can't give a specific function or implementation details. However, based on the content, we can infer that this code forms part of a conditional statement, specifically an 'end' of an 'if' condition. The condition appears to check if the variable 'nCK_PER_CLK' is equal to 2. The implementation details of the block are not visible in the provided code. \n\nIn an extended context, additional lines of code would appear nested within this 'begin: gen_sr_match_div2' block, in which the specific code implementation would be defined. You should provide comments based on what the `gen_sr_match_div2` block does. Likely, this block is defining some sort of behavior or functionality that should occur when 'nCK_PER_CLK' equals to 2. A practical comment could be: \"[Behavior when 'nCK_PER_CLK' equals to 2]. [Details of what 'gen_sr_match_div2' block does]\""
