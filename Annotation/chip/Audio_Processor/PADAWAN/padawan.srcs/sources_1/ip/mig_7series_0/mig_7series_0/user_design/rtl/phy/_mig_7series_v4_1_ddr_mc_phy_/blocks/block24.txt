Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code controls the reset operation and signal assignments for 'aux_out' array's specific indices in a synchronous manner. It initiates its action at the positive edge of 'auxout_clk' clock signal or 'rst_auxout' reset signal. When the 'rst_auxout' reset signal is at a high level, it will asynchronously reset the value of 'aux_out' at index 5 and 7 to zero with a delay of 100 units. If the 'rst_auxout' reset signal is at a low level, it will sync 'aux_out_' array's values to the 'aux_out' array at index 5 and 7 with the same delay. It's an implementation of synchronous reset with specific signal assignments.
