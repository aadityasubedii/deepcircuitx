    "block_comment": "This block of code handles updating the status of ECC (Error-Correcting Code) multiple error detection. It functions as a sequential logic circuit which latches the 'app_ecc_multiple_err_ns' signal into the 'app_ecc_multiple_err_r' register at every positive edge of the clock (rising edge-triggered). The actual data latching is delayed as indicated by '#TCQ', which might represent some pre-defined or user-defined delay in terms of clock cycles before the next state of 'app_ecc_multiple_err_ns' is memorized into the 'app_ecc_multiple_err_r' register."
