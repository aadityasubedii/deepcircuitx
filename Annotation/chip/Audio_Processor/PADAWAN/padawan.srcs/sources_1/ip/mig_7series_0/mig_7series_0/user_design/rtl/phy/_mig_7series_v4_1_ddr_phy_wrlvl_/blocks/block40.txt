This block of code assigns the value held in 'corse_cnt[v]' to a 3-bit slice of 'corse_cnt_dbg' at position '3*v'. It achieves this via a for loop which increments 'v' until it is less than 'DQS_WIDTH', ensuring that each 3-bit segment of 'corse_cnt_dbg' is filled with a corresponding value from the 'corse_cnt' array.
