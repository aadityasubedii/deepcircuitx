    "block_comment": "This block of code constitutes a register that saves the value of 'diff_ns' with a delay. This register only updates at rising edge of the clock (indicated by 'posedge clk'), characteristically following edge-triggered behavior. The delay is set with the delay value 'TCQ'. In essence, the block acts as a delay line for the 'diff_ns' signal."
