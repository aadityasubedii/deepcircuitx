This block assigns the value of the least significant bit of 'rnk_config_strobe_r' to the 'upd_rnk_config_last_master'. The 'assign' keyword is used to generate combinational logic: when a change in 'rnk_config_strobe_r' is observed, 'upd_rnk_config_last_master' is updated almost simultaneously. The bit-select operator '[0]' fetches the least significant bit of 'rnk_config_strobe_r'.
