    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a resettable counter that increments under a specific condition. When the system reset signal (rst) is high, it resets the count value of 'ocal_act_wait_cnt' to 0. Otherwise, if the system is in 'INIT_OCAL_CENTER_ACT_WAIT' state and the current count is less than 15, the count 'ocal_act_wait_cnt' gets incremented by one at the positive edge of the clock signal 'clk'. In all other cases, 'ocal_act_wait_cnt' is reset to 0. This block is essentially used for creating a time delay or wait state based on the system clock cycles for some specific operations to occur."
