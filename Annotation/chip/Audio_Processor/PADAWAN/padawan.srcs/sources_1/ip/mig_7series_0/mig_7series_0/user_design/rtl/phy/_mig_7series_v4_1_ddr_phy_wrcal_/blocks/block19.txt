Comment: 
This code block works as a pattern matching module for rising and falling signals. On every positive edge of the clock, it checks if each rising and falling signal pairs, sr_rise/sr_fall and pat_rise/pat_fall or early_rise/early_fall, are identical for various permutations of indices. If they match, it sets the corresponding match flag, else it resets it. The comparisons are conducted modularly for sr and early or pat signals, which illustrates cyclic pattern matching. These checks are performed in parallel, optimizing execution time. The '#TCQ' delay denotes a technology-specific cell delay.
