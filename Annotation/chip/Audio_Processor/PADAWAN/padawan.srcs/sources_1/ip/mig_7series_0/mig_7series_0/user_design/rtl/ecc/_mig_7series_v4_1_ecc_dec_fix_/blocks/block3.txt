Comment: 
This block replicates the raw data bitstream derived from an error checking and correcting (ECC) mechanism to a read data (rd_data) array indexed according to a given payload width. It does this by monitoring changes to the 'ecc_rddata_r' variable and subsequently allocating corresponding segments of 'ecc_rddata_r' (based on payload width) into the 'rd_data' array. This operation facilitates efficient handling of the read data bitstream in ECC monitored systems.
