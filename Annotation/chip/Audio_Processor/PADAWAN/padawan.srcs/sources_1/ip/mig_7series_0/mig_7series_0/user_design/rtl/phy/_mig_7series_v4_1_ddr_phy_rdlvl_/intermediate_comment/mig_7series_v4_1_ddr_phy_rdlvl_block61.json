    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code assigns pattern values to four primary arrays, namely idel_pat0, idel_pat1, pat0, and pat1 with different combinations for rising and falling conditions. The patterns are binary sequences specified for different instances when the clock frequency, represented by nCK_PER_CLK, is equal to 2. They represent rising and falling conditions for each clock pulse in a dual-frequency system and are used in the generation of pattern sequences. Each pattern is generated using a series of 'assign' statements, a standard Verilog keyword used for continuous assignments. These definitions are used for sequential logic manipulations in the waveform generation phases of a hardware system/unit."
