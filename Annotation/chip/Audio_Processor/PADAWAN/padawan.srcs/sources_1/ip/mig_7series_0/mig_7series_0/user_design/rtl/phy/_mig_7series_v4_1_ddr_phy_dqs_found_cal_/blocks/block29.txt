The function of this block is to monitor and control error handling related to the DQS (data strobe) signal in the context of memory operations. In each clock cycle, if a reset signal is detected, it will clear an error flag `pi_dqs_found_err_r` for a specific memory bank. Else, if certain conditions related to data quality are not met (a valid DQS signal is not found, the current retry count equals a set limit, and the reading byte-offset timing does not meet the sum of CL and AL constraints), it will set the error flag. This mechanism is essential to maintain data integrity during memory operations.
