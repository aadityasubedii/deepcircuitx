Comment: 
The block assigns the 'start_pre_wait' signal based on the conditions in the expression. It serves to indicate the beginning of a pre-wait state in a process or operation, acting as a trigger for subsequent logic. The 'start_pre_wait' signal is set to true either when an operation exit grant ('op_exit_grant') is given or when both end of round-trip time locally ('end_rtp_lcl') is achieved and neither tail round ('tail_r') active nor passing an open bank operation ('passing_open_bank') is ongoing, hence closely monitoring the multiple controls in the system design.
