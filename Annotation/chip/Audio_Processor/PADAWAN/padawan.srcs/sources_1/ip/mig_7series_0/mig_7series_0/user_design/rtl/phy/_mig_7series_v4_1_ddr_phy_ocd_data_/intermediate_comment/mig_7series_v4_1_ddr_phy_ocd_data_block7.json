    "block_comment": "This block of code is for the implementation of a digital circuit which registers the value of `prbs_ignore_last_bytes` at the rising edge of the clock signal (clk). A delay of TCQ units is employed for synchronization purposes. This circuit is typically implemented in data communications context for purposes such as ignoring specific bytes in a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS). The variable `prbs_ignore_last_bytes_r` is updated with `prbs_ignore_last_bytes` at the rising edge of `clk`, after a delay of #TCQ time units.\n"
