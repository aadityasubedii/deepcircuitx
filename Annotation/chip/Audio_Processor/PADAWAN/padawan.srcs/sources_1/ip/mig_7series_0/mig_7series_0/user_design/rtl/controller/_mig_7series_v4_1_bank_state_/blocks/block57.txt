This block implements an operation mode in a memory system, specifically controlling and managing the wait state. The block conditions the wait state on column access, ongoing read to precharge (RTP) activity, precharge wait when the RAS timer is not zero, or the operation wait asserting. Use of an operation active signal indicates that the operation mode is initiated when not under reset or during a passed open bank condition. It is true if the cycle is the last readiness interval operation (end RTP) on a local line and the tail command is registered, or the operation wait is asserted.
