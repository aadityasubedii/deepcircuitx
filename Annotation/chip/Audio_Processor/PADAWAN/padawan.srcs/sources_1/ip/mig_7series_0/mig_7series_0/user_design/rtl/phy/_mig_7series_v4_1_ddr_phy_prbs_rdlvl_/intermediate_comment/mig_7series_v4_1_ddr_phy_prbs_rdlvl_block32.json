    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as a counter error check. Through the use of a flip-flop that's triggered at the positive edge of the clock signal, the module keeps track of the counter `wait_state_cnt_r` not exceeding a certain limit of 14. If the counter value is less than 14, it flags the error condition `err_chk_invalid` after a delay specified by `#TCQ`, signifying the occurrence of a potential abnormal operation."
