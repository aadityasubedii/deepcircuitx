This block of code functions as a synchronous counter with reset functionality in a Verilog design. The counter increments 'lane_cnt_dqs_c_r' each time 'po_en_stg2_c' is HIGH and delay count 'delay_cnt_r' equals to 1, on the rising edge of the clock. If the reset 'rst' signal is active, the counter 'lane_cnt_dqs_c_r' gets reset immediately to 0, ignoring the other conditions. The delay simulation is modeled using '#TCQ' to reflect the delay introduced due to gate stages.
