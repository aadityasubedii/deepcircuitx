Comment: 
This block assigns the value of `maint_sre_r_lcl` to `maint_sre_r`. This is done through continuous assignment, denoted by the `assign` keyword in Verilog, which means `maint_sre_r` is updated throughout the simulation whenever the value of `maint_sre_r_lcl` changes. It is a simple wiring connection between these two registers. The change in signal values will take place instantaneously.
