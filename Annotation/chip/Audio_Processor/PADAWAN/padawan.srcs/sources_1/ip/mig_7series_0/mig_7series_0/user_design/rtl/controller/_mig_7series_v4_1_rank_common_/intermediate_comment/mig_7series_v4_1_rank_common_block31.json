    "block_comment": "This block of code describes a flip-flop, a basic digital circuit used in digital electronics. Upon each positive edge of the `clk` (clock) signal, the right-hand side expression `maint_srx_ns`'s value is sampled and propagated to the flip-flop output `maint_srx_r_lcl` after a delay specified by `TCQ`."
