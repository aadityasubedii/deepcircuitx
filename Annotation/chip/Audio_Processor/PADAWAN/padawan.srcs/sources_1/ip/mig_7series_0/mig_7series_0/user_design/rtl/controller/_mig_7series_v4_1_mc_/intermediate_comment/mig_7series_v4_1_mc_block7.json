    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code is responsible for implementing an Error Correction Code (ECC) check feature. If the ECC is turned ON (as specified by the ECC variable), then the code segment begins to execute. In this case, the block defines a register 'mc_wrdata_en_r' for storing the enable signal status of memory write data and a wire 'mc_wrdata_en_i' that represents the input enable signal for the memory controller's write data. This setup permits ECC features to correct any errors that may arise during the memory write process."
