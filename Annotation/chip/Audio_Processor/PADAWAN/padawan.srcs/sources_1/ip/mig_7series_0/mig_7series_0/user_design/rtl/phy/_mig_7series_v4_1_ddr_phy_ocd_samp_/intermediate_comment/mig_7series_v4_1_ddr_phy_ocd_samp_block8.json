    "block_comment": "This Verilog code defines two 1-bit registers, `sm_ns` and `sm_r`. The two registers are implemented as single bit widths, indicated by the range [0:0], which signifies that they can respectively hold binary values of either 0 or 1. They may represent state variables in a finite state machine (FSM), with `sm_ns` potentially representing the next state and `sm_r` the reset."
