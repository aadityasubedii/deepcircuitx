Comment: 
The code block enables selection between two data signals - `prde_r2` and `phy_rddata_en` - based on the status of the `complex_oclkdelay_calib_start` signal. More specifically, it uses the `complex_oclkdelay_calib_start` signal as a control or selection signal to a multiplexer structure implemented using ternary operator. If `complex_oclkdelay_calib_start` is high or true, `prde_r2` is selected as the output `prde`. Otherwise, the `phy_rddata_en` signal is selected.
