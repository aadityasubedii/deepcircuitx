[188, 188]
Comment: 
This block is a flip-flop that captures the state of `tap_ns` on the rising edge of a clock signal. This function is achieved through a non-blocking assignment within an `always` block, which is triggered at the positive edge of the `clk` signal. The time delay `#TCQ` models the clock-to-Q delay.
