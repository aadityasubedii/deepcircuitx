    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code calculates the difference between two stages in an RTL design, `stg3_r` and `stg3_init`. It utilizes a ternary operation to determine the sign of this difference - if `stg3_r` is greater than `stg3_init`, the difference is scaled by -2. On the other hand, if `stg3_init` is greater than `stg3_r`, the difference is scaled by 2. The resulting value is stored in the wire `stg2_steps`. The values are cast to signed to handle negative results."
