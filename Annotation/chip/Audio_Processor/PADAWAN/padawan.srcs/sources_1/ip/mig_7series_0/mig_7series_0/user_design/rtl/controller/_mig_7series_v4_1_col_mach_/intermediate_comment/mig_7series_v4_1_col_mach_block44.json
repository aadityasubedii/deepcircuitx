    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block implements a register and a conditional assign statement. The register stores the least significant bit of the 'offset_ns' variable every rising edge of the clock and assigns this value to the 'offset_r' array. The second line of code does a conditional assign to the 'data_end' bit, checking if the 'col_size' is not zero, if 'col_size' is not zero then it assigns the value in 'offset_r[0]' to 'data_end', otherwise 'data_end' is set to 1."
