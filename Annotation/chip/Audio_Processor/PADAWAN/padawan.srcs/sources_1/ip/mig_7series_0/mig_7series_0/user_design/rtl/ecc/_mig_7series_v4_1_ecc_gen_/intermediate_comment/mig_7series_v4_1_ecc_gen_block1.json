    "block_comment": "This block of code transposes an HT (Hammings Table) matrix in a Verilog hardware description. The implementation is achieved through a for loop that iterates over the width of the ECC (Error Correcting Code), assigning each element of the HT matrix to their transposed position in 'h_rows'. The location in 'h_rows' is calculated using the current index of the ECC width and the code width."
