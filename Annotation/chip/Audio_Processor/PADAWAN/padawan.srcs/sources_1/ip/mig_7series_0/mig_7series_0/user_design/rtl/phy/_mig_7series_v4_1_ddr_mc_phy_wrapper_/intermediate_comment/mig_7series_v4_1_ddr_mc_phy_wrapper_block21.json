    "block_comment": "This block of code performs bit reordering or multiplexing for a physical output array (phy_dout) used in a memory bank mapping circuit. It uses a for loop with a labelled begin-end block, loop_xpose, to ensure that the indexed access to the BANK_MAP and the assignment operation to phy_dout array occur four times. The index calculation for physical output array (phy_dout) is done by a complex mathematical expression which includes bit slicing and arithmetic division. The assigned value comes from the mux_bank array, which index is computed based on the loop variable n and another indexing variable m."
