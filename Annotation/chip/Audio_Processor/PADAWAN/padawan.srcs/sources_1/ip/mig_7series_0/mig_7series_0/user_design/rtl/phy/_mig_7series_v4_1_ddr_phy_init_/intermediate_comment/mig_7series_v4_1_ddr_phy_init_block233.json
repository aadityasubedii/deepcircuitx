    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages the state of 'calib_writes' signal based on the reset signal and the current initial state. This is achieved by using a clock-edge driven procedural block that reacts at the positive edge of the 'clk' signal. If 'rst' is asserted, 'calib_writes' is set to 0 after some delay defined by 'TCQ'. If the 'init_state_r' is in either 'INIT_OCLKDELAY_WRITE', 'INIT_OCAL_CENTER_WRITE', 'INIT_RDLVL_STG1_WRITE', 'INIT_RDLVL_STG1_WRITE_READ', 'INIT_WRCAL_WRITE', or 'INIT_WRCAL_WRITE_READ' states, 'calib_writes' is set to 1 after the same delay 'TCQ'. In all other cases, 'calib_writes' is again set to 0 after the same delay 'TCQ'."
