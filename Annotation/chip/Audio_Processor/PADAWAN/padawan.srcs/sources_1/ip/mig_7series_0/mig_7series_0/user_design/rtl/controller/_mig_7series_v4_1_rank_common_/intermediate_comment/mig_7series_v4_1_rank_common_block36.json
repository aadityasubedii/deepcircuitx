    "block_comment": "This block assigns a new maintenance rank to 'maint_req_r_lcl' on each positive edge of the clock. The assignment is delayed by a 'TCQ' (Time Constant Quantum) period to mimic the response time of an actual hardware operation. The 'new_maint_rank_r' serves as the new maintenance rank."
