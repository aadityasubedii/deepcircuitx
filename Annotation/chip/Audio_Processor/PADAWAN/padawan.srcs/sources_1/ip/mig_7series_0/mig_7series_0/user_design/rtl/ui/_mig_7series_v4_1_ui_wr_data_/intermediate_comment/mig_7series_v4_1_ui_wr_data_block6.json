    "block_comment": "This block primarily performs data writing operations on the memory of a system. At the rising edge of the system clock, it assigns the write buffer output data a delay of TCQ time units to help synchronize write operations. The implementation makes use of a for-loop to instantiate RAM32M modules, a 32-register memory array component, for RAM_CNT number of times. For each instantiation, it assigns 2-bit subsets of both input and output data and sets the write configurations. The write address, write enable signal, and write clock are all controlled from external signals to meet the write timing."
