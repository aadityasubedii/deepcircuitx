    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for updating the value of 'maint_rank_r_lcl' during the rising edge of the 'clk' signal. The update is based on 'maint_rank_ns' value and is delayed by #TCQ units of simulation time. Specifically, a nonblocking assignment is used, ensuring that all updates within the same timestep (based on rising edge of the clk signal) are evaluated before they are executed, ensuring synchronous updates over a situation where execution order might become important."
