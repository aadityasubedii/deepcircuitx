Comment: 
The function `clogb2` calculates the base-2 logarithm rounded up to the nearest integer for a given input `size`. The function achieves this by entering into a for loop where it continually divides `size` by 2 (which is equivalent to a right shift operation `size >> 1` in binary representation), and simultaneously increments the function's return value `clogb2` until `size` is no longer greater than 1. This essentially counts the number of times `size` can be halved before it becomes 1, effectively approximating the base-2 logarithm.
