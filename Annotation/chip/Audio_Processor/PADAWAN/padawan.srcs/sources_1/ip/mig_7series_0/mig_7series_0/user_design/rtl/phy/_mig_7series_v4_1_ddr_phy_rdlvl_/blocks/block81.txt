This block is a part of a calibration process for a DRAM module. At the positive edge of the clock, if 'rst' is set, it sets the range of 'dlyce_dq_r' array to 0. Otherwise, the module checks for various calibration options and works accordingly. If 'SIM_CAL_OPTION' equals "SKIP_CAL", again the range of 'dlyce_dq_r' is set to 0. If 'SIM_CAL_OPTION' equals "FAST_CAL", it loops through the 'DRAM_WIDTH' and assigns the 'cal1_dlyce_dq_r' to 'dlyce_dq_r' by index. If 'SIM_CAL_OPTION' equals "NONE" or "FAST_WIN_DETECT", 'cal1_dlyce_dq_r' is assigned to 'dlyce_dq_r' by index, only if 'cal1_cnt_cpt_r' equals 'z'. Otherwise, the same range of 'dlyce_dq_r' is set to 0.
