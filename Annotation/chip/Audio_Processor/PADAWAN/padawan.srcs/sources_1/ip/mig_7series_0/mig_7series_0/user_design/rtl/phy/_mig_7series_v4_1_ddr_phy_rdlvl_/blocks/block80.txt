Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is designed to control a delay increment flip-flop named `dlyinc_dq_r`. It works by resetting the flip-flop to 0 on a positive clock edge when a reset signal (`rst`) is high. When the `rst` signal isn't high (i.e., it is low), the value of `cal1_dlyinc_dq_r` is fed into and stored in the flip-flop. The delay (`#TCQ`) reflects the timing control for how quickly these operations respond to their control signals.
