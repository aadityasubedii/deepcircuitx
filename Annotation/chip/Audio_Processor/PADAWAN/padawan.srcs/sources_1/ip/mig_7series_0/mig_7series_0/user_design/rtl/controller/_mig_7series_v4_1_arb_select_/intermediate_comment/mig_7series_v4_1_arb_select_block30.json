    "block_comment": "The block, residing within an always block, manages command operations primarily for assigning 'cmd1'. The assignment is determined by which of the 'send_cmd1_row' or 'send_cmd1_col' is active. Initially, 'cmd1' is filled with high values, then it is updated with 'row_cmd_ns' or 'col_cmd_ns' based on whether 'send_cmd1_row' or 'send_cmd1_col' is high respectively. This high priority nature allows for command signals to be quickly assigned. Command issuing is controlled through the use of sensitive signals such as 'send_cmd1_row', 'send_cmd1_col', 'row_cmd_ns', 'col_cmd_ns', and 'pre_cmd_ns'."
