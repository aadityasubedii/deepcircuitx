    "block_comment": "This block of code performs memory address ordering and allocation based on specific test cases or configuration. It assigns values to the column, row, bank and rank variables using bitwise operations. The type of allocation is based on the `MEM_ADDR_ORDER` value, and varies by \"TG_TEST\" and \"ROW_BANK_COLUMN\". The code conditionally checks if `app_rdy_r` is ready; if true, it assigns from `app_addr_r1`, otherwise from `app_addr_r2`. In cases where `RANKS` is equal to 1, certain bit-width allotments are made, if not, others are used for address assignment. \"ROW_BANK_COLUMN\" is a separate memory address ordering approach, where each entity, col, row, bank and rank, is assigned based on a portion of the available address space. If none of the conditions for \"TG_TEST\" or \"ROW_BANK_COLUMN\" apply, it defaults to col, row, and bank assignments similar to \"ROW_BANK_COLUMN\", with rank defaulted to zero if `RANKS==1`."
