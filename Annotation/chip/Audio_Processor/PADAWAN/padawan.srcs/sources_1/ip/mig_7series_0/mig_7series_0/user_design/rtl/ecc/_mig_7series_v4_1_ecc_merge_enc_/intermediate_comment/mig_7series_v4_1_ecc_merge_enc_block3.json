    "block_comment": "This block writes raw data and the corresponding error-checking and correction (ECC) bits to memory. The data and ECC bits are separated internally and written to the same memory word. The data is separated out using an always block, which checks at every step for changes in the h_rows or merged_data or raw_not_ecc_r variables. The data is combined together based on the DQ_WIDTH of the memory array. Concurrently, an XOR operation is performed bit by bit on the portion of merged_data and h_rows to generate the ECC bits. The ECC bits are stored in mc_wrdata_c, replacing the least significant bits of corresponding raw data. This process allows for detection and correction of single-bit errors in the data when it is read back from memory."
