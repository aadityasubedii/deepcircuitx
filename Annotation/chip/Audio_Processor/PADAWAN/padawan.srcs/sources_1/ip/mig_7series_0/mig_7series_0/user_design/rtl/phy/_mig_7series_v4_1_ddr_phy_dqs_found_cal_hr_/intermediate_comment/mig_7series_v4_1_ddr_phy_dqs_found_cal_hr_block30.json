    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block serves the purpose of managing read byte data offset in synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) operation. It operates under a positive edge-triggered clock and includes initial reset operations. When the rst signal is high, a for loop iterates over the ranks resetting rd_byte_data_offset. Outside the reset scope, several conditions control the rank_done_r1, init_dqsfound_done_r signals, and a comparison between rd_byte_data_offset and a calculated latency value which will update rd_byte_data_offset. In the last scenario, if conditions related to dqs_found_start_r, detect_pi_found_dqs, and fine_adjust are met, rd_byte_data_offset is incremented by 1. All these transactions happen in one clock cycle due to use of '#TCQ' timing constraint."
