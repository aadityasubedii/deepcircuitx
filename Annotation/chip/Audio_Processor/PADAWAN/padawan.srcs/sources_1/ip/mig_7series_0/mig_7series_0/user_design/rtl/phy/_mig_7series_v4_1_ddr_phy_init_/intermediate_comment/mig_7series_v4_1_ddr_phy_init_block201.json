    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is conditional hardware generation unit, which works based on the value of the macro variable `RANKS`. If the value of `RANKS` is less than 2, this block generates a sequential circuit which gets activated on the positive edge of the `clk` signal. The `generate` keyword in Verilog RTL is utilized for conditional inclusion or exclusion of certain parts of the code, thus allowing parameterized hardware generation which can be controlled using macro variables like `RANKS`. The `always @(posedge clk)` statement enables the synthesis of a sequential block that updates its output at the rising edge of the clock."
