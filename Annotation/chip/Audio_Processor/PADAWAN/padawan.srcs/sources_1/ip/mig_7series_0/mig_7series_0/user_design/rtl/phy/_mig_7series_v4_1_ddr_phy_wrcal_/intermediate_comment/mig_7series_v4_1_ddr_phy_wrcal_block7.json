    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to implement a pipeline in synchronization with the input clock signal, specifically for the `wrcal_pat_resume` signal. The pipelining is achieved through the use of three registers (`wrcal_pat_resume_r1`, `wrcal_pat_resume_r2`, `wrcal_pat_resume`). On each positive edge of `clk`, `wrcal_pat_resume_r1` is assigned the current value of `wrcal_pat_resume_r`, `wrcal_pat_resume_r2` then takes the value of `wrcal_pat_resume_r1`, and finally `wrcal_pat_resume` receives the value from `wrcal_pat_resume_r2`. The `#TCQ` annotation indicates a delay, ensuring that signal assignment occurs after the propagation delay of the registers."
