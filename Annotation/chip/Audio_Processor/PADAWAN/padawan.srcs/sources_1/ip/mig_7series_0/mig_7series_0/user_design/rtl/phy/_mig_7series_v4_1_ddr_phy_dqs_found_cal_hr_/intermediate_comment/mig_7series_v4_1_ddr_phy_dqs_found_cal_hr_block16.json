    "block_comment": "The block of code, characterized by a synchronous design, performs the function of managing the offset of read byte data with respect to an external clock signal. The offset is set and updated based on logic states of various control lines like reset(rst), rank_done_r1, init_dqsfound_done_r and dqs_found_start_r along with parameters like nCL, nAL, RANKS and LATENCY_FACTOR. In essence, it manages latency problems between the memory and receiving module during data read. Initially, on reset, each rank\u2019s offset defaults to sum of nCL and nAL minus two. It's then updated when rank_done_r1 is true & init_dqsfound_done_r is not, or when rd_byte_data_offset exceeds a threshold. Additionally, this offset also increments when a started but incomplete search process finds the DQS signal while the read count equals to 1 and no fine adjustment is occurring; all with a time delay of TCQ."
