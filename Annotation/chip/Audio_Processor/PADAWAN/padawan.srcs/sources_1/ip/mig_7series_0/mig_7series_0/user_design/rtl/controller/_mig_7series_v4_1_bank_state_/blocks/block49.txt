Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code implements an operation exit request (`op_exit_req`). The operation exit request is activated when the system is in the low idle count state (`low_idle_cnt_r`) and the operation is active (`op_active`), or when the system is in an operation wait state (`op_wait_r`) and none of the bits in the operation count (`op_cnt_r`) are high (~|). This design leverages the inherent concurrency of Verilog and bit-wise operations to control the flow of operations.
