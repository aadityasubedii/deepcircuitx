    "block_comment": "The block of code represents a sequential logic block in the provided Verilog design, which updates the value of a specific variable with a delay on every positive edge of a clock signal. The shift of value `prbs_dqs_cnt_timing` towards `prbs_dqs_cnt_timing_r` is carried out with a delay denoted by `#TCQ` at each rising edge (posedge) of the clock signal `clk`."
