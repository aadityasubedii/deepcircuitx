    "block_comment": "This block manages the address for the read data buffer. The logic is triggered by signals: reset (rst), read_accepted (rd_accepted) or a change in the local read data buffer address (rd_data_buf_addr_r_lcl). Upon reset, it initializes the next-state address (rd_data_buf_addr_ns) to zero. Otherwise, when the read is accepted, it increments the local read data buffer address by one, effectively pointing to the next data to be read."
