    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block provides sequential control for a finite state machine (FSM) in an always block with combinatorial logic. It uses a case statement to define transitions between several states including IDLE, INIT, WAIT_WR_REQ, and others. The transitions are determined by specific condition checks such as 'lim_start', 'wait_cnt_done', 'poc2lim_detect_done', etc. Signals like 'stg3_dec', 'stg2_inc', and 'ktap_right' are used to control and influence different state behaviors. Iterations between the different states manage tasks such as initialization, waiting for write requests, decrementing or increasing stage three, checking stage two, and making precharge requests. When all operations are done, the FSM returns to the IDLE state. The code handles any unanticipated states by defaulting 'lim_nxt_state' to IDLE."
