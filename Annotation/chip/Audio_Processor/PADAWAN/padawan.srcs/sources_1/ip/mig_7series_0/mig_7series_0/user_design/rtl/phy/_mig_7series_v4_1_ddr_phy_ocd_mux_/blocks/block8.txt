Comment: 
This block of code assigns the value of `po_stg23_incdec_r` to `po_stg23_incdec`. The `assign` keyword in Verilog is used for continuous assignment statements, which means the right-hand side expression is evaluated and assigned to the left-hand side immediately when any operand changes its value. The net `po_stg23_incdec` hence always reflects the current value of `po_stg23_incdec_r`.
