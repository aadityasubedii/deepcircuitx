    "block_comment": "This block is a signal assignment operation in Verilog RTL code. It assigns the value of \"scan_done_r\" to the signal \"scan_done\". This is a simple one-liner Verilog code that is commonly used in design and test verification flows where \"scan_done_r\" might represent the status of a certain scan operation and \"scan_done\" could be the signal used by other parts of the system to denote the completion of the scan."
