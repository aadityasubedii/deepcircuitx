This code block manages the assignment of a signal related to a busy state in a memory system. The signal, `rb_hit_busy_ns`, goes high when a hit is detected in the specified rank and bank, and the system is not in an idle state. This is achieved using an AND operation between `rank_bank_hit` and the inverted `idle_ns` signal, the result of which is assigned to the local variable `rb_hit_busy_ns_lcl`. The block then assigns this local variable to the `rb_hit_busy_ns` output wire. The behavior ensures that `rb_hit_busy_ns` correctly reflects the current busy state of the rank and bank.
