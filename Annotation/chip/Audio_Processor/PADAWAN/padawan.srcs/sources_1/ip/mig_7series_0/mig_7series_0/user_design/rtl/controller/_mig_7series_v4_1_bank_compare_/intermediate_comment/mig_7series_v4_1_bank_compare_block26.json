    "block_comment": "This block of code is a single-line flip-flop for the 'rd_wr_r_lcl' signal, triggered on the positive edge of a clock ('clk'). This means that at every moment when the 'clk' signal goes from low to high, the current value of the 'rd_wr_ns' signal is stored in 'rd_wr_r_lcl' after a delay specified by 'TCQ'. The stored value remains constant and independent of 'rd_wr_ns' till the next positive edge of the clock. This way, the block's function is to safely latch 'rd_wr_ns' value with respect to the clock and prevent any unwanted alterations due to glitches or changes in the 'rd_wr_ns' signal in between two sequential clock edges. This particular flip-flop module is essential in synchronizing data between different domains operating at the same clock frequency."
