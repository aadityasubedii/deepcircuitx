This block implements a lookup table (LUT) that maps 8-bit read addresses to 18-bit output values. The LUT is implemented using a case statement within an always block triggered by changes in the read address (rd_addr). For each address, a corresponding 18-bit value is assigned to mem_out, consisting of a 2-bit prefix and two 8-bit segments. The LUT contains various patterns and sequences, including repeating patterns, incrementing values, and special cases for specific address ranges.
