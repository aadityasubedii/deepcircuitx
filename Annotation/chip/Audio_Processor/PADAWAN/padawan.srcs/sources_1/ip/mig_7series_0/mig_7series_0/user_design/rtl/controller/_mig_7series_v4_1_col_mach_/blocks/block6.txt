This block of code is handling the read data offset synchronization in a digital system. Its functionality is triggered on the rising edge (posedge) of the clock signal (clk), which is a common technique used in synchronous digital designs to ensure timing and state machine movement correctness. The '#TCQ' is used for delaying the assignment of 'rd_data_offset_ns' to 'rd_data_offset' with a time delay defined by 'TCQ'. This is used to model the real-world delay of the hardware.
