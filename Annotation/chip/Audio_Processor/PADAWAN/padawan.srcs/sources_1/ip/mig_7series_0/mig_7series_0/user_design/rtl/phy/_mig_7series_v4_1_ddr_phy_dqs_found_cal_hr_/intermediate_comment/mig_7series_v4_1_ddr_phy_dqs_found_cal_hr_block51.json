    "block_comment": "This block of code implements register functionality for reset signal delay in a synchronous digital system. On every rising edge of the clock, `rst_dqs_find` is registered in `rst_dqs_find_r1`, which is then registered in `rst_dqs_find_r2` after one clock cycle. This achieves a two-cycle delay for the reset signal, `rst_dqs_find`, essential for synchronization in complex systems."
