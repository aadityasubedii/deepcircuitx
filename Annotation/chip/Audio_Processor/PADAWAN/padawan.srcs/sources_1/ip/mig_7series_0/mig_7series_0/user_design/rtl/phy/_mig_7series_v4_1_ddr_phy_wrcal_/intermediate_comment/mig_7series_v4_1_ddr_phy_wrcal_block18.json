    "block_comment": "This block of code updates pattern matching and validation flags on every rising clock edge. The pattern match flags, for both rise and fall, are created for 4 different conditions (signified by 0 to 3), with each flag delayed by a time of #TCQ. The pattern dataset match flag ('pat_data_match_r') is an AND operation of all these individual pattern match flags, delayed by the same #TCQ time. Finally, the pattern data validity ('pat_data_match_valid_r') is updated depending on the last read activity, also delayed by #TCQ."
