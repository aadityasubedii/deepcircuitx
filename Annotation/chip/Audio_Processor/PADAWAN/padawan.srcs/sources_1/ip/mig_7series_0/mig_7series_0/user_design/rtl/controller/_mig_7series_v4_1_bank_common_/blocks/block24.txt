This block of code describes memory write operation control in a Verilog module. The block is essentially a flip-flop that sets the 'was_wr' control signal on the rising edge of the clock. The write operation occurs when the 'cmd[0]' is set, and it does not occur when 'periodic_rd_r' is set and 'periodic_rd_ack_r_lcl' is not set (ensures no overlapping read and write operations). The condition checking is achieved using boolean logic operators. The delay element '#TCQ' is used to the maintain timing constraints in the pipeline stage.
