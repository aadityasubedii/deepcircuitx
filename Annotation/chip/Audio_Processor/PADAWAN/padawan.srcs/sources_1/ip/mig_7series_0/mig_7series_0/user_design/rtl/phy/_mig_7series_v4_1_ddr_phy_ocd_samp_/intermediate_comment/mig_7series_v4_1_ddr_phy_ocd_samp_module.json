    "module": "Module-level comment: The module 'mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_ocd_samp' performs delay calibration for a DDR PHY using on-chip sampling. Its functionality is based on whether complex or simple scan mode is chosen. With input commands, control signals, and data streams, the module governs its state machine operation, manages counters, and processes signals for delay calibration. There are also provisions for setting delay units and data reading from a multiplexer. Output includes calibration progress signals and sampling results. Internal signals and parameters guide sampling counts, comparison thresholds, delay calibration, and state transitions. The module's design and operation ensure efficient clock calibration for DDR interfaces."
