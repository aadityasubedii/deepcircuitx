    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block primarily functions as a level-sensitive latch that assigns the signal 'sent_col_lcl' to 'cs_en1' and 'send_cmd1_col'. The latch gets triggered whenever there's a change in the value of 'sent_col_lcl'. The implementation is straightforward \u2013 whenever 'sent_col_lcl' changes, it triggers the block, which subsequently assigns the value of 'sent_col_lcl' to 'cs_en1' and 'send_cmd1_col'."
