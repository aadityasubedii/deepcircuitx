    "block_comment": "This block of code is handling memory resets. When a reset signal (rst) is triggered on the clock's positive edge, it sets the memory registers (mr2_r and mr1_r) of the intended rank (rnk_i) to their default states. If no reset event is detected, it uses the current state of the temporary memory registers (tmp_mr2_r and tmp_mr1_r) for that rank. All transitions are timed according to the Timing and Control Quanta (TCQ) delay."
