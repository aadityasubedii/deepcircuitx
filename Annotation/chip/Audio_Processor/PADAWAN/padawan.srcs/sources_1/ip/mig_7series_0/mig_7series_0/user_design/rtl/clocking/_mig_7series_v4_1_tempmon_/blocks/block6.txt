This block controls the xadc_drdy and xadc_do registers based on xadc_clk signal and reset signal. Specifically, on the positive edge of the xadc_clk signal, if the reset signal (rst_r2) is true, both xadc_drdy_r and xadc_do_r are reset to zero with a certain time-constant delay (defined by TCQ). If the reset signal is not true, values of xadc_drdy and xadc_do are assigned to xadc_drdy_r and xadc_do_r respectively with the mutually defined delay.
