This block of code acts as a toggle for the "double_window_ind" under certain conditions. It is clocked on the positive edge of "clk". If the reset "rst" is active, the "double_window_ind" is asynchronously reset to 0 with a delay defined by #TCQ. In the absence of a reset, the "double_window_ind" is set to 1 if it's already 1, otherwise it checks if the "valid_window_cnt" is greater than 1 to set its value, again with a delay defined by #TCQ. Therefore, it controls the index of double window based on the count of valid windows.
