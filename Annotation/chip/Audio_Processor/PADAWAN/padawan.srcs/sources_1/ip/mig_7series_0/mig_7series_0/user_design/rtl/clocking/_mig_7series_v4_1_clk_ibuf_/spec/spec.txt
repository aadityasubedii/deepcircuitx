Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_clk_ibuf. 

Module specification: The mig_7series_v4_1_clk_ibuf is a clock buffering module catering to differential, single-ended, or internal clocks input present in Memory Interface Generator (MIG) designs. This module is parameterizable with the 'SYSCLK_TYPE' parameter determining the type of clock input - Differential, Single-ended, or No_Buffer for direct internal clocks. It possesses three input ports: 'sys_clk_p' and 'sys_clk_n' for receiving the positive and negative parts of the differential clock respectively, and 'sys_clk_i' for the single-ended or direct internal clocks. The output clock 'mmcm_clk' is derived from the conditioned clock signals, the type being chosen based on the 'SYSCLK_TYPE' parameter. An internal signal 'sys_clk_ibufg' acts as an interface between the input buffering block's output and the module's final output. Depending on the 'SYSCLK_TYPE' parameter, 'sys_clk_ibufg' is assigned the result of the differential input buffer (IBUFGDS), the single-ended buffer (IBUFG), or directly from the 'sys_clk_i'. 'sys_clk_ibufg' is eventually routed to 'mmcm_clk' acting as the output clock for the module. The module also accommodates the case where the differential clock requires termination through a parameter named 'DIFF_TERM_SYSCLK'. Overall, this module provides a flexible clock buffering solution for MIG architectures adaptable to different system design requirements.
