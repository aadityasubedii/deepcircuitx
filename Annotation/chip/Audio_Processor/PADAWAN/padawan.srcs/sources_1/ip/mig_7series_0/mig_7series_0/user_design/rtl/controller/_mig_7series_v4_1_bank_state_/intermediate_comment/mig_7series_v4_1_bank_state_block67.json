    "block_comment": "This block creates a wire named `ras_timer_passed_ns` that selects between two possible values based on the condition of `rcv_open_bank`. If `rcv_open_bank` is true, the value assigned to `ras_timer_passed_ns` is `passed_ras_timer`, otherwise, the value of `ras_timer_ns` is assigned. The purpose of switching between these two values is typically to control timing or sequencing events in a larger system context."
