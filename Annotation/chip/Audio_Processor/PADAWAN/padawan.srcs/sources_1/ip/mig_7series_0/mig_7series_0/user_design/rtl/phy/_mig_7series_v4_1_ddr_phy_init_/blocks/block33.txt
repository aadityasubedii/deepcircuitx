Comment: 
This block of Verilog code sets specific states for the PHY (Physical Layer) RAS (Row Address Strobe) signals based on the current initialization state. When the initialization state (init_state_r) matches any of the given conditions, it sets the first RAS signal (phy_ras_n[0]) to low and the second RAS signal (phy_ras_n[1]) to high after a delay of TCQ. If none of these conditions are met, both RAS signals are set to high after a delay of TCQ. The different conditions represent various initialization states or sequences where the RAS signals may need to be set differently.
