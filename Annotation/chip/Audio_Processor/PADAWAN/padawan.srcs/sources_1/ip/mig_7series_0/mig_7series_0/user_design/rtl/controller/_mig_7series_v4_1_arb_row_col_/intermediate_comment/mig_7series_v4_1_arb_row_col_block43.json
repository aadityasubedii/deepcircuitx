    "block_comment": "This block of code is for a register that latches the next-state value of the 'rnk_config_valid' signal on the rising edge of the clock. This is implemented using an always block with a posedge clock sensitivity list. The '#TCQ' represents a delay which specifies when the assignment occurs. In essence, the 'rnk_config_valid_r_lcl' signal is updated a '#TCQ' time units after every rising edge of the clock 'clk', with the updated value being 'rnk_config_valid_ns'."
