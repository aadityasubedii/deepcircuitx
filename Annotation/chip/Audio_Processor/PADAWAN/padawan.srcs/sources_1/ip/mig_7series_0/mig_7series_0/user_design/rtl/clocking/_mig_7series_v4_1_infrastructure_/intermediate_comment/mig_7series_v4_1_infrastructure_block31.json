    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for defining the active system reset and clock signal activation along with the PLL lock condition. The variable 'sys_rst_act_hi' is conditionally assigned based on 'RST_ACT_LOW'; if it is true, the negation of 'sys_rst' is assigned, otherwise 'sys_rst' is assigned. The clock signal 'clk' is directly assigned to 'clk_bufg'. The PLL locked status is a logical AND operation of 'pll_locked_i' and 'MMCM_Locked_i'. Also, 'mmcm_locked' is directly assigned as 'MMCM_Locked_i'."
