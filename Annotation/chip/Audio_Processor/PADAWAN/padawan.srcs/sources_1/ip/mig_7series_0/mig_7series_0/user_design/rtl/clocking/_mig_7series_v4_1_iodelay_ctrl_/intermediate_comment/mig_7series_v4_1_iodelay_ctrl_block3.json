    "block_comment": "This block primarily deals with: a) handling reset signals and b) synchronous updating of a register. On every rising edge of clk_ref[0] or rst_tmp_idelay, it checks if rst_tmp_idelay is high. When high, it synchronously resets the rst_ref_sync_r[0] register using a predefined delay, TCQ, and default value RST_SYNC_NUM{1'b1}. In case rst_tmp_idelay is not high, it bitwise left shifts the rst_ref_sync_r[0] using the same delay, TCQ, thereby achieving shift-register-like functionality."
