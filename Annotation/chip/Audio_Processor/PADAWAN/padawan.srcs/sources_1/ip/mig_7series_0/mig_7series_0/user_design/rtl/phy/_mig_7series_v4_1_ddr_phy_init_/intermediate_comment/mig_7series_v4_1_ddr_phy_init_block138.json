    "block_comment": "This block of code is a part of a state machine, specifically denoting the state \"INIT_DONE\". The implementation is quite straightforward, as the next state variable 'init_next_state' is being set to the 'INIT_DONE' state. This could imply that the initialization process is completed and the system can transition to this state to denote that fact, hence ready to begin its main function."
