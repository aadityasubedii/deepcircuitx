Comment: 
This block of logic handles the receiver bank selection in a memory system. The `rcv_open_bank` signal is set based on the combination of conditions: an active shared bus request (`rb_hit_busies_r_lcl[BM_SHARED_BV]`) and a passing open bank request (`passing_open_bank_in[BM_SHARED_BV]`), single entry in a queue (`q_entry_r == BM_CNT_ONE`), and the condition that the system is not idle (`~idle_r_lcl`). The `rcv_open_bank` signal effectively selects a receiver bank when there's a shared bus request passed to an open bank, a singular entry in the queue, and when the system is active.
