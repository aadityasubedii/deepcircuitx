    "block_comment": "The block initiates a `start_maint` event based on the state of readiness of the maintenance (`maint_rdy`) and the state of `maint_srx_r` signals. Specifically, `start_maint` is activated when `maint_rdy` goes high (i.e., becomes ready) while it was not ready in the previous clock cycle or when `maint_srx_r` goes high while it was not high in the previous clock cycle. This is achieved by using bitwise logical operations, specifically the AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) operators, and bitwise inversion (`~`) of signal states from the current and previous clock cycle."
