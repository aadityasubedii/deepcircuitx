    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a latch for initiating a ZQ calibration request once the initial calibration process is complete. The `always` keyword in conjunction with the sensitivity list `@(init_calib_complete or zq_request_r)` implies the block will react whenever there's a change in either `init_calib_complete` or `zq_request_r`. The logic inside the block assigns the 'and' operation of `init_calib_complete` and `zq_request_r` to `zq_request`, thereby ensuring a ZQ calibration request will only be flagged when the initial calibration is completed and a ZQ request is registered."
