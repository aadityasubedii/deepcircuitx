    "block_comment": "This block assigns the `calib_rank_cnt` with the current chip count signified by `chip_cnt_r`. The assignment is done using an  `assign` statement in Verilog, which allows continuous assignment. This means values are immediately assigned to the left-hand side as soon as changes occur on the right-hand side; in this case, whenever `chip_cnt_r` changes, the new value is straightaway updated to `calib_rank_cnt`. Hence, `calib_rank_cnt` is used for tracking the chip count in the calibration process, linking with the chip count, to facilitate calibration."
