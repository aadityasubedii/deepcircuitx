    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for assigning the value of the write data offset in a data buffer. It does this through a tiered conditional operation that takes into account different control flags and parameters. If the 'DELAY_WR_DATA_CNTRL' flag is set to 1, it assigns the value of 'offset_r1', a register value. If it isn't, it checks if the 'EARLY_WR_DATA_ADDR' is set to 'OFF'. If it is, it assigns 'offset_r', another register value. If it isn't, it assigns 'offset_ns', an inferred (next state) value. Each selected offset value corresponds to specific data buffer width as defined by 'DATA_BUF_OFFSET_WIDTH'."
