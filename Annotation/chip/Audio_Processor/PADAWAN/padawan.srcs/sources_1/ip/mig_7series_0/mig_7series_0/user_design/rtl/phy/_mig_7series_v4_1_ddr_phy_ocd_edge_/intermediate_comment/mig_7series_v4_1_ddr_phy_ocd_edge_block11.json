    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code deals with assigning future state values to the current state registers on every positive edge of the clock signal. Specifically, the value of 'z2f_ns' (next state value for the flip-flop) is assigned to 'z2f_r' (current state register of the flip-flop) after a delay defined by the 'TCQ' parameter."
