    "block_comment": "This block manages the state of a validation flag for a sample in a synchronous digital design. In its stable state, it continues to assert the previously registered sample validity ('prev_samp_valid_r'). In any cycle, if the 'reset_scan' is active, then it updates the 'prev_samp_valid_ns' state to invalid. If a new valid sample has arrived (signified by 'samp_valid'), it then resets the 'prev_samp_valid_ns' state to valid. The block implements this logic with a simple if-else construct, inside a combinational always block."
