This block of code is a mux data selector. The function of the block is to assign specific values to the `dbg_phy_wrcal` array depending on the value of `nCK_PER_CLK`. If `nCK_PER_CLK` equals 4, values of `mux_rd_rise2_r`, `mux_rd_fall2_r`, `mux_rd_rise3_r` and `mux_rd_fall3_r` are assigned to slices of the `dbg_phy_wrcal` array. If `nCK_PER_CLK` does not equal 4, zeros are assigned to the same slices of the `dbg_phy_wrcal` array.
