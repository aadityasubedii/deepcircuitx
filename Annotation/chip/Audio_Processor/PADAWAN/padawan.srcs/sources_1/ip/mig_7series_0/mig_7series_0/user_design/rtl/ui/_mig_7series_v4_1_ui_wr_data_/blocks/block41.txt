This block of code manages a read index within a Read Data register in a synchronous reset design scheme. By default, the next state of the read index is the current state. If a reset signal is detected, the read index is reset to zero, establishing an initial state. However, if a new read data signal occurs, it increments the read index by 1 (using 5-bit arithmetic), effectively moving to the next location in the Read Data register. This block thus implements a key aspect of navigating the Read Data register.
