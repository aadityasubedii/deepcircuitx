    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a wire named 'req_bank_rdy_ns', which becomes active when both 'order_q_zero' and 'col_wait_r' are logic high. The purpose of this wire is to signal readiness for a new request from the bank under the condition that the order queue is empty (indicated by 'order_q_zero') and the system is waiting for the next column to be ready (indicated by 'col_wait_r'). The wire thus bridges the queue checks and column readiness, serving as a combined indicator for these states."
