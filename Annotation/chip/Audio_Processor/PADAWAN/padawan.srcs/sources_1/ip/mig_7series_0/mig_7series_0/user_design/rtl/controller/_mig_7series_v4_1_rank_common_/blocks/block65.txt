Comment: 
The given block of code handles the update of the maintenance prescaler in nanoseconds. It either assigns the current value of 'maint_prescaler_r' to 'maint_prescaler_ns' or this variable takes a default constant or decrement value, depending upon the state of 'init_calib_complete', 'maint_prescaler_tick_ns' and 'maint_prescaler_r'. The maintenance prescaler is reset to the set constant from 'MAINT_PRESCALER_DIV' array when 'init_calib_complete' is not asserted or 'maint_prescaler_tick_ns' is high. If any bit in 'maint_prescaler_r' is high and the other conditions not present, the prescaler is decremented by ONE array value.
