    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for updating a debug point-of-change register. Upon every positive edge of the system clock (clk), the specified range of the debug point-of-change register (dbg_poc_r[899:100]) is updated with a delay of #TCQ clock cycles to store the next state value (dbg_poc_ns). The use of a positive edge-triggered event indicates synchronous behavior, making this relevant for edge-sensitive operations."
