This is a basic assignment operation in Verilog RTL that establishment of a clock signal for the MMCM block. It defines 'mmcm_clk' as being equal to 'sys_clk_ibufg', the output of the system input buffer `sys_clk_ibufg`. Specifically, it indicates that the clock feeding the MMCM block derives directly from the system clock after it has passed through an input buffer (IBUFG) stage.
