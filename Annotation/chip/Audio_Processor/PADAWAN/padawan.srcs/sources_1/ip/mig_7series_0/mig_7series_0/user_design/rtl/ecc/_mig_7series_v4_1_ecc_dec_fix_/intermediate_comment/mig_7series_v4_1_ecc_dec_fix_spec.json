    "spec": "Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ecc_dec_fix. \n\nModule specification: The 'mig_7series_v4_1_ecc_dec_fix' module is a hardware model designed to decode and correct Error Correction Code (ECC) for memory systems, mainly implemented with Micron's MIG (Memory Interface Generator) 7 series. The module's operations are synchronized by the input clock (clk) and can be reset by the reset signal (rst). The module receives raw data (phy_rddata) and the parity check matrix (h_rows) as inputs. The control signal correct_en decides whether the detected errors in incoming data will be corrected or not. Another control signal ecc_status_valid indicates the validity of ECC error status. \n\nThe module corrects detected errors and generates the corrected data (rd_data). Error status signals, ecc_single and ecc_multiple, signal the presence of single and multiple bit errors in the decoded data respectively. \n\nInternally, the module uses temporary wires and registers (syndrome_ns, syndrome_r, ecc_rddata_ns, ecc_rddata_r) to handle syndrome calculation and payload data extraction. The H-matrix (h_matrix) transforms the parity check matrix from a linear format to a 2D matrix, facilitating ECC operations. An internal flip_bits wire array stores the bitwise complement of error positions. Additional internal signals like zero and odd are used to check error conditions in the data.\n\nThe module is divided into several operation blocks, including syndrome generation (ecc_word, ecc_bit), payload extraction (extract_payload), H-matrix generation (h_col, h_bit), bit flipping (flip_word, flip_bit), read data generation and potential correction (conditional based on correct_en), raw_bit copying (copy_raw_bits), and ECC status computation (compute_status). These operation blocks collaboratively ensure efficient decoding and correction of ECC in the memory system.",

The module's operations are synchronized by the input clock (clk) and can be reset by the reset signal (rst). The module receives raw data (phy_rddata) and the parity check matrix (h_rows) as inputs. The control signal correct_en decides whether the detected errors in incoming data will be corrected or not. Another control signal ecc_status_valid indicates the validity of ECC error status. \n\nThe module corrects detected errors and generates the corrected data (rd_data). Error status signals, ecc_single and ecc_multiple, signal the presence of single and multiple bit errors in the decoded data respectively. \n\nInternally, the module uses temporary wires and registers (syndrome_ns, syndrome_r, ecc_rddata_ns, ecc_rddata_r) to handle syndrome calculation and payload data extraction. The H-matrix (h_matrix) transforms the parity check matrix from a linear format to a 2D matrix, facilitating ECC operations. An internal flip_bits wire array stores the bitwise complement of error positions. Additional internal signals like zero and odd are used to check error conditions in the data.\n\nThe module is divided into several operation blocks, including syndrome generation (ecc_word, ecc_bit), payload extraction (extract_payload), H-matrix generation (h_col, h_bit), bit flipping (flip_word, flip_bit), read data generation and potential correction (conditional based on correct_en), raw_bit copying (copy_raw_bits), and ECC status computation (compute_status). These operation blocks collaboratively ensure efficient decoding and correction of ECC in the memory system."
