This block of code is responsible for handling synchronism in the system. Upon the occurrence of a positive clock edge, the rule specified within the always block is executed, which delays the logic assignment to 'edge_aligned_r' by a timing check quantity (TCQ). The system then waits for TCQ amount of delay before assigning the value of 'edge_aligned_ns' to 'edge_aligned_r'. This block is essential to ensure proper synchronization and to prevent setup and hold time violations in digital circuits.
