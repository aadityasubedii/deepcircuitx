This block computes the logic state of 'prech_req' signal. The 'prech_req' signal gets assigned a value that is the logical OR of various request signals ('oclk_prech_req', 'rdlvl_prech_req', 'wrcal_prech_req', 'prbs_rdlvl_prech_req') and also the AND condition of 'dqs_found_prech_req' with the checking whether 'init_state_r' equals to 'INIT_RDLVL_STG2_READ_WAIT'. Thus, if any of the request signals or the special condition is true, 'prech_req' will be set to true or high, indicating a precharge request.
