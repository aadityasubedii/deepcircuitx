    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the Initialization and termination of write leveling operations synchronous to a positive edge of a clock. The code employs an always block that responds to a rising edge of the 'clk' signal. If the system is under reset (rst) or write leveling is not active (~wrlvl_active), write leveling initiation (wr_lvl_start) is held in a low state after a delay specified by the clock period TCQ. Contrarily, if the write leveling assertion count (dqs_asrt_cnt) reaches 3 (2'd3), the code sets the write leveling initiation high after the same delay."
