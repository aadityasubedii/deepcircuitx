Comment: 
This block assigns specific 2-bit binary values to elements of different signal arrays used to control rise and fall states in the system. It directly assigns binary values to indices 1 & 0 of each 'early2_rise' and 'early2_fall' arrays, effectively defining the behavior of 'rise' and 'fall' for system clock cycles. This ensures deterministic behavior in the sequential parts of the design.
