    "block_comment": "The block of code captures the value of a signal called 'override_demand_ns' to another signal 'override_demand_r' on the rising edge of the clock, effectively acting as a D-Type Flip-Flop (DFF). The purpose of using this block code is to create a synchronous system where the state change of the 'override_demand_r' signal follows the clock signal, making it less prone to glitches and ensuring the stability of the logic system during the transition."
