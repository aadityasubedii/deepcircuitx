Comment: 
This block of code in Verilog is responsible for registering single-bit ECC (Error Correction Code) errors. On every positive edge of the clock signal `clk`, the value of the `ecc_single` signal is recorded into the `app_ecc_single_err_r` register after a delay defined by the `TCQ` time constant. This essentially is a sequential logic pattern in Verilog for capturing signal values.
