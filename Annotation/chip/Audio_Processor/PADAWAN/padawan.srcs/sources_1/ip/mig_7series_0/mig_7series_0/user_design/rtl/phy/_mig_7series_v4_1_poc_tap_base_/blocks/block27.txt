This block of code is used for synchronization, specifically to provide a delay. The code specifies that whenever there is a positive edge in the clock (posedge clk), the value of 'samp_wait_ns' is assigned to the variable 'samp_wait_r' after a delay specified by the time constant 'TCQ'. This is an example of a non-blocking assignment used in sequential logic designs, often seen in flip-flops or latch designs in hardware. It's crucial for managing the timing of operations in synchronous hardware systems.
