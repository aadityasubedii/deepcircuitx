    "block_comment": "The block of code provides a mechanism for extracting and mapping data payloads from the received data. It uses a generate loop to iterate through twice the number of clock periods denoted by `nCK_PER_CLK`, mapping each payload width of received data `phy_rddata`, shifted correctly by the data quantity width `DQ_WIDTH`, onto the error-correcting code read data `ecc_rddata_ns`. This is done with bit slicing operations, hence ensuring correct assignment of payloads."
