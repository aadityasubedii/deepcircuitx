    "block_comment": "[Function of the block] This block of Verilog code is dynamically generating circuits for tracking the left edge of a waveform in a DRAM system. [Implementation details of the block] It leverages the generate construct and a for loop to create a series of circuits, one for each bit in the DRAM's data width. The repeated circuit is labelled 'gen_track_left_edge'. The dimension of DRAM_WIDTH determines the amount of circuits instantiated."
