This block of code handles updating the state of the cnt_cmd_done_r signal in sync with the positive edges of the clk signal (Function of the block). It assigns the result of a comparison between cnt_cmd_r and CNTNEXT_CMD to cnt_cmd_done_r, after a delay determined by the value of TCQ (Implementation details of the block).
