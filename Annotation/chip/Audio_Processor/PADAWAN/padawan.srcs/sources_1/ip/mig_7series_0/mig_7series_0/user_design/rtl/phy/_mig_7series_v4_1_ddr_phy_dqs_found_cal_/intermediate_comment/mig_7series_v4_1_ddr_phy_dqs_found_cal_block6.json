    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code functions as a switch-case statement, typically used for controlling the multiplexing of `final_do_cand[i]`. The state of the multiplexer is controlled by `final_do_index[i]`. When `final_do_index[i]` is equal to 0, `final_do_cand[i]` will be set to `final_data_offset[i][5:0]`. But, `final_do_cand[i]` will be set to 0 for any other value of `final_do_index[i]` (1, 2 or any other)."
