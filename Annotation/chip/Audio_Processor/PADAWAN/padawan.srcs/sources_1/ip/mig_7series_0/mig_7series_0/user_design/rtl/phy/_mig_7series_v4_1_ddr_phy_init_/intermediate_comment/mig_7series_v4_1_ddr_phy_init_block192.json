    "block_comment": "The block is a sequential logic that updates the 'enable_wrlvl_cnt' variable on every rising edge of the system clock (`clk`). Depending on various conditions, 'enable_wrlvl_cnt' is reset to 0 on a system reset (`rst`), set to 12 when write leveling is initialized or when previous write leveling is complete and the variable itself is at 0, or decremented when it's larger than zero and both 'phy_ctl_full' and 'phy_cmd_full' are not activated. The block employs event-driven logic, updating 'enable_wrlvl_cnt' based on different system states and the current value of the variable."
