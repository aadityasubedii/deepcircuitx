    "block_comment": "This block serves as a data pass-through mechanism in Verilog design of a digital system. Specifically, it assigns the input data (mc_wrdata_i) directly to the output (mc_wrdata) under certain conditions managed by the parent code. This code block is named gen_wrdata_passthru, suggesting its function of simply passing data through, without any modification or manipulation in-between. This assignment operation is synchronous, meaning this pass-through operation will be performed at every positive edge of the system clock cycle implied in the parent if-else case."
