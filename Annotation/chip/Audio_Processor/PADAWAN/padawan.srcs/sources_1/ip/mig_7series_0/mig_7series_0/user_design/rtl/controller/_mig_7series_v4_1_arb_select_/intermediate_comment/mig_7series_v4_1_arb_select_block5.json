    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the second bit of the output wire 'mc_odt' based on a logical OR operation of the fourth bit from 'mc_aux_out0' and the second bit from both 'mc_aux_out_r' and 'mc_aux_out_r_1'. This signifies that 'mc_odt' will be high (1) if any of the selected bits from the three input wires are high."
