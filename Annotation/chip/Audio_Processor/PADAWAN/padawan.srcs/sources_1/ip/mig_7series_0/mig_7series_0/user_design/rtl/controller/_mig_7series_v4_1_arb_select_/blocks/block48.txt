This block of code enables the updating of 'col_wr_data_buf_addr'. It functions as a conditional assignment that updates 'col_wr_data_buf_addr' with the value of 'col_data_buf_addr_ns' only when 'EARLY_WR_DATA_ADDR' is set to "OFF". This mechanism allows the system to control when 'col_wr_data_buf_addr' should be updated based on the state of 'EARLY_WR_DATA_ADDR'.
