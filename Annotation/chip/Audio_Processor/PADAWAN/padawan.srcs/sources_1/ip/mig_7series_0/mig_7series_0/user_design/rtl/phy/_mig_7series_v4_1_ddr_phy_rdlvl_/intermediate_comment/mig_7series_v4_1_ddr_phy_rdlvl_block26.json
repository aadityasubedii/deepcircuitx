    "block_comment": "This Verilog code is a latch synchronizer block. It performs synchronization of signal patterns on the rise and fall edges at four points in a clock cycle. For each point, it checks if there's a match between the current and old signal or between the current and previous signal. A match is recorded if the pattern data matches or an mpr_valid flag is raised. This info is held for as long as mpr_rdlvl_start is active and mpr_rdlvl_done is not. At the end of the block, cumulative results for each clock cycle position are calculated and stored. If the sr_valid or mpr_valid flags are raised, the inverse of the calculated match data is stored. If not, zero is stored instead."
