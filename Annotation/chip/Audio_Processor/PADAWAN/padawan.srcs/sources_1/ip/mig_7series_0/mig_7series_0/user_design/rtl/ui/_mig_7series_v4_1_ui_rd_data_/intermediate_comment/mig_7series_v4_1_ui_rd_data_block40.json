    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is an edge-triggered register that assigns read data's end signal (rd_data_end) to the application read data end signal (app_rd_data_end). Its function is synchronized signal assignment. The block is implemented using an 'always' statement that causes 'app_rd_data_end' to adopt the state of 'rd_data_end' whenever a change in 'rd_data_end' is detected, implying a positive edge-triggered behavior."
