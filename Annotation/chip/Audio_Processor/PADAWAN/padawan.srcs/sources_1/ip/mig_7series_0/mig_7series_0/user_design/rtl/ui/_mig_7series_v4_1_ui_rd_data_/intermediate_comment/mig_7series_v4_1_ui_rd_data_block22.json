    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the update of a buffer index in response to a clock signal. Upon each positive edge of the clock signal, the next state of the read buffer index 'rd_buf_indx_ns' is delayed by the time specified by 'TCQ' and then stored into 'rd_buf_indx_copy_r'. The 5 least significant bits of 'rd_buf_indx_ns' are considered, meaning it supports index tracking for up to 32 buffer positions."
