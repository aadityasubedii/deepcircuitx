    "block_comment": "This block is a counter control unit for specific initialization states. It uses a synchronous design driven by a rising edge clock. If the initialization state register (init_state_r) is either in an idle state (INIT_IDLE) or in read leveling stage one write state (INIT_RDLVL_STG1_WRITE), the counter (cnt_init_data_r) is reset to '00'. When there is write data available on the PHY (phy_wrdata_en is high), it increments the count on the rising edge of the clock. However, if the init_state_r is in the write calibration state (INIT_WRCAL_WRITE), the counter (cnt_init_data_r) is set to '10'. The delays (represented by '#TCQ') indicate that these operations are scheduled to occur a specific delay after the clock edge.\n"
