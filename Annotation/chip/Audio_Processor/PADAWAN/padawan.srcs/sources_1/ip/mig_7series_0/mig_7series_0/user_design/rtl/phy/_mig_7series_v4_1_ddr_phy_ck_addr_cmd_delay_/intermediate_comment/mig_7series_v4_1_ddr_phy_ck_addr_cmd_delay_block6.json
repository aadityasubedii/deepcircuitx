    "block_comment": "This block of code is implemented as a sequential logic module that responds to the changing edges of a clock signal and works with a reset signal. Upon a positive edge of the clock signal, if a reset condition is detected, the block will initialize the registers 'po_stg2_f_incdec', 'po_en_stg2_f', 'po_stg2_c_incdec', and 'po_en_stg2_c' to zero. In the absence of a reset signal, it checks for decrement and increment control signals ('po_cnt_dec', 'po_cnt_inc') respectively and accordingly sets or clears the inc/dec and enable control flags for both stages.\n"
