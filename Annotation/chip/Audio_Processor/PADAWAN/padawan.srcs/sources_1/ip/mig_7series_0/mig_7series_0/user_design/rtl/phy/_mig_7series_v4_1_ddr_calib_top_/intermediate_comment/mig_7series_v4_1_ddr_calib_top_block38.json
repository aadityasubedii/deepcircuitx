    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code creates a conditional compilation section that will be constructed based on the true/false value of `SKIP_CALIB`. Whenever the symbol `SKIP_CALIB` is defined as \"TRUE\", it bypasses certain calibration processes. The block activates at each positive edge of the clock signal, ensuring the state of the system is updated consistently along with the timing of `clk`."
