    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to perform matrix transposition on data flow, facilitating the rearrangement of data across memory. The 'for' loop completes the selection and assignment of data elements by using calculated points referenced from the 'ADDR_MAP'. The memory addressing scheme uses combinations of multiple factors to achieve efficient data handling. The end resultant is that each 'phy_dout' is determined by the corresponding 'mux_address'."
