    "block_comment": "The block controls data offsets for selected data streams. On a positive edge of the clock, data offsets are reset when the 'rst' signal is high. Afterward, if 'init_dqsfound_done_r' is enabled while 'init_dqsfound_done_r1' is disabled and there is data presence, offsets are updated with previously read values, based on 'rd_byte_data_offset'; if 'CWL_M' modulo 2 is true, a unit is subtracted for MC copies of data offsets. Alternatively, if 'init_dqsfound_done_r5' is enabled and data presence is not detected, data offsets are replaced with maximum recorded offsets."
