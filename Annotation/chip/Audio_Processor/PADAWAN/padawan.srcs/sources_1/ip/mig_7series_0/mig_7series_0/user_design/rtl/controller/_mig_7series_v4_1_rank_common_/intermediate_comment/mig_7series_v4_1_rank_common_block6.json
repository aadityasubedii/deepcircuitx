    "block_comment": "The given block of code is responsible for managing read requests in a memory system, using a periodic read ranking scheme. Upon the positive edge of the clock, the local copy of the periodic read rank is updated with a latency of TCQ cycles acknowledge signal `periodic_rd_ack_r`. If a periodic read grant is active (`periodic_rd_grant_r` is high) and all the periodic read acknowledgments for each rank are received, the `clear_periodic_rd_request` signal is asserted, indicating the completion of read requests. Moreover, the output signals `periodic_rd_r` and `periodic_rd_rank_r` are assigned the values of their local counterparts."
