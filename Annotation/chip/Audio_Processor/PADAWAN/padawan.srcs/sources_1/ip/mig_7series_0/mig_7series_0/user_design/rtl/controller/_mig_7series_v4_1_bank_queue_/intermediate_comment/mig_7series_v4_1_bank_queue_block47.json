    "block_comment": "This block of code calculates the sum of all the values present in the \"bm_end_in\" array from index 0 to \"ID\". The variable \"idlers_below\" is initially reset to the constant value \"BM_CNT_ZERO\". Following this initial reset, it undergoes an iterative accumulation through a for loop. The for loop indexes from 0 to \"ID\" and increments by 1 in each iteration. In each loop pass, the indexed value of the \"bm_end_in\" is added to \"idlers_below\"."
