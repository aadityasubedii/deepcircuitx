    "block_comment": "This block governs the assignment of the control signal `mc_ref_zq_wip_ns`. This operation is done using a logical AND operation between the `maint_ref_zq_wip` and `col_read_fifo_empty` signals. This assignment takes place when a ZQ (ZQ is a calibration for the Memory Controller command) maintaining reference operation is underway (`maint_ref_zq_wip` is high) and the read FIFO column (`col_read_fifo_empty`) is empty. The result of this operation, which is only true when both conditions are met, updates the state of `mc_ref_zq_wip_ns`."
