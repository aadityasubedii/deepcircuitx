    "block_comment": "The provided block is very limited and does not provide sufficient context for a detailed comment generation. The above code declares a wire named \"maint_wip_ns\"; however, based on just this, we cannot conclude what the function of the block is. We need to analyze the block where this wire is used to understand its role in the overall hardware design. It would be helpful if you could provide a longer code block for a more complete understanding and accordingly a detailed comment generation."
