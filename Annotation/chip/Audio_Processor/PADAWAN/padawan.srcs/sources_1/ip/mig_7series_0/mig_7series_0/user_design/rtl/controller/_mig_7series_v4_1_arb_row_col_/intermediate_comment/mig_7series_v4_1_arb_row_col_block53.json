    "block_comment": "This block of code represents an instantiation of a round-robin arbiter module (`mig_7series_v4_1_round_robin_arb`) for memory interface (MIG) configuration. The block manages the access requests from multiple banks machines specified by the nBANK_MACHS parameter. The functioning of the arbiter is based on round-robin strategy, with the currently served bank indicated by `current_master`, while the `req` input signals requests for control. It uses a clock signal (`clk`) for synchronization and the reset (`rst`) to return the block to its initial state. Additionally, the block checks if the grant should be disabled (`disable_grant`) and the cases when the current master needs to be updated (`upd_last_master`). The block grants access through the `grant_r` signal."
