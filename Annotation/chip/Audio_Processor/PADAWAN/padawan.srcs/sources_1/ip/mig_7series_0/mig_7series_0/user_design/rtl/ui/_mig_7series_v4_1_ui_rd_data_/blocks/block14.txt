This block of code functions as a delay flip-flop for read data in an application. It operates at the positive edge of the clk signal, meaning it updates the 'app_rd_data' variable whenever there's a rising edge in the clock signal. The 'app_rd_data_ns' defines the 'next state' of the 'app_rd_data', with the delay 'TCQ' applied before update; this delay parameter, TCQ, allows adjusting the data setup time to suit the specific needs of the design.
