Comment: 
The Verilog block is essentially a set of properties for a set of cover directives utilized to verify the functional correctness of a memory controller. Property `pass_open_bank` is checked every positive edge of the clock when reset is not active. It verifies that signal `pass_open_bank_ns` is asserted. `pass_open_bank_killed_by_maint` and `pass_open_bank_following_maint` checks on each positive edge of the clk. Both are only asserted when `accept_req` and `pass_open_bank_eligible` conditions are met. The former is confirmed when `maint_hit_this_bm` is active and `wait_for_maint_r_lcl` is not triggered. Conversely, the latter is valid when both `maint_hit_this_bm` and `wait_for_maint_r_lcl` are active. This suggests the behavior of bank opening is altered during maintenance procedures.
