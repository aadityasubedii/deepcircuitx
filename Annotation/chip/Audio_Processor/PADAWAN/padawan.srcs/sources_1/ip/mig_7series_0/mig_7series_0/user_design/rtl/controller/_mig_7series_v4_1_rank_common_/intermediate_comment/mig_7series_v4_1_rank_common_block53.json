    "block_comment": "The block of code represents a D flip-flop with a delay. Upon identifying the positive edge (rising) in the clock cycle (clk), it carries forward the value of 'zq_timer_ns' to 'zq_timer_r' but with a delay of #TCQ time units. The delay (#TCQ) could represent a specific time constraint in the clock cycle to match circuit timing requirements, providing control over the data transmission."
