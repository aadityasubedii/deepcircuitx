    "block_comment": "This block implements a register that captures the signal `cal2_done_r`. On every rising edge of the clock (`clk`), it checks if the reset (`rst`) is asserted. If reset is active, it will reset `cal2_done_r1` to zero with a delay defined by `#TCQ`, essentially asserting the `cal2_done_r1` signal. If the reset is not active, it will latch the current value of `cal2_done_r` into `cal2_done_r1` after the same `#TCQ` delay. The use of `#TCQ` delay mechanism is typical for flip-flops or latches scenarios, ensuring synchronicity and data integrity with respect to timing constraints in digital hardware design."
