    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code generates a one-hot control signal for chip selection. It rotates the one-hot chip selection based on the value of `ra0` multiplied by `nCS_PER_RANK`. The `cs_one_hot` signal is inverted and left-shifted, then combined with a logic OR function with an array of logical not `cs_en0` signals of length `CS_WIDTH*nCS_PER_RANK`. The created control signal hence has the property to enable the chip based on the rank interface (`ra0`), and the chip select enable signal (`cs_en0`) decides the active status of the multiple chips."
