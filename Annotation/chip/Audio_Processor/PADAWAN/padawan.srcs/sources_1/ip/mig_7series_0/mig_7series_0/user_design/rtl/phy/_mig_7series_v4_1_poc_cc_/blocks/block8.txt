Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for updating the 'aligned_cnt_r' register every time there is a rising edge in the clock signal. This operation is performed with a delay defined by the constant 'TCQ'. Specifically, content from 'aligned_cnt_ns' is loaded into 'aligned_cnt_r' on every clock cycle, but this update manifests after a delay defined by 'TCQ'.
