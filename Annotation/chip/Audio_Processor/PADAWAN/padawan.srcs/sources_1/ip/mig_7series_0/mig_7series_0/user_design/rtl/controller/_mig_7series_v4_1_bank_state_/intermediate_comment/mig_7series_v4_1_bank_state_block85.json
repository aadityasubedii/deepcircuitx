    "block_comment": "The block of code controls the signal 'end_rcd' based on the input 'start_rcd_lcl'. This is implemented through an always block in Verilog RTL which is a sensitive list construct that triggers whenever there are changes at the input signal 'start_rcd_lcl'. The signal 'end_rcd' is continuously kept up-to-date with this input signal."
