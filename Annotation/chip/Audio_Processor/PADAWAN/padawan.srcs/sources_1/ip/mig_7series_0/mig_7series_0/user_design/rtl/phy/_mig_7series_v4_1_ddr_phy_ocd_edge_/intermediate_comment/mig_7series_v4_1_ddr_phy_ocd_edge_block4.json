    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is responsible for generating a sequential logic circuit that reads the value of \"oneeighty2fuzz_ns\", latches it, and assigns it to the \"oneeighty2fuzz_r\" at the positive edge (rising edge) of the clock signal. The clock-triggered data assignment ensures synchronization. The assignment is also delayed as mentioned by the time delay variable \"TCQ\"."
