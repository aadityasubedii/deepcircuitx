Comment: 
The block of code assigns a "grant_ns" value based on certain conditions. This operation includes a logical AND operation on "req", the negation of "inhibit" and a "WIDTH" bit replication of the negation of "disable_grant". Specifically, a grant signal is generated if there's a 'request' (req), no 'inhibition' is taking place, and the 'disable_grant' signal is not active. The braces with 'WIDTH' denote bit-wise replication which ensures the granted signal matches the width of the bus.
