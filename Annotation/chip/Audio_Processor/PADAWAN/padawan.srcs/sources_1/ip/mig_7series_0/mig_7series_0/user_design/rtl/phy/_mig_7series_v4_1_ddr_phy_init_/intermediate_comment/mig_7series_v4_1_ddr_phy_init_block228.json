    "block_comment": "This block is designed to manage write start operations for a complex local memory in a synchronous manner. When a positive edge clock signal is detected, the block checks if a reset signal (rst) is active. If so, the 'complex_ocal_wr_start' is set to false after a delay defined by 'TCQ', effectively resetting the writing process. If the reset signal is not active, it checks the value of 'complex_ocal_reset_rd_addr'. If this is true, 'complex_ocal_wr_start' is set to true after a delay, initiating the write operation. Otherwise, its previous value is retained.\nThis block implements a synchronous reset mechanism and an asynchronous write initiation mechanism depending on the reader address of the local complex memory."
