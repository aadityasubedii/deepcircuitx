Module-level comment: This module implements a DDR3 SDRAM memory controller, managing command and data operations including read, write, refresh, and maintenance tasks. It utilizes sub-modules (rank_mach, bank_mach, col_mach) to handle different aspects of memory control. The module interfaces with external PHY layers, processes incoming commands, manages timing parameters, and generates appropriate control signals for memory operations. It also includes optional ECC functionality for data integrity.
