Comment: 
The block generates an output for write data and its associated mask. It specifically assigns values to two output variables, wr_data and wr_data_mask, from the specific bits of the wr_buf_out_data bus. The sizes of wr_data and wr_data_mask are defined by APP_DATA_WIDTH and APP_MASK_WIDTH respectively. The values for these two outputs are taken from the write buffer output data (wr_buf_out_data), an array of values which may be expected to contain information related to data that needs to be written and its associated mask.
