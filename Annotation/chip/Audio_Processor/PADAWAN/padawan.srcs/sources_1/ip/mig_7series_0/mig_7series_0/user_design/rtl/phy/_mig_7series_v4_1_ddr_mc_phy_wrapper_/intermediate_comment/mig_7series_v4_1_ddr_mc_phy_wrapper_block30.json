    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to 'out_we_n' based on the index into 'mem_dq_out' as calculated from the 'WE_MAP' bit vector. Specifically, the memory output 'mem_dq_out' is indexed using a combination of segmentations of 'WE_MAP'. The calculation involves shifts and multiplications to form the index, where specific parts of 'WE_MAP' are divided and multiplied by 48, 12 and 1 (for the least significant bits), respectively.\n"
