    "block_comment": "The block performs matching of input signal patterns (rising and falling edges) with defined idle patterns (idel_pat1) for a synchronous system, driven by a clock signal. This is achieved by comparing the input pattern at each clock cycle with the idle pattern and updating the matching status accordingly (setting it to 1 if it matches, and 0 if it doesn't). The signal patterns and idle patterns are compared section by section (rise0, fall0, rise1, fall1, rise2, fall2, rise3, fall3), and the matching status is recorded correspondingly. This allows the system to determine if the input signal pattern matches the idle patterns for each section, providing a basis for system control decisions."
