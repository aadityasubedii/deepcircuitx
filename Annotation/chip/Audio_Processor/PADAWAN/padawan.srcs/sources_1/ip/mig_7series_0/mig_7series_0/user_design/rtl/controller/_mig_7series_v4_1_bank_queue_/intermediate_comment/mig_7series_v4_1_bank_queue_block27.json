    "block_comment": "This block of code is a D-type flip flop, essentially a memory unit that sets its output pass_open_bank_r_lcl to the value of the input pass_open_bank_ns_lcl at the rising edge of the clock signal (clk). The #TCQ is a delay parameter, which indicates that the output change will occur a specific amount of time after the clock edge. This constitutes a one-cycle delay operation in the design and is an integral part of sequential logic circuits often used to introduce delay or to synchronize operations."
