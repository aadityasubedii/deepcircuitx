    "block_comment": "The block of code is used to process the 'last_byte_ns' signal on the rising edge of the system clock ('clk'). The implementation leverages a non-blocking sequential assignment, indicated by the \"<=\", to assign the value of 'last_byte_ns' to 'last_byte_r' after a delay equal to 'TCQ'. This allows the synchronization of 'last_byte_ns' with the system clock and ensures safe data updates without causing data hazards."
