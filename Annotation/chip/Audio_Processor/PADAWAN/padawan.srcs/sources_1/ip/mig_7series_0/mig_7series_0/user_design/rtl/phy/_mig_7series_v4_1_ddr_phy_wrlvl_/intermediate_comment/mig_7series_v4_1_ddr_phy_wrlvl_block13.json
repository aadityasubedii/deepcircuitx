    "block_comment": "This block of code is a generator that populates the rd_data_rise_wl_r register array for each bit within the DQS_WIDTH parameter using a for loop during read operations. It operates in a synchronous manner, triggering on a rising clock edge. Essentially, every time the clock signal rises, the register rd_data_rise_wl_r for the currently iterated bit (rd_i) is updated. The increase in `rd_i` is handled by incrementing it by 1 in every cycle until all bits in the DQS_WIDTH parameter are covered."
