This block implements data transferring functionality in a synchronous manner. When a positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`) is observed, the lower 6 bits of `po_counter_read_val` are captured and saved into the `po_counter_read_val_r` register after a delay of time which is defined by `#TCQ`. This process ensures that `po_counter_read_val_r` always holds the latest state of `po_counter_read_val` with precision up to 6 bits based on the clock pulse.
