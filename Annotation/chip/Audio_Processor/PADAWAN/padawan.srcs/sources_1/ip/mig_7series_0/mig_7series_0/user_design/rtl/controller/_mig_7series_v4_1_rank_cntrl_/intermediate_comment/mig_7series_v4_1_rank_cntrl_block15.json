    "block_comment": "The given Verilog block is computing a boolean signal `my_refresh`. The `my_refresh` indicates when a maintenance procedure `insert_maint_r1` is active, but other maintenance codes (`maint_zq_r`, `maint_sre_r`, `maint_srx_r`) are not and it is associated with a specific memory rank (`maint_rank_r`) that matches an identifier ID. It's computed using logical AND (`&&`) and logical NOT (`~`) operations. The signal `my_refresh` goes high when `insert_maint_r1` is high and the rest of the maintenance signal are low, and `maint_rank_r` equals to the given ID."
