    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to update the value of the register 'rd_data_previous_r' under specific conditions at each positive clock cycle. The conditions are defined based on a series of state checks where the variable 'wl_state_r' and 'wl_state_r1' are compared with various predefined states. Additionally, a conditional check on 'wl_edge_detect_valid_r' is made when 'wl_state_r' equals 'WL_EDGE_CHECK'. When any of the mentioned conditions are met, 'rd_data_previous_r' is assigned the value of 'rd_data_rise_wl_r' with a delay defined by 'TCQ'."
