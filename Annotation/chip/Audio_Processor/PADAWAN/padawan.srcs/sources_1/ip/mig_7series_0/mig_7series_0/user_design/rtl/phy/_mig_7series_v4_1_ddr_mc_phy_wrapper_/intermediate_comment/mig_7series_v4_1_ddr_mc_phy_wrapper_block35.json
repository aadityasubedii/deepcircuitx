    "block_comment": "This block primarily manages the fine-tuning of delay in a system in sync with the rising edge of the clock. It does so through the use of multiple assignments of the fine_delay_mod array, computed using a combination of byte_sel_data_map and fine_delay_incdec_pb arrays, effectively mapping byte selections to fine delay adjustments. A delay represented by #TCQ is implemented to maintain synchronization and timing constraints. Additionally, a register fine_delay_sel_r is also updated with fine_delay_sel at every clock cycle."
