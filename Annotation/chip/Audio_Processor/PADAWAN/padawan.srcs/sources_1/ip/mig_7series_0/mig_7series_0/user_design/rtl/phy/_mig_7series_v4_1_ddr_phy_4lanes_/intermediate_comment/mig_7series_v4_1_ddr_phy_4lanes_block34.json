    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the `pi_phase_locked_lanes` variable a value based on the status of different data lanes A, B, C, and D. The value for each lane in the 4-bit `pi_phase_locked_lanes` is set as logic high if the respective `PRESENT_DATA_[Lane]` bit is not present (logic low) or if the respective `pi_phase_locked` bit is high, indicating the data on the lane is phase-locked. The status of the data lanes is encoded in a 4-bit binary value, where each bit represents a respective lane's status. The logical OR operation is used in each assignment to make sure that the `pi_phase_locked_lanes` reflects the phase locked state or lack of data for each lane."
