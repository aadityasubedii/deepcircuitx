    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is essentially a flip-flop that manages the reset signal (`rst_auxout`) for an auxiliary output (`auxout`). The flip-flop is triggered on the falling edge of the `auxout_clk` clock signal or on the rising edge of the reset (`rst`) signal. If the reset signal is high, the reset output for the auxiliary output is set to 1 immediately (due to the delay model `#(1)` specifying zero delay). Otherwise, it follows the value of `rst_auxout_rr` after a delay equivalent to 1 time unit as specified in the same delay model (`#(1)`)."
