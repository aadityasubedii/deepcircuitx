    "block_comment": "This block initializes a generate loop variable 'i'. This variable declaration is typically present at the beginning of a 'generate for loop' in Verilog code. The value of 'i' will change depending upon the execution of the generate loop and so can be used to instantiates multiple hardware blocks in a parameterized manner. The 'genvar' keyword in Verilog denotes that 'i' is a special kind of variable that retains its value only within the generate loop."
