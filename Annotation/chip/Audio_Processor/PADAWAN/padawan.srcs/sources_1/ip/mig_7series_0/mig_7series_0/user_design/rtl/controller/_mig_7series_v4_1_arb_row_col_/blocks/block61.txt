This block implements a condition-based register and wire assignment in Verilog for handling address command modes and precharge commands. If the number of clock cycles per clock (nCK_PER_CLK) is equal to 4 and the address command mode (ADDR_CMD_MODE) is not equal to "2T", then the block initiates and creates a register named 'granted_pre_r' and a wire vector 'grant_pre_r_lcl' with a size equal to the number of bank machines minus one. Furthermore, a wire 'granted_pre_ns' is implemented as a reduction OR operation on the rts_pre signal. The assignment of 'grant_pre_r' to 'grant_pre_r_lcl' is implemented using a Verilog 'assign' statement.
