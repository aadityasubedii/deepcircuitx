Comment: 
This block of code manages the occupancy count of a read buffer in a Verilog design. It updates a variable (occ_cnt_ns) that keeps track of the occupancy count of the buffer. The block is sensitive to the signals free_rd_buf, occ_cnt_r, rd_accepted, rst, occ_minus_one, and occ_plus_one. During reset (rst), the count variable occ_cnt_ns is reset to 0, indicating an empty buffer. A 2-bit case decision is implemented for the pair (rd_accepted, free_rd_buf) to either increment or decrement this count, hence reflecting whether a read operation has occurred or a buffer spot has been freed respectively.
