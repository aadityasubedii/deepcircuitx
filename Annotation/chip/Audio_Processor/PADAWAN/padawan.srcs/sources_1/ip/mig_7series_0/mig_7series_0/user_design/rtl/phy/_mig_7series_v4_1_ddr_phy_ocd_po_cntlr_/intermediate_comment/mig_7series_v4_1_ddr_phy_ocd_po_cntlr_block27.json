    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the assignment of the value of the variable 'ninety_offsets_r' to another variable 'ninety_offsets'. It's essentially transferring the stored value of 'ninety_offsets_r' to 'ninety_offsets', providing a mechanism for accessing or manipulating data stored in 'ninety_offsets_r' through 'ninety_offsets'. This Verilog 'assign' statement is typically used for continuous assignments where the right-hand expressions are evaluated whenever there's a change in their value and the result assigned to the left-hand side."
