    "block_comment": "This block of code designates a reconfigurable holding space or register named 'rd_buf_indx_copy_r'. This register is defined as a 5-bit vector, allowing it to hold a range of values from 0 to 31. The attribute (* keep = \"true\" *) tells the optimizer to preserve this register throughout the synthesis process, making the 'rd_buf_indx_copy_r' a persistent register that is resistant to being optmized away during synthesis."
