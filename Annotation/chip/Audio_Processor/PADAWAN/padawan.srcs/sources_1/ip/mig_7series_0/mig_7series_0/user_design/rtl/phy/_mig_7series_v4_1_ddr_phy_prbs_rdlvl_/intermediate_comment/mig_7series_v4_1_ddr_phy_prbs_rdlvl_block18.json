    "block_comment": "The block of code is a function that generates a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) for each data lane in a DRAM bus. It uses a for loop to loop over each bit in the DRAM width, creating each bit's PRBS separately. This block is clocked on the rising edge, and it will reset or initialize when the system reset signal is high, or when the PRBS state machine is in the `PRBS_NEW_DQS_WAIT` state."
