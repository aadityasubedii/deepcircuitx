    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements read leveling calibration for DDR memory interfaces. It adjusts read data capture timing by detecting data patterns, finding valid eye regions, and centering the capture point. The module uses a state machine to control the calibration process, incrementing delays and analyzing read data patterns. It supports multiple ranks and both DDR3/DDR4 memory types, utilizing IDELAY and PHASER_IN delays for fine-grained timing adjustments. The calibration algorithm includes edge detection, pattern matching, and per-byte/per-bit delay optimization to ensure proper alignment with the memory clock."
