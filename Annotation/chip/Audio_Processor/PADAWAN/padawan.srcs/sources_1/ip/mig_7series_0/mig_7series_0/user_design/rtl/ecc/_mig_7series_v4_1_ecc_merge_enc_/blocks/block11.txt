This block is used for sequential data transfer. Upon every positive edge of the clock signal 'clk', it ensures that the data from 'rd_merge_data' is assigned to 'rd_merge_data_r' after a delay specified by 'TCQ'. This helps in creating a delay buffer, which allows synchronization of the data read from the 'rd_merge_data' to be processed in subsequent clock cycles.
