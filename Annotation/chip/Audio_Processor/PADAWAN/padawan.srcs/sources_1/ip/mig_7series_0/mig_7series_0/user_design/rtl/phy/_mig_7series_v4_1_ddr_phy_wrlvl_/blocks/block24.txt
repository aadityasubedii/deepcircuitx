Comment: 
The block of provided Verilog code aims at generating delay elements controlled by the DQS signal for a dual-rank memory system. If the system is configured for two memory ranks, a loop is executed where, for each DQS lane (as determined by DQS_WIDTH), an always block is initiated to perform operation synchronized to the rising edge of the clock. Upon reset (signalled by an active high 'rst'), certain actions (unfortunately, not included in the provided snippet) will be executed. This reset-based activity indicates that the logic within the 'always' block is likely responsible for initializing or resetting the state of the delay elements associated with each DQS lane.
