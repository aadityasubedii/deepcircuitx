Comment: 
This line of code assigns the "complex_wrlvl_final" system level wire with the value from the register "complex_wrlvl_final_r". This is implemented using the ASSIGN keyword which means this operation will be executed continuously. This means that it will keep its value as identical to that of complex_wrlvl_final_r at all times. The value of complex_wrlvl_final changes as soon as the value of complex_wrlvl_final_r changes.
