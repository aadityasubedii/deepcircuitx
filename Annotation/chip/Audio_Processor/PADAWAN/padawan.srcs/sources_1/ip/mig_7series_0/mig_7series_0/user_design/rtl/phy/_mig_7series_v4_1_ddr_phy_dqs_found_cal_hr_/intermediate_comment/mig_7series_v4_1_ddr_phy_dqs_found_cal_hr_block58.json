    "block_comment": "The given block of code performs an assignment operation in Verilog RTL code. The wire \"rd_data_offset_cal_done\" is assigned the value of the wire \"init_dqsfound_done_r\". This is a simple assignment action, and the operation will be performed continuously. The Bool value \"init_dqsfound_done_r\" represents the completion status of an initial DQS (Data-Quick-Sync) found process, and it is used here to denote the completion status of a read data offset calibration."
