    "block_comment": "This block of code is for a conditional operation where it accomplishes a task only when a specific condition is met, which is if the value of Macro `HIGHEST_BANK` is equal to 2. The implementation is done using an `else if` condition which comes into execution only when previous conditions don't validate, thus checking the specified condition. In the body of this condition, actual tasks to be performed are to be written which remain unknown as the body is currently empty. This construct of the statement in Verilog helps in sequential decision-making based on multiple conditions."
