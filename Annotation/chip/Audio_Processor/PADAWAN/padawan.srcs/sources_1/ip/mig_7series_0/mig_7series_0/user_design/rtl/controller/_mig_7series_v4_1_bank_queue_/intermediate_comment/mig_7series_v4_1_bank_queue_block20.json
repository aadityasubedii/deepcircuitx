    "block_comment": "The block of code serves to assign the 'bm_end' output wire, which is a key signal in this module, indicating an access end condition. This condition is designed by a local variable 'bm_end_lcl' using a logical OR operation between 'pre_bm_end_r' (indicating a preliminary end condition) and a combination of 'sending_col_not_rmw_rd' and 'pass_open_bank_r_lcl' flags. The former seems related to whether or not a read operation was initiated, and the latter corresponds to an open bank condition."
