    "block_comment": "This block assigns write buffer output data to the write data and write data mask. The write buffer output data (wr_buf_out_data) is partitioned across the width (WR_BUF_WIDTH), where the given RTL code extracts the bits ranging from zero to WR_BUF_WIDTH-1 and assigns them accordingly to the write data (wr_data) and the write data mask (wr_data_mask). This operation occurs in parallel for all bits in a single clock cycle."
