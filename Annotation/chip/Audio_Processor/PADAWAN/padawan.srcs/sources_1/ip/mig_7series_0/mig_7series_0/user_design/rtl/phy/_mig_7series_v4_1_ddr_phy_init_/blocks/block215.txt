Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for updating several delay variables on each rising edge of the clk signal. The variables `rdlvl_last_byte_done_r`, `prbs_last_byte_done_r`, `rdlvl_start_dly0_r`, `wrcal_start_dly_r`, `oclkdelay_start_dly_r` and `prech_done_dly_r` are all assigned new values, with any changes delayed by the propagation delay `#TCQ`. The delay variables for the 'start' sequences are held in 15-bit registers to maintain the current state before the next clock pulse (`[14:0]`). The 'last_byte_done' and 'start_dly' variables are likely integral to a larger state machine, and this block forms part of the update process for the related delay variables.
