Module-level comment: This module implements a DDR memory controller PHY interface for 7 series FPGAs, handling physical layer communication between the memory controller and DDR devices. It supports multiple byte lanes and banks, implements timing calibration for read/write operations, and manages various clock domains. The module uses configurable ddr_phy_4lanes instances for each bank, PHASER_IN_PHY for clock management, and includes features like input/output FIFOs, delay adjustments, and status reporting. It is highly parameterizable to adapt to different memory configurations and FPGA designs.
