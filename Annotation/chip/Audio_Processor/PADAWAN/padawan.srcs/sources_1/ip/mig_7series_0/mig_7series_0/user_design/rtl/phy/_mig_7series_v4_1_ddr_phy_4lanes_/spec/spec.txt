Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_4lanes. Module specification: This module implements a DDR (Double Data Rate) PHY (Physical Layer) interface for a memory controller, designed for 7 series FPGAs, supporting up to 4 byte lanes. It manages timing, calibration, and signal integrity for DDR memory operations, incorporating PHASER_IN, PHASER_OUT, and IDELAYCTRL components. The module handles clock generation, data alignment, and various calibration processes for read and write operations across multiple byte lanes. Key inputs include reset signals, clocks, calibration controls, and configuration parameters, while outputs provide status information, control signals, and data for the DDR memory interface. Internal signals manage read clocks, data remapping, and control signals for individual byte lanes. The module is organized into sections for each byte lane (A, B,
