    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mig_7series_v4_1_poc_pd' module is designed to manage phase detection and output sampling in digital signal processing interfaces. It employs the IDDR block for handling double data rate inputs. Key inputs include clock and reset signals, while key output is the phase-detection output. The module also supports delay-controlled sampling via the TCQ parameter. Internal signals include 'q1' for data reflection, 'pos_edge_samp' for positive edge sampling, and 'pd_out_r' for output preparation. Different flow control paths are implemented for handling regular and metastable/sim conditions."
