    "block_comment": "This block of code defines essential parameters related with read buffer width, number of full RAMs required, the remaining bits not fitting into a full RAM, the total RAM count and the total width of all RAMs. First, it computes the read buffer width by adding APP_DATA_WIDTH to a value contingent on whether ECC is off or not. If ECC is off, 0 is added; otherwise, it adds a value calculated from 2x2xnCK_PER_CLK. Then computations for full RAM count and remaining bits are performed based on division and remainder of RD_BUF_WIDTH by 6. Finally, total RAM count is obtained by the sum of full RAM and any additional RAM for remainder. RAM width is subsequently calculated as six times the total RAM count."
