This block is a sequential logic component that outputs a reset signal for stage 1 of the PI calibration circuit. Three conditions are evaluated: a system level reset, a DQS specific reset, or a default condition. During a posedge clk if a system-level reset occurs, the output is set to zero with a delay defined by #TCQ. Alternatively, a DQS-specific reset sets the output to one with the same delay. In any other case, the output is simply set to hold its current value.
