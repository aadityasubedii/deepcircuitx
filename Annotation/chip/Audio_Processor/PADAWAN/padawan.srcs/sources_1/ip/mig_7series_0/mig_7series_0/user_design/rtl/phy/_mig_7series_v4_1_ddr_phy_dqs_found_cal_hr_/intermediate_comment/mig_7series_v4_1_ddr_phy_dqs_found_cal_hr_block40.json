    "block_comment": "This code block is a part of a Sequential Circuit logic implemented in Verilog that responds to positive edge of clock signal. This circuit is likely a part of a memory controller, maybe for a DRAM, where calibration stages are being reset based on certain conditions. The logic sets the reset signal (`pi_rst_stg1_cal_r[2]`) to low when there's a global reset signal, a specific calibration stage reset, or a fine adjustment trigger. If these conditions are not present, it checks for the beginning of data strobe (`pi_dqs_found_start`) or when data strobe have been found in any bank but not in all (`pi_dqs_found_any_bank_r[2]`) or when read offset (`rd_byte_data_offset[rnk_cnt_r][12+:6]`) is higher than a certain latency parameter. If any of these conditions are met, it sets the reset signal to high. The '#TCQ' after the assignments refers to Time Quantum, used here to delay input to output propagation.\n"
