    "block_comment": "This block is a counter decrement control for a reading value count based on clock pulses and a reset conditions. On a positive edge of the input clock signal, the block checks if a reset is true or if the reading value count is equal to 0. If either is true, the reading value decrementing is disabled. However, if neither is true, and a DQS power down decoding process is finished, the reading value count is greater than 0, and the wait counter is equal to 1, then this block enables the decrement of the reading value. If none of these conditions meet, the decrementing remains disabled."
