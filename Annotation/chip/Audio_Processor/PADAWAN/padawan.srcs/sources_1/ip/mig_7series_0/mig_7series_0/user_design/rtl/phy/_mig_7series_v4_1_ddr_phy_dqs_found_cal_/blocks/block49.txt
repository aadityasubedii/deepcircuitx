This block of code is used to introduce delay into the reset signal 'rst_dqs_find'. The operation of this block is clocked, meaning it only updates on the positive edge of the clock signal. On every positive edge of the clock, the current state of 'rst_dqs_find' is transferred to 'rst_dqs_find_r1' after a delay defined by 'TCQ'. Subsequently, 'rst_dqs_find_r1' is then transferred to 'rst_dqs_find_r2' again after a 'TCQ' delay. Therefore, it effectively introduces two delay stages (2*TCQ) into the signal propagation of 'rst_dqs_find'.
