    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for assigning specific hexadecimal values to four elements of multiple bit-vector arrays (pat0_rise0 to pat0_rise3 and pat0_fall0 to pat0_fall3). These hexadecimal values, that are 4 bits long, indicate specific value patterns that will be taken by these arrays. This assignment is achieved using the assign statement which determines the values of the specified elements at compile time."
