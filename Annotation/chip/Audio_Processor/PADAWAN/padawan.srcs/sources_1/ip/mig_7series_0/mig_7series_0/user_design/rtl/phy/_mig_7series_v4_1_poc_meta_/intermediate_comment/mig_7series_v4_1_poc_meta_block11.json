    "block_comment": "This block of code is a sequential always block that describes a register. The function of this block is to capture the value of the previous state (prev_ns) with each positive edge (rising edge) of the clock (clk). This register implements a non-blocking assignment, ensuring the proper simulation of concurrent behavior in sequential circuits. Moreover, '#TCQ' indicates a delay model associated with the assignment, implying that the update of prev_r will occur after a time delay determined by the parameter 'TCQ'."
