    "block_comment": "This block of code is a reporting mechanism for a completed calibration process. Whenever there's a positive edge-triggered event on the 'oclkdelay_center_calib_done' signal, the module checks if 'rst' is not active (i.e., low). If 'rst' is low, which normally implies normal working conditions, it displays a message indicating that the 'OCLKDELAY CENTER CALIB' calibration has finished at a given time captured via the '$time' system task."
