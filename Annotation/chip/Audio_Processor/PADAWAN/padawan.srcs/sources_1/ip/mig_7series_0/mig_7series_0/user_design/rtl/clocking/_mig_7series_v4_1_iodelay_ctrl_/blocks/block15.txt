This block of code handles system reset signal configuration. It employs the use of a conditional structure within Verilog's generate construct to conditionally instantiate an IBUF buffer. Specifically, if the SYS_RST_PORT is enabled, the signal sys_rst passes through an IBUF buffer (u_sys_rst_ibuf) and is output as sys_rst_i. Otherwise, if the SYS_RST_PORT is not enabled, sys_rst_i is directly assigned the sys_rst signal. The purpose of using IBUF is to enhance performance by buffering and isolating the input signal.
