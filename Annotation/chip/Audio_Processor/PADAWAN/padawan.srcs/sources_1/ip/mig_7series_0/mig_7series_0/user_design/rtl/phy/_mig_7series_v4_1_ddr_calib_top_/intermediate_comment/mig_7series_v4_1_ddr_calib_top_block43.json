    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for updating the signal `phy_if_reset` on the rising edge of the system clock signal `clk`. The update of `phy_if_reset` is controlled by a transmission delay (#TCQ) and the logical OR of five signals: `phy_if_reset_w`, `mpr_end_if_reset`, `reset_if`, `wrlvl_final_if_rst`, and `calib_tap_end_if_reset`. This means that if any of these five signals are true, `phy_if_reset` will be set to true (high) after the delay period."
