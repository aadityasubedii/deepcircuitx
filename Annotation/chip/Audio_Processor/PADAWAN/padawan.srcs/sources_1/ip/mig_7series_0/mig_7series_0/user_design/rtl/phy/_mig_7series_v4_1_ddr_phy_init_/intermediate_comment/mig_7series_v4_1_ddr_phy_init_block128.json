    "block_comment": "The block primarily manages the completion flag `ddr3_lm_done_r` for DDR3 load mode register operations. On reset, the boolean variable `ddr3_lm_done_r` is set to 0. Otherwise, a check is made for three conditions: if the initialization state machine is in the `INIT_LOAD_MR_WAIT` state, if the `chip_cnt_r` is at its maximum value (i.e., it equals `RANKS-1`), and if the write calibration is done (`wrcal_done`). If all conditions are met, `ddr3_lm_done_r` is then set to 1 signifying that the DDR3 Load Mode register tasks have been completed. The evaluations are clocked events, getting updated at every rising edge of the clock."
