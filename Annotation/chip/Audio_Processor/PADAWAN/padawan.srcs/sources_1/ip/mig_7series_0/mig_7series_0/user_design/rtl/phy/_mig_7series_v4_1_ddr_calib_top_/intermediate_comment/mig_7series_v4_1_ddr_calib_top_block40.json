    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for register updates pertaining to temperature monitor parameters, which are driven by the positive edge of the system clock. When reset is asserted, all registered outputs related to the temperature monitor, i.e., 'tempmon_pi_f_inc_r', 'tempmon_pi_f_en_r', and 'tempmon_sel_pi_incdec_r' get zeros written to them, effectively resetting the monitor. Else, during the operation, these registered outputs get updated with the results of associated logical operations each clock cycle."
