    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for reset control within a synchronous digital circuit. The reset takes effect when the clock (`clk`) rises and either `rst`, `pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1[0]`, or `fine_adjust` is high. It implements asynchronous reset synchronization by driving `pi_rst_stg1_cal_r[0]` to 0 when these conditions are met. Conversely, when certain conditions about data qualification (`pi_dqs_found_start`, etc.) are true, `pi_rst_stg1_cal_r[0]` is set to 1, signaling the end of the reset operation. The block prioritizes the reset conditions to ensure proper functioning of the larger memory system."
