    "block_comment": "The block of code implements a sequential logic shift operation from a non-blocking assignment that shifts the current state of `col_row_ns` to `col_row_r` upon every positive edge of the clock. The delay is defined by time constant `#TCQ`. The sequential operation ensures that the new state ('next state') of `col_row_ns` is properly transitioned to the current state of `col_row_r` synchronous to the clock cycle."
