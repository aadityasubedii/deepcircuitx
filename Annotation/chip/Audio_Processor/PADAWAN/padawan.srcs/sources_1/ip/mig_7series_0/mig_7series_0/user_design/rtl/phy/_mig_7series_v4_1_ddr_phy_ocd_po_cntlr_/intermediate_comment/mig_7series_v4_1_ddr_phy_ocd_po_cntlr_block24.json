    "block_comment": "The given block of code is handling the synchronization of an update to a register named ocd_ktap_left_r. The update occurs at each rising edge of the clock signal. The register value is set to the next state (ocd_ktap_left_ns) after a specific delay, represented by #TCQ, which is presumably given as a parameter."
