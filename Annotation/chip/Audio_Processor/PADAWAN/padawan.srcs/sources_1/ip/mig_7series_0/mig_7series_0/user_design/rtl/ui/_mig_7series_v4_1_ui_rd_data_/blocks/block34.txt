Comment: 
The provided block of code is not directly useful for generating a comment, as this particular code snippet is not complete. The 'else begin : not_strict_mode' statement in Verilog is essentially defining a labelled block of code that is executed when preceding if condition(s) are not met. 

However, the actual function and implementation details of the block could not be inferred from this snippet alone as it doesn't contain any RTL code or specific logic that executes under this 'not_strict_mode' condition. 

In order to generate an accurate comment about its purpose and implementation, the full context of the code, including the logic contained within this 'not_strict_mode' block (i.e. the code between 'begin' and corresponding 'end' keyword) and the condition that leads to this else statement need to be known. 

After having the complete necessary block of code, you could summarize it in the following way as per the instruction given: 
"[Function of the block]. [Implementation details of the block]." For example, "This block of code implements the functionality of a flip-flop in non-strict mode. It works by only updating the output at the positive edge of the clock when the enable signal is high."
