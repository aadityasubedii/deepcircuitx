    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a synchronous counter named `dqs_asrt_cnt`. The counter is clocked by `clk` and can be reset by a high `rst` signal or if both `wrlvl_done_r` and its negation `~wrlvl_done_r1` are high. Under normal conditions, whenever `wr_level_dqs_asrt` becomes high and the counter is not at its maximum value (i.e., `2'd3`), the counter `dqs_asrt_cnt` increments by 1 at every positive edge of the clock. This way, the circuit counts up and can be reset based on various conditions, thereby playing a role in flow control."
