Comment: 
This block of code is assigning the value of `grant_config_r_lcl` to `grant_config_r`. The keyword `assign` is used in Verilog to create combinational logic connections. In this case, `grant_config_r` would always mirror the value of `grant_config_r_lcl`. Since this is a single line of code, not many implementation details can be discussed, but it's crucial for data flow linkages in the design.
