    "block_comment": "The block generates two times the number of clock cycles per individual clock, iterating incrementally. Specifically, it is a generate construct that produces a series of always blocks, looped for a range of 2*nCK_PER_CLK. It repetitively instantiates hardware units named \"ecc_word\" during synthesis time to handle burst errors."
