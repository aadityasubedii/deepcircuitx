    "block_comment": "The given Verilog block is designed to manage control flow for the physical write data enable signal (phy_wrdata_en). It uses several conditional checks in synthesis (always @(*) construction) to accomplish this. The 'phy_wrdata_en' is activated whenever there's a new read-level write burst request which is not blocked by a full physical control or full physical data buffer or when the latched signal 'phy_wrdata_en_r1' is true. If these conditions are not met, the 'phy_wrdata_en' is deactivated."
