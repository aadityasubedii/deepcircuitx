    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code generates parity output when a control register (`REG_CTRL`) is set to \"ON\". The `out_parity` assignment is calculated using bit-level mapping (`PARITY_MAP`) of `mem_dq_out` register. A condition checks if the lower nibble of `PARITY_MAP` is less than 10 (4'hA). If it is, `phy_dout` gets assigned a value that involves a calculation with the current `PARITY_MAP`, which also includes a division by `PHASE_DIV`, resulting in a 4-bit concatenation from `parity_in`. If the condition is not met, a different calculation is used for the `phy_dout` assignment that involves a lowered value from `PARITY_MAP` and an offset of +4."
