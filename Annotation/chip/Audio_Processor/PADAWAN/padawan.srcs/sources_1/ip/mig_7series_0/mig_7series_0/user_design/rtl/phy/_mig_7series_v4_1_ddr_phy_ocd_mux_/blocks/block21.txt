Comment: 
The function `clogb2` calculates the ceiling logarithm base 2 of an input integer. The initial size of the input is reduced by 1. It then enters into a loop where the size is gradually halved each time by a right shift operation, and the resulting value of the operation is updated until the size is reduced to 1 or less. The function finally returns the number of shifts made as the computed ceiling logarithm base 2.
