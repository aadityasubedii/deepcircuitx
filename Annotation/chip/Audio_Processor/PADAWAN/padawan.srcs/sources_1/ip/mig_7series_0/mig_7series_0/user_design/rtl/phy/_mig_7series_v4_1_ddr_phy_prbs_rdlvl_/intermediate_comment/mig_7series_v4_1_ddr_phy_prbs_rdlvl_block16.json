    "block_comment": "The block of code describes a synchronous reset mechanism for a certain stage counter. It operates in response to the rising edge of a clock (clk). When the reset (rst) signal is high, the 'fine_inc_stage' variable is set to binary 1, effectively initiating a reset. If not in a reset state, the 'fine_inc_stage' gets the negation of whether 'stage_cnt' equals decimal 3, thus advancing the stage count except when it reaches the value of 3."
