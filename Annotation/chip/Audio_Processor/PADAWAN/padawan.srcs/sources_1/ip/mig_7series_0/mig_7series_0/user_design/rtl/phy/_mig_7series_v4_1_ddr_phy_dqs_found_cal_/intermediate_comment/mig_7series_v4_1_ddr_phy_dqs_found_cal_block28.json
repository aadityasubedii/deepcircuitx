    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the Read Byte Data Offset of a memory system based on different conditions in synchronous context. On a rising clock edge, if the reset signal is high, it initializes the 'rd_byte_data_offset' for all the ranks of memory with a calculated latency (nCL + nAL + LATENCY_FACTOR). If reset is not high, the conditions set vary in complexity with the simplest being if timing condition or if the byte data offset is less than a calculated value (nCL + nAL - 1), again sets the offset to the latency calculation. But, a more complex condition also sets the byte data offset decrementing its previous value, if certain conditions regarding DQS signal detection, data read count, and DQS fine adjustment met."
