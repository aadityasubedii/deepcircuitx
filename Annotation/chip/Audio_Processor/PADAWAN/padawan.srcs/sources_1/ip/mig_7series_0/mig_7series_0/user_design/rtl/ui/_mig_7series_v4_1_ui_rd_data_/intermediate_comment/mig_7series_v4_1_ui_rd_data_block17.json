    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to latch the 'app_rd_data_end_ns' signal value to 'app_rd_data_end' on the positive edge of the clock signal. The implementation leverages event-driven sequential logic and a time delay, represented by 'TCQ', to specify the timing of the assignment, ensuring synchronization with the clock signal."
