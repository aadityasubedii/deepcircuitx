    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages the control signal for a sample timer within a temperature monitoring system. At every positive edge of the XADC clock, it checks the state of the system and sets the `sample_timer_en` signal accordingly. If a reset is activated or a temperature read request is in progress (`tempmon_state == REQUEST_READ_TEMP`), the sample timer is disabled (`sample_timer_en` is set to 0). If the system is in its initial idle state or in a read state (`tempmon_state == INIT_IDLE` or `tempmon_state == READ`), the sample timer is enabled (`sample_timer_en` is set to 1)."
