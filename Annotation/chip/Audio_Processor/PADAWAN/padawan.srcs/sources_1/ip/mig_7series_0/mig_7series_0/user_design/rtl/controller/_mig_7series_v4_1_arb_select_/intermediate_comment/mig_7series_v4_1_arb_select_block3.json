    "block_comment": "This block of code carries out a logical OR operation on specific elements from two different multi-bit signals. The result of the operation is then assigned to a specific bit of another multi-bit signal. Specifically, the third bit from the 'mc_aux_out0' signal and the first bit from the 'mc_aux_out_r' signal are used as operands for the OR operation. The resulting boolean value is assigned to the first bit of the 'mc_odt' signal."
