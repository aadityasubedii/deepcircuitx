    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a logic '1' to the rdlvl_err signal when both the signals rdlvl_stg1_err and mpr_rdlvl_done are high ('1'). This indicates an error during the read leveling stage, specifically upon the completion of read leveling data capture process as signaled by mpr_rdlvl_done. The implementation relies on bitwise AND operation in hardware logic."
