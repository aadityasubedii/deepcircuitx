The block is a non-blocking sequential logic that takes 'complex_wrlvl_final_ns' as input and outputs 'complex_wrlvl_final_r' on the rising edge of the 'clk' signal, enforcing the delay of 'TCQ'. It is implemented in an 'always' controlled block, running every time there is a positive edge of the clock ('posedge clk'). The assignment delay '#TCQ' ensures the data transmission follows timing constraints.
