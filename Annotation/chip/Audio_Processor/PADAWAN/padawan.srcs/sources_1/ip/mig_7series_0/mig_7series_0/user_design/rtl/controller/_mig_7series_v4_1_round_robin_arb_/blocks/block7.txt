This block generates a wire array `inh_group` for managing access requests from different channels. By loop iteration, each wire in the array gets an assignment statement which is a logical AND operation between `dbl_last_master_ns[i+j]` and the OR-ed combination of a range of values from `dbl_req[i+WIDTH-1:i+j+1]`. This helps in arbitrating requests, preventing conflicts and enhancing efficiency.
