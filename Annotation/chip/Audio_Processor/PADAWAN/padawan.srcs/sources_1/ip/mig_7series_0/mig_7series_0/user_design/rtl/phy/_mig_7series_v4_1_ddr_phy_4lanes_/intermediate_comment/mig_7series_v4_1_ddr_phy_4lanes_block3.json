    "block_comment": "This block performs calibration selection for digital delay lines. Depending on the 2-bit value of `calib_sel`, it assigns specific system signals to one of four sets (A, B, C or D) of variables, which control phase interpolation (pi), phase offset (po), and delay line (idelay) operations. Each set includes enable signals, increment signals, load and read enablers, load values, reset and fine delay selectors for phase interpolation and phase offset functionalities. If `calib_sel` is changing, it implies dynamic calibration is happening, choosing different working settings accordingly."
