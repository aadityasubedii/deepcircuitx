Comment: 
This block of code describes a flip-flop that is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal (clk). When a positive edge of the clk signal is detected, the value of 'samp_result_ns' gets latched into 'samp_result_r' after a delay defined by 'TCQ'. This delay may be intended to model the propagation delay in a real flip-flop circuit.
