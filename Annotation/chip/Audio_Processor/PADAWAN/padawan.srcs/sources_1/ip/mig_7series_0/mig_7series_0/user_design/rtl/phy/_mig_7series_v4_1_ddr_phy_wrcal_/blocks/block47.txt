Comment: 
This block of Verilog code primarily implements a multiplexer functionality in context to a DRAM read operation. On every rising clock edge, it selects and stores data from specific sections of DRAM read data. For each type of data (i.e., rise0, fall0, rise1, fall1, rise2, fall2, rise3, fall3), it calculates an index based on the current selected multiplexer (DRAM_WIDTH times rd_mux_sel_r) plus the current mux index (mux_i). The selected data is then stored in the corresponding mux read variable with a delay of TCQ time units, which seems to model a clock-to-q delay or transmission delay typically observed in real hardware.
