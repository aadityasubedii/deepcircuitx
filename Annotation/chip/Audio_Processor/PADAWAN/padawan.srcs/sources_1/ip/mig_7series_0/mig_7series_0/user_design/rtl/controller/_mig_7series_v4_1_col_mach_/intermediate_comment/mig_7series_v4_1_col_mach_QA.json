It also takes into account burst mode, command and data latency, and other memory specific configurations to control data flow effectively.\n\nThe module uses timed control structures to organize columns of memory during callbacks and generate read and write commands to the memory. The module uses FIFOs for queuing read requests and delays data control path if needed based on parameters. It also extracts necessary address lines based on parameters.\n\nAdditionally, this module also includes support for Error Correction Codes (ECC) if ECC parameter is set to \"ON\".
