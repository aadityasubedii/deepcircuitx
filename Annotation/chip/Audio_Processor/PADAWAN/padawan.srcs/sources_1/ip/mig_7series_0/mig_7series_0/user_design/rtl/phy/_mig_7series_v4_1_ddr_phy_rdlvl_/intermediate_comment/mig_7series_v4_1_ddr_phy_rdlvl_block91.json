    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles signal delay for pi_en_stg2_f and pi_stg2_f_incdec signals upon the rising edge of the clock. The implementation relies on sequential logic and follows positive-edge-triggered flip-flop operation. The delays are set by the system clock 'clk' and timing constants TCQ, specific to each signal. This ensures synchronization and orderly processing in the digital system."
