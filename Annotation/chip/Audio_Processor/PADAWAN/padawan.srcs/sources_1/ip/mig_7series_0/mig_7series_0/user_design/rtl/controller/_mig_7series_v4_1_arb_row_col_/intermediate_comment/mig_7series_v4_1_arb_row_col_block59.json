    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value held in the `granted_pre_r` signal to the `sent_pre_lcl` signal. This operation is a simple and direct assignment which means that `sent_pre_lcl` will exactly mirror the `granted_pre_r` state every clock cycle ensuring coherence between these two signals. It's part of a digital system having an essential role of signal state propagation mainly used for control blocks or conditional paths."
