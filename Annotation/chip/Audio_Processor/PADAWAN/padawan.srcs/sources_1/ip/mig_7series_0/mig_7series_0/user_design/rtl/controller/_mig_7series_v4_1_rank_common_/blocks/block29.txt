Comment: 
The line of code assigns the local signal `maint_zq_r_lcl` to the `maint_zq_r` wire. Essentially, it is setting the value of `maint_zq_r` to be whatever the current value of `maint_zq_r_lcl` is at that point in the operation. This type of operation is common in Digital Logics to propagate signals across different stages or modules to maintain sequential logic. The implementation is achieved via the Verilog `assign` keyword, which assigns the right-hand expression to the left-hand net continuously.
