    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for handling the register data during the rising-edge of the clock signal. It utilizes a delayed assignment with the delay time defined by \"TCQ\". The assigned value is selected from the 'rd_data_rise0' array, based on the rising edge index 'rd_i'. The index is defined by multiplying 'rd_i' by 'DRAM_WIDTH' and determining the appropriate bit within the array. The input 'rd_i' is used to specify the index of 'rd_data_rise_wl_r' array."
