    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to assign values to different signal indicators in a hardware module. Specifically, it assigns binary values to various elements (index 2) in early rise and early fall arrays for the rising edge and falling edge detection. Here, 'early_rise0[2]' and 'early_fall0[2]' are set to '0', while 'early_rise1[2]', 'early_fall1[2]', 'early_rise2[2]', and 'early_fall2[2]' are set to '1'. The 'early_rise3[2]' is set to '1' and 'early_fall3[2]' is set to '0'. These assignments initialize these system level timing signals and control hardware operation accordingly."
