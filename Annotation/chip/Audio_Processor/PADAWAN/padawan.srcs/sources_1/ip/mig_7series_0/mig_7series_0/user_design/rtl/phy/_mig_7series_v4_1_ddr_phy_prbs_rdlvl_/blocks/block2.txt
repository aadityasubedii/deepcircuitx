This block determines the value of mem_out_dec based on the combination of largest_left_edge and smallest_right_edge. It maps different input combinations to specific 6-bit output values. The function of this block is to decode memory output values. The implementation uses a large case statement to define the mapping between 12-bit input combinations and 6-bit output values, covering a wide range of possible input scenarios.
