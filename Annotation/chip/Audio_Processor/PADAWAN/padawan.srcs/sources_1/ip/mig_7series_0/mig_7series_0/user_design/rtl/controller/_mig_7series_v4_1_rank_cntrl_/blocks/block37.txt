This block of code is used to update a register when a specific condition is fulfilled. The always block implements a flip-flop that is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock. When a rising edge of the clock 'clk' is detected, the value of 'add_rrd_ns' is assigned to the 'add_rrd_r' after a delay specified by '#TCQ'. This is a common pattern for implementing synchronous operations in Verilog.
