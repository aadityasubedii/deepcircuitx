Comment: 
This block selects between two sources to define the value of the wire 'data_cnt' based on the boolean condition 'complex_oclkdelay_calib_start'. The ternary operator is used here to accomplish this. If 'complex_oclkdelay_calib_start' is true, 'data_cnt' will be assigned the value from 'CMPLX_DATA_CNT'; otherwise, 'data_cnt' will take the value from 'SIMP_DATA_CNT'. The code block is designed to be used in situations where the source of 'data_cnt' needs to be dynamically switched based on the calibration state.
