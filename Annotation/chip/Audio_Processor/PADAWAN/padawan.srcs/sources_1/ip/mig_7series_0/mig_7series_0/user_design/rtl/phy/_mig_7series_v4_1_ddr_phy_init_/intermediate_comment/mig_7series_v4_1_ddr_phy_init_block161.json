    "block_comment": "This block manages the reset logic for a given physical layer (PHY). It's essentially a flip flop circuit that synchronously reacts to changes in the system's clock (clk) or the reset signal (rst). When the reset signal is high, the PHY is held in a reset state. However, when the clk signal is detected and the reset signal is low, the reset state of the PHY depends on the value of the cnt_pwron_reset_done_r signal."
