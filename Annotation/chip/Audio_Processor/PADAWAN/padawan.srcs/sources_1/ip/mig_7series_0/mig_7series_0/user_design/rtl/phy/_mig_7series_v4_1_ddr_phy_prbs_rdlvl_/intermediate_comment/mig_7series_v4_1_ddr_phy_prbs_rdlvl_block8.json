    "block_comment": "The block transitions the Finite State Machine (FSM) into the PRBS_CALC_TAPS state from the PRBS_CALC_TAPS_WAIT state. The FSM achieves this transition by updating the register prbs_state_r to the enumerated value PRBS_CALC_TAPS after a delay of TCQ time units to ensure synchronicity."
