    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages command count for various initialization states in a system, which could be part of a memory controller or similar system. It is driven by a clock signal and operates during the clock's positive edge, reflecting a synchronous design. On every rising edge of the clock, the code checks the system's current initialization state. If the system is in any of several 'WAITING' states and a certain condition (either 'phy_ctl_full' or 'phy_cmd_full') is met, it increments the command count, but only after a delay quantified by the #TCQ macro. If the system is not in a waiting state or in the specific 'WRLVL_WAIT' state, it resets the command count. This block controls periodic actions during different states of initialization, helping with system synchronization."
