    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a flip-flop with asynchronous behavior that's used for the initial state condition. It functions as a delay register for the signal 'ocal_scan_win_not_found_ns'. Every time when there's a rising edge on the clock signal ('clk'), the current state of 'ocal_scan_win_not_found_ns' is captured and held in the flip-flop until the next positive edge of the clock, thereby creating a one-clock-cycle delay in propagating the signal. The assignment uses the '#TCQ' delay control to ensure this operation occurs after a delay equivalent to the Time Control Queue (TCQ) constant. It enables the system to maintain the stability of the 'ocal_scan_win_not_found_ns' signal and mitigate the issues of setup and hold time violation."
