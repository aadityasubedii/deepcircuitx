    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for updating the `wr_ecc_buf` register at every positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. It achieves this through a non-blocking assignment, which means it assigns the value of the variable `wr_ecc_buf_ns` into `wr_ecc_buf` concurrently at each positive edge of the clock. The delay `#TCQ` specifies the time duration to elapse before the assignment takes place. Thus, the block implements a synchronous register update with a specified time delay."
