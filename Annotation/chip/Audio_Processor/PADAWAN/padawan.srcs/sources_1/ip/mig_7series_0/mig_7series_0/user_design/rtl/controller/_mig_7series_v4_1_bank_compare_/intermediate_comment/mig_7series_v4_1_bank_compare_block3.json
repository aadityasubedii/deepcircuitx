    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is creating an assignment that sets the `row_cmd_wr` signal equal to the `act_wait_r` signal state. This means that whenever `act_wait_r` state changes, instantaneously `row_cmd_wr` signal will also get updated with its value. This is a combinational assignment happening here taking `act_wait_r` as an input to drive the `row_cmd_wr`. The purpose of this block is to synchronize or align the command state for row write operation with the active wait state."
