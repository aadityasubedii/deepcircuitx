    "block_comment": "This block handles the assignment of settings for the Mode Register 1 (MR1) of DDR3 or DDR2 DRAM based on the type of DRAM and various parameters. If DRAM_TYPE is DDR3, MR1 is loaded as per DDR3 specifications with respect to OUTPUT_DRV, RTT_NOM_int, and AL parameters. For example, bits [4:3] of MR1 adjust the Additive Latency (AL) based on the 'AL' parameter value. Similarly, if DRAM_TYPE is DDR2, MR1 is loaded as per DDR2 specifications. Some specific bit assignments of MR1 are changed according to the value of parameters such as OUTPUT_DRV, RTT_NOM_int, and DDR2_DQSN_ENABLE."
