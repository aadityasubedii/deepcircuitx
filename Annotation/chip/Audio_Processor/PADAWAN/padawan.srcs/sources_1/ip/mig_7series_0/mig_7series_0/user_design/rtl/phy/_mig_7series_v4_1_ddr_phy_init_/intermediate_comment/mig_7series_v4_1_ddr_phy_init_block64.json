    "block_comment": "This code block controls the write calibration read logic for a system. At the rising edge of the clock, a few conditions are checked: when a reset signal is received or when the system is in the \"INIT_WRCAL_READ_WAIT\" state, the number of write calibration reads is zeroed. If the number of write calibration reads is more significant than zero, and neither the physical control full flag nor the physical command full flag are set, it decrements the count of `wrcal_reads`. If the system is in the \"INIT_WRCAL_MULT_READS\" state, or the full flags for control or command are set, and a new burst request is received, the variable `wrcal_reads` is set to its maximum value. This is done to manage the write calibration reads."
