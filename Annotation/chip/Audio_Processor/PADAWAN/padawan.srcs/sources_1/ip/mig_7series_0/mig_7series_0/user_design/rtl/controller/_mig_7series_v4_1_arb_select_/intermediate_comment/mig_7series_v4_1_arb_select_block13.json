    "block_comment": "This line of code is assigning the 'rnk_config_ns' signal to the 'rnk_config' signal. The 'assign' keyword in Verilog is used for continuous assignment statements which means the RHS (right-hand side) expression will always be evaluated every-time there's a change in any of variable present in the RHS. In this context, 'rnk_config' will always be updated with the value of 'rnk_config_ns' as soon as 'rnk_config_ns' changes. This can be used, for example, to create combinational connections within your design."
