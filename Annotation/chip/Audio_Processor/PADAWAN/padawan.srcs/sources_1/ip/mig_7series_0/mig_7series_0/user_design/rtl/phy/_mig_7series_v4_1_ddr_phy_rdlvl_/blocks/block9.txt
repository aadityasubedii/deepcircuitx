Comment: 
This block of Verilog code manages a delay tap limit. On the rising edge of the clock cycle, the block resets the delay tap limit if either a reset signal is received or a new count capture operation starts. Alternatively, if the current delay tap count (indexed with rank and calibration counts) equals 31 (fully representing 5 bits), it sets the delay tap limit, after a delay of TCQ time units.
