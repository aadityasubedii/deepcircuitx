Comment: 
The block is responsible for pattern matching between input signal rise and fall values with predefined patterns (pat1) for four different conditions on every positive clock edge. It implements this using if-else comparisons; if the value of the input signal rise/fall (sr) at current segment index (pt_i) is exactly the same as the corresponding pattern (pat1) value (considering the pattern index as the modulus of 4), it assigns '1' to the corresponding match flag, else it assigns '0'.
