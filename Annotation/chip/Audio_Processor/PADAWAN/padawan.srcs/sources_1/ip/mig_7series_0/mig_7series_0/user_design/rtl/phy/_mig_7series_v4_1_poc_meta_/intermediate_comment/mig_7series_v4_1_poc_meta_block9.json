    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code is a combinational logic block meant for determining the value of 'diffs_eq_ns', a signal that flags whether certain conditions are met. It achieves its function through the utilisation of conditional assignments. If 'centering' is enabled, the code checks whether 'done_r' and 'done_ns' are both completed. If so, it assigns 'diffs_eq' to 'diffs_eq_ns'; otherwise, it assigns 'diffs_eq_r' to 'diffs_eq_ns'."
