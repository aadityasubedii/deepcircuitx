    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a control mechanism for a reading operation in a complex system. It is triggered at the rising edge of the clock signal (clk). If the reset signal (rst) is active or the system is in a particular initial state (INIT_RDLVL_STG1_WRITE) or a certain condition is met (prbs_rdlvl_done_pulse), it clears the complex_byte_rd_done signal. However, if a particular condition called prbs_rdlvl_done is met and the complex_row1_rd_cnt has reached a specific value i.e., (COMPLEX_RD-1), and the value of complex_row1_rd_done changes from 1 to 0, it sets the complex_byte_rd_done signal. The delays for setting and clearing the signal are determined by TCQ time parameter."
