    "block_comment": "This line of code represents a wire assignment in the Verilog RTL code. Specifically, it assigns the value of the wire `poc_error_r` to `poc_error`. This feature is widely used for driving signals within digital circuits, and in this case, it is used to propagate the signal state from `poc_error_r` to `poc_error`. To put it simply, the purpose of this line is to take the signal from `poc_error_r` and make it available for usage elsewhere in the circuit as `poc_error`. The update is continuous and happens immediately after any change in the value of `poc_error_r`. This is a procedural continuous assignment statement, often used to drive the outputs of latches, flip-flops, or registers, and in this case is ensuring continuous updating of `poc_error` with the state of `poc_error_r`."
