Comment: 
This Verilog RTL code represents a simple wire assignment. The output signal `ocal_scan_win_not_found` is given the value of the register `ocal_scan_win_not_found_r`. The purpose of this assignment could be for synchronizing signals across different clock domains, or for pipeline staging, but it would require the rest of the design to clarify. This operation is instantaneous as it is an "assign" statement, meaning it doesn't need a clock to be updated, and its value will immediately change with changes to the `ocal_scan_win_not_found_r` register.
