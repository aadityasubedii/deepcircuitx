    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for managing the read pointer of a buffer using a synchronous design. Upon a positive edge of the clock, if the reset condition is activated, it resets the read pointer and its associated timing to zero. Otherwise, if the buffer is not set as empty and is not fully inputted, the block advances the read pointer to the next position while synchronizing the timing of the read operation."
