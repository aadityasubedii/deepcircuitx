    "block_comment": "This line of code assigns a boolean value to the variable 'ktap_at_right_edge'. It performs a logical OR operation on 'lim2poc_ktap_right' and 'ocd_ktap_right'. If either or both of the input variables are true, 'ktap_at_right_edge' will be set to true; otherwise, it will be set to false. This can be used to indicate whether the current processing element is at the right edge of the design, based on either limit or on-chip debugging (OCD) conditions."
