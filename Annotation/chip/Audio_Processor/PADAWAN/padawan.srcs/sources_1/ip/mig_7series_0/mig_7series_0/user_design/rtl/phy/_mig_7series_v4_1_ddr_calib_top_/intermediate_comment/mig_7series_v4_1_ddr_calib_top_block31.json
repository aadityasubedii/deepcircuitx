    "block_comment": "This code block, written in Verilog RTL, implements a synchronous reset signal. The reset is activated on every rising edge of the clock. It primarily checks for the condition of two variables, namely, 'rdlvl_stg1_done' and 'prbs_rdlvl_done', which are sampled at this clock edge. If 'rst' or 'reset_if_r9' is high, or if either 'rdlvl_stg1_done' or 'prbs_rdlvl_done' had a rising edge (went from low to high since the last clock edge), the 'reset_if' flag is set to zero, else it's set to one. The delays indicated by '#TCQ' mimics circuit propagation delay, which is representative of actual hardware."
