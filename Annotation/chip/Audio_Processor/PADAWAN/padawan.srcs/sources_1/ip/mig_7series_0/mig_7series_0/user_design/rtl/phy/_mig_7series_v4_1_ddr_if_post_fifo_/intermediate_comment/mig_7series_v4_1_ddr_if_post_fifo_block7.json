    "block_comment": "This is a part of a Verilog RTL code that defines a task named 'updt_ptrs'. The task is designed to update 'rd_ptr' (read pointer) and 'wr_ptr' (write pointer) values in a data FIFO queue, and it determines whether the FIFO queue is full or empty. The pointer values are updated based on input 'rd' and 'wr'. The task uses modulo operation with a DEPTH constant to cycle the pointers. It also manages my_empty and my_full flags through conditions checked under case statements dependent on the 'rd', 'wr', and status of the FIFO buffer. In case an unexpected event occurs, it defaults to an error message displaying the status of 'rd', 'wr', 'my_empty' and 'my_full'. This block of code is a fairly common piece of Control Logic in a FIFO design, implemented in synchronous design style using non-blocking assignments."
