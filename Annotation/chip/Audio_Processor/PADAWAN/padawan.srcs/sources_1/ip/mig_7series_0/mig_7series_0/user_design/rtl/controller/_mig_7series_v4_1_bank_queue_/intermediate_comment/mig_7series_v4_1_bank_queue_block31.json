    "block_comment": "This block of code is an assignment statement that assigns the value of the variable `idle_r_lcl` to the variable `idle_r`. In Verilog, the `assign` keyword is used to create continuous assignments which are used to drive wire type of data with a value. In this specific case, `idle_r` would continuously acquire the value of `idle_r_lcl` as long as this block is active in the hardware schematic."
