    "block_comment": "This Verilog block initializes a register array to store potential candidates for optimization, with the size of the array depending on the number of RANKS. Using a generate and a genvar-controlled for loop, the code iterates over the RANKS and creates an array, `final_do_cand`. Each item in the array is a 6-bit register. Following this, the block checks if `HIGHEST_BANK` equals 3 and will execute the corresponding logic if the condition passes."
