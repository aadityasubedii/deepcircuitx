Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_bank_cntrl. 

Module specification: The mig_7series_v4_1_bank_cntrl module is a control module for handling memory operations in a DDR memory system implemented on Xilinx 7 series devices. It has configuration parameters like type of DRAM, command mode, data buffer address width, and so on, and includes multiple input ports like clk for clock synchronization, cmd for instruction signals,  idle_cnt for managing idle conditions, and bank, row, col for representing the memory structure. The output ports include act_this_rank_r, wr_this_rank_r, rd_this_rank_r, rank_busy_r for controlling and monitoring rank-specific operations,  col_addr, col_rdy_wr, row_addr, row_cmd_wr for managing the column and row operations in the memory system; and several others for processing specific operations in the memory. The module uses internal signals like act_wait_r, allow_auto_pre, pre_wait_r, req_priority_r, and others for controlling and status indications of various operations. The major portions in codes are provided by three sub-modules, namely 'mig_7series_v4_1_bank_compare', 'mig_7series_v4_1_bank_state', and 'mig_7series_v4_1_bank_queue' which conducts bank comparison, bank state management and queue operation respectively. Overall, this module manages the operational behaviour of the memory bank, including the handling of data transfers, command sequencing, and buffering mechanisms.
