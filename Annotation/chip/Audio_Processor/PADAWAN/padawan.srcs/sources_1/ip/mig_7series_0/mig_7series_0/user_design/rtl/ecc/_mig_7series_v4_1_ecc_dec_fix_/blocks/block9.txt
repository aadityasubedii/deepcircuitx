This block of code is tasked with generating an ECC (Error Checking and Correcting) matrix from given bit columns (`h_rows`) of an ECC code. It systematically assigns each element in the `h_rows` array to the corresponding element in `h_matrix` using two nested 'for' loops. The outer loop iterates over the data width and the inner loop iterates over the ECC width. The code is designed to operate combinatorially under the 'generate' region so that the assignments are done during elaboration time, thus not consuming any dynamic hardware resources.
