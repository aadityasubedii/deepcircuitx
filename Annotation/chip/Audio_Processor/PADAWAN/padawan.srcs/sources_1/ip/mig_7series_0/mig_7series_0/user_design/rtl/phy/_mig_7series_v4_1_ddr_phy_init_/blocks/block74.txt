This block of code creates a control structure for the variable 'complex_sample_cnt_inc' based on the clock cycle, reset signal and certain conditions. On the positive edge of the clock signal, if the reset signal is high, the 'complex_sample_cnt_inc' will be set to 0 immediately. Otherwise, check if 'stg1_wr_rd_cnt' equals to 1 and 'complex_row1_rd_done' is true, if this condition is satisfied, 'complex_sample_cnt_inc' will be set to 1, else it retains a value of 0. This forms a key part in controlling data flow in the system.
