This block of Verilog code is used to associate the variable `mmcm_edge_detect_done` with the `done_r` signal. The `assign` keyword in Verilog is used to model both combinational and sequential logic, it creates a continuous assignment statement. In this specific case, whenever there is any change in `done_r`, the change will get immediately assigned to `mmcm_edge_detect_done`. This is a simple logic wiring with no specific logic behavior added.
