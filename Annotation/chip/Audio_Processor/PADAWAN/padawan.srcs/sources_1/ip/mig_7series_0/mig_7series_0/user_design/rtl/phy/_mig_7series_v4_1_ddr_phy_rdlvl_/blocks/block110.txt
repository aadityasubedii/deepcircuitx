Comment: 
This block of the Verilog RTL code controls a mux selector with a counter register value. The block gets activated at the positive edge of the clock cycle, and then the mux selector update happens in a non-blocking way (due to the "<=" operator), which portrays that this operation doesn't prevent other operations from occurring concurrently. The updated value for `rd_mux_sel_r` comes from `cal1_cnt_cpt_r`, which is presumably a counter's value being delayed by `#TCQ`, meaning it will wait for a pre-defined time period before updating.
