    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is designed to conditionally synchronize data across different clock phases in a DRAM system, when the number of clock cycles per clock is 4. For each unit of DRAM_WIDTH, the block incrementally evaluates and generates synchronization with the rising edge of the clock signal, as specified within the 'always' clause. Hence, the code block sets up a clock-driven event loop that's iteratively repeated based on the defined DRAM width, effectively synchronizing actions with specific clock events."
