    "block_comment": "The block of code manages a pipeline register for handling column-read-write control signals with a delay. The positive edge of the clock signal drives this register. The register consumes the value of `col_rd_wr_r1` at each rising edge of the clock, but only after a delay defined by `#TCQ`. Thus, it aids in synchronizing the column-read-write operations with the system clock while maintaining a specified timing constraint."
