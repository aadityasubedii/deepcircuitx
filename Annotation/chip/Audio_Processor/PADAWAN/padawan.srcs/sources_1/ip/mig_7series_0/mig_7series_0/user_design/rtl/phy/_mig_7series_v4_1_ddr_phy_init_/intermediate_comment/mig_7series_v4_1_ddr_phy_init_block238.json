    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for triggering the start of a complex activation sequence. The operation is carried out during a positive edge clock cycle. The 'complex_act_start' signal gets updated with a delay defined by #TCQ. It's activated either when the 'init_state_r' signal is in the 'INIT_RDLVL_COMPLEX_ACT' state or when it's in the 'INIT_RDLVL_COMPLEX_PI_WAIT' state.\n"
