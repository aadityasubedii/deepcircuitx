It seems like you didn't provide a proper block of Verilog RTL code to generate the comments for it. The "endgenerate" keyword is used to mark the end of a generate block in Verilog, but on its own, it doesn't provide sufficient context to produce a comment. Please provide a complete and valid block of Verilog RTL code.
