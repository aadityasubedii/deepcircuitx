Comment: 
This block of code is primarily responsible for setting initial patterns for rising and falling edges in 4 different hardware signals. In the implementation, individual pattern element `[2]` is assigned constant Boolean values for "rise" and "fall" across 4 signals `pat_rise` & `pat_fall` (from `0` to `3`). Specifically, rising edge pattern is set to `1'b1`(true) and falling edge to `1'b0` (false) for signals `pat_rise0` and `pat_rise2`, and the reverse for `pat_rise1` and `pat_rise3`. The same opposites apply to falling edge patterns as well.
