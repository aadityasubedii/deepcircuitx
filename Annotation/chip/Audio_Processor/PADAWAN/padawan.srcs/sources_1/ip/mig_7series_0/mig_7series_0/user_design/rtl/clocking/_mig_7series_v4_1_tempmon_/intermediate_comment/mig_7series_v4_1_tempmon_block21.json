    "block_comment": "This function performs a ceiling division operation. Given two inputs, `num` and `div`, it divides `num` by `div` while rounding up fractional values to next integer. The quotient is computed by regular division (`num/div`), and if there is a remainder (`num%div`), it increments the result by one, emulating the round-up operation."
