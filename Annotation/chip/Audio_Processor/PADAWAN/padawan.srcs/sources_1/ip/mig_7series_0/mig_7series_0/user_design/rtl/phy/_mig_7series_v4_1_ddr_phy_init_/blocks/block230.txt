Comment: 
This block controls the asynchronous reset and clock delay calibration of a given system. It employs a hardware latch design triggered at the rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`). Upon system reset (`rst`), the signal `complex_oclkdelay_calib_done_r1` is asynchronously reset to 0. In the absence of a reset, the latch assumes the current value of `complex_oclkdelay_calib_done`, delayed by the fixed time constant `TCQ`. The block thus serves to maintain synchronization during clock delay calibration operations.
