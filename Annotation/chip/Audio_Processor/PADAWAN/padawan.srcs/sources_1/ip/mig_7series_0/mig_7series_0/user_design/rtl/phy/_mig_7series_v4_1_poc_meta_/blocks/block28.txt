This block of code utilizes a Flip Flop to store and assert the "done_r" signal, synchronously with the rising edge of the clock signal. Whenever a positive clock edge is detected, the block waits for a length of time specified by "TCQ" before updating "done_r" to reflect the value of "done_ns". This operation is commonly used to mitigate setup and hold time violations for the target synchronous digital system.
