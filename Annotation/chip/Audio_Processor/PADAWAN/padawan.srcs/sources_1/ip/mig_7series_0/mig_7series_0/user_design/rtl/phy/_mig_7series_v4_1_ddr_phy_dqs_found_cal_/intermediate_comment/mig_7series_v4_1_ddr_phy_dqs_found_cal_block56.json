    "block_comment": "This line of code is assigning the value of the `init_dqsfound_done_r` signal to `rd_data_offset_cal_done`. In essence, it simply copies the current state of `init_dqsfound_done_r` to `rd_data_offset_cal_done`. This typically means that the `rd_data_offset_cal_done` signal serves as an indicator which shows whether the read data offset calibration has been completed, this completion is based on the condition indicated by `init_dqsfound_done_r`."
