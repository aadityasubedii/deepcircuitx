Comment: 
This block of code is designed to delay the propagation of the signal 'prech_done'. It uses a sequential chain of delay elements which are clocked on the rising edge of 'clk'. Each delay element, represented by the variable 'prech_done_r[1-3]', provides an additional degree of delay to the 'prech_done' signal. The total propagation delay is controlled by the delay parameter TCQ. After a positive edge of 'clk', the value of 'prech_done' is sequentially passed down the chain of delay elements. Each delay element represents one delay period, TCQ, resulting in the cascaded delay of the 'prech_done' signal.
