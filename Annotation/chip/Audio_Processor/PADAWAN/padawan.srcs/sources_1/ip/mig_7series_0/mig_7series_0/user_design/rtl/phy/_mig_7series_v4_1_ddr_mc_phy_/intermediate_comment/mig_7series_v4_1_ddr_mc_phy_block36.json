    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog code is responsible for configuring the read-enable signals for byte banks based on the highest bank available. If the highest bank is 2, the byte read enable signals are set to accomodate this: The least significant bit of the signal for \"other\" banks is set to 1 and the rest of the bits are assigned from the byte read enable signal. But for any other case, all bits of the byte read enable signal for \"other\" banks are set to 1, considering each byte bank eligible for reading."
