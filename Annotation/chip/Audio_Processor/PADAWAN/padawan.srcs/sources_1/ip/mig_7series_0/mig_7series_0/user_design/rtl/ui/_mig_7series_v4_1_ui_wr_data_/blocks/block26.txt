Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for the assignment of write-back write data addresses. The implementation details of this block indicate that write-back write data address and write-back write data address write are composed of a concatenation of two respective variables. `wb_wr_data_addr` is assigned a concatenated value of `wb_wr_data_addr_r` and `wb_wr_data_addr0_r`, and `wb_wr_data_addr_w` is assigned a concatenated value of `wb_wr_data_addr_ns` and `wb_wr_data_addr0_ns`.
