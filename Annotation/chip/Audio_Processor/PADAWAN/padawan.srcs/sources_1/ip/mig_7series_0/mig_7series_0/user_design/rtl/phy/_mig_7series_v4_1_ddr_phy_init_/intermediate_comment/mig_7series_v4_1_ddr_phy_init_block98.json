    "block_comment": "This block is an asynchronous block that runs on each positive clock edge and updates a control signal. The control signal `complex_row0_wr_done` is set to false whenever a reset occurs, when there is a write request increment but the `complex_row_cnt` is within a certain range and other reads and writes operations are not done yet. A write operation complete flag (`prbs_rdlvl_done`) is also taken into consideration. Conversely, `complex_row0_wr_done` is set to true after the completion of the read level stage 1 when the `stg1_wr_rd_cnt` equals 2. This conditional statement behaves as a Finite State Machine, controlling the narrative of the operations based on the given conditions and clock signal."
