Comment: 
This block of Verilog code controls the request size in different burst modes. The burst mode can be 4, 8, or OTF. If the burst mode is 4 or 8, the request size is set as a constant 1'b0 or 1'b1, respectively. However, in the OTF mode, a wire 'req_size_ns' is declared where its value is determined by the 'idle_ns' signal. If 'idle_ns' is true, 'req_size_ns' becomes either 'periodic_rd_insert' or 'size', otherwise it keeps its current value.
