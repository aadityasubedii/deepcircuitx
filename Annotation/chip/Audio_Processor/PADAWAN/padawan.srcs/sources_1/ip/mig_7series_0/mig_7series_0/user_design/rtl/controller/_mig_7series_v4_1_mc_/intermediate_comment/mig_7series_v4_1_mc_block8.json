    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for Memory Interface Generator (MIG) utilizing the 7-series library, specifically the module ecc_gen which handles Error Correction Code (ECC) generation for memory operations. It is parameterized by CODE_WIDTH, DATA_WIDTH, and ECC_WIDTH to control the scalability in terms of code size, data size, and ECC size. An instance ecc_gen0 of this module is created, which takes h_rows as input whose role is typically to specify the hamming code rows.\n"
