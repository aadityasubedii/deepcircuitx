Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_wrcal. Module specification: This module implements a write calibration (WRCAL) procedure for a DDR memory interface, supporting both 2:1 and 4:1 memory:fabric clock ratios. It performs pattern matching on read data to determine the optimal write timing for each DQS group. Key inputs include clk, rst, wrcal_start, wrcal_rd_wait, and rd_data, while outputs include wrcal_done, wrcal_pat_err, and various debug signals. Internal signals such as cal2_state_r, wrcal_dqs_cnt_r, and pat_data_match_r are used to manage the calibration state machine and pattern matching. The module consists of several blocks: a state machine for controlling the calibration process, pattern generation an
