This block of code designs a synchronous reset mechanism for the 'wrlvl_tap_done_r' register. On a positive edge of a clock signal, if the reset signal 'rst' is high, the 'wrlvl_tap_done_r' register is asynchronously reset to 0 with a clock queue delay defined by TCQ. If the reset signal is low and 'wrlvl_tap_done_r' is currently 0, then a check for 'oclkdelay_calib_done' signal is made. If this signal is high, it then sets the 'wrlvl_tap_done_r' register to 1, again with a delay defined by TCQ.
