Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is a state machine that controls the state of "wait_state_cnt_en_r" signal based on a set of defined states. It updates the signal "wait_state_cnt_en_r" on the rising edge of a clock (clk). If the actual state "prbs_state_r" is in any of the listed states (PRBS_NEW_DQS_WAIT, PRBS_INC_DQS_WAIT, PRBS_DEC_DQS_WAIT, FINE_PI_DEC_WAIT, FINE_PI_INC_WAIT, PRBS_NEW_DQS_PREWAIT), the code sets "wait_state_cnt_en_r" to 1; otherwise, it sets this signal to 0.
