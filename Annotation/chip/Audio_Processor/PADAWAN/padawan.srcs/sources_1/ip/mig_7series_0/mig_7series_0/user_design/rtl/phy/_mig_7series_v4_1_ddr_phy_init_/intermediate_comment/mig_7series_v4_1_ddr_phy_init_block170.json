    "block_comment": "This code block constitutes a timing control block in Verilog. The control signal ('tg_timer_go') is conditionally activated on the rising edge of the clock and can be reset with the 'rst' signal. Specifically, the 'tg_timer_go' signal is set to HIGH when a series of conditions, including 'PRE_REV3ES' being \"ON\", successful completion of 'temp_wrcal_done' and 'temp_lmr_done', and 'init_state_r' being at the 'INIT_WRCAL_READ_WAIT' state, are met simultaneously. In all other scenarios, 'tg_timer_go' is cleared to LOW, essentially stopping the timer."
