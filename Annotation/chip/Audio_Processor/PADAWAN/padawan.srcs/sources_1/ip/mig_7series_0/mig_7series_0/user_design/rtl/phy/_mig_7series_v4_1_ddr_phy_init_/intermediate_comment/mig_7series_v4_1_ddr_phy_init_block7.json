    "block_comment": "The block of code is designed to latch the physical address and bank number on every rising edge of the clock. It uses the parameterized variable ROW_WIDTH and BANK_WIDTH to select the correct range of indices for storing these values into the 'phy_address' and 'phy_bank' arrays. The propagation delay to these operations is controlled by the constant 'TCQ'. The `+:` operator helps in specifying the part select range, starting from '(r*ROW_WIDTH)' and the range is 'ROW_WIDTH' bits wide and similar logic is applied for bank number."
