    "block_comment": "This block is a state machine that handles the resetting and updating of read byte data offset in a DDR memory system in response to a clock signal. When the reset signal is active, read byte data offset for all DDR memory ranks is initialized with the sum of the Column Latency, Additional Latency, and a constant Latency Factor. Alternatively, if the rank_done_r1 signal is high and the init_dqsfound_done_r signal is low, or if the current read byte data offset is less than the sum of nCL and nAL minus 1, the read byte data offset for the current rank count is updated similarly. Additionally, if a DQS signal is detected and not found for all banks, the read byte data offset for the current rank count is decremented by 1."
