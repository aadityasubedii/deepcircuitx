    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is assigning the value of `run_polarity_r` to `run_polarity`. Its function is to keep `run_polarity` updated with the current value of `run_polarity_r`. This can be useful in several contexts like inverting a signal, keeping a signal in sync with another, or propagating a signal value through the design. This is achieved simply through the `assign` keyword, which in Verilog creates a continuous assignment. This means that the value of `run_polarity` will always reflect the value of `run_polarity_r`, whenever it changes."
