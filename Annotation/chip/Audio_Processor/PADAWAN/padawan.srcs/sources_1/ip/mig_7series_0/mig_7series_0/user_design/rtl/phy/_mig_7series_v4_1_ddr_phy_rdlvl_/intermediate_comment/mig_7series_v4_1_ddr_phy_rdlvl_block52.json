    "block_comment": "This block of code registers the `idel_pat_data_match` signal. This is implemented using an always block driven by a rising edge of the clock signal, `clk`. When the clock signal transitions from a low state to a high state, the current value of `idel_pat_data_match` is captured and held in the `idel_pat_data_match_r` register. The assignment is done with a delay of #TCQ, where TCQ is the time constant for quantization."
