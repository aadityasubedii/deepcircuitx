    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for assigning the value of \"wrlvl_final_r\" to the signal \"wrlvl_final\". This is done using the Verilog \"assign\" construct to continuously assign the value of one wire to another. The right side \"wrlvl_final_r\" is monitored, and each time it changes, the left side \"wrlvl_final\" is updated with the new value. This simple yet fundamental operations are utilized extensively in digital designs to ensure signal correspondence between various parts of a circuit."
