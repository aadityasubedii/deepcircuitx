    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the delay in command start times. It introduces latency at each clock positive edge where a series of pipeline stages are set up for the 'cmd_delay_start' signal, effectively creating a six-staged delay line. This delay allows adequate time for each command to be completely executed before the next one starts. Additionally, the code progresses the 'pi_fine_dly_dec_done' signal at each clock cycle to coordinate with other system delays."
