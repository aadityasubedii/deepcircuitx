    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a conditional instantiation of a DDR PHY PRBS Read leveling module in a FPGA's Memory Interface Generator (MIG). It functions only when the DRAM type is DDR3, four clock cycles are available for one clock cycle and complex read leveling is not bypassed. During this condition, the instantiated module (\"mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_prbs_rdlvl\") performs read leveling, an operation used for calibrating data lines to compensate for variations in signal arrival times. Otherwise, the block assigns default values to its output signals. The instantiated module takes inputs like clock, reset, and various control signals and data and delivers outputs like the status of leveling, precharge request, compare data, and debug information."
