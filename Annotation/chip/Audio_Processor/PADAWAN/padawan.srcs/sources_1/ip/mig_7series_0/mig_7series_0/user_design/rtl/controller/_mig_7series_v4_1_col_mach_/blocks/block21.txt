Comment: 
The block configures the 11th bit of the `col_a_full` signal. Depending on the `ROW_WIDTH` parameter, it directs the 11th bit of `col_a_full` to either the 13th bit of the `col_a` signal or sets it to zero. Specifically, when `ROW_WIDTH` parameter is greater than or equal to 14, the 13th bit of `col_a` becomes the 11th bit of `col_a_full`. In the contrary condition, the 11th bit of `col_a_full` is explicitly set to zero.
