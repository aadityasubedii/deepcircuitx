The block of code is responsible for controlling the read data enable flag. On every positive edge of the clock signal, the value of 'rd_data_en' is set to the value of 'rd_data_en_ns'. This makes the 'rd_data_en' signal to be in sync with the system clock and changes its state according to the 'rd_data_en_ns' signal.
