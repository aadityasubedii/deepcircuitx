    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used to manage error conditions in a data query system. On each rising edge of the clock, the program checks whether a reset condition is detected. If a reset condition exists, it negates any previously found error, setting the error register 'pi_dqs_found_err_r' for the first bank (bank 0) to zero. If no reset condition exists, the program then checks whether all banks have been successfully queried. If a bank is found without data and if the retry count for this bank has reached a predefined limit (NUM_DQSFOUND_CAL), or if the read byte data offset for the current rank (rnk_cnt_r) exceeds the sum of the Clock Latency (nCL), Additive Latency (nAL) and a latency factor, then the error register for bank 0 is set to 1, triggering a warning."
