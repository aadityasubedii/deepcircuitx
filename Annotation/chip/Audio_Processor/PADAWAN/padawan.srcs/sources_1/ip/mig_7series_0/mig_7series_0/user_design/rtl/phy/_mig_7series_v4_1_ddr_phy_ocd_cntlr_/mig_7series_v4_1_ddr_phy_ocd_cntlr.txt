Module-level comment: This module, named mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_ocd_cntlr, acts as an Odelay Calibration Controller in the Memory Interface Generator system and primarily optimizes timing of DDR signals in FPGA. It leverages various input-output ports and internal signals to manage precharge, write level, and calibration operations along with handling any timing constraints. Carefully calculated delays are introduced at different stages ensuring precise control of DDR signal synchronization. The primary logic is engrained in well-defined state machine blocks that dictate code flow based on real-time inputs and calculated states.
