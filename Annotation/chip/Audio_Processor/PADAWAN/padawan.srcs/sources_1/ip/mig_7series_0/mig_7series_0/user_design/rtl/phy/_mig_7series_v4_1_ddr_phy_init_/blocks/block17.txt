This is a synchronous reset block that is responsible for configuring calib_cke and calib_odt signals based on certain conditions. On reset, this block initializes these signals with predefined values. In the running state, calib_cke is controlled by the signal cnt_pwron_cke_done_r, whereas calib_odt configuration depends on various signals including DRAM type, RTT values, and different initialization states. The configuration process involves the synchronization of signals with the system clock, ensuring precise timing control.
