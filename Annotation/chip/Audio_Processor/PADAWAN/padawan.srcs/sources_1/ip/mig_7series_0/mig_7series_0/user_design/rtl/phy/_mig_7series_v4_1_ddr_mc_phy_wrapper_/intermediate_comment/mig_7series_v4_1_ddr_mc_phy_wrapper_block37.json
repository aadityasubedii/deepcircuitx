    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of 'byte_sel_cnt' to 'byte_sel_cnt_w1'. This is a continuous assignment in Verilog which means 'byte_sel_cnt_w1' will always mirror the current value of 'byte_sel_cnt'. Such assignments are typical for transferring or buffering signals within RTL logic blocks.\n"
