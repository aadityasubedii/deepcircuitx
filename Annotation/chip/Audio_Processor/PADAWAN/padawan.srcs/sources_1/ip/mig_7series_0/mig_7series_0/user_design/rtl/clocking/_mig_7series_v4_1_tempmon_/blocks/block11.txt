Comment: 
This block is responsible for enabling sampling in synchronization with the positive edge of the XADC clock signal. The value of `sample_en` is updated based on the condition check `sample_timer == nTEMPSAMP_CLKS_M6` after a delay of `#TCQ`. If the condition is true, `sample_en` is set to `1'b1`, otherwise, it is set to `1'b0`.
