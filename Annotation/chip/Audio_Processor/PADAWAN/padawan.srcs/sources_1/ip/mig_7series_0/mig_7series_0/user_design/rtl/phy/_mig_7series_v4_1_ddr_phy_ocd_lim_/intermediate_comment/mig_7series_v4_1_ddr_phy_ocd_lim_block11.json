    "block_comment": "This block implements a counter function that interfaces with wait logic. It uses a synchronous design, driven by the \"clk\" signal. When the \"wait_cnt_en_r\" signal is low, the counter \"wait_cnt_r\" and flag \"wait_cnt_done\" are reset. If the \"wait_cnt_en_r\" signal is high and the counter is not yet at its limit (WAIT_CNT - 1), it increments \"wait_cnt_r\" by 1 and keeps \"wait_cnt_done\" low. When the counter reaches its limit, it resets \"wait_cnt_r\" and sets \"wait_cnt_done\" to high indicating completion."
