    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog RTL code handles the registration of conditions related to a 'run' event, specifically if it's too small, upon the positive edge of the system clock signal. This block utilizes a delay flip-flop with a delay of TCQ time unit to capture the logic state of 'run_too_small' signal ANDed with the inverted equality condition of 'run_ends_r' to the constant 'd1'. This process occurs synchronously with respect to the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk'. The resultant state is then stored in the register 'run_too_small_r1'."
