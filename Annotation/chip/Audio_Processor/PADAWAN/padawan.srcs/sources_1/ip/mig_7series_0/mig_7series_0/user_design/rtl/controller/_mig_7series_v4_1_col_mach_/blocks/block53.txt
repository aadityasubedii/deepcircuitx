Comment: 
The block sets the condition for an operational mode known as "one_bump". The "one_bump" mode is achieved if either of two conditions are met, namely; 1. If the system is running at double data rate (DDR) type 3 or burst mode 8 and there are 2 clock cycles per clock (nCK_PER_CLK equals 2), OR 2. the system is running at double data rate 2 or burst mode 4 and there is only one clock cycle per clock (nCK_PER_CLK equals 1). This sets appropriate conditions for memory operations depending on DRAM type and burst mode.
