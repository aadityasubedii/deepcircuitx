    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is primarily used for variable assignments. The variables are assigned values from future state variables appended with '_ns'. The variables `col_periodic_rd`, `col_ra`, `col_ba`, `col_a`, `col_rmw`, `col_rd_wr`, `col_size`, `col_row`,  and `col_data_buf_addr` get values assigned from corresponding '_ns' state variables. The extracted '_ns' state is obtained for commands of different widths - `ROW_WIDTH`, `BANK_WIDTH` and `RANK_WIDTH` for `col_ra`, `col_ba`, and `col_a` respectively. This block helps transition and manage various command states in a memory controller context."
