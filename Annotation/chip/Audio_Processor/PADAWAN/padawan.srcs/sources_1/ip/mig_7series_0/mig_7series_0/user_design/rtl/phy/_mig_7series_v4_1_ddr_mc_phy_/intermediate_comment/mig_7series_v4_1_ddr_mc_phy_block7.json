    "block_comment": "This block handles the updates to the 'aux_out' output vector at the rising edge of either the 'auxout_clk' clock signal or the 'rst_auxout' reset signal. If the 'rst_auxout' signal is high, the block resets the 9th and 11th indices of 'aux_out' to 0. If not, it retains its current state by assigning the values of 'aux_out_' at the 9th and 11th indices back to 'aux_out'. There is a delay #100 for each assignment operation."
