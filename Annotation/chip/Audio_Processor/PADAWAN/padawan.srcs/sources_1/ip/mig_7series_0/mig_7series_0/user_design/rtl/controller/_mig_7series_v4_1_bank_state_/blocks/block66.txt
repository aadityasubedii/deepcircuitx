Comment: 
This block manages delay timing for a row address strobe (RAS). On every positive edge of the clock signal, it assigns the value of 'ras_timer_passed_ns' to 'ras_timer_r' with a delay of 'TCQ'. This is generally used to enforce time constraints between RAS signal activations in synchronization with the system's clock.
