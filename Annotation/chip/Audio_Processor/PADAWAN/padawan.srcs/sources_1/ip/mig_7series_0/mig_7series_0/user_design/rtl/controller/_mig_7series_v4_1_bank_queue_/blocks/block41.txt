This block of code handles the updating of a variable called 'head_r_lcl' based on a rise in a clock signal, 'clk'. With each positive edge of 'clk', the 'head_r_lcl' variable is set to the value of 'head_ns' after a delay specified by 'TCQ'. This delay emulates the behavior of a real hardware where signals take time to propagate. So, this block models a synchronous update of the 'head_r_lcl' value.
