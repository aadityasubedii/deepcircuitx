    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code implements an output buffer. The module role is to convert internal signals of FPGA for transmission over longer distances. It uses the OBUF primitive or library element that is provided in the FPGA library. Here, `u_cas_n_obuf` is the instance name where `I (out_cas_n)` is the input to buffer and `O (ddr_cas_n)` is the output from the buffer. The block's behavior reflects that the output `ddr_cas_n` will mirror the input `out_cas_n` signal."
