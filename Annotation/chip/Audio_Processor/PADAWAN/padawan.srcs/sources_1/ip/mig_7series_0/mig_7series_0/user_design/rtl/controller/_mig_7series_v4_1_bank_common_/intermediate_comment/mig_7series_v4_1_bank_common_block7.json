    "block_comment": "This block of code is implementing a synchronous counter. At every positive edge of the clock signal (posedge clk), the value of 'send_cnt_ns' is assigned to the register 'send_cnt_r' after a delay specified by '#TCQ'. This is a classic Verilog RTL syntax for synchronous operations where new values are stored in registers on every clock cycle. Here, 'send_cnt_ns' is the next state of the 'send_cnt_r' register based on the logic defined elsewhere in the code. The '#TCQ' is defining the delay or 'Time to Clock to Q' usually simulating the propagation delay in real-world hardware."
