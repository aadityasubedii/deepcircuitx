    "block_comment": "This Verilog statement is responsible for continuously assigning the value of `po_coarse_tap_cnt_w` to `dbg_final_po_coarse_tap_cnt`. The assignment is derived through the `assign` keyword and this connection remains valid throughout the whole lifecycle of the hardware model, reflecting any changes in the wire `po_coarse_tap_cnt_w` to the wire `dbg_final_po_coarse_tap_cnt` in real-time, helping in debugging and control flow."
