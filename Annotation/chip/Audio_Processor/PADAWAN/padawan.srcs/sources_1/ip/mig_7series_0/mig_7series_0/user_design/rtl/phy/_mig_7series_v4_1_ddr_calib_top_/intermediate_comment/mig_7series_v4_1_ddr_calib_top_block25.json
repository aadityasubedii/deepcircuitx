    "block_comment": "This block initiates the Memory Interface Generator (MIG) DDR PHY for a 7 series Xilinx FPGA. The initialization includes various timing parameters and characteristics of the DDR SDRAM to be interfaced, such as clock periods, column widths, rank configuration, calibration of row and column addresses, burst mode and type, refresh intervals, output drive, and more. The module then links these configurations using input and output signal connections. The underlying mechanism involves phase locking, calibration operations, and checks for status flags like calibration done, write leveling done, initiation done, etc. Additionally, debugging, complex calibration, and write/read requests are handled within this block."
