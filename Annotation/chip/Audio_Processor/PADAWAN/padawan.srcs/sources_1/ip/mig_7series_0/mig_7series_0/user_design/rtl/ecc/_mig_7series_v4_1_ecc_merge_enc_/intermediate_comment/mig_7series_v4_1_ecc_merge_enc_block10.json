    "block_comment": "The block of code declares two generation variables, 'h' and 'i'. These are special types of variables used in Verilog for creating generate loops. Generate loops are commonly used in hardware description languages to describe repetitive structures, such as arrays of registers or instances of modules. This block is preparing for a situation where there may be a requirement to replicate hardware components."
