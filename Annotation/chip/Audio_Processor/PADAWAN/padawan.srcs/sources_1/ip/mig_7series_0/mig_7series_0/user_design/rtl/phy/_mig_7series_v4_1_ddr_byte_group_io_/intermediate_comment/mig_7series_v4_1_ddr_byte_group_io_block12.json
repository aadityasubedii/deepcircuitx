    "block_comment": "The block handles a fine delay operation, linked with the physical clock (phy_clk) and a reset signal (rst). It is triggered on the rising edge of the phy_clk signal. If the reset signal is high, the fine_delay_r is reset to 0 with a delay of 1 unit time. When the reset is not high and fine_delay_sel signal becomes high, then the fine_delay value is captured into the fine_delay_r with a delay of 1 unit time."
