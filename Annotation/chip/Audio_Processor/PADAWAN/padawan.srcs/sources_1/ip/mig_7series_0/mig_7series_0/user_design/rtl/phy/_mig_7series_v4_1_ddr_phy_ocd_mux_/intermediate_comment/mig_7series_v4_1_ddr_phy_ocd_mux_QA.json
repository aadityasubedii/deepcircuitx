It differentiates the control signals into suitable behavior for stage3 or stage2 and stage3. It evaluates the edge detection and handles left and right KTAP signals. The required condition is known using the reset signal, setup signals, input signals. The module is designed based on the reset signal and clock inputs to function properly. It uses several internal variables to keep track of the state of the inputs. Furthermore, it manipulates the input signals to create output signals that are appropriate for the countdown, setup, and output requests."
