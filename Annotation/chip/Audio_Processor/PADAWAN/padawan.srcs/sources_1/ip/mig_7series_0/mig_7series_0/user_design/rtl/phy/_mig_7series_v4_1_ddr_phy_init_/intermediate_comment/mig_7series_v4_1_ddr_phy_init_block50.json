    "block_comment": "This block is a sequential logic for managing the 'first_rdlvl_pat_r' signal. It is clocked by the positive edge of 'clk'. If 'rst' is high or 'rdlvl_stg1_rank_done' is true, 'first_rdlvl_pat_r' will be set to '1' after a delay specified by 'TCQ'. In the case where 'rst' and 'rdlvl_stg1_rank_done' are not true, and both 'phy_wrdata_en' and 'init_state_r' equals to 'INIT_RDLVL_STG1_WRITE', 'first_rdlvl_pat_r' will be reset to '0' with 'TCQ' delay.\n"
