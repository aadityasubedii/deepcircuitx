    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for setting the refreshing timer in a memory management system. It achieves this action using a series of conditional statements and bitwise operators to adjust the `refresh_timer_ns` based on certain conditions. When the init_calib_complete signal is not asserted or a local refresh_tick occurs, the `refresh_timer_ns` is reset to the value of the REFRESH_TIMER_DIV. When `refresh_timer_r` is nonzero and `maint_prescaler_tick_r_lcl` is asserted, the `refresh_timer_ns` gets decremented by one. In all other cases, refresh_timer_ns gets assigned the current value of `refresh_timer_r`."
