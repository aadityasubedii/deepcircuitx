    "block_comment": "This block of code serves as a logic gate for the `extend_cal_pat` signal under different conditions. Based on the condition of signals `clk`, `rst`, `wrcal_done` and `temp_lmr_done`, the output `extend_cal_pat` is manipulated. The first condition occurs at the positive clock edge where if reset (`rst`) is high or `wrcal_done` is complete, `extend_cal_pat` is set to 0 after a delay specified by `TCQ`. If `rst` and `wrcal_done` are not active and `temp_lmr_done` is high and `PRE_REV3ES` equals to \"ON\", `extend_cal_pat` is set to 1 with the same delay."
