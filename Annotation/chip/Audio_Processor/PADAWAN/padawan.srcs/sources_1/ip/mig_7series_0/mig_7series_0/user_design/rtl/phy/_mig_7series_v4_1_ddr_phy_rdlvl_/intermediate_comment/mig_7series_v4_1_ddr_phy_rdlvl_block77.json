    "block_comment": "This block is asynchronous state machine event handler that manages wait states. At every rising edge of clock signal, the conditional operator checks the current state of the cal1_state_r signal against a pre-established set of wait states. If the current state matches one of those states, it triggers a wait count enable signal, cal1_wait_cnt_en_r, causing a delay in the process. If not, it disables the wait counter. This ensure the proper sequencing of system operations and timely response to changes in state."
