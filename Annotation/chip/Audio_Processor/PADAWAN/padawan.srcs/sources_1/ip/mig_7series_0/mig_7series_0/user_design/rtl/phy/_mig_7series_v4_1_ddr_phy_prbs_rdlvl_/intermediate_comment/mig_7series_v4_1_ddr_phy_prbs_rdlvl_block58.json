    "block_comment": "This Verilog block drives the pipeline register flags for data read validations based on certain conditions. The first condition checks for a start signal (prbs_rdlvl_start) and also whether a physical interface FIFO queue (phy_if_empty) is not empty. This information is first assigned to 'mux_rd_valid_r', which is then passed down sequentially through 'rd_valid_r1', 'rd_valid_r2', and 'rd_valid_r3', thereby creating a 4-stage pipelining mechanism. This happens at the positive edge of the clock, indicating it's a synchronous sequential logic."
