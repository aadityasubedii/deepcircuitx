    "block_comment": "The block establishes an asynchronous reset and timely adjustment of read byte data offset in a DDR memory controller system. Triggered by a clock's rising edge, the block initially resets the `rd_byte_data_offset` by a computation involving CAS Latency `nCL` and Additive Latency `nAL` within a memory rank reset loop, if a reset signal is active. However, if the reset signal is not active and either all ranks have completed their processes or the `rd_byte_data_offset` exceeds a relative latency factor, the block adjusts the `rd_byte_data_offset` similarly. Additionally, it increments the `rd_byte_data_offset` when a DQS signal is initiated, has not been found for all banks, a fine adjustment is not being made, and a DQS detection condition meets. This ensures an appropriate adjustment of the read offset for handling data transmission delays."
