    "block_comment": "This block of code performs an assignment operation, essentially being a binding of the variable `rd_data_buf_addr_r` to the value of `rd_data_buf_addr_ns`. The `assign` statement in Verilog is a continuous assignment statement, meaning the assignment is continuously executed as long as the system is operating. Any changes in `rd_data_buf_addr_ns` are instantaneously reflected in `rd_data_buf_addr_r`, keeping these two values in sync throughout the execution of the Verilog code."
