    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling the value of 'head_ns' based on various conditions, featuring reset ('rst') condition, bus mastering ('bm') operations and idle handling. Upon reset, 'head_ns' is set inversely to all the bits of 'ID' array within the range '[BM_CNT_WIDTH-1:0]'. Otherwise, 'head_ns' takes the value of 'head_r_lcl', modified under certain situations: when 'accept_this_bm' is set, 'head_ns' is calculated based on 'rb_hit_busy_cnt' and 'adv_queue'; when the block is not idle and 'adv_queue' is set or when the block is idle and 'accept_req' and not 'accept_this_bm' are set, 'head_ns' is updated based on 'q_entry_r'; lastly, when 'bm_end_lcl' is set, 'head_ns' is updated based on 'idle_cnt', 'accept_req' and 'idlers_below'."
