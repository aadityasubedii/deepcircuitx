    "block_comment": "The block of code is a circuit that controls a wait count ('not_empty_wait_cnt') based on system reset and specific conditions. The circuit incorporates a synchronous design, updating on every rising edge of the clock signal.If a reset signal is given, the system initializes 'not_empty_wait_cnt' to zero. If the \"cal2_state_r\" equals \"CAL2_READ_WAIT\" and \"wrcal_rd_wait\" is True, the count is incremented. Aside from those conditions, the 'not_empty_wait_cnt' is reset to zero."
