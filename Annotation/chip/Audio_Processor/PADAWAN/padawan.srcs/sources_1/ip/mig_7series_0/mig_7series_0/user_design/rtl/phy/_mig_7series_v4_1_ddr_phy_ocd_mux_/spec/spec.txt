Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_ocd_mux. 

Module specification: This module is a part of a DDR memory interface which mainly provides control over the output clock delay (OCD). It differentiates the control signals into appropriate behavior for stage2 and stage3. It also handles the left and right KTAP signals and edge detection through controlling signals. Important code sections are designed around reset and control operations, with edge detection contributing to the functionality. The module requires a clock and reset inputs, as well as multiple control signals to steer the action of the KTAP and edge detection as well as increment or decrement operations. Outputs from the module control the KTAP, edge detection readiness, and several stages of operation including setting count for the PLL. 

Internally used signals cater to different parts of the system, including set up, changes, incremental processes and ready states. For instance, 'clogb2' calculates the base 2 logarithm, 'PO_WAIT' provides the wait state prior to setup and changes, 'setup_po' signal detects necessary setup changes, 'po_en_stg23_ns' along with 'po_en_stg23_r' determines the current and future states of stage 2 and stage 3 enablement, and 'wl_po_fine_shifted' is a count selector for the phase-locked loop post shifting based on the calibration count etc.

The module's Verilog code is clearly divided into different sections: parameter declarations, input and output declarations, internal signal definitions, logic implementation, and functional routines. This ensures a clean, efficient structure with minimal redundancy and an emphasis on reusability and modularity. Procedures for the next-stage setup, increment or decrement operations, and the readiness of the system are to be found in the 'always' blocks of the codes. Also, a pre-defined function 'clogb2()' is used for calculating the base 2 logarithm.
