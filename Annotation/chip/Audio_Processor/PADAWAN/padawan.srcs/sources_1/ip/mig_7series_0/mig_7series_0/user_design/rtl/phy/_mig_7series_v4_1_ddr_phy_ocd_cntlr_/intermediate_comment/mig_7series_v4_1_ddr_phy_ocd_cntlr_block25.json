    "block_comment": "This block of code is an asynchronous data latch. It sets or updates the value of the registered signal `ocd_prech_req_r` at every upward clock (positive edge) tick. This mechanism is achieved by applying the non-blocking assignment operator (`<=`), which delays the assignment until all calculations on the right-hand side (`#TCQ ocd_prech_req_ns`) are complete. The delay (`#TCQ`) allows for clocked synchronous timing control resulting in an orderly execution of the statement."
