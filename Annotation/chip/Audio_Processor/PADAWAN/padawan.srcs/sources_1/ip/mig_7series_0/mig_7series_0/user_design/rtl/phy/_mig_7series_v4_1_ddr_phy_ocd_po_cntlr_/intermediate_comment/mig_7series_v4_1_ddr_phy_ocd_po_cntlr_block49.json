    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the value of 'oclkdelay_center_calib_done_r' to 'oclkdelay_center_calib_done'. The assignment operator ensures that whenever 'oclkdelay_center_calib_done_r' changes its value, it immediately changes the value of 'oclkdelay_center_calib_done' as well. This is used for registering 'oclkdelay_center_calib_done' with the value 'oclkdelay_center_calib_done_r', which may be representing the completion of a clock delay center calibration process in the system."
