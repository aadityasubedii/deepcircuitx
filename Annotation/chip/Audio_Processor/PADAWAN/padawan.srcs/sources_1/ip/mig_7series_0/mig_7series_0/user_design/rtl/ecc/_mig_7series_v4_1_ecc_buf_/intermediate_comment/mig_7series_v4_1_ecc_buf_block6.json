    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for buffering the write address. It assigns 'buf_wr_addr' by padding the difference between 4 and size of 'DATA_BUF_ADDR_WIDTH' with zeros, followed by 'DATA_BUF_ADDR_WIDTH' bits. This technique of zero padding is used to align data when the incoming data size is smaller than the data bus size, and hence, filled with zeros to make it compatible.\n"
