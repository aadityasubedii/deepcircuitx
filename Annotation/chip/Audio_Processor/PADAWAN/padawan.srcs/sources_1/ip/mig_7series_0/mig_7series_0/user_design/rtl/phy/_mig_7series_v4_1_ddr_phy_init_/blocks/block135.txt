Comment: 
This block manages a read calibration signal `read_calib_int` in a memory controller. Triggered by each positive edge of the clock, it resets `read_calib_int` to '0' if a reset signal is received or calibration is done, signified by a high `pi_calib_done_r1`. However, if the calibration is not done yet and the controller is in the `INIT_RDLVL_ACT_WAIT` state and `cnt_cmd_r` equals `CNTNEXT_CMD`, it turns on `read_calib_int` to initiate the read level calibration, all while respecting the timing constraints specified by `#TCQ`.
