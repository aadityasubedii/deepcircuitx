Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used to implement a synchronous reset logic. It operates based on the positive edge of the mmcm_ps_clk clock signal or the positive edge of the rst_tmp reset signal. During a reset state (when rst_tmp is true), the block sets the rst_sync_r register with a shifted binary value and the rst_sync_r1 register with a binary '1'. In the normal operation state (when rst_tmp is false), it shifts the current rst_sync_r value by one bit to the left and updates rst_sync_r1 with a selected bit value from the rst_sync_r register. This implementation ensures that the reset action is synchronized with the system clock, hence improving the reliability of the system.
