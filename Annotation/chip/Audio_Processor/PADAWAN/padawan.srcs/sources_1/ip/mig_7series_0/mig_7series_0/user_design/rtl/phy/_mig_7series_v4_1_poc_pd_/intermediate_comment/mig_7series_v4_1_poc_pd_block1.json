    "block_comment": "This block of code is a procedural assignment that facilitates data transportation between different modules or parts of the same module. This line assigns the value of the 'pd_out_r' to the 'pd_out' wire. This is an example of continuous assignment that means whenever the value of 'pd_out_r' changes, the value of 'pd_out' will change simultaneously. This simple yet effective mechanism in Verilog enables real-time value transfer without requiring any trigger, making it an agility enhancer in designs involving data connections or value passing between different components."
