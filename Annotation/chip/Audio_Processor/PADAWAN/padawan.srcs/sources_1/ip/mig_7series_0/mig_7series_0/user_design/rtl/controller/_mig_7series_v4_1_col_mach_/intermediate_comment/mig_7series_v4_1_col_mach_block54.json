    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a data queue (dq) busy signal generator in a Verilog digital design. It gets triggered every time there is a change in 'granted_col_d_r' or 'sent_col'. Once activated, the block assigns 'dq_busy_data' a boolean value which equals the logical OR operation of 'sent_col' and bitwise OR operation over 'granted_col_d_r'. This implies that 'dq_busy_data' is true when 'sent_col' is true or at least one bit in 'granted_col_d_r' is true.\n"
