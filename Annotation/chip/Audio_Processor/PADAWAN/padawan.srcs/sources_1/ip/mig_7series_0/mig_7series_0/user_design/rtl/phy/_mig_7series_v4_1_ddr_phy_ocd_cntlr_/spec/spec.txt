Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_ocd_cntlr. 

Module specification: The mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_ocd_cntlr is an Odelay Calibration Controller (ocd_cntlr) for a Memory Interface Generator (MIG), mainly targeted for 7 series devices. Its primary function is to fine-tune the DDR (Double Data Rate) signals' timing characteristics in an FPGA circuit by managing stages of precharge, write level, and calibration cycles. 

Input ports include clk (the clock signal), rst (reset signal), prech_done (signal indicating completion of a pre-charge operation), oclkdelay_calib_start, complex_oclkdelay_calib_start (signals for starting the (complex) on-chip clock delay calibration), lim_done (signal showing fulfilled limitations), phy_rddata_en (read data enable signal for physical layer of the DDR interface), po_counter_read_val (current counter read value), po_rdy (post-amble ready signal), and scan_done (scan completion signal).

Output ports encompass wrlvl_final, complex_wrlvl_final (final write leveling signals for normal and complex calamity operations), oclk_init_delay_done (indication that on-chip clock initialization delay is done), ocd_prech_req (initiates OCD precharge operation), lim_start (starts limitation checking), complex_oclkdelay_calib_done, oclkdelay_calib_done (signals indicating the completion of (complex) on-chip clock delay calibration operations), phy_rddata_en_1, phy_rddata_en_2, phy_rddata_en_3 (additional delay signals for DDR physical layer read data), ocd_cntlr2stg2_dec (propagates control signals between different OCD controller stages), oclkdelay_calib_cnt (ongoing count value during on-chip clock delay calibration), and reset_scan (resets the scanning operation). 

The module uses various internal signals, such as wrlvl_final_ns,r, ocd_prech_req_ns,r, and lim_start_ns,r, which represent write leveling, precharge request, and limitation start. Additional signals like oclkdelay_calib_done_ns,r, phy_rddata_en_r1,r2,r3, and po_rd_wait_ns,r serve for clock delay calibration, DDR physical layer read data, and post-amble read wait. Other signals like byte_ns,r, reset_scan_ns,r, and sm_ns,r manage internal functions like byte storage, scan reset, and state machine statuses.

The main blocks within the module encompass signal declaration, always and case blocks for signal assignment and logic implementation, and state machine for managing the module's operation based on the on-chip clock delay calibration, limitation check, and precharge and write leveling operations. The well-structured design allows flexible timing control for efficient DDR signal operation, optimizing bus transactions, and ensuring synchronization, thereby greatly enhancing the performance of the DDR PHY layer.
