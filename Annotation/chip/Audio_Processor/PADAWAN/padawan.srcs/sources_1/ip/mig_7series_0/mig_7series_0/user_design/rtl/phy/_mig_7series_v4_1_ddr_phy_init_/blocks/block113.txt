Comment: 
This block of Verilog code has a simple function: it assigns the signal `phy_int_cs_n` to `phy_cs_n`. The `assign` keyword in Verilog is used for continuous assignment statements, which means that any change in the value of `phy_int_cs_n` will cause an immediate change in the value of `phy_cs_n`. This continuous assignment is a way to propagate signal changes, making `phy_cs_n` mirror `phy_int_cs_n` in real-time.
