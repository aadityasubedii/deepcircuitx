    "block_comment": "The block of code here simply assigns the value of a local variable, 'periodic_rd_insert_lcl', to another variable 'periodic_rd_insert'. This assignment is a digital logic function and usually occurs concurrently with all other continuous assignments in the Verilog design. This specific statement would most likely appear within an always block or a module to ensure the 'periodic_rd_insert' variable accurately reflects the current state of the 'periodic_rd_insert_lcl' variable, which may be defined or modified elsewhere in the design."
