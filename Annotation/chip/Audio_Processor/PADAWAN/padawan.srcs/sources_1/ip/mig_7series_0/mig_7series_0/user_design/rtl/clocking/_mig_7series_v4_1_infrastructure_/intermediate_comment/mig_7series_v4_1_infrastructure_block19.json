    "block_comment": "This block of code is a delay flip-flop for an MMCM clock signal in the Verilog hardware description language. Operating at the positive edge of the clock, it takes the non-stable `mmcm_hi0_ns` signal and assigns it to the stable `mmcm_hi0_r` signal after a delay defined by propagation constant `#TCQ`. This implementation benefits applications where the MMCM clock signal's stability is critical for precise operations within the system."
