    "block_comment": "This code block forms a part of clocked digital logic that manages the status of signal matches. It captures the values of four different matches: 'rise0', 'fall0', 'rise1', 'fall1', on each positive edge of a clock cycle, and simultaneously triggers the 'pat0_data_match' condition when all the four matches occur within the same clock cycle. The delayed assignment due to #TCQ ensures that the value assigned to the variables is the updated value from the current clock cycle than the previous one. This timing control helps to prevent potential race conditions, ensuring reliable sequential operation."
