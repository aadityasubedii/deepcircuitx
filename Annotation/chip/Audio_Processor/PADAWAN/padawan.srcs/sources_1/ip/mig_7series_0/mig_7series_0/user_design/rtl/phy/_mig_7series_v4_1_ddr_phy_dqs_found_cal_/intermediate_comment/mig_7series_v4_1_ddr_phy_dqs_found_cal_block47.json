    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for delay the assertion of the 'dqs_found_start_r' signal. It uses the system-defined timing parameter #TCQ to accomplish this. When a rising edge (posedge) of the 'clk' signal is detected, the 'pi_dqs_found_start' signal is assigned to 'dqs_found_start_r' after a delay specified by #TCQ."
