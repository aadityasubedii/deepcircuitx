    "block_comment": "The block of code sets specific values for six 2-bit signal wires. It assigns digital HIGH and LOW signals to portions of the 'early1_rise0', 'early1_fall0', 'early1_rise1', and 'early1_fall1' wires. For the 3rd bit indices, it sets 'early1_rise0' as HIGH and 'early1_fall1' as HIGH, inverting these for 'early1_fall0' and 'early1_rise1'. For the 2nd bit indices, it sets 'early1_fall0' as HIGH and 'early1_rise1' as HIGH, while 'early1_rise0' is LOW."
