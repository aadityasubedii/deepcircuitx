    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for detecting certain condition edges during the calibration process. Specifically, it monitors when the calibration state machine is in either the \"CAL1_STORE_FIRST_WAIT\", \"CAL1_PB_STORE_FIRST_WAIT\", or \"CAL1_PB_DEC_CPT_LEFT_WAIT\" state. When the state machine is in any of these states, the 'pb_detect_edge_setup' signal is assigned a high logic level, indicating that a predefined condition edge has been detected."
