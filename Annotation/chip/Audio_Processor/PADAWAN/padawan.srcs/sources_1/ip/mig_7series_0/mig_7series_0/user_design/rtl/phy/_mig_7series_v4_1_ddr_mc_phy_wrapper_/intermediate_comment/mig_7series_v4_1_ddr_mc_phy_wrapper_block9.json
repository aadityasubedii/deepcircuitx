    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code represents the instantiation of an output buffer (OBUF) which serves as an interface between internal and output circuitry. Specifically, it is reading the internal signal `out_ras_n` and driving the output signal `ddr_ras_n`. This buffer isolates the internal circuitry from direct exposure to the external loads and provides sufficient drive to send a signal to following stages in the design. This lock helps in maintaining signal integrity and ensuring stable operation of the design."
