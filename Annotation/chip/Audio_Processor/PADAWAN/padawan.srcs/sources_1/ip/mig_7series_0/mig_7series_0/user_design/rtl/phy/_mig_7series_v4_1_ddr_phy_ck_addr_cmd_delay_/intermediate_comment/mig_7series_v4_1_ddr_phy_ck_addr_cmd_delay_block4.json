    "block_comment": "This block of code is implementing a delay decrement counter. Primarily, it utilizes a synchronous design concept, getting triggered at every positive edge of the clock. If reset is high, or the delay command is not started, or certain specific conditions are met, the delay decrementation counter 'delaydec_cnt_r' is set to 'TAP_DEC'. If none of these conditions are satisfied and the 'po_cnt_dec' is high with 'delaydec_cnt_r' more than 0, then the 'delaydec_cnt_r' gets decremented by 1. The propagation delay defined by '#TCQ' makes sure the paths between flip-flops meet setup time requirements."
