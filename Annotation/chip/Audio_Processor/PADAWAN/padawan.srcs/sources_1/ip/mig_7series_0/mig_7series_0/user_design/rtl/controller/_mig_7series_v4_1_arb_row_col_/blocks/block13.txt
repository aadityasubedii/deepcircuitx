The block serves as a means to update the control signal values based on the 'sent_col_lcl' signal. In this procedure, the variables 'cs_en0' and 'send_cmd0_col' are both set equal to 'sent_col_lcl'. This implementation allows for the tracking and mirroring of changes to 'sent_col_lcl' across the 'cs_en0' and 'send_cmd0_col' variables.
