    "block_comment": "This block of code creates a new scope named 'early_wr_data_addr_on', in which two new register arrays `col_wr_data_buf_addr_ns` and `col_wr_data_buf_addr_r` of size `DATA_BUF_ADDR_WIDTH-1:0` are declared. These register array addresses are created to write data into a specific address range in the data buffer. The suffix `_ns` and `_r` likely represent the next-state and registered addresses used in a finite state machine design."
