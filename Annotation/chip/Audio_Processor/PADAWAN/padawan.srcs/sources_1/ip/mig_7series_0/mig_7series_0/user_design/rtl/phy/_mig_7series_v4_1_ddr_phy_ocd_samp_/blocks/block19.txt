Comment: 
This block of code represents a synchronous data flip-flop with one input and one output. The output (oclck_calib_resume_r) is updated with the input (oclck_calib_resume_ns) value on the positive edge of the clock signal (clk). The system implements a delay element depending on the time constant (TCQ), representing a transport delay model.
