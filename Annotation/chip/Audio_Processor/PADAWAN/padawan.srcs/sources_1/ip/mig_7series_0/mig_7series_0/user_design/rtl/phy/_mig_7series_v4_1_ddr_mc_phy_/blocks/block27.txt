This block of RTL Verilog code defines a combinational logic that unconditionally sets a four-bit signal 'aux_out' to 0. This is achieved by using the "always @(*)" construct which denotes a combinational block implying that whenever there's a change in any of the variables inside this construct, the hardware logic will execute this statement, hence resetting 'aux_out' to 0. The "aux_out[3:0] = 0;" signifies that all four bits (from 3 down to 0) of the signal 'aux_out' are set to zero.
