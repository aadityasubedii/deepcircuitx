    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for updating a register, `data_cnt_r`, on the rising edge of the input clock signal, `clk`. The new value for `data_cnt_r` is taken from `data_cnt_ns`, delayed by the time specified in `TCQ`. The use of the `always` keyword ensures that this functionality is continuous, thereby cyclically updating the `data_cnt_r` register every time there is a positive edge in the `clk`. This kind of structure is essential in synchronous digital systems where changes are dictated by clock cycles."
