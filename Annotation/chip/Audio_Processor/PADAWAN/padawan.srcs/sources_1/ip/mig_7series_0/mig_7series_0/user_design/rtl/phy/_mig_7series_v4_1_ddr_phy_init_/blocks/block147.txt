Comment: 
This block of code depicts a state machine initialization control. It responds to a positive edge clock signal and uses a synchronous reset (rst). When a reset signal is imposed, the state machine is moved to the INIT_IDLE state. For any other conditions, the state machines shift to the next detected state and the current state, respectively, maintaining synchronization with the clock cycle edge.
