    "block_comment": "The block of code handles the row address assignment. It employs a conditional statement to determine the row address value based on the active wait signal (`act_wait_r`) and the request row signal (`req_row_r_lcl`). If the active wait signal is not present (`act_wait_r` == 0), the block sets the 10th bit of `row_addr` to zero, effectively modifying the row address. Constant monitoring of changes in `act_wait_r` and `req_row_r_lcl` triggers the addressed process."
