    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThe 'mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_wrlvl_off_delay' Verilog module controls physical layer timing for DDR memory, specifically the timing delays for Read and Write leveling operations. It uses input ports like 'clk', 'rst', 'pi_fine_dly_dec_done', and 'cmd_delay_start' for various controls and synchronization. There are output ports for indicating DQS lanes controlled and enabling/disabling controls for the second phase output. Various internal signals manage delay stages, decrementing, and incrementing operations. The functionality is achieved through pipelining stages of significant signals, controlling the decrement of delay in Phase Offset counting, managing second phase output delay, and other processes."
