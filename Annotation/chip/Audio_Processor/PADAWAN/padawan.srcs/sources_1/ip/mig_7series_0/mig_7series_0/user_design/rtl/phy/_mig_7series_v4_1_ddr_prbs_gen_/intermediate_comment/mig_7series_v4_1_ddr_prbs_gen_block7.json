    "block_comment": "The block of code is a positive-edge triggered always block that assigns the value of `mem_out[17]` to `prbs_ignore_last_bytes_r` after a delay of `#TCQ`. The delay is modeled using the `#TCQ` delay control where `TCQ` represents the delay value. The condition for this assignment to take place is the positive-edge of the clock signal `clk_i`. Therefore, at every rising edge of `clk_i`, after a fixed delay of `#TCQ`, the 18th byte of `mem_out` is stored into `prbs_ignore_last_bytes_r`."
