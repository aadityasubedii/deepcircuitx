    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code assigns the condition of 'end_rtp' to match 'end_rtp_lcl'. Simple assignment statements in Verilog like this mean that the wire 'end_rtp' will always take the value of 'end_rtp_lcl'. When 'end_rtp_lcl' changes state, this is reflected instantaneously in 'end_rtp'. This is largely used to interpret and reiterate signal values within the digital logic design."
