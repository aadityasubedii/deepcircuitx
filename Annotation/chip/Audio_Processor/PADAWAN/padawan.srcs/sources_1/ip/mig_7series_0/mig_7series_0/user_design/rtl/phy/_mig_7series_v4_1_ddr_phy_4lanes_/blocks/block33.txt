Comment: 
This line of code creates an assignment for the 'pi_dqs_found_lanes' variable in Verilog. The assigned value is a concatenation of four data signals namely D_pi_dqs_found, C_pi_dqs_found, B_pi_dqs_found, and A_pi_dqs_found. Concatenation is done by using the '{}' brackets in Verilog, which combines the four aforementioned signals into one, assigned to the 'pi_dqs_found_lanes' variable.
