This block of Verilog code is a conditional sequential logic block that determines whether to set the `oclkdelay_int_ref_req` signal based on various conditions. During every positive clock edge, if the reset signal `rst` is high or if any of the following states are active - `init_state_r` equals `INIT_OCAL_CENTER_ACT`, `oclkdelay_calib_done`, `ocal_last_byte_done`, or `oclkdelay_center_calib_done` - it sets the `oclkdelay_int_ref_req` signal to 0 after a propagation delay specified by `TCQ`. If those conditions are not met and `oclkdelay_ref_cnt` equals 1, it sets the `oclkdelay_int_ref_req` signal to 1 after the same `TCQ` delay.
