Comment: 
This block of code in Verilog is a sequential element which updates an internal register, `wrlvl_final_r`, at the rising edge of the clock signal. The update value, `wrlvl_final`, is delayed by `TCQ` units of time to emulate the phenomenon of clock-to-q delay. This delay is typical in register-transfer level models to reflect the actual hardware behavior where synchronization is necessary with the system's clock cycle.
