    "block_comment": "This block of code generates memory controller commands. The first command `mc_cmd[0]` gets assigned the value of `sent_col` which could signify if a column address was sent. The second command `mc_cmd[1]` depends on the macro `EVEN_CWL_2T_MODE`. If it is \"ON\", the command is assigned the value of `sent_col && col_rd_wr_r` meaning a memory read or write command will only be sent if a column address has been sent and the signal `col_rd_wr_r` is high. Otherwise, the command is based on `sent_col && col_rd_wr_ns`, possibly implying a non-standard read/write operation if a column address has been sent and `col_rd_wr_ns` is high. Finally, the third command `mc_cmd[2]` is the inverse of `sent_col`, which could serve to ensure a column address is not being sent.\n"
