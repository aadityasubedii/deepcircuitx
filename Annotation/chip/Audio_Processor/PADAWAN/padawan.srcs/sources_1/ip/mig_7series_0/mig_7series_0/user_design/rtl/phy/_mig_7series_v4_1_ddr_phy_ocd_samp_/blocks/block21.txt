Comment: 
This Verilog line of code is involved in signal assignment. Specifically, it assigns the value of `samp_done_r` to `samp_done`. This operation is fundamental to data movement within hardware systems and is usually performed as part of larger tasks related to data handling, state machine control flow among others. The `assign` keyword used here denotes a continuous assignment which indicates that changes to `samp_done_r` will prompt an immediate update to `samp_done`. Continuous assignments are used in combinational logic circuit design, often with wire data types.
