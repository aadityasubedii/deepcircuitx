Parameters are set defining memory characteristics such as the number of memory banks, clock behaviour, column and row sizes etc. It then manages the operations such as read, write and refresh on the memory. The module contains a multitude of outputs and inputs connected to the memory and other components to control the memory's operation. The module is further split into two sub-modules, mig_7series_v4_1_bank_cntrl and mig_7series_v4_1_bank_common, which handle individual memory bank operations and common functionality shared by all banks, respectively."
