    "block_comment": "This block of code performs the operation of tracking and updating the status of a bank machine. It primarily sets the `bank_mach_next` variable to a default status (BM_CNT_ZERO) and then iterate through all available bank machines (`nBANK_MACHS`). If any machine is available (`next[i]` is true), the code updates the `bank_mach_next` with the current machine's index, truncated or expanded to `BM_CNT_WIDTH` bits."
