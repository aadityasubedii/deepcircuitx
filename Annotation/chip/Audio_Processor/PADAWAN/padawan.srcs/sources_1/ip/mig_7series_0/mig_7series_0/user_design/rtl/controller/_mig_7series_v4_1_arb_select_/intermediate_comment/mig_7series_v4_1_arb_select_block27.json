    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns respective bit values from 'cmd0' to various parameters, which are related to memory control signals. The implementation of the block is done using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog which wires together all the right hand side values to the left hand side values. It distributes bit values from 'cmd0' to 'ra0', 'mc_bank', 'mc_address', 'mc_ras_n', 'mc_cas_n' and 'mc_we_n'."
