    "block_comment": "This block manages the state of two elements, specifically index 9 and 11, of an aux_out array based on certain clock conditions. If a reset signal (rst_auxout) is received during positive edge, it initializes the aux_out[9] and aux_out[11] indices to zero after a delay of 100 units. Otherwise, on the falling edge of the auxout_clk, the aux_out array elements aux_out[9] and aux_out[11] are updated with the current values of aux_out_[9] and aux_out_[11] respectively, also with a delay of 100 time units. The always block is triggering on two signals - when there's a falling edge on auxout_clk or a rising edge on rst_auxout, thus setting or refreshing specific array elements under defined conditions."
