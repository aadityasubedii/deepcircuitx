Comment: 
This block is responsible for remapping data lanes according to the LANE_REMAP[13:12] variable if the signal PRESENT_DATA_D is high. If it is not high, and the HIGHEST_LANE is greater than 3, it assigns a null value to the phy_din based on the same LANE_REMAP mapping. The reassignment to phy_din is made for the bits range from the respective calculated index (depending on LANE_REMAP) to their upper limit of 80 bits difference. The source of the remapping in the first part comes from the phy_din_remap[319:240] bits.
