    "block_comment": "This block of code is a reset logic in a digital circuit design, being triggered on the rising edge of the system clock. The reset signal is assigned the logical OR value of 'rst' and 'rst_tg_mc' signals, with #TCQ indicating a delay. This delay is executed before the assignment operation, ensuring properly synchronized deassertion and assertion of the reset signal during design operation."
