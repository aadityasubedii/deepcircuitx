    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the value of the `req_periodic_rd_r_lcl` signal to `req_periodic_rd_r` signal. The implementation utilizes the `assign` keyword which implies a continuous assignment. The left-hand signal gets the updated value of the right-hand signal anytime there's a change in its value. In this case, whenever `req_periodic_rd_r_lcl` alters, the change reflects instantly on `req_periodic_rd_r`. It's a simple logic propagation common in data flow modeling in Verilog."
