    "block_comment": "This block of code is a flip-flop that gets updated at every positive edge of the clock signal. The output, 'prbs_bytes_r', is non-blocking as indicated by the \"<=\" operator, and it takes the value of 'prbs_bytes_ns' after a delay of '#TCQ' time units with respect to the triggering clock edge. This kind of construct is often used to safely update state variables in synchronous designs without causing race conditions or unruly feedback loops."
