    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a delayed version of the reset signal `rst` at rising edges of the `phy_clk` clock signal. It uses a pipeline method where the reset signal is registered at every clock cycle, delays its propagation by creating four stages of flip-flops (`rst_r1`, `rst_r2`, `rst_r3`, `rst_r4`). At each rising edge of `phy_clk`, each further stage is updated with the value of the previous stage, with the initial stage `rst_r1` being directly driven by `rst`."
