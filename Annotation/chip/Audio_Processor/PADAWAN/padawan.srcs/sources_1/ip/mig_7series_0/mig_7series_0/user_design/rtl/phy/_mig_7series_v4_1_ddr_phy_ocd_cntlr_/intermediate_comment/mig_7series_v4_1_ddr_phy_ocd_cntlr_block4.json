    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a simple assignment operation. The function of this block is to ensure that the value of 'reset_scan' is always equal to 'reset_scan_r'. This feature is accomplished via the 'assign' statement, a continuous assignment that dynamically updates the value of 'reset_scan' if 'reset_scan_r' changes."
