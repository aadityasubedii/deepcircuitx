    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for governing the behavior and calibration of a DRAM memory subsystem. At each positive edge of the clock, this code manages various aspects of a DRAM system such as resetting of parameters, delay adjustment, calibration checking during various stages of read and write operations depending on DRAM type (DDR2, DDR3) or other conditions. The implementation utilizes a series of nested if-else statements, which allows the appropriate parameters (byte_sel_cnt, ctl_lane_sel, and calib_in_common) to be set according to the current status flags and delay values."
