    "block_comment": "This block is a part of a larger memory controller module responsible for edge detection in the received data, contingent on several conditions (Function). The logic update for 'rd_data_edge_detect_r' happens at every positive clock edge. The edge detection is set to '0' under the reset conditions or when a specific bit in the data is '1'. It is also set to '0' under various read/write latch states or if a previous data read exists and a count is less than 14. Otherwise, the edge detector takes the bitwise negation of the previous data and performs a bitwise AND operation with the rising edge of the data (Implementation)."
