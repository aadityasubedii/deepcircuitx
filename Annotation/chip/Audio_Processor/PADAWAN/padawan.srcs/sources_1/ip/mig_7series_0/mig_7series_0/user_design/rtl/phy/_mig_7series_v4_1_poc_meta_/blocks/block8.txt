This block of code implements a sequential logic circuit element, specifically a flip-flop, that updates at the positive edge of the clock signal. It delays the assignment of the "diffs_eq_ns" net to the "diffs_eq_r" net using a non-blocking assignment, implying that the assignment will occur at the end of the execution cycle, maintaining correct time delays with respect to the clock. The delay value is specified by the TCQ parameter.
