This is done by taking in data through the 'wrdata_in' input and writing it into memory. It performs exclusive OR operation on input data with some other data 'fi_xor_data' and gives 'wrdata_out' as output. The input 'wrdata_en' acts as a write enable. If it's active, 'fi_xor_data' is reset to zero and if it's not, then either 'fi_xor_data' remains unchanged, or it gets updated with 'fi_xor_wrdata', depending on the state of 'fi_xor_we'. 'fi_xor_we' and 'fi_xor_wrdata' are both arrays, allowing multiple data bits to be processed at once. The operation happens at each positive edge of the input clock signal."

It is an array sized according to 2 times the quantity of 'nCK_PER_CLK' times 'DQ_WIDTH'.\n\n3. wrdata_en: This is the write data enable signal.\n   Explanation: The 'wrdata_en' signal, when active, triggers the resetting of 'fi_xor_data' to zero.\n\n4. fi_xor_we: This is the write enable for 'fi_xor_data'.\n   Explanation: 'fi_xor_we' is an array sized according to 'DQ_WIDTH'. It is used to decide whether to write to 'fi_xor_data' or not.
