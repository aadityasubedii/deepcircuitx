    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code constitutes a conditional hardware generation block governed by the 'generate' and 'if' constructs. The block's function is to dynamically instantiate hardware that listens for changes on various signals if 'nCK_PER_CLK' matches the value 4. The block achieves this functionality by using an 'always' process listening for any changes in 'send_cmd2_row', 'send_cmd2_col', 'send_cmd2_pre', 'send_cmd3_col', 'row_cmd_ns', 'col_cmd_ns', or 'pre_cmd_ns' signals. Further actions powered by this process are not visible in the provided code extract."
