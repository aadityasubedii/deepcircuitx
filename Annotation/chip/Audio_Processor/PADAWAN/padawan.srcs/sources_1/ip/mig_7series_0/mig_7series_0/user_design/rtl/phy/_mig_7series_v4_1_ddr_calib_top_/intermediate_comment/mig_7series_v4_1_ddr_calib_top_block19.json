    "block_comment": "This block of code deals with the scenario where clock calibration (oclk_calib) is disabled. When the clock calibration is not active, the block resets a series of signal and status variables, such as 'wrlvl_final', 'psen', 'psincdec', 'po_stg23_sel', 'po_stg23_incdec', 'po_en_stg23', 'oclkdelay_calib_cnt', 'oclk_prech_req', 'oclk_calib_resume', and debug flags ('dbg_phy_oclkdelay_cal', 'dbg_oclkdelay_rd_data'), to their default state, typically low or 'b0'. However, it also sets 'oclkdelay_calib_done' to 1 or high, indicating that any ongoing calibration process is now completed, despite the fact that the calibration may not have been carried out due to the disablement."
