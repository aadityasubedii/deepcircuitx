    "block_comment": "The block of code's function is assigning the value of `sent_col_lcl_r` to `sent_col_r`. The implementation is through the use of the `assign` keyword in Verilog, which continuously assigns the value on its right-hand side (RHS) - in this case, `sent_col_lcl_r` - to the variable on the left-hand side (LHS), `sent_col_r`. This is a straightforward block used commonly to relay or copy signals/values in Verilog design."
