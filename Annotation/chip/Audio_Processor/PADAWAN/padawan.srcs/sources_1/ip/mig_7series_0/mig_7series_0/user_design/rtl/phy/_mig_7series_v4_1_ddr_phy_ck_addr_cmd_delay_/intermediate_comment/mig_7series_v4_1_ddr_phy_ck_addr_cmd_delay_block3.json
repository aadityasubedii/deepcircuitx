    "block_comment": "This block provides control for lane counting in a system, which can be reset or paced in different conditions. It operates with conditional logic that checks and manipulates the value of `ctl_lane_cnt` based on different conditions at the positive edges of a clock cycle. If either a reset signal (`rst`) is received or `cmd_delay_start` is false, `ctl_lane_cnt` resets to a delay of 0, implemented via the `#TCQ` delay mechanism. Otherwise, if `delay_dec_done` is false, `ctl_lane_cnt` equals `N_CTL_LANES-1` and `delaydec_cnt_r` equals 1, `ctl_lane_cnt` remains constant. Lastly, if `ctl_lane_cnt` doesn't equal `N_CTL_LANES-1`, `delaydec_cnt_r` equals 0 and `delay_cnt_r` equals 0, then `ctl_lane_cnt` increments by 1. This serves as the control logic for the lane counting process."
