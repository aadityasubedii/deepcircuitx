The operations include refresh request handling, ZQ command processing, and self-refresh entry and exit handling for DDR3 memory. Additionally, the module includes a periodic read request feature for refreshing memory content. Each operation has a round-robin arbiter for a fair assignment of maintenance tasks across all memory ranks. The module uses parameters extensively to make it easily adaptable to different configurations.\n"
