    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code essentially manages the memory refresh operations. It determines the next state based on certain conditions, primarily related to calibration completion and memory refresh request signals. The block assigns the next state of the memory refresh operation request ('app_ref_ns') to be true when initialization calibration is complete ('init_calib_complete') and a refresh request is either explicitly demanded ('app_ref_req') or implicitly in progress ('app_ref_r') and a refresh_request is perceived. Simultaneously, it sets the acknowledgment state of the refresh operation ('app_ref_ack_ns') to be true when a refresh operation is in progress but no fresh requests are pending, as indicated by the absence of any 'refresh_request'."
