Explanation: This module is designed to monitor and control the temperature of a memory interface generator (MIG) in a 7 series FPGA DDR memory system. It achieves this by dynamically adjusting the temperature range based on multiple parameters including the steadily increasing or decreasing temperature of the device. The module also consists of multiple states in which it operates. The transitions between these states are controlled by the preset temperature limits and the data sampled from the device's temperature sensor during different periods of operation."
