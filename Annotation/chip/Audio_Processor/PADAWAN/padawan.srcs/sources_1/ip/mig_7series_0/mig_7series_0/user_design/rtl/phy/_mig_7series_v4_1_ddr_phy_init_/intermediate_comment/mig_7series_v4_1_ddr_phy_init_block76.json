    "block_comment": "The block is a state machine used for controlling the number of complex writes in a dynamic random access memory configuration process. On a positive edge clock trigger, resets occur whenever either 'rst' or 'prbs_rdlvl_done_pulse' is true, resetting the 'complex_num_writes_dec' register to 1. In cases where the initialization state equals either 'INIT_OCAL_COMPLEX_WRITE_WAIT' or 'INIT_RDLVL_STG1_WRITE_READ' or 'INIT_RDLVL_COMPLEX_ACT_WAIT', and under certain conditions, 'complex_num_writes_dec' is loaded with the value of 'complex_num_writes'. If in the 'INIT_RDLVL_STG1_WRITE' state and 'complex_num_writes_dec' is non-zero, 'complex_num_writes_dec' is decremented by one at every clock cycle."
