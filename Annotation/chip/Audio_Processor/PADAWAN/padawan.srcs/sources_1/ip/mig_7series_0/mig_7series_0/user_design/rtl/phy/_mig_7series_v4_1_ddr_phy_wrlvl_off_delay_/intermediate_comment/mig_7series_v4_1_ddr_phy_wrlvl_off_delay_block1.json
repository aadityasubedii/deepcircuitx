    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for updating control and status signals on the positive edge of the clock. It handles this function by assigning the current values of 'po_stg2_incdec_c', 'po_en_stg2_c', and 'lane_cnt_dqs_c_r' to 'po_s2_incdec_c', 'po_en_s2_c', and 'ctl_lane_cnt' respectively, after a delay defined by 'TCQ'. The procedure takes place within an 'always' block, which ensures that the signals are updated every clock cycle."
