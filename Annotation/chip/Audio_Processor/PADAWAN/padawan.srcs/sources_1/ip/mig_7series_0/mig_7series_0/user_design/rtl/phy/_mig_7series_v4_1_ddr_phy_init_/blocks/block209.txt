Comment: 
This block is responsible for resetting and setting the 'oclk_calib_resume_level' control signal, which is used for calibration resumption of the output clock 'oclk'. It operates synchronously with the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk'. When the reset signal 'rst' goes high, or 'init_state_r' reaches the state 'INIT_OCLKDELAY_READ', the control signal is reset. Alternatively, if the 'oclk_calib_resume' signal is asserted, the control signal 'oclk_calib_resume_level' would be set, indicating an output clock calibration resumption request. The timing control '#TCQ' is applied to the enable signals to control the timing intervals of the changes.
