    "block_comment": "This block of code corresponds to a clock-driven counter, specifically managing wait times in a physical layer controller based on its status. When the clock signal ('clk') rises, the block checks the state of 'init_state_r'. If it's 'INIT_WRCAL_READ_WAIT', it checks if either 'phy_ctl_full' or 'phy_cmd_full' are active - if they are, 'cnt_wait' retains its value; if not, 'cnt_wait' will increment. In any other 'init_state_r' state, 'cnt_wait' resets. This counter, thus, adjusts wait periods based on the capacity of the physical layer controller."
