    "block_comment": "This block of code updates the eight register values on the rising edge of the clock signal, if the multiplexer read is valid. It specifically handles the update of rising and falling signals for four different instances (0 to 3). The implementation achieves this by using a clock-triggered always block, where on each positive edge of the clock cycle, it checks for the valid multiplexer read (`mux_rd_valid_r`). If true, it updates the respective rising and falling registers for each instance with a certain time delay (TCQ) from the corresponding multiplexer read signals."
