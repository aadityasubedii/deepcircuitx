Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is associated with a synchronous process that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal. It updates the 'complex_ocal_reset_rd_addr' signal based on the current state of various signals. When the 'init_state_r' signal is at the 'INIT_OCAL_COMPLEX_ACT_WAIT' state and 'complex_wait_cnt' is at the count of 9, or when 'prbs_last_byte_done' signal is high and its delay ('prbs_last_byte_done_r') is delayed by 1 clock cycle, the 'complex_ocal_reset_rd_addr' signal is set. The purpose of the block is to set the reading address for a complex operation when certain timing conditions meet or the last byte of a prbs operation is done while its delayed signal is unset. The block operates in a synchronous fashion following the rising edge of the system clock.
