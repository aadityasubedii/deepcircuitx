Comment: 
This block resets or updates specific indices of `aux_out` based on system states. If a `rst_auxout` signal is detected, the block resets the 0th and 2nd indices of `aux_out` to 0, implying a system reset operation. On the detection of an `auxout_clk` signal and absence of `rst_auxout` signal, the block updates the same `aux_out` indices with the corresponding values from `aux_out_`, suggesting a normal system operation or a state update. The block operation is asynchronous and occurs at the positive edge of the `auxout_clk` or `rst_auxout` signal, with a delay of 100 time units for each register assignment.
