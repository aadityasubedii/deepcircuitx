    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for pattern matching between incoming signals and predefined patterns. On every rising edge of the clock, it compares various rise and fall states with the corresponding entries of pattern 0 (pat0). The comparison is made using bitwise operators between corresponding signals in shift registers (sr_) and pattern storage (pat0_). Then it sets an output register (_r) to high if the comparison is a match and to low if not. The use of modulo operation allows the pattern to repeat every four clock cycles."
