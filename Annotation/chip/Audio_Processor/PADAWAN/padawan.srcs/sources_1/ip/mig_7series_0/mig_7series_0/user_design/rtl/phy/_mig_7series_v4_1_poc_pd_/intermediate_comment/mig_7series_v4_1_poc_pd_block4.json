    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for creating a delayed version of the signal 'q1', synchronized with the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk'. In the presence of 'clk' signal's rising edge, a flag 'rising_clk_seen' is set high to denote the occurrence of the clock transition. Following this, the current value of the 'q1' signal then gets assigned to 'q1_delayed', hence creating a one clock cycle delayed version of 'q1'."
