    "block_comment": "This code block acts as a conditional branch to handle situations where 'PHYCTL_CMD_FIFO' signal is set to 'FALSE'. The code assigns specific values to several control signals related to the physical interface controller (PHYCTL). 'phy_ctl_wd' is assigned to '_phy_ctl_wd'; 'aux_in_1' and 'aux_in_2' are assigned to 'aux_in_[1]' and 'aux_in_[2]' respectively. The boolean logical OR operation with '_phy_ctl_a_full_p' is used to determine 'phy_ctl_a_full'. 'phy_ctl_full' takes '_phy_ctl_full_p' for the LSB, while its significant bits (3:1) are set to zero. 'phy_clk' is assigned to '_phy_clk', maintaining clock syncing across the system."
