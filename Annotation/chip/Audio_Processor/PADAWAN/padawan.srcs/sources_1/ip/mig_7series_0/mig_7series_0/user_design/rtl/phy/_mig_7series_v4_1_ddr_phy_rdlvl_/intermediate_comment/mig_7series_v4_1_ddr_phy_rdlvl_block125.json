    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code assigns a condition to `mpr_rdlvl_err`. This is achieved by performing a bitwise AND operation on `rdlvl_stg1_err` with the inverse of `mpr_rdlvl_done`. This signifies that `mpr_rdlvl_err` will be true only when `rdlvl_stg1_err` is true and `mpr_rdlvl_done` is false, i.e., an error has occurred during the read level stage 1 operation that is not yet completed."
