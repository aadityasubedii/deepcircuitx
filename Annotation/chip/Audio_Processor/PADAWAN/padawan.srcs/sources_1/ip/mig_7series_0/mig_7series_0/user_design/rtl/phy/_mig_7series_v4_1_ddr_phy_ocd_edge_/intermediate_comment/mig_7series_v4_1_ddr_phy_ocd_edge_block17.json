    "block_comment": "The block handles the updating of the previous sample validity signal (`prev_samp_valid_r`) in a synchronous manner. In every clock cycle (`clk`), on the rising edge (positive edge), the value of `prev_samp_valid_ns` is delayed by a time defined by `TCQ` (Time of Clock to Q output) and then assigned to `prev_samp_valid_r`. This sequential nature of the operation ensures that the updated value of the signal is ready for use in the next clock cycle."
