    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns a value to the `mmcm_edge_detect_rdy` signal based on the logical OR result of `lim2poc_rdy` and `ocd_edge_detect_rdy`. This implies that the `mmcm_edge_detect_rdy` signal becomes ready when either or both of the `lim2poc_rdy` and `ocd_edge_detect_rdy` signals are ready."
