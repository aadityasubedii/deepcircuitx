    "block_comment": "This block stores the value of the signal `samps_hi_held_ns` into the register `samps_hi_held_r` on every positive edge of the clock signal. It contains a delay element, denoted by `#TCQ`. It ensures the value of register `samps_hi_held_r` is updated after the defined delay `TCQ` from triggering at the rising edge of the clock cycle."
