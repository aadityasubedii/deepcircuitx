    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is responsible for assigning write data from the input to the output for specific data widths. It makes use of Verilog's bit-slicing feature to select sections of the input data and assign it to the output data. The bit-slice ranges are dynamically calculated based on the data width (DQ_WIDTH) and the number of clock cycles per clock input (nCK_PER_CLK). Specific indices of the data are being transferred from the incoming write data (wrdata_in) to the outgoing write data (wrdata_out), using calculated index ranges."
