This Verilog block is essentially a sequential logic block that responds to positive clock edges. Every time a positive edge of the clock signal (clk) is detected, two operations are executed. The two assignments happening in this block perform a delay specified by TCQ (Time Clock-to-Q, a technology parameter representing the delay from the clock triggering to the actual flip-flop update) on both variables pi_en_stg2_f and pi_stg2_f_incdec. These delayed assignments allow the variables to maintain their values for a select period - effectively utilizing sampled signals for functional or timing reasons.
