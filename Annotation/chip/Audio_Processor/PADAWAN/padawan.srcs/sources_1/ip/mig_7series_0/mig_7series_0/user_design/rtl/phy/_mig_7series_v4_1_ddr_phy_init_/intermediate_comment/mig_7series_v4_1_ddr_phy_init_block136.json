    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for the function of doing write calibration under specified conditions. The operation is triggered on the positive edge of a clock pulse. When a reset signal is received or the condition of 'done_dqs_tap_inc' and 'init_state_r' being 'INIT_WRLVL_LOAD_MR2' is met, 'write_calib' is set to 0 after a delay of 'TCQ'. Otherwise, if 'wrlvl_active_r1' is found to be true, 'write_calib' is set to 1 after a delay of 'TCQ'. The use of #TCQ delay models the delay of real-world interconnect or device TCQ delay."
