    "block_comment": "The block calculates the ceiling of the base-2 logarithm of a given non-negative integer. It first decreases the input size by one. Then, in a for loop, it repeatedly right shifts the size until it is less than or equal to one, simultaneously increasing the output counter each time. The end result counter, 'clogb2', gives the ceiling of the log base-2 value of the input."
