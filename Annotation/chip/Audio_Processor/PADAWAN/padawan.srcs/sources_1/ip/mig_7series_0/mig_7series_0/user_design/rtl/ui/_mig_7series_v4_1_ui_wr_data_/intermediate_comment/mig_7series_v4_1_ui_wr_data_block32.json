    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for the write data control operation. By segmenting the data, the block facilitates the writing operation where the address is less than or equal to the defined parameters. Particularly, it utilizes conditional logic operations such as AND and OR to determine the write data end and whether the next state is ready or if the data update index is aligned with the application write data operand. The write data control operation thus happens based on these conditions."
