    "block_comment": "This block of code deals with managing a sample counter and reseeding operations under different clock conditions. When the reset signal 'rst_i' is active or the clock enable 'clk_en_i' is inactive, the sample counter 'sample_cnt_r' is reset and the reseed operation 'reseed_prbs_r' is turned off. If the clock enable is active and either the interface isn't empty 'phy_if_empty_r' or the read level start isn't active 'prbs_rdlvl_start', it increments the sample counter. Furthermore, when the sample count equals 'PRBS_SEQ_LEN_CYCLES' minus two, the code triggers a reseed operation."
