    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the value of `periodic_rd_ack_r_lcl` to `periodic_rd_ack_r`. This assignment is continuous, meaning it's performed every time `periodic_rd_ack_r_lcl` changes its value. The purpose of this block is to copy or mirror the local signal `periodic_rd_ack_r_lcl` to a global signal `periodic_rd_ack_r` for further processing or output."
