    "block_comment": "This Verilog block contains a sequential logic design with combinatorial logic inside. It mainly functions to execute various memory write leveling operations based on the current state and conditions. The block uses a state machine workflow wherein each state, indicated by `wl_state_r`, corresponds to a specific leveling operation such as initialization (WL_INIT), increment or decrements checks (WL_FINE_INC, WL_FINE_DEC, WL_CORSE_INC, WL_CORSE_DEC), and completion checking (WL_DQS_CHECK). This is triggered on the positive edge of a clock signal and the process gets reset if `rst` is enabled. Conditionality is employed at various points to manipulate signals based on specific conditions or to transition between states, manipulating and checking signals like `wl_tap_count_r`, `wl_edge_detect_valid_r`, `dqs_count_r` and others in the process. It uses inline condition checking and assigns new values to control the flow of the state machine. The block also contains a loop structure for index 'r' to manipulate certain bit-level operations across the range of `DQS_WIDTH`. Signals are delayed for `#TCQ` time units before they are assigned to ensure requirements on setup and hold times are met."
