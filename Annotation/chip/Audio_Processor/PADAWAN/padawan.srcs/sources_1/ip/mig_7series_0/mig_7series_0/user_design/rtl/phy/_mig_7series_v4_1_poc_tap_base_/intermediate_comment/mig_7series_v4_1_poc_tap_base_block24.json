    "block_comment": "This block of code is essentially a flip-flop updating its value on the rising edge of the clk signal. It's implemented using an always block in Verilog, which runs whenever there's an event (in this case, a positive edge of the clock). The flip-flop 'run_r' is then assigned the value of 'run_ns' after a time delay corresponding to #TCQ (usually representing the clock's time cycle quality or delay)."
