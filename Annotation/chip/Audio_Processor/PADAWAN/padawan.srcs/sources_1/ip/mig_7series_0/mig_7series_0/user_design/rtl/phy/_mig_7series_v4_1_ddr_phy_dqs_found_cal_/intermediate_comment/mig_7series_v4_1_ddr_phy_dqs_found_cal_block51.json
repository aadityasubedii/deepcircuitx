    "block_comment": "This RTL code block provides functionality for a counter reset and decrement mechanism. The block is initiated at a clock's rising edge. At reset (`rst` condition) or when `detect_rd_cnt` is zero, the counter `detect_rd_cnt` is set to a constant number `NUM_READS`. If the `detect_pi_found_dqs` condition is true and `detect_rd_cnt` is greater than zero, the value of `detect_rd_cnt` is decremented by one. This functionality ensures `detect_rd_cnt` never goes below zero, while also providing a reset mechanism as required."
