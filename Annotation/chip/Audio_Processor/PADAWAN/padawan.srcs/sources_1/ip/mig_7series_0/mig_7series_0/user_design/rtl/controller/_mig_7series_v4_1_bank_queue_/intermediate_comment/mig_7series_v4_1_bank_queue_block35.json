    "block_comment": "The block of code defines a wire named 'clear_req' that becomes true when either the 'bm_end_lcl' signal is true or a reset ('rst') signal is active. This mechanism accomplishes a clear request function in the hardware design. In short, it's a simple OR logic gate implementation at the RTL level, corroborating with the operation of generating a clear request when reset signal is true or upon local benchmark end."
