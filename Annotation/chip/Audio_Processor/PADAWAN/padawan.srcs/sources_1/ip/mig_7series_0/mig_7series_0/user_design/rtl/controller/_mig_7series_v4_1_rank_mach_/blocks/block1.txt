This block manages the common portion of a memory interface generator (MIG) rank. The MIG rank module handles various memory management tasks including refresh cycles, periodic reads, voltage maintenance, self-refreshing, and ZQ (impedance) calibration. The implementation involves both specification parameters (detailed at the top) and interface signals (listed after the rank_common0 instantiation). Some are used for operational controls like .refresh_tick and .maint_req_r while others pass data between the MIGs like .periodic_rd_request and .maint_wip_r. Control signals like .app_ref_req and .app_zq_req request operations, while their corresponding .app_ref_ack and .app_zq_ack signals acknowledge completion.
