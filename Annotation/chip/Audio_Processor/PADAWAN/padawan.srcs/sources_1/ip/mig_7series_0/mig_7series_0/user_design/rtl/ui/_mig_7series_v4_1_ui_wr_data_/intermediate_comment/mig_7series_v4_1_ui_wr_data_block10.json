    "block_comment": "The block of code defines a Verification module for generating Pointer Random Access Memories (RAMs). The module employs a conditional functionality driven by the status of ram_init_done_r; if it's done, the block uses writing operation parameters, else, it uses initial RAM address for both writing data and address. Then, the module uses a for loop to instantiate a series of 32-bit RAM modules that share common pointer write enable and clock signals. The writing operation parameters and RAM indexes are derived from the state of the writing data, each distinguished by 2 bits."
