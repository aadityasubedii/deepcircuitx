    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a retry counter for a specific operation with synchronous reset and conditional increment. On the positive edge of the clock, the block checks if either a reset condition 'rst' or 'rank_done_r' signal is true, resetting the retry counter if so. When these conditions are not met, it checks for another condition that relates to the offset of read byte data and a missing data-strobe signal. If this condition holds, the counter is incremented by 1; otherwise, it retains its current value."
