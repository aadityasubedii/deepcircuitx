Comment: 
The block functions as a storage element for data related to rise and fall times coming from two multiple input channels. It waits for a clock pulse before updating the captured rise and fall times. Specifically, at each rising edge of the clock signal, it fetches corresponding 'rise' and 'fall' values from the two multiplexers, delays it by TCQ, and stores these in corresponding registers indexed by rd_i. These registers (sr_rise0_r, sr_fall0_r, sr_rise1_r and sr_fall1_r) are used to hold these fetched values until the next clock pulse.
