Comment: 
This block is about the reset mechanism of two control and command registers: `phy_mc_ctl_full_r` and `phy_mc_cmd_full_r`. When reset signal `rst` is asserted, both registers are reset to '0' at the next positive edge of clock signal `clk`. If `rst` is not asserted, the registers maintain their current state. The existing state of these registers is updated with a delay defined by the time constant `TCQ` for certain synchronization purposes.
