    "block_comment": "The function of this code block is synchronizing a reset signal to the clock domain and implementing different operations for various reset conditions. Reset signals are typically processed asynchronously and require synchronization to avoid metastability issues when used in a clocked domain. The block of code is describing a flip-flop that gets updated at each positive edge of the clock signal 'clk'. When the 'rst' reset signal is high, it sets the 'pi_rst_stg1_cal' register to zero with timing constraint TCQ applied. If the 'rst_dqs_find' signal is high, the 'pi_rst_stg1_cal' register is set to one. In absence of both reset conditions, the register 'pi_rst_stg1_cal' maintains its previous value 'pi_rst_stg1_cal_r'."
