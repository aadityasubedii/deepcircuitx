Comment: 
The function `combos` calculates the combination of 'n' items taken 'k' at a time. It accomplishes this by using the mathematical combination formula nCk = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where '!' denotes the factorial operation. In the code, factorials are calculated through the predefined Verilog procedure named 'factorial'. Both 'n' and 'k' are inputs to the procedure, and the output is the number of different ways 'k' items can be selected from 'n' items.
