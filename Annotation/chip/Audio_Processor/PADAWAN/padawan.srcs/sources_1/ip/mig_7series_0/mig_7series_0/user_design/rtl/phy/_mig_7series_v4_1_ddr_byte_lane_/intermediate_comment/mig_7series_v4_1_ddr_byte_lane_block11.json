    "block_comment": "This block implements a clocked, positive-edge-triggered functionality with reset in digital systems. The reset, which has higher priority, asynchronously sets 'pi_dqs_found_r4' to zero when activated. Otherwise, when 'pi_dqs_found_r2' equals 'pi_dqs_found_r3', the block will synchronously set 'pi_dqs_found_r4' to the value of 'pi_dqs_found_r3' on the positive edge of 'phy_clk'. This block is typically used in state machine design or data retain operations."
