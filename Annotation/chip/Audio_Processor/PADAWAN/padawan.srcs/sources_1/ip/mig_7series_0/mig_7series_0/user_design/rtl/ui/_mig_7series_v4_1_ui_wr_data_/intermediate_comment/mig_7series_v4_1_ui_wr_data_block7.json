    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a write buffer for data storage. When this buffer receives data inputs, it assigns the input data to `wr_buf_in_data` according to different situations. The scenarios include whether the error checking and correction (ECC) test is on or off, and whether the remaining buffer capacity (`REMAINDER`) is zero or not. The write buffer address (`rd_addr_w`) is assigned combining the write data address and offset. ECC and remaining capacity settings control how data is assigned, allowing for flexible data handling suitable under different operation conditions."
