    "block_comment": "This block of code specifies a delay for the read data at the end of a cycle. It operates synchronously with the rising edge of the system clock. Upon each clock cycle, the 'rd_data_end' signal is updated to the next state 'rd_data_end_ns' after a delay specified by 'TCQ'. The delay length is specified by 'TCQ', which could be a defined constant or a dynamically changing value."
