    "block_comment": "The block manages the update of `prbs_state_r1` and `prbs_rdlvl_start_r` on the positive edge of the clock signal. It implements a flip-flop-like logic, where the present state (`prbs_state_r` and `prbs_rdlvl_start`) gets transferred to the next state (`prbs_state_r1` and `prbs_rdlvl_start_r`), with a delay defined by `#TCQ`. This delay allows for synchronized updates of these variables to prevent communication issues between logic elements running at different speeds."
