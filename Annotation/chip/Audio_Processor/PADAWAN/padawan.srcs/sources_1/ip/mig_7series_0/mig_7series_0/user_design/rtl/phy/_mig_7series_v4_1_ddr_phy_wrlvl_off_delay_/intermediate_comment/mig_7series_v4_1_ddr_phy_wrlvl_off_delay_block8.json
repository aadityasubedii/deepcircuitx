    "block_comment": "This block is part of a sequential logic module, which is responsible for maintaining the 'incdec' and 'en' signals between different logic stages upon a positive edge of a clock signal. The sequential operation is achieved by always triggering on the rising edge ('posedge') of the clock ('clk'). A delay of '#TCQ' is applied to both signals in order to synchronize them with the changed clock signal, ensuring proper sequential logic operation. The delayed 'incdec' and 'en' signals are then assigned to the 'po_s2_incdec_f' and 'po_en_s2_f' signals, respectively."
