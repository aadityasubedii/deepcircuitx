    "block_comment": "This Verilog block represents the instantiation of a MIG (Memory Interface Generator) 7 series module, particularly for memory controller functionality. The MIG module is configuring with a large set parameters such as `TCQ`, `PAYLOAD_WIDTH`, `MC_ERR_ADDR_WIDTH`, `ADDR_CMD_MODE` and others for controlling memory characteristics such as data width, QDR settings, error settings, addressing mode, etc. It is then connected to several input and output wires and buses for the purpose of read and write operations to memory including error detection and correction (ECC), self-refresh request (sr_req), and interfaces for data read and write. The versatility of setup and the number of input and output connections implies it can handle a variety of memory provisions in a complex system."
