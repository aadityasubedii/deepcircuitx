    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code performs the operation of counting and generating an exit request signal for an operation. It does this using a flip-flop that updates the operation count (`op_cnt_r`) at every positive edge of the clock cycle. The procedure for generating the `op_exit_req` signal is based on two conditions: either the operation is in an idle low count state and currently active, or the operation is waiting and all bits of the operation count have been reset to zero. This block of code is typically used in managing computational operations and controlling their execution."
