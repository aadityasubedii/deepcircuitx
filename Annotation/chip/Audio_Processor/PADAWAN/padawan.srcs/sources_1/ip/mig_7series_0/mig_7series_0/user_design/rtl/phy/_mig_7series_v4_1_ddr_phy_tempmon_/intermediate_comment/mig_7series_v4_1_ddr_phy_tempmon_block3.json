    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for assigning the signals for a potential temperature monitoring system. More specifically, it maps certain control signals such as 'pi_f_inc' and 'pi_f_dec' to 'tempmon_pi_f_inc' and 'tempmon_pi_f_dec' respectively. In addition, it uses a logical OR operation to determine if either of the 'pi_f_inc' or 'pi_f_dec' signals is active, and then assigns the resulting value to 'tempmon_sel_pi_incdec'. All these assignments are made concurrently due to the 'assign' keyword's implicit always @* behaviour in Verilog, consequently the output signals will instantly react to any changes in input signals."
