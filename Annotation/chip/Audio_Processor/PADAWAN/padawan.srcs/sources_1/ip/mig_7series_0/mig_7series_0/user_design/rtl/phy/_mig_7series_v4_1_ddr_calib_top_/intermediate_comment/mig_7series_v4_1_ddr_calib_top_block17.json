    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog code primarily enables the calibration for the Data Strobe (DQS) delay lines in DDR memory interfaces. Calibration is dynamically selected based on the direction parameter \"DQSFOUND_CAL\". The control logic branches based on this parameter. For \"RIGHT\", the normal DQS calibration module (mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_dqs_found_cal) is instantiated, while for any other value, the hardware-reduced DQS calibration module (mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_dqs_found_cal_hr) is instantiated. Both modules adapt to a wide range of memory timing specifications represented by parameters like TCQ, nCK_PER_CLK, nCL, AL, and nCWL. Other parameters account for DRAM characteristics and the control variables, while signals provide interfacing for calibration control and status monitoring."
