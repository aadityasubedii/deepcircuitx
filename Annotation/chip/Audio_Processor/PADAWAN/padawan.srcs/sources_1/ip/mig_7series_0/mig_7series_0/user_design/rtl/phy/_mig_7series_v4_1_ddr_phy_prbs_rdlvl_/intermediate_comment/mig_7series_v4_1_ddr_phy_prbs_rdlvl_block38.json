    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the value of a right-shifted pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) counter to a timing variable. The implementation concisely uses the \"assign\" Verilog keyword to specify continuous assignment. The right shift operation is represented by the concatenation expression `{2'd0, prbs_dqs_cnt_r}`, which prepends two '0' bits to the PRBS counter signal, effectively shifting its value to the right."
