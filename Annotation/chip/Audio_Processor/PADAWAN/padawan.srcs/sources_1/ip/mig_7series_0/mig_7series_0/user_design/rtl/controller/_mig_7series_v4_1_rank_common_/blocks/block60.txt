The block manages a refresh timer using a register. The block employs two registers "refresh_timer_r" and "refresh_timer_ns", both of which have the width defined by the constant REFRESH_TIMER_WIDTH. Each of these registers are used to keep track of a timer for a specific purpose, but as the context is not provided we cannot determine their specific functionality.
