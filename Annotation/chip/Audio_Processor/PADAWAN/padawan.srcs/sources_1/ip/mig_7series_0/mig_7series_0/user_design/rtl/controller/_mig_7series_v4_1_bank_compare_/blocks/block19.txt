Comment: 
This block of code contains a register assignment that triggers at every rising edge of the input clock signal. The register `req_bank_r_lcl` is assigned the value of `req_bank_ns` after a delay specified by `#TCQ`, making sure the assignment respects the setup and hold times of the sequential logic.
