Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for assigning certain variables to their "_r" counterparts. The implemented design uses 'assign' statements in Verilog, which implies that continuous assignment happens here. It implies that whenever any changes occur to the variables on the right-hand side i.e., 'z2f_r', 'f2z_r', 'o2f_r', 'f2o_r', it would immediately reflect on their left-hand side counterparts i.e., 'z2f', 'f2z', 'o2f', and 'f2o'.
