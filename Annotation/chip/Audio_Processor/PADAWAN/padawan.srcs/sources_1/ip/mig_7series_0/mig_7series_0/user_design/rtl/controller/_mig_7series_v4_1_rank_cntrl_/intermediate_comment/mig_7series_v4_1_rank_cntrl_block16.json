    "block_comment": "This block is designed to check if any bank machine of a specific rank is busy or not. It employs a for loop which iterates over the range from 0 to nBANK_MACHS (the total number of bank machines) and for each iteration, selects the corresponding rank_busy status stored in rank_busy_r memory using 'ID' and current index. It logically ORs ('||') this status with the 'my_rank_busy', which in the beginning, is set to '0'. As a result, if any of the bank machines in this particular rank is busy, 'my_rank_busy' will be set to '1'. Otherwise, it remains '0', indicating all the bank machines in this rank are idle."
