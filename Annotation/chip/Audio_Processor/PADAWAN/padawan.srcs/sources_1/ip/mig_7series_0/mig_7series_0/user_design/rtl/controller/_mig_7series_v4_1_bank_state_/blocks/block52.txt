Comment: 
This code block is responsible for asserting the operation exit request (`op_exit_req`). It does this by using a bitwise AND operation between the signals `low_idle_cnt_r` and `op_active`. If `low_idle_cnt_r` and `op_active` are both true simultaneously, then `op_exit_req` will be asserted, indicating that the operation wants to exit.
