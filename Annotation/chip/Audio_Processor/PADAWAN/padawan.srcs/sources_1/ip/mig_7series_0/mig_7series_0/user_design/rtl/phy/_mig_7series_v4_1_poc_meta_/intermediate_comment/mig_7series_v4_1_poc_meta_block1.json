    "block_comment": "Without the complete Verilog RTL code block, it's challenging to provide an accurate comment for this single line of code. However, based on my expertise in hardware design and Verilog RTL, my initial interpretation is below:\n\nThis line of code declares an output signal named 'mmcm_lbclk_edge_aligned'. This signal likely serves to indicate when the low bit clock signal, 'lbclk', is edge-aligned by an MMCM block. MMCMs are specialized digital clock managers in hardware designs, and 'edge-aligned' here refers to the synchronization of the 'lbclk' with the reference clock in the MMCM."
