Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for defining three signals in the system: `dqsfound_retry`, `wrcal_read_req`, and `phy_if_reset`. The first two, `dqsfound_retry` and `wrcal_read_req`, are assigned static values, zero in both cases, indicating that these signals are being reset or disabled. The `phy_if_reset` signal is assigned the value of the `cal2_if_reset` signal, meaning that any change in the state of `cal2_if_reset` will directly influence the state of `phy_if_reset`.
