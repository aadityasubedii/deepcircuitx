The block of Verilog code is responsible for creating a register that stores the value of 'wrcal_dqs_cnt_r' at each rising edge of the clock signal (clk). This register, rd_mux_sel_r, is delayed by #TCQ. The block uses non-blocking assignments, ensuring that updates occur asynchronously without posing conflicts or glitches with other signals in the system. The block is triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal, reflecting a common design characteristic used to synchronize signal updates within digital hardware systems. This is how the block achieves its functional implementation.
