Comment: 
This line of Verilog code is setting the value of a wire or reg, named col_channel_offset, to 1. Unlike procedural assignments that are performed at runtime, the assign statement make continuous assignments, which essentially means the target (in this case, col_channel_offset) is constantly updated based on the value of the expression on the right side of the assign statement. In this context, as the right hand side is a constant (1), the col_channel_offset will remain 1 throughout. This may be used for designating a fixed position or an offset in a certain control or data flow architecture.
