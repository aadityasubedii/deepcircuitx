    "block_comment": "This section of the code manages a Wait signal (`wrcal_rd_wait`) connected to a Write Calibration (WRCAL) Read operation. It stands active during the `INIT_WRCAL_READ_WAIT ` state in a synchronous process, triggered by each positive clock edge. If a reset (`rst`) is issued, this flag is forcefully turned off immediately. Conversely, if the system is in the `INIT_WRCAL_READ_WAIT` state, the flag `wrcal_rd_wait` is set high indicating a pending Write Calibration Read. Under any other state, the flag reverts or remains low suggesting no such operation is demanded."
