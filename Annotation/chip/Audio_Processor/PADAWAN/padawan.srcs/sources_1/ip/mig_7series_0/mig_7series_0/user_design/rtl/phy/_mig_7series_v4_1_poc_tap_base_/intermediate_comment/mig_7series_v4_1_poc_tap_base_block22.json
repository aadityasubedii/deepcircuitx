    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code indicates a continuous assignment for the 'run_end' signal. The assigned value is from the internal signal 'run_end_int'. The continuous assignment means that the 'run_end' output is driven by the 'run_end_int' internal signal all the time, i.e., whenever 'run_end_int' changes, 'run_end' will immediately reflect this change."
