    "block_comment": "This block is used for updating a synchronous register called row_hit_r with a delay specified by the time constant TCQ, whenever a positive clock edge is detected. The functionality of this block is achieved using an always block in Verilog which is activated on a positive edge of the clock signal, 'clk'. Inside the block, a non-blocking assignment is used to transfer the value of 'row_hit_ns' to 'row_hit_r' with a delay of #TCQ. This ensures that changes are deferred until all the computations in the current time-step are finished, a behavior which closely mirrors actual hardware operation."
