    "block_comment": "The given Verilog block handles the assignment operation to facilitate the flow of data from a \"grant_pre_r_lcl\" signal to a \"sending_pre\" signal. This operation is implemented via a direct, non-blocking assignment which means that the value of \"grant_pre_r_lcl\" at the current moment of execution is passed to \"sending_pre\", allowing for real-time synchronization of values between the two signals."
