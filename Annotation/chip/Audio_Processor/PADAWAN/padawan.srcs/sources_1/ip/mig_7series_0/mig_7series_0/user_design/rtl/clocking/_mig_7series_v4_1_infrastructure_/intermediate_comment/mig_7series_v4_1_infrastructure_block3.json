    "block_comment": "This block of code is a conditional assignment statement that determines the reset conditions for the phase reference signal, `rst_tmp_phaser_ref`. It considers the memory type and clock period to apply the appropriate reset scheme. If the memory type is DDR3 and the clock period is less than or equal to 1500, the reset is triggered by a high system reset signal, an unlocked MMCM signal, or the unavailability of the second control signal from I/O delay module. Else, for other memory types or a higher clock period, the reset condition changes to being associated with the first control signal from the I/O delay module."
