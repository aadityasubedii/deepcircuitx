Module-level comment: The 'mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_ocd_edge' handles DDR PHY Operation, Control, and Debugging on Xilinx 7 Series FPGA chips within the MIG design. It scans signals, manipulates state transitions (ZERO, FUZZ, ONEEIGHTY), and controls their timings. Input signals command scan direction, reset functionality, and sample read operations. Output signals identify scan direction and store transition results. Internal signals maintain previous state information, upcoming transition decisions, and transition results. Implementation employs 'always' blocks for timing control and a 'case' statement, manipulating signals dependent on the scan direction and current state.
