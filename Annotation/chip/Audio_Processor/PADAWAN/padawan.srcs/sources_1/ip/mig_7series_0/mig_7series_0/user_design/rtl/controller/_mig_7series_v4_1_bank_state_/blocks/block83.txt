Comment: 
This block is a timer module for recording time intervals in Verilog RTL. It resets the time upon a reset (`rst`) signal or updates the timer count upon the local start record (`start_rcd_lcl`) signal or every time when the record timer register (`rcd_timer_r`) changes. Implementing the functionality, it initializes `rcd_timer_ns` to zero when `rst` is high and decrements `rcd_timer_ns` when `rcd_timer_r` is non-zero, while it sets `rcd_timer_ns` to `nRCD_CLKS_M2` whenever `start_rcd_lcl` signal goes high. This block helps maintain the data timing by either initiating, increasing, or decreasing the timer based on the relevant specified signals.
