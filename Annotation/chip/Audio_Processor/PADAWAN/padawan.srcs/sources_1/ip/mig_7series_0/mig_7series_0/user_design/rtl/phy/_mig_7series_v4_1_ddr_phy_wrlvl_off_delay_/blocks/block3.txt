This Verilog code block is serving as a delay done signal generator. When the system reboots or before the fine delay decoding is finished, it resets the delay_done signal to '0'. After fine delay decoding, when the delay counter is equal to 1 and the lane counter DQS is '0', the signal delay_done sets to '1'. The delay time of '#TCQ' controls the time taken to establish new signals.
