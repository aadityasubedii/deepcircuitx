    "block_comment": "This block is synchronously and conditionally controlling the 'complex_ocal_ref_done' flag with respect to clk. The flag is updated to logic high under the 'rst' reset condition, the case when 'init_state_r' is at the 'INIT_LOCAL_COMPLEX_ACT' state, or when 'prbs_rdlvl_done' is achieved and 'init_state_r' is in the 'INIT_RDLVL_COMPLEX_ACT' phase, with a delay of 'TCQ'. It is set to logic low if the state of 'init_state_r' is 'INIT_RDLVL_STG1_WRITE', again with a delay of 'TCQ'."
