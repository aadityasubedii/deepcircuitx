    "block_comment": "This Verilog block controls the chip select signal and send command based on the local sent column signal. It employs an always block to monitor \"sent_col_lcl\". When this signal changes, \"cs_en1\" and \"send_cmd1_col\" are synchronously assigned its value, allowing column commands to be sent based on the state of \"sent_col_lcl\"."
