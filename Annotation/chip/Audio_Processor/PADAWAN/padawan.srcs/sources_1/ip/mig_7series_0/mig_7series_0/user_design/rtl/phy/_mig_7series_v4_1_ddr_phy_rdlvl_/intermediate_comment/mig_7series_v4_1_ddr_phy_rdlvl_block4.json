    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages the resetting and calibration of the read leveling delay-locked loop (DLL) tap count for each rank and data strobe. On a reset signal, it initializes the read leveling DLL tap count for all ranks and all data strobes to zero. If 'FAST_CAL' option is selected, it updates the tap count with the computed count 'tap_cnt_cpt_r'. If 'SKIP_CAL' option is selected, it sets the tap count to a default value of 31. In case none of these conditions are met and the calibration state is 'CAL1_NEXT_DQS', the tap count for a specific rank 'rnk_cnt_r' and specific timing 'cal1_cnt_cpt_timing_r' is updated with 'tap_cnt_cpt_r'. The computations are synchronized with the clock's positive edge."
