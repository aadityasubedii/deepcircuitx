    "block_comment": "The block of code is tasked with controlling two signal activations, `pi_dqs_found_start` and `wrcal_start`, based on the system's state. Upon receiving the `clk` signal, the process checks if the system is in reset, retry, or redo states. If any of these states are active, the two control signals are de-activated. Conversely, if the system is not in any of the states and in the `INIT_RDLVL_STG2_READ` state, the `pi_dqs_found_start` signal is activated. If the delayed `wrcal_start_dly_r` signal at index 5 is true, the `wrcal_start` signal is activated."
