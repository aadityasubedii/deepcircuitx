This block of code is a flip-flop design, a basic building block in digital circuits [Function of the block]. The code represents a positive-edge triggered flip-flop. Whenever thereâ€™s a positive edge on the clock signal 'clk', the current value of 'phy_data_full' signal will be stored to 'phy_data_full_r' after #TCQ delay time, denoting the flip-flop's propagation delay [Implementation details of the block].
