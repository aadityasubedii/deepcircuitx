    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to manage a counter (`done_cnt`) based on operation states and a reset signal. It is designed to handle operations in a state machine, with different behaviors defined for various states. The block is triggered at the positive edge of the clock. When a reset signal is high, the counter is reset. If the machine is in `CAL1_REGL_LOAD` state preparing for `CAL1_NEXT_DQS` state, or if the counter is at one and the machine is not in `CAL1_DONE` state, the counter is set to ten. If none of these conditions are met, and the counter is above zero, it decreases by one in each clock cycle. Hence, `done_cnt` allows to control the progress of several state transitions."
