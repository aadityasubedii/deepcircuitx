Comment: 
I am sorry. It seems like there's a mistake and the verilog block code you provided is incomplete. Please provide a complete Verilog RTL code so I can help you process the raw data appropriately for the code comment generation task. Once I have a complete Verilog RTL code, I will transform it into a suitable format serving as inputs and outputs for the model. Typically, the input for the model will be the Verilog RTL code, and the output would be a summary that reflects both the function and implementation details of the block.
