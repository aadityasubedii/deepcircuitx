    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for updating the configuration of rank (rnk_config_ns) in synchronous digital circuits. It does this by constantly monitoring the grant to a specified configuration, undertakes a reset condition, and updates the rank configuration based on the request rank. On reset (rst), the rank config (rnk_config_ns) is initialized to all zeros. However, when a strobe signal is received (rnk_config_strobe), and if grant is given to the configuration (grant_config_r[i]), the new required rank configuration (req_rank_r) updates the rank configuration at the appropriate index, effectively achieving a conditional configuration update."
