This block is responsible for assigning specific bits of the 'final_data_offset' vector to 'final_do_cand'. Depending on the value of 'final_do_index', different ranges of bits from 'final_data_offset' are selected and assigned. For instance, if 'final_do_index' equals '000', the values from bit 5 down to 0 of 'final_data_offset' are selected. If 'final_do_index' equals '001', the values from bit 11 down to 6 are chosen, and for '010', values from bit 17 down to 12 are selected. In any other case, the 'final_do_cand' is assigned a value of 0.
