    "block_comment": "The block's function is to propagate the value of the registered 'run' signal (run_r) to the 'run' wire. This is achieved through the Verilog keyword \"assign\" which perpetually assigns the value on the right side ('run_r') to the left side ('run'), creating a continuous assignment. As a result, 'run' will always hold the same value as 'run_r' as long as the system is active."
