    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a counter decrementer. The block has a synchronous reset, triggered on the rising clock edge. When reset is enabled, or 'cmd_delay_start_r6' is not activated, or 'po_delay_cnt_r' equals zero, the 'po_delay_cnt_r' is set to the 'PO_INITIAL_DLY' minus 31. If 'po_en_stg2_f' is enabled with 'po_delay_cnt_r' greater than zero, the 'po_delay_cnt_r' will decrease by one. In both cases, a delay specified by 'TCQ' is applied."
