Comment: 
This block is a clocked functional block which initializes or updates two arrays `pi_dqs_found_all_bank[]` and `pi_dqs_found_any_bank[]` based on reset (rst) and `pi_dqs_found_start` inputs. On a positive clock edge, if rst is asserted, it goes into an initialization mode, setting all array positions to 0 for both of the arrays. Otherwise, when `pi_dqs_found_start` is asserted, the block updates each position of the arrays using bitwise 'OR' and 'AND' operation respectively, performed on the boolean variables `DATA_PRESENT` and `pi_dqs_found_lanes_int`.
