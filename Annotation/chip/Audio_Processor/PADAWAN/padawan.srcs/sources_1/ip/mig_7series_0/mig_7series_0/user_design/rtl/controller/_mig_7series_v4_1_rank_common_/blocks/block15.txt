The function of this block is to create a delay on the app_zq signal based on the rising edge of the clock (clk). The block achieves this through the use of an always block and a non-blocking assignment combined with a delay statement. Specifically, whenever there is a positive edge on the clock signal, the assignment to app_zq_r is made. The delay statement, denoted by #TCQ, introduces an intentional delay equivalent to the time cycle quantity (TCQ) before the assignment to app_zq_r is made, creating app_zq_ns signal. Therefore, the app_zq_r signal effectively becomes a delayed version of the input signal app_zq_ns.
