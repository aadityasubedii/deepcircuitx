    "block_comment": "This code block primarily carries out data lane remapping for a physical interface. Depending on the value of the bit width variable 'LANE_REMAP[1:0]', it remaps input data phy_din_remap[79:0] into different segments of phy_din. If 'PRESENT_DATA_A' is high, data is copied; otherwise, its respective segment is zeroed. This mechanism might be utilized in physical communication protocols where lane remapping is required for dynamic data routing."
