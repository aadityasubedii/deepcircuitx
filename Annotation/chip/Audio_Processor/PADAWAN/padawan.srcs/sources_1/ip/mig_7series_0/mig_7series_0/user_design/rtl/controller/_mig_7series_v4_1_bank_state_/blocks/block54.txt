This block of code is responsible for memory operation regulation in synchronous designs. Specifically, it leverages the rising edge of the clock signal (posedge clk) to define the timing of memory operations. The non-blocking less than '-=' operation indicates that the op_wait_r signal is scheduled for updating in the next simulation cycle to the value of op_wait_ns after a delay of #TCQ time unit, making the memory operation happen synchronously with the clock timing. This is a frequently used pattern in RTL synchronization design, particularly for handling latency in memory-intensive tasks.
