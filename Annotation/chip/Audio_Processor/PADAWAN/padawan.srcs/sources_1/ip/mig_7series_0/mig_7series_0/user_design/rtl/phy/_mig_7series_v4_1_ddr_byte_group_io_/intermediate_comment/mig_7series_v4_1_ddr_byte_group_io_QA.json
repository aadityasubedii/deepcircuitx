It handles data rate and data width parameters for the OSERDES(Data Output SERializer/DESerializer) and ISERDES (Data Input SERializer/DESerializer). The parameters control the basic configurations, such as the data rate (SDR/DDR), data width and the operation mode. It uses other primitives like IDELAYE2 for delay control and ODDR for output data rate. During synthesis or implementation, an array of these modules are instantiated to handle each data bit of the DDR memory data bus."
