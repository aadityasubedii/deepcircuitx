    "block_comment": "The block replicates D flip-flop circuit operation, storing and holding the state of the 'run_polarity_held_ns' variable at the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk'. The verilog implementation utilizes the \"always\" statement to continuously monitor the 'clk' edge, where the '#TCQ' introduces a delay mimicking the flop operation. At each positive edge of 'clk', the current state of 'run_polarity_held_ns' is captured and retained in 'run_polarity_held_r' until the next clock cycle."
