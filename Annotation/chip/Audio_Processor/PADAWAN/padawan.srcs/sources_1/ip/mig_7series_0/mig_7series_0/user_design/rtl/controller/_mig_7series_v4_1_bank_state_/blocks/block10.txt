Comment: 
This Verilog block comprises assertions for debugging and verification purposes in a memory controller context. It checks whether certain conditions are met under different states of the memory system. Specifically, it monitors the system for a 'wait' state while 'read/write' is allowed, under circumstances like queue not empty and data bus not busy, queue empty and data bus busy, as well as queue empty and data bus not busy with 'read/write' disallowed. It employs cover properties to track such occurrences at the positive edge of the clock signal without being reset.
