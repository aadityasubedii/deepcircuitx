    "block_comment": "The block of code handles the rotation process for write victim selection when FIXED_VICTIM is set to \"FALSE\". The generate-if construct is used in this block to conditionally activate the procedure. If FIXED_VICTIM is not set to \"FALSE\", the block referenced by \"wr_done_victim_rotate\" is not activated and does not take part in the hardware construction. The naming of the instance (\"wr_done_victim_rotate\") suggests that it is related to the completion of a write process and possibly involves an operation of rotating the victim selection for write operations."
