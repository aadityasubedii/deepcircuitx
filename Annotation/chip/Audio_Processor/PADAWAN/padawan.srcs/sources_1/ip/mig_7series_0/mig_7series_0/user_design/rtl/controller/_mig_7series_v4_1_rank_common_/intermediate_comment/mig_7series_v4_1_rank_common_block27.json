    "block_comment": "This line in Verilog is a simple assignment statement. It directs that the value of the `maint_srx_r_lcl` signal is continuously assigned to `maint_srx_r`. This means when the value of `maint_srx_r_lcl` changes, `maint_srx_r` will update immediately, maintaining an essential tie between these two signals. This continuous assignment could be useful when altering a signal's name for clarity or routing a signal to multiple parts of a design."
