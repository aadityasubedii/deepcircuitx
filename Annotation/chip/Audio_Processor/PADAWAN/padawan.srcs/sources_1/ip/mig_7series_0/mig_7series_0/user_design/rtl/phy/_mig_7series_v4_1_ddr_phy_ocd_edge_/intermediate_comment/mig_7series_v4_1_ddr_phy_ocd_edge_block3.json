    "block_comment": "This block defines the sequential logic of a flip-flop. On the rising edge of the clock signal (`posedge clk`), the value of `fuzz2oneeighty_ns` is asynchronously latched and stored in the register `fuzz2oneeighty_r` after a delay represented by `#TCQ` (Time Clock to Q). This code block ensures that `fuzz2oneeighty_r` synchronously updates with the current `fuzz2oneeighty_ns` after each passing clock signal considering the necessary delay."
