Comment: 
This block initiates the calibration process on the rising edge of the system clock. This is implemented by assigning the non-blocking delay `#TCQ` of the `oclkdelay_center_calib_start_ns` signal to `oclkdelay_center_calib_start_r` under the condition of a positive edge-triggered clock. This action will commence the center alignment calibration with a certain delay defined by `#TCQ`.
