Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is primarily responsible for displaying the current values of a set of clock parameters. These parameters are likely associated with a complex programmable logic device (PLLE2_ADV). Its function is implemented using the $display system task feature of Verilog, which prints simulation text messages to the console. The displayed parameters include factors that contribute to clock period and divide times - nCK_PER_CLK, CLK_PERIOD, CLKIN1_PERIOD, DIVCLK_DIVIDE, CLKFBOUT_MULT, VCO_PERIOD, and individual CLKOUT_DIVIDE & CLKOUT_PERIOD for up to 5 channels. The values of these parameters are formatted for readability, with the appropriate spacing and precision.
