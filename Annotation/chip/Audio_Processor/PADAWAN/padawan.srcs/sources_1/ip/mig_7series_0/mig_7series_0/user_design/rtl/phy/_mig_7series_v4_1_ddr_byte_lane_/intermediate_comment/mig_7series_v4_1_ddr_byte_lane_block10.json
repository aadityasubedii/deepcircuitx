    "block_comment": "The function of this block is to setup a counter that can be reset or updated depending on certain conditions. The block operates in a synchronous way, on the positive edge of the `phy_clk`. If the reset `rst` is high, the fourth stage of the pipeline `pi_counter_read_val_r4` is reset to '0'. Alternatively, if the values of the second and third stage of the pipeline, `pi_counter_read_val_r2` and `pi_counter_read_val_r3`, are equal, then 'pi_counter_read_val_r4' takes the value of 'pi_counter_read_val_r3'. This essentially makes 'pi_counter_read_val_r4' reflect the equality of the two pipeline stages, while still having the capability of being reset."
