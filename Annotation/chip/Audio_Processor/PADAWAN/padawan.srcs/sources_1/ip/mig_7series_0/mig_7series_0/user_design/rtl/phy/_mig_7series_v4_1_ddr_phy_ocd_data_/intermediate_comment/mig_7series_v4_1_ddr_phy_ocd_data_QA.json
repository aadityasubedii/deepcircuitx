It takes in the raw data from the DDR (data from memory input generator), as well as PRBS (Pseudo Random Binary Sequence) data, and uses a complex calibration algorithm to adjust the phase of the clock and data to assure optimal reading from the memory. The module contains several shift registers and compares the delayed versions of the data from the DDR and PRBS. It also handles special conditions where the first byte or last bytes should be ignored. The result of the calibration process is returned through the output \"match\"."
