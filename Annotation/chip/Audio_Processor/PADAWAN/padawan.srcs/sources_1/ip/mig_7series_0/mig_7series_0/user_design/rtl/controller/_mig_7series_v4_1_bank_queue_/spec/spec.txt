Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_bank_queue

Module Specification: The mig_7series_v4_1_bank_queue is a part of a memory controller for MiG (Memory interface Generator) in Xilinx FPGA designs, managing the queue operations associated with the bank machines. This module manages the flow of read and write requests to memory while handling idle signals, passing open bank requests, maintaining hit registers, handling auto precharge, managing the active request queue, and other auxiliary operations.

The module uses various input ports for its operation, including 'clk' (the clock signal), 'rst' (reset signal), 'accept_internal_r' (control signals for internal operations), 'use_addr' (address usage signal), 'periodic_rd_ack_r' (acknowledgement for periodic read), among others. The output ports include signals like 'head_r' and 'tail_r' (indicating the head and tail of the queue), 'idle_ns' and 'idle_r' (indicating idle state), 'pass_open_bank_ns' and 'pass_open_bank_r' (controlling the passing of open banks), amongst others. 

Internally, the module uses signals like 'idle_r_lcl' and 'head_r_lcl' (local signals to store idle state and head of operation queue), 'bm_ready' (indicating bank machine readiness), 'accept_this_bm' (indicating acceptance of an operation by the bank machine), 'idlers_below' and 'idlers_above' (tracking idle bank machines below or above respectively), among others for different functionalities. 

The module's code is divided into several sections, most of them dealing with managing different aspects of the queues operation. The module includes a variety of conditional and iterative control structures that enable it to manage all aspects of memory reads and writes, as well as other related operations based on a collection of internal signals and variables. Finally, the module ensures that the necessary responses can be prepared in other hardware components in response to this module's output.
