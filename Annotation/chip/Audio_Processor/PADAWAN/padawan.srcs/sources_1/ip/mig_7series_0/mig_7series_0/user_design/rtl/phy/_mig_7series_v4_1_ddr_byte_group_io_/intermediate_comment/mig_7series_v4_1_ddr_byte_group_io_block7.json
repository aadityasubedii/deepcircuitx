    "block_comment": "This portion of Verilog code zeroes out the lower 4 bits of an array element in the `iserdes_dout` array. It does this by taking an index `i`, multiplying it by 4 and then adding 3, 2, 1, and 0 to it in respective assignment statements. Thus, each of the calculated indices is set to 0 using an `assign` statement which statically defines combinational logic. Remember that the total value of the `i` should be interpreted based on the broader context of where this block of code is used."
