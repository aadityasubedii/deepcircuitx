The block of code manages an asynchronous delay between digital signals within a hardware system. Using a synchronous process, the block activates on every rising edge of the clock (clk) signal, and it sets the maint_prescaler_tick_r_lcl signal after a delay determined by the #TCQ maint_prescaler_tick_ns value – the latter being a preset time constant (TCQ – Time Constant Quantum).
