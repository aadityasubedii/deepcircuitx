Comment: 
This block of Verilog code implements a pipeline delay mechanism. On every positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`), the system successively shifts the `delay_done` signal to `delay_done_r1`, then `delay_done_r1` to `delay_done_r2`, and so on up to `delay_done_r3` to `delay_done_r4`, each time applying a delay of #TCQ time units. This essentially creates a 4-stage pipeline delay where the output (`delay_done_r4`) changes 4 clock cycles after the input (`delay_done`) changes.
