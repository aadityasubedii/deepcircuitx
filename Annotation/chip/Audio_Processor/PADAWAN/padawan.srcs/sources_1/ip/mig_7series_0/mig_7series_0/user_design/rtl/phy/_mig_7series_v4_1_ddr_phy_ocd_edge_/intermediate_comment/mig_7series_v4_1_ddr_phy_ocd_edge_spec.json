    "spec": "Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_ocd_edge. \n\nModule specification: The mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_ocd_edge module is a piece of the Memory Interface Generator (MIG) tailored for double data rate (DDR) physical interface operation, control, and debugging on Xilinx 7 series FPGA chips. It primarily serves as a signal scanner that manages signal transitions within different states: ZERO, FUZZ, and ONEEIGHTY (assumed to be phase shift of 180 degrees).\n\nThe inputs to this module include: `clk` which is the clock for synchronization; `samp_done`, `phy_rddata_en_2`, and `stg3` that are involved in sample read operations; `reset_scan` for resetting the scanning operation; `scanning_right` to determine scan direction; `samp_result` which holds the results of sample operations.\n\nOutputs from the module: `scan_right`, confirming the direction of scanning; `z2f`, `f2z`, `o2f`, `f2o`, enabling transitions or state changes from ZERO to FUZZ, FUZZ to ZERO, ONEEIGHTY to FUZZ, and FUZZ to ONEEIGHTY respectively. `zero2fuzz`, `fuzz2zero`, `oneeighty2fuzz`, `fuzz2oneeighty`, storing state transition results in a 6-bit format.\n\nInternally, the module uses various signals to control the planned state transitions and to store the preliminary outcomes. These include `samp_valid` which indicates when a valid sample data is ready, `prev_samp_valid_ns`, `prev_samp_valid_r`, `prev_samp_ns` and `prev_samp_r` for storing previous sample validity and result, `scan_right_ns`, `scan_right_r` to decide the direction of scanning in each state. For each state transition, corresponding signals like `z2f_ns`, `z2f_r`, `f2z_ns`, `f2z_r`, `o2f_ns`, `o2f_r`, `f2o_ns`, `f2o_r` are used to decide the triggering of the transition, while `zero2fuzz_ns`, `zero2fuzz_r`, `fuzz2zero_ns`, `fuzz2zero_r`,`oneeighty2fuzz_ns`, `oneeighty2fuzz_r`, `fuzz2oneeighty_ns`, `fuzz2oneeighty_r` maintain the 6-bit result of these transitions.\n\nThe code can be categorized into three primary blocks: Initial parameters and signal declaration, then various always blocks handling the control and timing for each state transition, and eventually a case statement that governs the internal signal control for different transition scenarios between the pre-defined states based on various input signals.",

The primary purpose of this module appears to manage signal scanning and data transition timing (fuzzing) through a range of states which includes ZERO, FUZZ, and ONEEIGHTY (180 degrees phase shift assumed from the names). This seems to involve adjusting these states based on sample results and the direction of the scan (scanning right or not). The transitions between states are also controlled by a delay parameter TCQ. It also shows functionality for resetting the scan operation. The control signals like z2f (zero-to-fuzz), f2z (fuzz-to-zero), o2f (oneeighty-to-fuzz), and f2o (fuzz-to-oneeighty) seem to manage the specification of the transition.\n\nPlease note this is an educated guess based on the given code and without knowing the full context and the specific logic of memory operation, it could be a part of a larger system performing a more complex operation."

It primarily serves as a signal scanner that manages signal transitions within different states: ZERO, FUZZ, and ONEEIGHTY (assumed to be phase shift of 180 degrees).\n\nThe inputs to this module include: `clk` which is the clock for synchronization; `samp_done`, `phy_rddata_en_2`, and `stg3` that are involved in sample read operations; `reset_scan` for resetting the scanning operation; `scanning_right` to determine scan direction; `samp_result` which holds the results of sample operations.\n\nOutputs from the module: `scan_right`, confirming the direction of scanning; `z2f`, `f2z`, `o2f`, `f2o`, enabling transitions or state changes from ZERO to FUZZ, FUZZ to ZERO, ONEEIGHTY to FUZZ, and FUZZ to ONEEIGHTY respectively. `zero2fuzz`, `fuzz2zero`, `oneeighty2fuzz`, `fuzz2oneeighty`, storing state transition results in a 6-bit format.\n\nInternally, the module uses various signals to control the planned state transitions and to store the preliminary outcomes. These include `samp_valid` which indicates when a valid sample data is ready, `prev_samp_valid_ns`, `prev_samp_valid_r`, `prev_samp_ns` and `prev_samp_r` for storing previous sample validity and result, `scan_right_ns`, `scan_right_r` to decide the direction of scanning in each state. For each state transition, corresponding signals like `z2f_ns`, `z2f_r`, `f2z_ns`, `f2z_r`, `o2f_ns`, `o2f_r`, `f2o_ns`, `f2o_r` are used to decide the triggering of the transition, while `zero2fuzz_ns`, `zero2fuzz_r`, `fuzz2zero_ns`, `fuzz2zero_r`,`oneeighty2fuzz_ns`, `oneeighty2fuzz_r`, `fuzz2oneeighty_ns`, `fuzz2oneeighty_r` maintain the 6-bit result of these transitions.\n\nThe code can be categorized into three primary blocks: Initial parameters and signal declaration, then various always blocks handling the control and timing for each state transition, and eventually a case statement that governs the internal signal control for different transition scenarios between the pre-defined states based on various input signals."
