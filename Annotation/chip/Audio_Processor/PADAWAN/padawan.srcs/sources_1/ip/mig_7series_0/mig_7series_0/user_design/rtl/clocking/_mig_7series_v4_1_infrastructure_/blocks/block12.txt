This block of code calculates a time difference. When there is a rising edge in the clock signal ('clk'), it calculates "pdiff" as the difference between the current simulation time ('$time()') and the stored time variable 'rising_mmcm_ps_clk'. Considering this is in an 'always' statement, this operation will be performed repeatedly for every positive edge in 'clk'.
