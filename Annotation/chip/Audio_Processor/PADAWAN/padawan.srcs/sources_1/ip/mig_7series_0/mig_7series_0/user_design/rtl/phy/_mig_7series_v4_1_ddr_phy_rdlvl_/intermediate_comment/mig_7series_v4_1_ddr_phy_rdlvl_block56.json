    "block_comment": "This block is used for pattern matching between input sequences and four predefined patterns on the rising and falling edges of a clock. This is accomplished by comparing sequences (sr_riseN_r and sr_fallN_r) against each pattern (pat1_riseN and pat1_fallN), with N from 0 to 3. If a match is found, the corresponding 'pat1_match' signal is set high. The '(pt_i % 4)' ensures that sequences are compared to the correct pattern section in case the pattern is cyclic."
