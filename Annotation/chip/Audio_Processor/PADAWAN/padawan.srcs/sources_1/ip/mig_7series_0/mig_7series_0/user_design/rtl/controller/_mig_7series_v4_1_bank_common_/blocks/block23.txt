Comment: 
This block of Verilog code essentially deals with priority indication. It is activated by a rising edge on the 'clk' signal and uses a high priority signal, 'hi_priority', to set the 'was_priority' flag. When 'hi_priority' is high, 'was_priority' is set to 1 using a delay specified by #TCQ. Otherwise, 'was_priority' is set to 0 using the same delay.
