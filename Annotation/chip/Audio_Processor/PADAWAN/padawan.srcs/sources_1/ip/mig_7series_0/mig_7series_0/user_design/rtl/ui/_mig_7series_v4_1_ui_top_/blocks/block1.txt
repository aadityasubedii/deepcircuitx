This block of code is used to zero out the upper bits of a write data buffer address. It functions by checking if the data buffer address width is greater than 4. If the condition is true, it assigns zeros to the address bits from index 4 to DATA_BUF_ADDR_WIDTH-1. This effectively retains only the lower 4 bits.
