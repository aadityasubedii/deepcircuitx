    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing the calibration process state in a digital circuit. Upon receiving a positive clock edge, it checks if a reset signal has been issued: if so, the calibration tap increment process is stopped by assigning a low logic level to 'calib_tap_inc_start'. However, if the machine is in state 'INIT_SKIP_CALIB_WAIT', it starts the calibration tap increment process by assigning 'calib_tap_inc_start' a high logic level. The changes take effect after the time delay defined by 'TCQ', a timing constraint often used in hardware description languages to depict setup or hold times for sequential circuits."
