This block of Verilog code has two functions. The primary function of this block is to control and manage conditions related to data overflow and underflow in FIFO for data and address lines. It determines whether the FIFO is empty or full and takes actions accordingly. It works by utilizing the condition check on the PO_DATA_CTL constant. If the PO_DATA_CTL  value is "FALSE", then the block assigns zero to all conditions (fifo empty, fifo full for data and address lines) indicating the absence of data. However, if the PO_DATA_CTL value is not "FALSE", it assigns corresponding flags to indicate FIFO states for data and address lines.
