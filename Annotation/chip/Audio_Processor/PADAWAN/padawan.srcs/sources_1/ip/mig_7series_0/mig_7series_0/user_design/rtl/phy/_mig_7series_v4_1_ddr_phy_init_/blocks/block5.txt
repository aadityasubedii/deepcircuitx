The double loop structure in this Verilog block dynamically generates clock dividers based on multiplexer (MUX) selection. The outer loop iterates over the number of clock cycles per clock period defined by nCK_PER_CLK. The inner loop iterates over the width of the memory bank defined by BANK_WIDTH. The implementation utilizes these two control variables, r and s, passed as inputs to generate multiple instances of circuit block that implements MUX selection and clock divider function.
