    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a phase-locked loop (PLL) operation in a clock and data recovery system. Executed at the rising edge of the physical clock (phy_clk), this block resets the fourth stage of phase interpolation (pi_phase_locked_r4) if the reset signal (rst) is high. If not, it checks whether the second and third stages of phase interpolation (pi_phase_locked_r2 and pi_phase_locked_r3) are equal, and if they are, pi_phase_locked_r4 is set to the same value as pi_phase_locked_r3. This synchronization process ensures accurate phase adjustment for the system."
