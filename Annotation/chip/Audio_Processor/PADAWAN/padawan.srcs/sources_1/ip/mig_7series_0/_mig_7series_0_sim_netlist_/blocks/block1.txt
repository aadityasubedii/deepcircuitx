Comment: 
This code block is a delay mechanism for the global test signal (GTS_int). It uses an initial construct to drive GTS_int high at the start, and then after a delay specified by TOC_WIDTH (Time Of Control Width), it drives GTS_int low. This delay mechanism can be used to align timing in test scenarios.
