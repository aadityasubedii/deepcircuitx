This block of code manages a buffer or FIFO queue state, where 'my_empty' represents the empty state of the queue. It functions on a clock (clk) signal, resetting on a reset (rst) signal by setting 'my_empty' to a default state. When reset isn't set, the block operates based on the full state of the buffer, the write enable signal, and the status of incoming data. If the buffer is not full, incoming data is being written and certain conditions are met, 'my_empty' state is updated accordingly. Similarly, if the buffer isn't full, there's no incoming data nor write enable signal, 'my_empty' mimics the equality between the next read pointer and the write pointer. It's split into two sections, each controlling a specific range of bits, optimising parallel processing.
