Comment: 
This line of code assigns a new 2-bit value, `oclk_count_w`, from the concatenation of a 2-bit zero value and the value stored in `oclkdelay_calib_cnt`. It's essentially appending two zeroes to the current `oclkdelay_calib_cnt` value, making it wider. The `assign` keyword in Verilog is used for continuous assignment statements, implying the right-hand side is always evaluated and assigned to the left-hand side. Hence, whenever `oclkdelay_calib_cnt` changes, `oclk_count_w` will be updated with the new value and 2 additional zeroes in higher-order bits.
