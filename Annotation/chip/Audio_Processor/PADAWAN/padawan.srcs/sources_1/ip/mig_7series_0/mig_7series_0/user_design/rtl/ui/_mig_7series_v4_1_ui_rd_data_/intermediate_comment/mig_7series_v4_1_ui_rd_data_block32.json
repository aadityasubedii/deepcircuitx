    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code is responsible for memory-writing operations. These operations are invoked on the rising edge of the system clock, signifying a synchronous design. The address for writing to the status RAM is updated at each clock cycle, with Time Constant Quantity (`#TCQ`) delay, to ensure data integrity and reliable writing. Additionally, a 2-bit wire `wr_status` is declared but its functionality or value isn't defined within this block."
