    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is primarily responsible for controlling a reference counter (`oclkdelay_ref_cnt`) associated with delay calibration based on a series of conditions. Whenever the system clock (`clk`) edges upwards, this block resets the reference counter (`oclkdelay_ref_cnt`) to a predefined `REFRESH_TIMER` time, if either a reset (`rst`) has happened, or if the initialization state (`init_state_r`) is indicated as \"INIT_REFRESH\", or if a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) read level flag (`prbs_rdlvl_done`), or when the last byte operation (`ocal_last_byte_done`) or a clock delay center calibration (`oclkdelay_center_calib_done`) is done. However, if the internal delay calibration flag (`oclkdelay_calib_start_int`) is set and the reference counter is greater than zero, the counter decreases by one. If it has reached zero, it is again set back to the `REFRESH_TIMER` value to start anew."
