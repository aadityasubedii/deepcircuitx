    "block_comment": "This block generates an IDELAYCTRL component if the parameter `GENERATE_IDELAYCTRL` is set to \"TRUE\". The IDELAYCTRL component, a digital delay line element, is used for fine phase adjustment of input signals, essential in high-speed digital design. The module interfaces with three signals: `.RDY` (output ready signal), `.REFCLK` (reference clock input), and `.RST` (reset input). The reference clock `idelayctrl_refclk` and reset `rst` signals are connected, while the output ready signal remains unconnected. The `generate` and `endgenerate` construct in Verilog allows conditional generation of this hardware based on the truthiness of `GENERATE_IDELAYCTRL`."
