This block assigns values to rank offsets for read data according to the highest bank number. If the high bank value is 3, all three read data offsets for each rank are assigned specific parts of `final_data_offset`. If the high bank value is 2, the last offsets are assigned zeros while the rest follow the same pattern. If the high bank value is neither 3 nor 2, only the first offset is assigned from `final_data_offset_mc`, the rest are given zero values. In each case, the procedure is looped according to the number of ranks.
