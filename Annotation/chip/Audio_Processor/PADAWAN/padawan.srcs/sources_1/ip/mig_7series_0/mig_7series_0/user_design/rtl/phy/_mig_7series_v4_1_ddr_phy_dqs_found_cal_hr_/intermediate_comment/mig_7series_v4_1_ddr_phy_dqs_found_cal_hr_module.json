    "module": "Module-level comment: This module performs DQS signal calibration for DDR memory interfaces. It detects DQS signals across banks and ranks, calculates read data offsets, and implements fine adjustment for optimal DQS detection. The module uses a state machine to control the calibration process, including initialization, detection, adjustment, and finalization stages. It handles multiple ranks and banks, performs retries on failures, and provides status signals for calibration progress and completion."
