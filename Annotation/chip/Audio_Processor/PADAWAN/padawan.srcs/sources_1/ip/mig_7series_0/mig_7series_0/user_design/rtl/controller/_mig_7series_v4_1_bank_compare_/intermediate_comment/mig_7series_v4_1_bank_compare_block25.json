    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for an assignment operation. It assigns the value of variable 'rd_wr_r_lcl' to 'rd_wr_r'. This line of code essentially reflects the current state of 'rd_wr_r_lcl' into 'rd_wr_r', ensuring both have the same state at the time of the assignment operation. This might be useful in case where 'rd_wr_r' is used in multiple processes, ensuring consistent value across different system components. The assignment operation is a combinational logic, meaning the value will update immediately based on the change of 'rd_wr_r_lcl'."
