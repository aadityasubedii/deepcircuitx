    "block_comment": "This block handles the status of the 'last_master_ns' signal in a master-slave architecture. The signal is assigned as per a three-condition pipeline. If 'rst' is high, it is set to a constant defined by 'ONE' bit-sliced for 'WIDTH'. If there's an update flag 'upd_last_master' high, 'last_master_ns' will acquire the status of the 'current_master'. If neither 'rst' is high nor 'upd_last_master' is high, 'last_master_ns' retains the status of the register 'last_master_r' from the previous clock cycle."
