Comment: 
This Verilog block primarily facilitates column request arbitration in the absence of a row request. The column request is determined by the 'rts_col' signal and a locally defined condition that depends on the 'rnk_config_kill_rts_col_lcl' for each bank machine. As there is no row request, both the 'block_grant_row' and 'block_grant_col' signals are set to 0, ensuring no grants for row or column requests are active. Hence, this block effectively prevents unnecessary blocking in absence of row requests.
