    "spec": "Module Name: mig_7series_v4_1_poc_tap_base\n\nModule Specification:\nThe module, mig_7series_v4_1_poc_tap_base, is a component of a memory interface generator (MIG) specifically designed for 7 series FPGA devices. This Verilog RTL code is primarily tasked with generating control signals and implementing complex logic for operations including phase-locked loop (PLL) control, counters, data sampling, and signal conditioning. The module also securely handles reset logic for system integrity during potential error scenarios.\n\nThe input ports include 'pd_out', 'clk', 'samples', 'samps_solid_thresh', 'psdone', 'rst', and 'poc_sample_pd'. These inputs variously enable operations such as the control of clock timing, sampling operations, phase shifting notifications, system resets, and phase detector sampling.\n\nThe output ports named like 'psincdec', 'psen', 'run', 'run_end', 'run_too_small', 'run_polarity', 'samp_cntr', 'samps_hi', 'samps_hi_held', 'tap', 'sm', 'samps_zero', 'samps_one' are used uniquely for controlling or monitoring the MIG operations.\n\nThe module uses several internal signals such as 'samp_wait_ns', 'samp_wait_r', 'pd_out_r', 'pd_out_sel', 'run_r', 'run_ns', 'samps_hi_ns', 'tap_ns', 'tap_r', 'samps_zero_ns', 'samps_zero_r', 'samps_one_ns', 'samps_one_r', 'samps_lo', and 'new_polarity'. These signals are used for complex operations like sampling, tap count advancing, and change in polarity identification.\n\nThe RTL code of the module can be divided into several blocks, where each block is defined for a specific type of operation. There are blocks designed to hold registers for internal signals, handle reset conditions, manage state machine states, provide necessary control signals, and perform calculations. It also includes a block for a custom function 'clogb2' to compute the logarithm base 2 of the input size and a case-sensitive block for state management. The design and operation of the module are notable for their ability to successfully perform complex tasks with precision and control.",

                    "text": "Module Name: mig_7series_v4_1_poc_tap_base\n\nModule Specification:\nThe module, mig_7series_v4_1_poc_tap_base, is a component of a memory interface generator (MIG) specifically designed for 7 series FPGA devices. This Verilog RTL code is primarily tasked with generating control signals and implementing complex logic for operations including phase-locked loop (PLL) control, counters, data sampling, and signal conditioning. The module also securely handles reset logic for system integrity during potential error scenarios.\n\nThe input ports include 'pd_out', 'clk', 'samples', 'samps_solid_thresh', 'psdone', 'rst', and 'poc_sample_pd'. These inputs variously enable operations such as the control of clock timing, sampling operations, phase shifting notifications, system resets, and phase detector sampling.\n\nThe output ports named like 'psincdec', 'psen', 'run', 'run_end', 'run_too_small', 'run_polarity', 'samp_cntr', 'samps_hi', 'samps_hi_held', 'tap', 'sm', 'samps_zero', 'samps_one' are used uniquely for controlling or monitoring the MIG operations.\n\nThe module uses several internal signals such as 'samp_wait_ns', 'samp_wait_r', 'pd_out_r', 'pd_out_sel', 'run_r', 'run_ns', 'samps_hi_ns', 'tap_ns', 'tap_r', 'samps_zero_ns', 'samps_zero_r', 'samps_one_ns', 'samps_one_r', 'samps_lo', and 'new_polarity'. These signals are used for complex operations like sampling, tap count advancing, and change in polarity identification.\n\nThe RTL code of the module can be divided into several blocks, where each block is defined for a specific type of operation. There are blocks designed to hold registers for internal signals, handle reset conditions, manage state machine states, provide necessary control signals, and perform calculations. It also includes a block for a custom function 'clogb2' to compute the logarithm base 2 of the input size and a case-sensitive block for state management. The design and operation of the module are notable for their ability to successfully perform complex tasks with precision and control."
