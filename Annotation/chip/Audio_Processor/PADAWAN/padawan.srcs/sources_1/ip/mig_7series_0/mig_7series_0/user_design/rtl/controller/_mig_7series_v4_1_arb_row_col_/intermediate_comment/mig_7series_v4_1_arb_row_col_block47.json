    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a shift register for 'rnk_config_strobe_r'. The shift register gets triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal - 'clk'. A noticed design delay, '#TCQ', has been applied to the stored value of 'rnk_config_strobe_r' from the previous clock cycle (indexed by '[i-1]'), before updating the current clock cycle's value (indexed by '[i]')."
