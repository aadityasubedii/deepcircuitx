Comment: 
This block of code generates a conditional construct that checks if the number of memory ranks, defined by the 'RANKS' parameter, is less than 2. If the condition is satisfied, it begins execution of a named block of code `one_rank`. The `generate` keyword in Verilog is used to create instances of modules and other Verilog constructs depending on certain conditions or parameters. The `if` construct here signifies that the block of code following it, named `one_rank`, will only be executed if the condition `RANKS < 2` is true.
