    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for synchronous updates of the 'stg3_init_val' register on every positive edge of the clock signal. If a reset 'rst' is triggered, the register 'stg3_init_val' gets updated with the value of 'oclkdelay_init_val' after a delay determined by '#TCQ'. If not in reset mode and calibration has been completed indicated by 'oclkdelay_calib_done', it fetches 'simp_stg3_final_sel' after '#TCQ' delay. If these conditions are not met, 'stg3_init_val' is updated again to 'oclkdelay_init_val' after delay '#TCQ'."
