    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for signal assignment. Specifically, it assigns a binary value of one (1'b1) to the signal 'psincdec'. In Verilog, the 'assign' keyword is used for continuous assignment statements, which means the assignment happens continuously as soon as the right-hand side value changes."
