Comment: 
The block of code ensures synchronization and reset functions in the digital system. It works on the rising edge of the system's clock and performs reset under certain conditions. If any condition among 'rst', 'pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1[0]', or 'fine_adjust' is true, the 'pi_rst_stg1_cal_r[0]' is set to 0 with a delay denoted by #TCQ. Alternatively, if there's a change in the 'pi_dqs_found_start' signal value or the 'pi_dqs_found_any_bank_r[0]' bit set while 'pi_dqs_found_all_bank[0]' bit is not set, or the 'rd_byte_data_offset' value exceeds a certain threshold, 'pi_rst_stg1_cal_r[0]' is set to 1 with a delay denoted by #TCQ.
