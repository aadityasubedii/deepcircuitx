    "module": "Module-level comment: The module 'mig_7series_v4_1_ecc_buf' manages read/write buffer operations of an ECC environment in a MIG design. Inputs include clock, reset, read/write data addresses/offsets, payload and write command. The output is the merged read data. Internally, address assignments are managed through 'buf_wr_addr' and 'buf_rd_addr_r'. Data is segmented into 'payload', and interfaces the generated RAM buffer via 'buf_out_data' and 'buf_in_data'. Functionality is realized through generate loops for data addressing and RAM buffer management, with final output assigned to 'rd_merge_data'."
