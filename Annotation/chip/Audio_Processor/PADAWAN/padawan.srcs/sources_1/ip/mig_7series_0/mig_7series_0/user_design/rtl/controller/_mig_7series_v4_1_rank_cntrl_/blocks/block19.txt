This block of code is implementing a synchronous latch for the 'inhbt_wr' signal. The latch is triggered by any change in the 'inhbt_wr_ns' signal. On each event trigger, the current state of 'inhbt_wr_ns' is asynchronously copied to 'inhbt_wr'. This method is a simple yet effective way to create a synchronization flip flop that ensures the 'inhbt_wr' signal only changes in accordance with 'inhbt_wr_ns' changes.
