Comment: 
This block is responsible for managing the Four Active Window (FAW) counter in a memory system, which contributes to tracking the number of row activations in a rolling window for efficient memory management. If a reset signal is received, the FAW counter is reset to zero. Otherwise, it copies the counter's current state and, depending on certain conditions, it may increment or decrement the counter. If a row is activated in the current state, the counter increments. If there is a delay in activation, it decrements the counter. An inhibit signal is generated if the FAW counter reaches 4 or the row-to-row delay inhibit signal is activated.
