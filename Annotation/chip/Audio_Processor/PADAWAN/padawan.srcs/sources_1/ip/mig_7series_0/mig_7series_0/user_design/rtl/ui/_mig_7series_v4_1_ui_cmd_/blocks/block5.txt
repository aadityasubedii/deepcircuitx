Comment: 
This block of code controls the readiness signal of the application layer. It uses a continuous assignment statement in Verilog, which means the output `app_rdy` is always driven by the value of `app_rdy_r`. The purpose of this code is to relay the signal from `app_rdy_r` indicating that the application layer is ready to `app_rdy`. Any change in the `app_rdy_r` will reflect on the `app_rdy`, enabling constant update of the application readiness status.
