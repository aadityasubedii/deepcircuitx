    "block_comment": "The Verilog code block is primarily responsible for assignment operations. It optimizes the process of assigning complex expressions using the 'assign' keyword. The given statement assigns 'cmd3' to a multi-bit concatenation involving 'ra3', some sections of 'mc_bank', 'mc_address', 'mc_ras_n', 'mc_cas_n', and 'mc_we_n'. The width of 'mc_bank' and 'mc_address' is determined by 'BANK_WIDTH' and 'ROW_WIDTH' respectively."
