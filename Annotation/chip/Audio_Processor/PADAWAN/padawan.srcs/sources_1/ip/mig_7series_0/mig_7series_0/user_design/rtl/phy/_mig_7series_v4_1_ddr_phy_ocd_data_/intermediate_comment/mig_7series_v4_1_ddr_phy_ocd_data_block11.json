    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a register update in synchronous digital design. At the rising edge (posedge) of the clock signal (clk), the register data_bytes_r1 gets updated. The '#TCQ' is a delay control that introduces a delay before the assignment, effectively representing the time taken by the register to get updated after the clock edge. This implementation ensures that data_bytes_r1 holds the intermediate state of data_bytes_r only after the specified delay has passed after a clock pulse, thereby assisting in synchronization within the design."
