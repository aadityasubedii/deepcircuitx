Comment: 
The provided block of code defines several local parameters and a wire related to the width and count for a RAM or buffer in a Verilog RTL design. The local parameters include WR_BUF_WIDTH, FULL_RAM_CNT, REMAINDER, RAM_CNT and RAM_WIDTH. WR_BUF_WIDTH calculates the total width of the data to be written into the buffer. FULL_RAM_CNT calculates the number of fully occupied RAMs, while RAM_CNT adjusts this count based on the left over width (REMAINDER). Finally, it declares a wire with width RAM_WIDTH to output written data from the buffer. This wire will be connected to the RAM write port in the larger design.
