Comment: 
This block of code handles the updating of a register value, specifically 'demanded_prior_r'. The update happens at the rising edge of the clock signal (posedge clk), hence the block is running synchronously with the system clock. The register value is set to 'demanded_prior_ns' with a delay equal to #TCQ. The delay is used to model the time it takes for the register to change state, ensuring accurate modelling of real-world digital systems.
