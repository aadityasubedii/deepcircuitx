Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_infrastructure. Module specification: This module is designed to generate and control various clocks and reset signals for a memory interface in Xilinx 7 series devices. It utilizes a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) and Mixed-Mode Clock Manager (MMCM) to generate multiple clock outputs with configurable frequencies and phases. The module takes inputs such as mmcm_clk (primary clock input), sys_rst (system reset), iodelay_ctrl_rdy (delay control ready signal), ref_dll_lock (DLL lock signal), psen (phase shift enable), and psincdec (phase shift increment/decrement). It produces outputs including clk (main clock), clk_div2 (half-frequency clock), various reset signals (rstdiv0, rst_div2, iddr_rst, rst_phaser
