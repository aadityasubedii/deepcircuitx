    "block_comment": "The block manages the read buffer index (rd_buf_indx_r) under certain conditions. It starts by assigning the current value of rd_buf_indx_r to the next state (rd_buf_indx_ns). If a reset signal (rst) is present, the index is reset to zero. Alternatively, if an update signal (upd_rd_buf_indx) is received, the value of the read buffer index in the next state is incremented by one. If the data buffer address width (DATA_BUF_ADDR_WIDTH) isn't 5, the single_data value is added to the index's value."
