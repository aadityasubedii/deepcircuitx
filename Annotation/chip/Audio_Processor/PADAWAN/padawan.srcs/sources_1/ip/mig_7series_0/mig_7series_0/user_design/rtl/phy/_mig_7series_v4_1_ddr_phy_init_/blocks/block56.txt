This block of code is used to manage the write data pattern counter in a physical layer data transfer scheme. The operations occur on the rising edge of the clock signal. If the write data enable signal 'phy_wrdata_en' is not set and the first read level pattern 'first_rdlvl_pat_r' is set, the write data pattern counter 'wrdata_pat_cnt' is reset to '00'. If the current counter value is '11', it rolls back to '10'. Else, the counter increments by 1 each clock cycle. The delay of '#TCQ' ensures sequential consistency.
