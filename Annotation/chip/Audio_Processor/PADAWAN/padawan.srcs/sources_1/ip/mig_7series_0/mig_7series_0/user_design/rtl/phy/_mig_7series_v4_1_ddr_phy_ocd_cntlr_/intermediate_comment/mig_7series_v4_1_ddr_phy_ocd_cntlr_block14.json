    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code serves as the declaration of three one-bit registers: phy_rddata_en_r1, phy_rddata_en_r2, and phy_rddata_en_r3. Reg is a Verilog keyword used to define a variable, but it's important to note that it doesn't actually create a physical register, the operation of these registers is determined later in the code. These register labels (phy_rddata_en_r1, phy_rddata_en_r2, phy_rddata_en_r3) seem to suggest that these registers are used to enable the reading of certain data from a physical layer interface in subsequent clock cycles, hence the suffixes `_r1`, `_r2`, and `_r3`. These are most likely implemented as pipeline registers in a data handling or processing section of a design.\n"
