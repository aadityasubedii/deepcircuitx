This block of code is essentially an idle counter update mechanism in a Verilog RTL system. Whenever there is a change in the local accept request, idle counter value, passing open bank flag, system reset event, or start pre-wait flag, this block of logic triggers to update the idle counter next state (`idle_cnt_ns`). It does this by subtracting the local accept request from the current idle counter value and adding the sum total of passing open bank signals if the system is not in reset state. Additionally, it also checks if there is an outstanding pre-wait condition and if present, that is also added to form the final value of the idle counter next state. If the system is in a reset condition, the idle counter next state is set to the total the number of bank machines (nBANK_MACHS).
