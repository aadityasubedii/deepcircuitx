    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the updating of `insert_maint_r1_lcl` signal. It operates on each rising edge of the clock signal `clk`. This implementation harnesses the #TCQ delay to set the value of `insert_maint_r1_lcl` equal to `insert_maint_r` after the defined clock period."
