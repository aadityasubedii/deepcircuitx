The block of code is a sequential circuit that controls the transitioning of data reading enable signal (`phy_rddata_en_r1`). This operation happens on the rising edge of the clock (`posedge clk`). The time required for the transition is defined by `#TCQ` variable, thus making it a delay flip flop circuit with a delay defined by `#TCQ`.
