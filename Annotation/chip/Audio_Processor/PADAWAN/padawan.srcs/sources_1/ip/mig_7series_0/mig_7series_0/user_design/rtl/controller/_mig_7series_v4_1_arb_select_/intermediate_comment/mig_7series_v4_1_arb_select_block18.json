    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is performing conditional assignment for memory control chip select signals in a DDR (Double Data Rate) context. If the system clock (number of clock cycles) per normal clock is 4, the code assigns two ranges of chip select signals: `mc_cs_n[3*CS_WIDTH*nCS_PER_RANK -1  :2*CS_WIDTH*nCS_PER_RANK ]` and `mc_cs_n[4*CS_WIDTH*nCS_PER_RANK -1  :3*CS_WIDTH*nCS_PER_RANK ]`, where the assignment includes bitwise shift operation with respect to certain rank addresses (`ra2` and `ra3`) and the enable signals (`cs_en2` and `cs_en3`). The operations ensure that chip select signals for the targeted ranks are correctly set to manipulate memory operations."
