    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for the strict mode data read operation in a hardware system. In this mode, it begins by assigning three important variables, `app_rd_data_valid_ns`, `single_data` and `rd_buf_full`, each with a default value of zero. This indicates no valid data read yet, no single data piece, and the read-buffer is not full. An address register `rd_data_buf_addr_r_lcl` is defined to keep track of the current data buffer's address. It then assigns a new address to the read data buffer, `rd_data_buf_addr_ns`. If system reset (`rst`) is enabled, it initializes the read data buffer's address to zero, else it increments the current address pointer by the value in `rd_accepted`, ensuring the buffer's address is updated after each accepted read."
