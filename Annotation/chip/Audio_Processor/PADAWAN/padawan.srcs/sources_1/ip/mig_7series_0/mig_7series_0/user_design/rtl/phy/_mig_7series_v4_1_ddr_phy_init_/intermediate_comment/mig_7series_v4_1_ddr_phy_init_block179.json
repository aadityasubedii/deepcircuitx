    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code describes a clocked process that controls the status of the `mask_lim_done` signal, making it act like a synchronous reset flip-flop. Upon receiving an active high clock signal, the block first checks two conditions: rst (reset) and prech_done_r3. If either condition is true, `mask_lim_done` is asynchronously reset to 0 after a delay of TCQ time units. This condition serves as the priority condition for the code block. Alternatively, if prech_pending_r is high, `mask_lim_done` is set high after a delay of TCQ time units; else, `mask_lim_done` maintains its prior state. In essence, this block controls a system's readiness state based on reset signals and task completion signals."
