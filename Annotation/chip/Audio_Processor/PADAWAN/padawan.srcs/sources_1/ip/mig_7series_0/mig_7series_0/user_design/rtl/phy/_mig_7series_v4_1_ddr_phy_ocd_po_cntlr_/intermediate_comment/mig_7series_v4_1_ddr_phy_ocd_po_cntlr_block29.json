    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assigning a value to the variable `stg2_final_ns`. Depending on three conditions, `stg2_final_ns` can be assigned with three different values: if the 9th bit of `stg2_target_r` is 1, `stg2_final_ns` will be 0; if `stg2_target_r` is greater than 63, `stg2_final_ns` will be 63; otherwise, `stg2_final_ns` will receive the value of the lower six bits of `stg2_target_r`. This conditional assignment operation is being realized using the ternary operator (`?:`), in a combinational circuit as indicated by the `always @(*)` block declaration."
