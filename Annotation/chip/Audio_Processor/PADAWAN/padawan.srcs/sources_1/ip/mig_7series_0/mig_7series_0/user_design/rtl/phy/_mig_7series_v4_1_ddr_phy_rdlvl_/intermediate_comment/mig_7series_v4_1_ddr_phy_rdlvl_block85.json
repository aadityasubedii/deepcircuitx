    "block_comment": "The block of code corresponds to the clock cycle updates of a counter named `regl_rank_cnt` in a memory controller. On a rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`), the block invokes conditions for resetting, holding or incrementing `regl_rank_cnt` based on reset signal (`rst`), 'done' conditions or calibration states. The counter is reset to '00' if the reset signal is high, 'done' counter is zero or memory pre-read leveling is done on a previous clock cycle and not done in the current cycle. On the other hand, if the controller is in the 'REGL_LOAD' calibration state, the digital quad-sampling signal counter equals to its width minus one, and 'done' counter is '1', `regl_rank_cnt` is incremented (provided it is not already maxed out per the available ranks) or held at the current count. Increment or holding of `regl_rank_cnt` is executed after a time delay represented by `TCQ`."
