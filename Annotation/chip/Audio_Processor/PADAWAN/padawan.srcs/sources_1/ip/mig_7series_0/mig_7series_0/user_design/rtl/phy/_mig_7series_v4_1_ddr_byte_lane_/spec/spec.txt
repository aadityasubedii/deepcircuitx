Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_byte_lane. Module specification: This module is a byte lane controller for a DDR (Double Data Rate) memory interface in a 7 Series FPGA. It manages data transfer between the FPGA and DDR memory for a single byte lane, handling tasks such as data serialization/deserialization, timing adjustments, and clock generation. The module features numerous input ports for control signals, clocks, and data, including rst, phy_clk, mem_dq_in, and phy_dout. Output ports include mem_dq_out, mem_dqs_out, and phy_din, providing data and status information. Internal signals like oserdes_dqs, iserdes_dout, and ififo_wr_enable are used for data management and timing control. The module is composed of several
