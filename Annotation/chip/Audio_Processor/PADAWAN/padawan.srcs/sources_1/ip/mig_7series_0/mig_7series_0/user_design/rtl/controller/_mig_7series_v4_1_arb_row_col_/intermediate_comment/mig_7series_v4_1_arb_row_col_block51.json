    "block_comment": "The block of code generates a 'rnk_config_strobe_ns' signal which initiates a configuration strobe for a rank. This is done by performing a logical AND operation on the inverted signal 'rnk_config_strobe_r[0]', the reduced OR of 'rtc' signals, and the inverted 'granted_col_ns'. When all of these conditions are satisfied, 'rnk_config_strobe_ns' becomes true, signaling the start of a new configuration cycle for a rank."
