This block of code is a flip-flop that updates the `reset_scan_r` signal on each positive edge (rising edge) of the `clk` signal. Implementation-wise, the block uses a non-blocking assignment (`<=`) to asynchronously set the `reset_scan_r` value which is equal to the `reset_scan_ns` after a delay equivalent to #TCQ (Time Control Queue). This ensures that changes in the `reset_scan_r` signal do not reflect immediately within the same simulation time-step, making this structure suitable for sequential logic design like flip-flops in Verilog.
