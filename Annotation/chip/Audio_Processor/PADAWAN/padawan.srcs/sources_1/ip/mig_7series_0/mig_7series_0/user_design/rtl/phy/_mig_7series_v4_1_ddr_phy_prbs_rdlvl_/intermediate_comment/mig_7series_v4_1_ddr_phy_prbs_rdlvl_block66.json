    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily responsible for the assignment of data from read operations and comparison operations in a memory system. It sections off parts of a wider data bus (`rd_data` and `compare_data`),and separates this data into individual components based on the rising and falling edges of a clock signal. Specifically, the read data and compare data are both split into multiple parts equal to the data quantity width (DQ_WIDTH) assigned to different variables. The latter four assignments then set additional comparison data values to hexadecimal zero ('h0), essentially clearing these specific data units."
