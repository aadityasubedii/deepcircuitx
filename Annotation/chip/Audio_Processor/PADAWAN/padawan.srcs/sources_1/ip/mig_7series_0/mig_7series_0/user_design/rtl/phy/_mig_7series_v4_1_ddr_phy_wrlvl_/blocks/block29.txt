This code block's function is to create a conditional generation of certain parts of the hardware design based on the value of the 'RANKS' parameter. The block checks if 'RANKS' is equal to '2'. If it does, a hardware block labelled 'dual_rank' is spawned. The 'generate if' construct in Verilog lets designs vary in a structural way based on parameters, allowing for a more flexible, scalable design. Here, the block is making the design adaptable for dual rank hardware modules.
