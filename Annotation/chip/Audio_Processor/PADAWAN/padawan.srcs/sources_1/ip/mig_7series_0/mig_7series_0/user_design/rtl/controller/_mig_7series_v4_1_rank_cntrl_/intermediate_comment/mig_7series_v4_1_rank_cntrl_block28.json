    "block_comment": "This block dynamically decides whether a specific rank needs to be written. It iterates over all bank machines, using the \"for\" loop. The boolean variable \"write_this_rank\" is initially set to 0. It is then updated based on the bitwise OR of its current value and the conjunction of \"sending_col[i]\" and \"wr_this_rank_r[(i*RANKS)+ID]\", for each bank machine. If \"sending_col[i]\" for a certain bank is true, and it's the current rank's turn to write (checked by \"wr_this_rank_r[(i*RANKS)+ID]\"), the \"write_this_rank\" is set to true."
