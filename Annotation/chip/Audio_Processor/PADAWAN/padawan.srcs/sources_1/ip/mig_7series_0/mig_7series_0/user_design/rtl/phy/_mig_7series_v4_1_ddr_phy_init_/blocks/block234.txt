Comment: 
The given block effectively administers reset functionality in a synchronous circuit. It is designed to primarily control the `mpr_end_if_reset` flag whenever a rising edge is detected on the `clk` clock signal. If a reset signal `rst` is high, the flag `mpr_end_if_reset` is asynchronously set to zero. If `rst` is not high, `mpr_end_if_reset` is determined by the condition `(mpr_last_byte_done && (num_refresh != 'd0))`. This suggests that if the last byte has been processed and number of refreshes are not zero, `mpr_end_if_reset` is set to 1. If these conditions are not met, `mpr_end_if_reset` is held at 0 after the delay specified by #TCQ.
