    "block_comment": "This block of code is defining three single-bit wires: B_mux_ctrl, C_mux_ctrl, and D_mux_ctrl in a Verilog design. The wires are used as control signals in this context, typically tasked with controlling the behavior of multiplexers (mux). A multiplexer uses its control input (in this case the defined wires) to choose between its data inputs and forward the selected one to its output. The specific behavior and role of these control wires would be defined elsewhere in the Verilog code."
