    "block_comment": "This block initializes a DDR PHY (Physical Layer) module handling the physical signaling of data and commands to the DRAM chips. When the condition `if ( BYTE_LANES_B1 != 0)` is met, it instantiates the module `mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_4lanes` with various configuration parameters, that set up aspects such as the data control, fine delay, clock speed grade, and command offset, among others. The configuration parameters allow for customization of this module for different use cases. The instantiated module is tied to local wires and signals, making it an integrated part of the overarching system. This block therefore plays a crucial role in managing low-level memory communication."
