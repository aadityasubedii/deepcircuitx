    "block_comment": "This block of code features a rank machine (rank_mach0) from the mig_7series module, which is designed for managing multi-rank DDR memory operations. It sets up parameters for memory configuration and provides a communication interface between memory and the system. The parameters include burst mode, cas latency (CL), command word latency (CWL), dram type, refresh rates, timings, and the number of ranks. In addition, it manages activities such as reading and writing data, initiating calibration, handling inhibition of activities (like reading, writing, or activating), maintenance requirements, periodic reading, and power state requests. It also incorporates timing signals like clock and reset."
