    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is essentially implementing a data merging functionality. It uses two nested loops to successively mix read and write data based on the write data mask. For each sampling point and each byte within the sample, if the corresponding bit in the write mask is active, the data from the read merge data stream is selected; otherwise, the write data stream is selected. Also, this block deals with the condition where the payload width is larger than the data width by simply assigning the remaining bits of the write data to the merged data without any condition."
