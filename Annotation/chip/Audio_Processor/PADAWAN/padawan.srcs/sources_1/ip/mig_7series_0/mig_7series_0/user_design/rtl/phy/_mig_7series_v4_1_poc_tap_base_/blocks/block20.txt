Comment: 
This block serves as a positive edge-triggered delay flip-flop. When the rising edge of the clock signal ('clk') is detected, the value of 'run_too_small_ns' is loaded into 'run_too_small_r' after the delay defined by #TCQ. This block thus facilitates synchronization within the digital logic design, ensuring 'run_too_small_r' gets updated at regular intervals governed by the clock signal and the delay propagation feature.
