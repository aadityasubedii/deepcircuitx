    "block_comment": "This block defines the state update of a memory controller during positive clock cycles. At each clock rising edge, it sequentially assigns next state values to the current state variables of the memory controller with a delay of #TCQ time units. The variables include address, bank, Command Strobe (CS), RAS, CAS, Write Enable (WE), ODT (On-Die Termination), CKE (Clock Enable), auxiliary output, command, data offset, CAS slot, write data enable, rank count for memory controller, and address, enable, and offset for write data. Each variable is updated based on its 'next state' counterpart (_ns), indicating the system's pipeline design."
