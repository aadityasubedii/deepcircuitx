    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for updating the output lane counter (`lane_cnt_po_r`). It uses a rising edge clock (`clk`) to control the timing of its operations. Upon receiving a reset (`rst`), the counter is set to zero. However, if reset is not activated and the second stage output enable (`po_en_stg2_f`) is active, and the delay count equals one (`po_delay_cnt_r == 6'd1`), then the counter is incremented by one. The delay of the increment operation is controlled by `#TCQ`."
