This block of code handles the address assignment to "col_wr_data_buf_addr" under specific conditions in a synchronous manner. When there's a rising edge detected on the clock signal 'clk', it assigns the 'col_wr_data_buf_addr_ns' value to the 'col_wr_data_buf_addr_r', considering a delay defined by time constant 'TCQ'. Additionally, 'col_wr_data_buf_addr_ns' is also continuously assigned to the 'col_wr_data_buf_addr' outside the always block.
