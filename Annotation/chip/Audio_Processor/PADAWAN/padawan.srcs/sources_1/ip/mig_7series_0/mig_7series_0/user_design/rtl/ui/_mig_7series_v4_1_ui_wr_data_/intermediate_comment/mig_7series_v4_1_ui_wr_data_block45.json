    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to update the 'wr_data_offset_r' only on the positive edge of the clock cycle. The implementation is achieved by using a non-blocking assignment ('<='), delaying the update until all right-hand side expressions have been evaluated according to the delay specified (#TCQ). This allows for synchronous updates and maintains data stability within the specific clock cycle."
