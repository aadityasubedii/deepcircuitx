Module-level comment: This module manages on-chip delay (OCD) limits for DDR PHY in 7series FPGA memory interfaces. It implements a finite state machine to control delay calibration, adjusting stage 2 and 3 taps based on MMCM measurements. The module processes input signals, transitions through various calibration states, and outputs control signals to other system components, ensuring proper delay alignment for reliable data transfer in DDR PHY operation.
