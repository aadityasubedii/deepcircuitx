    "block_comment": "This is a D flip-flop block that acts as an intermediary stage for pipeline operation. On each positive edge of the clock signal (clk), it asynchronously updates its output (po_stg23_sel_r) using the non-blocking assignment (<=). The value it takes is delayed by a time constant (TCQ), referred from po_stg23_sel_ns, ensuring a synchronism in the pipeline's operation."
