Comment: 
The provided Verilog block is designed to control a signal termed 'complex_victim_inc' based on reset & samples count conditions in a synchronous sequential logic context. This control is established via an 'always' block that synchronizes these changes with the positive edge of the system clock. If a reset is issued, it clears the 'complex_victim_inc' signal after a delay denoted by '#TCQ'. In the absence of a reset, if the 'samples_cnt_r' equals 'NUM_SAMPLES_CNT', it sets 'complex_victim_inc' to 1, indicating that the required number of samples has been reached. If neither condition is met, 'complex_victim_inc' is cleared.
