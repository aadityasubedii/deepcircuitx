    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for conditionally assigning the value of the 'left' signal. It accomplishes this by employing a ternary operator which assesses the boolean state of 'use_noise_window'. If 'use_noise_window' is true, 'left' takes on the value of 'rise_lead_left'; otherwise, it adopts the value of 'rise_trail_left'."
