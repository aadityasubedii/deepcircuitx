    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block handles the sequential assignment of the next state request rank to the current 'req_rank_r_lcl' register value. Working in sync with the rising edge of the 'clk' signal, it guarantees that the new value for 'req_rank_r_lcl' will be determined and set according to the variable 'req_rank_ns', with #TCQ representing a delay control operation to delay the assignment."
