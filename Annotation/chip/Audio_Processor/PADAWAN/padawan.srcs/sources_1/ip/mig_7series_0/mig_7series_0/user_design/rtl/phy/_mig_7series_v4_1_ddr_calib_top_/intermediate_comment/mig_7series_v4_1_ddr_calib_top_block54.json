    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code comprises conditional assignments for the 'wrcal_resume_w' and 'wrlvl_done_w' signals. Depending on the status of 'WRLVL', it switches between writing leveling on('ON') and off. When 'WRLVL' is 'ON', 'wrcal_resume_w' is assigned the value of 'wrcal_pat_resume', and 'wrlvl_done_w' takes on the value of 'wrlvl_done'. Otherwise('OFF'), 'wrcal_resume_w' is set to 0 and 'wrlvl_done_w' to 1. This unary bit assignment indicates a falling edge."
