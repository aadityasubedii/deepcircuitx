Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_mc_phy. Module specification: This module implements a DDR (Double Data Rate) memory controller PHY (Physical Layer) interface for 7 series FPGAs. It handles the physical layer communication between the memory controller and DDR memory devices, supporting multiple byte lanes and banks. The module has numerous input ports for control signals, clocks, and data, including rst, phy_clk, phy_ctl_wd, and phy_dout. Output ports include phy_din, mem_dq_out, mem_dqs_out, and various status signals. Internal signals are used for calibration, phaser control, and FIFO management. The module is highly configurable through parameters and consists of several sub-blocks, including ddr_phy_4lanes instances for each bank, PHASER_IN_
