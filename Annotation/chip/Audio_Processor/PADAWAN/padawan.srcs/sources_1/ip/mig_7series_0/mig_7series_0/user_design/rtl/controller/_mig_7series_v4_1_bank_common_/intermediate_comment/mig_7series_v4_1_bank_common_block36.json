    "block_comment": "The block of code recounts the busyness of read buffer hits. The implementation initiates a counter \"rb_hit_busy_cnt\" to zero. Next, it operates a loop from 0 to nBANK_MACHS-1. Each time the specific indexed \"rb_hit_busy_r\" holds true, increment the \"rb_hit_busy_cnt\" by one. Consequently, \"rb_hit_busy_cnt\" reflects the number of set/busy instances in array \"rb_hit_busy_r\"."
