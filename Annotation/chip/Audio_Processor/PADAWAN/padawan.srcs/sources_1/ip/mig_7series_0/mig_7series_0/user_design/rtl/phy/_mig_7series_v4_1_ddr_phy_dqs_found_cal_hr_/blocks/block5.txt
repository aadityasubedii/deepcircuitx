This block compares data representations and updates a maximum value accordingly. On a positive edge of the clock signal, if a reset is detected, it sets the final_do_max[i] to 0. If reset is not detected, it enters a case statement based on the value of final_do_index[i]. In each case, if any value in the data present slice is true and the current maximum is less than the comparison value, it checks whether the CWL_M value is odd or even. If even, it sets the final_do_max value as final_do_cand value subtracted by one. If odd it sets the final_do_max to the final_do_cand value as it is. If no conditions are met, it holds the initial final_do_max value.
