    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code uses a D-type flip-flop to latch an error signal (`pi_dqs_found_err`), which is based on a delay mechanism of the `pi_dqs_found_err_r` signal. The flip-flop is triggered by the positive edge of a clock signal (`clk`). Any change in `pi_dqs_found_err_r` value will not affect the output until the next positive clock edge due to the latch mechanism. The delay ('#TCQ') is likely a predefined constant time delay, to synchronize this particular signal operation with the overall system timing strategies."
