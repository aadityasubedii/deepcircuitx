    "block_comment": "This block of code is creating a write data mask for memory controller with all bits set to zero. Specifically, the right-hand side of the assignment uses a Verilog replication operator '{n{m}}' to repeat the bit '1'b0' a certain number of times, determined by the expression \"2*nCK_PER_CLK*DQ_WIDTH/8\". This replication effectively creates a binary bit mask, where all bits are set to '0', and the mask's length is equal to twice the product of the number of clock cycles per clock (nCK_PER_CLK) and the data quantum width (DQ_WIDTH), all divided by eight."
