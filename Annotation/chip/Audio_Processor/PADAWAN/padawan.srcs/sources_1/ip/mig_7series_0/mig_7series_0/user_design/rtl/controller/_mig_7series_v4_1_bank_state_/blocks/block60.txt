Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for assigning a boolean value to the `bank_wait_in_progress` signal based on certain conditions. It does this by using a logical OR combination of three different conditions: `sending_col_not_rmw_rd` being true, `rtp_timer_r` having any bit set to 1 (represented by the OR reduction `|rtp_timer_r`), or `pre_wait_r` being true and `ras_timer_zero_r` being false at the same time (represented by the AND operation `pre_wait_r && ~ras_timer_zero_r`). The result of this expression controls if a wait state in the memory bank operation is currently in progress.
