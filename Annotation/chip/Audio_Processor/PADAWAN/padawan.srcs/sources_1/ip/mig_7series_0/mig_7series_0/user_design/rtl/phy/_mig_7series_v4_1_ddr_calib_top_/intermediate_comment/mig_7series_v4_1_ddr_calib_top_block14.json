    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog code is the deactivation sequence for read leveling in a DDR PHY interface. When triggered, this block sets various status and control flags to indicate the completion of several DDR memory read leveling steps, clearing of previously asserted errors, and minimization of certain delay variables to their beginning states. It consists of a bunch of 'assign' statements which immediately and simultaneously assign values to the variables used in the run-time operation of the DDR memory interface. These actions help with synchronization, error management, and fine-tuning the timing parameters of the data read operations."
