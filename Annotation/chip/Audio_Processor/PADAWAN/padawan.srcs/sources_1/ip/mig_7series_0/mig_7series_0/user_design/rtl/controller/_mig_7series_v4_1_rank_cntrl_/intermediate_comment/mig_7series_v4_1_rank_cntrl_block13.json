    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog RTL is primarily designed for managing and controlling the refresh operations in a memory controller. It is done by checking conditions on different signals at the positive edge of the clock signal. In each clock cycle, the bank to be refreshed is selected, and it ensures that the refresh operation doesn't overflow or underflow by keeping the refresh bank value within the specified limit (nREFRESH_BANK). Various assertions and cover properties are defined to verify the correct functioning under all possible conditions, which are active during simulation when the macro MC_SVA is defined. Furthermore, a refresh request is issued based on several conditions, including when initialization and calibration are complete, when the refresh bank register is not full, and when the rank is not busy."
