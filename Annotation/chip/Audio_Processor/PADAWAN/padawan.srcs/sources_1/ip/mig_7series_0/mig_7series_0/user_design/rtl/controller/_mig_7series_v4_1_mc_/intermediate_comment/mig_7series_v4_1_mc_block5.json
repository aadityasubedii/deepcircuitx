    "block_comment": "This line of code is assigning the signal 'mc_wrdata_en_r' to the 'mc_wrdata_en_i' signal. It indicates that the input signal of write data enable for memory controller ('mc_wrdata_en_i') receives its value from the corresponding registered signal 'mc_wrdata_en_r'. This happens each time the right side signal changes, ensuring that changes in the 'mc_wrdata_en_r' signal are propagated to the 'mc_wrdata_en_i' signal instantly."
