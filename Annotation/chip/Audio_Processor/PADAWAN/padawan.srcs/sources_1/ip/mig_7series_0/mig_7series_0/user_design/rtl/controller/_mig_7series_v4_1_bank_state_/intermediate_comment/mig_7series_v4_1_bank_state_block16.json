    "block_comment": "This Verilog code operates as a 4-bit counter that uses a D flip-flop design. The circuit uses four D flip-flops arranged in a series chain in such a way that the output from one flip-flop is connected as the input to the next flip-flop. The operation of the system is controlled by a clock signal, and there's an enable signal that allows or disallows counting. The count increments at each positive edge of the clock given that the enable signal is high. Two more controls are provided for setting the count to zero (reset) or to maximum value (load). The connections are designed using generate loops to adhere to DRY principle and to reduce cognitive load while reading the code."
