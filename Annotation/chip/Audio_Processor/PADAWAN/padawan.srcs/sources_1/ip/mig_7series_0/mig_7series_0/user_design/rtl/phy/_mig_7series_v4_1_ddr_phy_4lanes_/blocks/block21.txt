Comment: 
The block of code handles condition-based assignment for data and control signals in a hardware design. If the `PRESENT_DATA_C` condition is true, it assigns various flags (like `C_of_data_full`, `C_of_ctl_full`, etc.) different values indicating data presence or control action. Contrarily, when `PRESENT_DATA_C` is false, it follows a different assignment strategy, mostly assigning 0 to the variable, indicating 'no data' or 'no action' states. This mechanism helps the hardware to understand when to receive or transmit data, or take a certain action based on the signal flags.
