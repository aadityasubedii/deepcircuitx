    "module": "Module-level comment: The module, mig_7series_v4_1_ui_cmd, pipelines memory access commands for 7 series FPGAs. It accepts inputs such as command type, size, priority, etc., and generates appropriate read/write acceptance signals and memory addresses using built-in logic. Internally, next state values are computed for pipelining, while flip-flops are used to hold command or flag states. Depending on memory order, addresses are assigned and read or write requests are accepted and processed. The output shows detailed memory location (rank, bank, row, column), priority of operation and acceptance status of read/write operations."
