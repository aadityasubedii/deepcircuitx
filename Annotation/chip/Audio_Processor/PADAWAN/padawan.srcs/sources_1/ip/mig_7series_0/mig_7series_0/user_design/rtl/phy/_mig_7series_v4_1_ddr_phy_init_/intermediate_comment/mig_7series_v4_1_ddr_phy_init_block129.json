    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for indicating an error when the phase-locked timer equals a predefined timeout value. It achieves this by using a conditional assignment statement (`assign`) in Verilog. The `pi_phase_locked_err` signal is set to logic 1 (`1'b1`) if the `pi_phaselock_timer` equals the `PHASELOCKED_TIMEOUT`. If not, it's set to logic 0 (`1'b0`)."
