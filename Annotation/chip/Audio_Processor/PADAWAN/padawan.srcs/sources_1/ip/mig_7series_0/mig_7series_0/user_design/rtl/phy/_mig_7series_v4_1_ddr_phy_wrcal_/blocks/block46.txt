The given Verilog RTL code block is responsible for generating a multiplexer read operation when 'nCK_PER_CLK' equals 2. The process is implemented through a loop that cycles for the entire width of DRAM. Within this loop, the mux_i (mux index) variable helps in keeping track of the current position during the loop iteration. The increment is of one step at a time. This mechanism allows the block to read from specific DRAM locations depending on the current index value, thereby handling read operations when working under a double clock cycle condition.
