    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog implements a clock divider function and a shift register with a length of 1 when specific conditions are met. In the case where nCK_PER_CLK equals 2, a clock divider by 2 is instantiated in the 'gen_sr_div2' block. Moreover, if RD_SHIFT_LEN is equal to 1, a shift register module with unit length is activated within the 'gen_sr_len_eq1' block. The function also incorporates a loop that operates over the width of the DRAM to generate a corresponding shift register for each bit in the 'gen_sr' loop, looping from 0 and incrementing by 1 each time."
