    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing the operations of the `po_wait_ns` signal. At each change in the inputs, the state of `po_wait_ns` is updated according to several conditions. The default state is `po_wait_r`. If `rst` signal is high, `po_wait_ns` is reset to zero. However, if `po_en_stg23_r` is high, `po_wait_ns` is decremented by one (assuming that `PO_WAIT` is greater than `ONE`). Finally, if `po_wait_r` is not zero `po_wait_ns` decrements itself by one."
