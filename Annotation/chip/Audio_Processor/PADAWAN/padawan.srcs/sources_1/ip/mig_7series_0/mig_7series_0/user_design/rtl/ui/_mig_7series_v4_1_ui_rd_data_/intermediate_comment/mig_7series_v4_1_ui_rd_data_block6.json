    "block_comment": "This block of code essentially manages a read buffer's occupancy count and checks for buffer overflows or underflows. On every positive edge of the clock signal, the occupancy count gets updated to its new state, denoted by 'occ_cnt_ns'. A read buffer full signal is generated by checking the bit at 'DATA_BUF_ADDR_WIDTH'th index of the occupancy count. In the presence of Model Checking assertions check, the code also includes properties to flag overflow or underflows in the read buffer. It checks for full buffer and an underflow or overflow situation, which could happen if occupancy count drops to '0' or goes beyond 'h10' respectively, on the positive edge of the clock. The checks are bypassed when reset signal is active, ensuring stable system operation at initial power up or during a reset operation."
