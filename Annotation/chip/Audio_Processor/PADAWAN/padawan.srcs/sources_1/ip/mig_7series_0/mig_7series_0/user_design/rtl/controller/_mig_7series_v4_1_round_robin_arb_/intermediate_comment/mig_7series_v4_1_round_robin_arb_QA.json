In this, `WIDTH` number of requestors will submit requests (`req`). The arbitration scheme guarantees that every request gets served by the round-robin fashion. The output of the module is a grant signal (`grant_ns, grant_r`) which indicates which request is currently being served. This grant can also be disabled using the `disable_grant` signal input. The `current_master` signal indicate who was served last time and the signal `last_master_ns` looks at the last request served to decide the next request to serve ensuring the round-robin manner. The requesters (`req`) are served in a fair round-robin order according to the `WIDTH`."

It is an array with width defined by parameter WIDTH.\n4. disable_grant: This signal is for disabling the grant signal. When this signal is high, the grant signal will not be asserted even if there is a request.\n5. current_master: This signal holds the index of the master currently being served.\n6. upd_last_master: This is a boolean signal to update the 'last master served\u2019 record.\n\nOutput ports: \n1. grant_ns: This is a next state grant signal of the requesting masters.

It represents the served request.\n3. last_master_ns: This is a signal representing the next state 'last served master'. It serves as an intermediate signal for updating the last served master.\n\nExplanation: The inputs consist of signals that the module observes to carry out its operation i.e these are the control and data signals which come into the module.

Its main role is to help in the calculation of the inhibit signal which in turn determines the generation of grant signals.\n\n2. dbl_req: This signal is obtained by doubling/concatenating the request signal (req).

The calculation of this signal considers the sequence of requests made and the mastering sequence to decide the next master in line in a fair manner considering the round-robin scheme.\n\n4. inh_group: This is a wire array signal used to calculate individual bits of the inhibit signal inside the generated loop. This wire is derived from a combination of the request signals (dbl_req) and last master signals(db_last_master_ns).\n\n5. last_master_r: This is a registered signal which holds the value of the last_master_r. Its value changes at the edge of clock signal with a delay defined by the TCQ parameter.
