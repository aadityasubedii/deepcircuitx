Module-level comment: The module "mig_7series_v4_1_rank_common" is designed for memory interface operations, notably for refresh handling, ZQ calibration, and self-refresh entry/exit tasks mainly for DDR3 memory on 7 Series FPGAs. Features include a periodic memory read request to keep content fresh. Functionalities are achieved through operations on specific internal signals managed by dedicated code blocks. Notably, 'maint_prescaler' controls the maintenance prescaler, 'zq_cntrl' and 'sr_cntrl' manage ZQ calibration and self-refresh respectively, while 'periodic_read_request' handles periodic memory read operations.
