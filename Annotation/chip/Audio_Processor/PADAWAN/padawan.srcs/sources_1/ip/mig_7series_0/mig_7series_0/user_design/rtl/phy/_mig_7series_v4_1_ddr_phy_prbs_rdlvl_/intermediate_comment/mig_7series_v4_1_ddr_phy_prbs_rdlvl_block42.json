    "block_comment": "This block synchronously resets or updates the `prbs_rdlvl_prech_req` variable. On the positive edge of the clock signal, if a reset signal (`rst`) is active, the `prbs_rdlvl_prech_req` is assigned to 0 with a delay of `TCQ` time units. Otherwise, it is assigned the value of `prbs_prech_req_r` with the same `TCQ` delay."
