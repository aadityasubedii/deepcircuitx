Comment: 
The block regulates the 'inhibit_edge_detect_r' signal based on various conditions. The signal is set to high whenever a reset event occurs or condition associated with 'mpr_rd_rise' and 'mpr_rd_fall' flags are met. When the state matches 'CAL1_MPR_PAT_DETECT' and associated conditions linked with idelay taps and 'mpr_rd_rise' and 'mpr_rd_fall' flags, the 'inhibit_edge_detect_r' signal is set to low. This logic is implemented using flip-flop that triggers on every positive edge of the clock signal.
