This block represents a 4 by 4 memory module. This module's primary purpose is to store and retrieve data. The memory module comprises 16 single bit registers (RAM) in a 4X4 arrangement. The memory instantiation within the generate loop allows for dynamic instantiation of the memory cells dependent on the provided address, with the loop variable i serving as the specific indices for the addressed cell. Read and write operations are conducted based on the input write enabling (wen) signal. If wen is high, the data will be written to the specified address, whereas if it is low, the data will be read from the specified address. This is achieved by employing if-else conditionals.
