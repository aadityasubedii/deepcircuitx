    "block_comment": "This block initializes the `read_calib` signal in response to the rising edge of `clk`. When the system is reset (`rst`) or `pi_calib_done_r1` is high, `read_calib` is set low, otherwise, if `pi_calib_done_r1` is low and `init_state_r` matches `INIT_PI_PHASELOCK_READS`, `read_calib` is set high with `TCQ` delay. The block utilizes positive edge clocking and multilevel conditions to manage the state of the `read_calib` signal based on system status and calibration states."
