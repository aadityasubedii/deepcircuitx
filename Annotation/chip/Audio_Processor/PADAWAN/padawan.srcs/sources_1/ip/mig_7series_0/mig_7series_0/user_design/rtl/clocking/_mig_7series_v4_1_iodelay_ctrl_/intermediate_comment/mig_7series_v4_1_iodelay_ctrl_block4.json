    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a sync circuit for reset signals. It responds to a referenced clock signal (`clk_ref[1]`) or a reset delay signal (`rst_tmp_idelay`). If `rst_tmp_idelay` is triggered, the second bit of the reset sync register (`rst_ref_sync_r[1]`) is assign with delayed reset value. Otherwise, the same register bit is left-shifted. The output reset signal (`rst_ref[1]`) is assigned as the last bit of the `rst_ref_sync_r[1]` register array. This implementation makes use of Verilog's non-blocking assignments and bit-wise shifts for clock-driven synchronization of reset signals."
