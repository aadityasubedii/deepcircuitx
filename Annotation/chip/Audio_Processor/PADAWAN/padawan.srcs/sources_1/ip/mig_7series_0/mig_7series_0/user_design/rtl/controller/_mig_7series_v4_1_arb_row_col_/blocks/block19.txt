Comment: 
This block of Verilog code primarily orchestrates the updating of command send columns based on certain local variables. When either 'sent_col_lcl' or 'sent_col_lcl_r' changes state, the 'always' block gets triggered. Consequently, the values of 'sent_col_lcl_r' and 'sent_col_lcl' get assigned to 'send_cmd0_col' and 'send_cmd1_col' respectively. This ensures a synchronization between the command send columns and their corresponding local variables.
