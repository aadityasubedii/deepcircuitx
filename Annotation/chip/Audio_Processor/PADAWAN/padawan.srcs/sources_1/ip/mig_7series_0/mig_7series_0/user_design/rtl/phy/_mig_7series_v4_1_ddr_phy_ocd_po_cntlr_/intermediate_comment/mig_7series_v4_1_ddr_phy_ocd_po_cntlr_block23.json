    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a sequential logic that updates on the positive edge of the clock. On each positive edge of the clock cycle, the previously computed next state (`ocd_ktap_right_ns`) is latched into the current state register (`ocd_ktap_right_r`) according to the timing control statement `#TCQ`, providing a mechanism to synchronize the state updates."
