The provided block is designed to update the value of the register 'oclkdelay_calib_done_r' on every rising edge of 'clk'. This is done by implementing a non-blocking assignment in an always@ block that triggers on the positive edge of the clk signal. The assigned value 'oclkdelay_calib_done_ns' is delayed by a time constant '#TCQ', ensuring there is a delay equivalent to propagation delay before updating 'oclkdelay_calib_done_r'.
