    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a counter 'tap_inc_wait_cnt' that increments conditionally during multiple calibration states. When a rising clock edge is detected, the counter is reset to zero if 'rst' is high. Otherwise, it increments by one if the 'cal2_state_r' is either in the 'CAL2_DQ_IDEL_DEC', 'CAL2_IFIFO_RESET', or 'CAL2_SANITY_WAIT' states. If the 'cal2_state_r' is in any other state, the counter 'tap_inc_wait_cnt' resets to zero."
