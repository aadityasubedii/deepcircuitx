    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code performs DDR PHY Write Levelling and command delay handling. When Write Levelling (WRLVL) feature is turned on and calibration is required, two modules mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_wrlvl and mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_ck_addr_cmd_delay are instantiated. The first module handles the write levelling while the latter manages the command delay. If calibration is not requested, only the command delay module is instantiated and all relevant signals are set to their default values. In the case where Write Levelling is turned off, another module mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_wrlvl_off_delay is instantiated to handle the delay associated with the off state. This module also sets signal values to their defaults. The design uses this structure to handle different states of the Write Levelling feature, hence enhancing performance and flexibility."
