    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block manages the status of a FIFO queue for column reads. It checks if the head pointer \"head_r\" of the queue is the same as the tail pointer \"tail_r\", which indicates that the queue is empty. If so, it assigns the \"col_read_fifo_empty\" signal a binary value of 1, otherwise it assigns a binary value of 0, indicating that the queue is not empty. This comparison operation and assignment are performed in parallel on each clock cycle."
