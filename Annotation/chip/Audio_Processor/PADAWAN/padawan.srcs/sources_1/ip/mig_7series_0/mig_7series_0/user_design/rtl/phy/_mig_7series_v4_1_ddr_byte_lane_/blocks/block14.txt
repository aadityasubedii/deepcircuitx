This block is used for phase-locked loop (PLL) control with a clock division option. It utilizes feature-labeled registers to implement the PLL functions: tracking phase lock status, DQS (data strobe) signal availability, and monitoring a 6-bit PI (Phase Interpolator) counter value. For each function, it uses a four-stage pipelined architecture with the first three stages labeled asynchronous, ensuring data coherence across different clock domains.
