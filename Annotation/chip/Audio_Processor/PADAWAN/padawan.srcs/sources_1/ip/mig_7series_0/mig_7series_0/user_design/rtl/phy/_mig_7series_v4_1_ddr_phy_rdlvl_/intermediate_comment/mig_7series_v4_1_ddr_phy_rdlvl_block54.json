    "block_comment": "This block is designed to update certain state variables on the rising edge of a clock signal that indicate the status of various match conditions for a pattern. The operation is implemented using bitwise AND operations and delay constructs (#TCQ) in an always block to ensure these updates are performed synchronously with the clock signal. The final operation `idel_pat1_data_match_r` checks if all match conditions have been met and updates accordingly."
