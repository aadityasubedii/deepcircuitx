Comment: 
This block of code implements a flip-flop that samples and holds the state of the signal `two_ns` at the rising edge of the clock signal `clk`. The holding period is defined by the clock-to-q delay (`#TCQ`). This structure ensures that the value of `two_ns` is captured and held steady during the high phase of the clock signal, providing synchronization for downstream logic.
