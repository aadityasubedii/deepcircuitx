    "block_comment": "The block of code is a sequential logic block that works with synchronous protocols, responding to a rising edge clock event (Function of the block). This is implemented using always @ syntax at a positive edge of clock signal (clk), and captures and assigns new values to pi_stg2_load and pi_stg2_reg_l on each clock cycle with a delay defined by TCQ. The use of non-blocking assignments ensures that all assignments happen concurrently, as would happen in an actual hardware (Implementation details of the block)."
