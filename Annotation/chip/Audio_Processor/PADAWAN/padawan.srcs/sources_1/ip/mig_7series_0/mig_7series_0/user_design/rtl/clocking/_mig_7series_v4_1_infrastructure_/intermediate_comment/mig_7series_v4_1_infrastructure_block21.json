    "block_comment": "This block represents a Verilog delay flip-flop that detects the rising edge of the 'mmcm_ps_clk' signal. Upon the positive edge of the 'mmcm_ps_clk' clock signal, the 'first_rising_ps_clk_r' is assigned the value of 'first_rising_ps_clk_ns' after a delay specified by the time constant 'TCQ'. This block is crucial for synchronizing signals or control logic that are dependent on the 'mmcm_ps_clk' clock signal."
