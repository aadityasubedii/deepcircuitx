    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a conditional structure in generate-construct of Verilog RTL design. Based on the value of 'DATA_BUF_ADDR_WIDTH', if it is greater than or equal to 4, the following code segment under the label 'ge_4_addr_bits' will get synthesised in the hardware layout. The 'generate' keyword initiates the parametric definition construct which conditionalizes or loops the hardware instantiation based on compile-time constants. In this specific context, different hardware layout will be created depending on the DATA_BUF_ADDR_WIDTH value."
