The block of code assigns the next state (`grant_col_wr_ns`) of the `grant_col_wr` variable. This is an instance of optimistic copying in action, where the current state of `grant_col_wr` is fast-forwarded to the next known state for immediate use in the system, essentially achieving non-blocking assignment. This direct assignment is achieved through the `assign` keyword which provides continuous assignment in Verilog. This approach saves time by eliminating the need for waiting until the end of the current iteration.
