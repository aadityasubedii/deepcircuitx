    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling the application read data end signal (`app_rd_data_end`). The signal change is triggered by a positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`). Its new value is determined by the `rd_data_end` signal but with a delay specified by `#TCQ`, which is a parametric delay potentially representative of the time clock quality."
