    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value of the local register 'ordered_r_lcl' to the register 'ordered_r'. The keyword 'assign' is used to implement continuous assignment in Verilog, thus whenever there is a change in the value of 'ordered_r_lcl', the same is instantly reflected in 'ordered_r'. This is a technique commonly used for real-time synchronization in digital circuitry."
