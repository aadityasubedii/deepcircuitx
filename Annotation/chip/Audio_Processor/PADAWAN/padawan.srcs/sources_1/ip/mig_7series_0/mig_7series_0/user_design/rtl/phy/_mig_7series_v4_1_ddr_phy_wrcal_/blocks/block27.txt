Comment: 
The block of code defines a pattern division function for the case when there are two clock cycles per clock signal (`nCK_PER_CLK == 2`). The block contains sequential sets of 'assign' statements which assign specific rising and falling values for patterns and early signal categories consecutively. Detailed pattern assignments are provided for four bits per category, i.e., pat1, pat2, early1, and early2, and this pattern alternates after every two clock cycles within this block. This block implements division by 2 of clock signal by defining and using two different patterns pat1 and pat2 and specifying their rising and falling behaviour. The process is repeated for the early signals early1 and early2. This is performed bit by bit from bit 3 to 0.
