    "block_comment": "This block handles a specific memory operation inhibition condition. It checks whether a refresh operation can be started on the given memory rank. The code initiates by setting the inhibition flag 'inhbt_act_rrd' to 0, indicating no inhibition initially. It then performs a loop over all available bank machines, starting from the current ID. Within this loop, it checks if the incoming start refresh command ('start_rcd_in') is active for the specific bank and matches the requested rank with the incoming requested rank. If true, it sets the inhibition flag 'inhbt_act_rrd'. Thus if a refresh operation is demanded on a rank where an operation is already pending, it sets an inhibition, preventing potential conflicts."
