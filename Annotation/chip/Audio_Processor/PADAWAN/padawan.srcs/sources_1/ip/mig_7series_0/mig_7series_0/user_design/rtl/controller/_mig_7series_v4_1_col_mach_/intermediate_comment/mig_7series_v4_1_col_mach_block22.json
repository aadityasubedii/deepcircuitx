    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a bit-level operation on the `col_a` vector and assigns the result to `col_a_full`. What it does is mapping the 11th bit and first 10 bits of `col_a` to form an 11-bit word for `col_a_full`. The implementation involves Verilog's vector part-select and concatenation operations for bit-level manipulation."
