    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a specific value to a subset of the pi_dqs_found_lanes bus, precisely the four lanes from index 4 up to (and including) an index given by the constant HIGHEST_LANE_B1 plus 4 minus 1. The assigned value is a 4-bit binary number, specifically 4'b1111, which means all four considered lanes are set to '1'. This operation could be typically used to flag the active or valid lanes in a, say multi-lane data processing system."
