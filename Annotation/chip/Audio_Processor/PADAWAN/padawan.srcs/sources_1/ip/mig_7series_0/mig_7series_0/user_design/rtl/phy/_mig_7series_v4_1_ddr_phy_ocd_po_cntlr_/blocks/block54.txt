Comment: 
This block of code functions as an edge-triggered register. It stores the value of the non-blocking assignment of 'cmplx_samples_done_ns' to 'cmplx_samples_done_r' at the rising edge of the 'clk' signal. The '#TCQ' indicates the propagation delay from the 'cmplx_samples_done_ns' input to the 'cmplx_samples_done_r' output. The register will maintain the previous value unless a rising edge of the 'clk' signal is detected, which is when it updates with the new value after the delay specified by 'TCQ'.
