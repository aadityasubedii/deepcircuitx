    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a flip-flop with asynchronous reset functionality. The function of the block is to update the `q_entry_r` register. With the positive edge of the `clk` signal, if the `rst` is set, the code block sets `q_entry_r` to hold the value of `ID[BM_CNT_WIDTH-1:0]` after a delay defined by `#TCQ`. If the `rst` is not set, `q_entry_r` takes the value of `q_entry_ns` after the same delay. The delay simulates the inherent delay of hardware circuits. The '#TCQ' implies a delay built into the process to account for transport/connection delays."
