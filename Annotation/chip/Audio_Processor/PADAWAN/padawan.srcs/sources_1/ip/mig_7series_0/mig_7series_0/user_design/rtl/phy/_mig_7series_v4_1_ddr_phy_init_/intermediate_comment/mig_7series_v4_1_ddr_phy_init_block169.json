    "block_comment": "This block of code is a counter, which is part of a timing generator or phase-locked loop logic within a digital system. Essentially, it increments a timer 'tg_timer' during each positive edge of a clock cycle if certain conditions are met. The timer is reset to zero if a reset signal is received, 'temp_wrcal_done' changes from high to low or the state of the machine is 'INIT_PRECHARGE_PREWAIT'. Otherwise, if the phase-locked timer reaches timeout, 'tg_timer_go' goes high and 'tg_timer' has not reached its timeout value, 'tg_timer' is incremented by one on each clock cycle."
