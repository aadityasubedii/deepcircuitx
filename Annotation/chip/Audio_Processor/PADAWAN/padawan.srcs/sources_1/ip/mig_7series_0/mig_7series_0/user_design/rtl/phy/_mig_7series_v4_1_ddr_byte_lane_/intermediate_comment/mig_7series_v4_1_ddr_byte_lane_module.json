    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a byte lane controller for DDR memory interfaces in 7 Series FPGAs. It manages data transfer between FPGA and DDR memory, handling serialization/deserialization, timing adjustments, and clock generation. The module uses PHASER_IN/OUT, ISERDES/OSERDES, and FIFOs to process data, control timing, and manage I/O. It supports various configuration options for different memory types and speeds, integrating PHY-level control with memory-specific operations."
