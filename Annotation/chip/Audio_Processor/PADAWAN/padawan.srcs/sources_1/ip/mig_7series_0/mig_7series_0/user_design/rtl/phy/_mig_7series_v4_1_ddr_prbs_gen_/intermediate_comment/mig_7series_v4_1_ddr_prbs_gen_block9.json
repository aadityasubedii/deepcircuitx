    "block_comment": "The always block responds to the positive edge of the clock signal, `clk_i`, driving the `prbs_ignore_first_byte_r` with a delayed value associated with `mem_out[16]`. The delay is determined by the parameter `#TCQ`. This implementation is basically capturing data from `mem_out[16]` on the rise of each clock pulse and delaying it by `#TCQ` time units before assigning it to `prbs_ignore_first_byte_r`. This methodology not only ensures synchronous data updates but also provides controlled latency owed to the specified delay."
