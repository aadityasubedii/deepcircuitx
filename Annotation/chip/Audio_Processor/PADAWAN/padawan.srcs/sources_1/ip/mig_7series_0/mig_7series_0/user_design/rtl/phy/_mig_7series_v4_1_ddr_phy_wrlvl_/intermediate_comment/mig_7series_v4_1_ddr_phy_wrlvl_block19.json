    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for initializing the array elements of 'smallest' and 'largest' with the respective values from 'wl_dqs_tap_count_r' array. Implementation wise, it uses a for loop to traverse through the entire range defined by the DQS_WIDTH. For each index 'i', the respective 'i-th' elements of the 'smallest' and 'largest' arrays are set to the 'i-th' element of 'wl_dqs_tap_count_r' after a specified delay defined by 'TCQ'."
