Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for checking the clock period to comply with certain timing constraints. The conditional statement makes sure that this block gets executed only when the clock period (`tCK`) is less than or equal to 2500 ps. The local parameters `CLK_PERIOD_PS` and `CLK_PERIOD_PS_DIV4` are then computed, multiplying the `MMCM_VCO_PERIOD` by the `MMCM_MULT_F` and dividing the resultant clock period by 4 respectively. Lastly, the variable `rising_mmcm_ps_clk` of data type time is declared to keep track of the rising edge of the clock which could be used in further calculations or conditions.
