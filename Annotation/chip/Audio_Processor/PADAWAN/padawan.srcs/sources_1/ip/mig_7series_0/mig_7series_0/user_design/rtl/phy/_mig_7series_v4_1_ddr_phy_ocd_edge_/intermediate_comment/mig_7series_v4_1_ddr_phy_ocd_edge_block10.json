    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for sampling the next state of the signal f2z_ns on the rising edge of the clock, and assigning it to f2z_r after a delay specified by TCQ. The operation inside an always block ensures that whenever there's a positive edge (rising edge) in the clock signal, the assignment to f2z_r takes place. The \"#\" TCQ introduces a delay before the assignment, representing a propagation delay typically seen in actual hardware circuits."
