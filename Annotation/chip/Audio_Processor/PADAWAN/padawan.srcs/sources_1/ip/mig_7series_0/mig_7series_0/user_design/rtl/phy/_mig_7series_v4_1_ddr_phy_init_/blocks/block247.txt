This block of code represents a hardware description language monitor that prints a message upon completion of OCLKDELAY calibration. Utilizing the 'always' keyword, the block is triggered at every positive edge of the 'oclkdelay_calib_done' signal. When reset is not active (signified by '!rst'), the calibration completion message along with the current simulation time is displayed using the '$display' system function.
