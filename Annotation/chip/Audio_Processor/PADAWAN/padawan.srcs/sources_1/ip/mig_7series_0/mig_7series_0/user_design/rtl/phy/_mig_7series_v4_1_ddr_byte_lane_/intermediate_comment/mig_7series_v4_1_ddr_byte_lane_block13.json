    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code synchronizes input signals to the positive edge of the phy_clk. The signals being synced are 'pi_phase_locked', 'pi_dqs_found', and 'pi_counter_read_val', which have their values updated from corresponding write registers on the rising edge of 'phy_clk'. Sequential synchronisation steps are achieved with three-state pipelining; each signal has three register stages (_r1, _r2, _r3), and at every clock edge, the signal value is propagated to the next stage."
