Comment: 
The code block assigns the signal `wait_for_maint_r` the value of `wait_for_maint_r_lcl`. This signal assignment is done using the `assign` statement, which continuously drives the `wait_for_maint_r` signal to the current value of the `wait_for_maint_r_lcl` signal. This means, whenever `wait_for_maint_r_lcl` changes, `wait_for_maint_r` will immediately reflect this change.
