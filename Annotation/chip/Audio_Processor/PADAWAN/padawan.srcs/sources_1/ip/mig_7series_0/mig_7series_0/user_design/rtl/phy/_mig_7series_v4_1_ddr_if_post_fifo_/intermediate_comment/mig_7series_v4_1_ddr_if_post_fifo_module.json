    "module": "Module-level comment: This mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_if_post_fifo module is a DDR memory interface FIFO block, utilizing parameters TCQ (clock latency), DEPTH (FIFO depth), and WIDTH (data path width). It handles data management with input and output ports for control and data transfer. The module uses internal pointers, memory registers, and control wires synchronized with the clock to monitor and manipulate the FIFO status. Functions include pointer and flag updating tasks, conditions for memory write/read operations, error detection, and controlled data output based on FIFO status."
