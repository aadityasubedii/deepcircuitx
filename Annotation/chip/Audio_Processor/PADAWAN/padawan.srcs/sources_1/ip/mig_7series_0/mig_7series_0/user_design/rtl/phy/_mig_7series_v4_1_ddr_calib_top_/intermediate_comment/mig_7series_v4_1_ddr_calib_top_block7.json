    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for calibrating signals and tracking the device temperature. When the reset signal is triggered, it zeroizes the counters used for calibrations and the registers used for device temperature tracking. If the calibration tap load control signal is triggered instead, depending on the value of the calibration tap address, it adjusts the counts on different taps, or refreshes the device temperature. The adjustments are based on the provided calibration tap value, which is set to specific index ranges of different counter registers, or updates to specific parts of the device temperature register."
