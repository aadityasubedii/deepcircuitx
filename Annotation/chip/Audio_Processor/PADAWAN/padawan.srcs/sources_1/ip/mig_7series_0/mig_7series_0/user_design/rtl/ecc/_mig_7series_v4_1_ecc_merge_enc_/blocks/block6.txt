Comment: 
This block of code primarily defines inputs and a register for a hardware module written in Verilog code language. The module is apparently programmed to accept Hamming code with variable 'h_rows' and raw data with 'raw_not_ecc'. 'h_rows' is an input stream whose width is determined by the product of 'CODE_WIDTH' and 'ECC_WIDTH', symbolising the input of a Forward Error Correction (FEC) encoded data stream. While 'raw_not_ecc' is the input that represents raw data that has not been processed by an ECC, 'raw_not_ecc_r' is a register for storing this raw data temporarily while it is being processed, and its width is determined by '2*nCK_PER_CLK'.
