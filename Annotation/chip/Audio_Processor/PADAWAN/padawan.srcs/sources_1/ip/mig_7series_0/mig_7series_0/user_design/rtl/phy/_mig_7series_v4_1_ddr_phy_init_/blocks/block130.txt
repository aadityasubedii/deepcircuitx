This block is responsible for controlling a phase-locked loop timer (`pi_phaselock_timer`) in a Verilog RTL. Specifically, it utilizes clock-based conditionals to regulate the timer's progression. The timer is reset when a reset signal is detected (`rst`) or when a preset condition (`PRE_REV3ES == "ON"`) and a temporary write calibration completion signal is received (`temp_wrcal_done` and `~temp_wrcal_done_r`). Alternatively, if the device is in an initialization state (`init_state_r == INIT_PI_PHASELOCK_READS`) and hasn't timed out, or when a go signal (`tg_timer_go`) is received, the timer count is incremented. Otherwise, the timer remains stagnant.
