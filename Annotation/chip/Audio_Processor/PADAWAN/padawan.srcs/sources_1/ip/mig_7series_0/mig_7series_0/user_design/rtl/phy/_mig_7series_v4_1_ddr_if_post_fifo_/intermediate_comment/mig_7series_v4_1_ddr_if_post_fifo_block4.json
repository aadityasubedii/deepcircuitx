    "block_comment": "This block initializes system variables and handles read pointer updates for a buffer system on reset or read conditions. On every positive edge of clock (clk), if a reset (rst) is signaled, several system variables including my_empty, my_full and various pointers are reset to default values. Otherwise, if the buffer is not empty and not full with read enable signal and no empty input signal, the read pointer is updated using the updt_ptrs function. This block implements control flow for read pointer updating under specific buffer conditions."
