    "module": "Module-level comment: This module manages memory operations for a 7 Series FPGA memory interface generator. It controls read, write, and refresh operations based on input parameters and signals. The module uses multiple bank control units (bank_cntrl) to handle individual bank operations, a common bank unit (bank_common) for shared functionality, and an arbitration multiplexer (arb_mux) to coordinate memory access. It processes input commands, generates appropriate control signals, and manages timing constraints to ensure proper memory operation."
