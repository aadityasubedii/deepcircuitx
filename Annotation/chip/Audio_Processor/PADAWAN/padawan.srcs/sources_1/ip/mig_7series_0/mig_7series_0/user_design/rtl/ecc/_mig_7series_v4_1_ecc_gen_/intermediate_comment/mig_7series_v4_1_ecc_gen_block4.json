    "block_comment": "The block assigns values to elements of the \"ht_matrix\" array, specifically it assigns a string that includes five 1-bit ones followed by certain number of 1-bit zeros. The total length of the string is ECC_WIDTH bits. The array \"ht_matrix\" has a width of ECC_WIDTH, with each element in the array being ECC_WIDTH bits long. The particular configuration of ones and zeros serves to identify and handle error correction in the matrix.\n"
