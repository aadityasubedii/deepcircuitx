Comment: 
This block of code sets the control signals for a memory system. It is triggered whenever there is a change in the 'sent_row_or_maint' signal. Specifically, it controls the enable signal for chip select 'cs_en1' and sets the command signals 'send_cmd0_row' and 'send_cmd1_row' to the state of 'sent_row_or_maint'. This is essentially a conditional assignment block, which changes the state of these three control signals synchronously based on the state of 'sent_row_or_maint'.
