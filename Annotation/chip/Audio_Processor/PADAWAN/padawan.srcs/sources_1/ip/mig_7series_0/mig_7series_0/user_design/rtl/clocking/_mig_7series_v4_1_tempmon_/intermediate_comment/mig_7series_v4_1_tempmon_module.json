    "module": "Module-level comment: mig_7series_v4_1_tempmon module manages device temperature monitoring. The module samples user-supplied or XADC-supplied temperature, and produces a synchronized version of temperature aligned with system clock. The functionality is achieved by input signal staging through synchronization registers, assisted by a counter for flow control. In case of XADC input, a state machine enables controlled reading of temperature."
