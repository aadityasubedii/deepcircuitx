    "block_comment": "This block manages the output data transfer (ODT) port functionalities when USE_ODT_PORT is enabled. It outputs data from mem_dq_out to out_odt based on the indices computed from ODT_MAP. Then, this block further processes these outputs depending upon the condition whether the first 4 bits of the converted ODT_MAP are less than hex 'A or not. For both cases, it processes the data in sets of 4 through the loop_xpose block, with the only difference of index calculation for writing to the phy_dout. One computation is direct while the other is reduced by 5 and offset by 4 to cater for different memory layouts.\n"
