Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for updating the "ordered_ns" variable based on certain conditions. When a reset (rst) signal is issued, the "ordered_ns" is set to 0. Otherwise, "ordered_ns" mimics the value of "ordered_r_lcl". Additionally, if "set_order_q" is true, "ordered_ns" is set to 1 and if the "ordered_issued_lcl" signal is received, "ordered_ns" is set back to 0.
