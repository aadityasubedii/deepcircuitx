    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for managing data allocation to different bank units in a chip memory system based on a counter called 'chip_cnt_r'. When the 'chip_cnt_r' is at default value '2'b00', it assigns the data from 'bank_w[s]' to 'phy_bank' at the location based on calculation '(r*BANK_WIDTH) + s'. In other circumstances, the data assignment in 'phy_bank' gets complex where it switches the allocation between 0 and 1 indices if 's' is 0 or 1 respectively, else it keeps the same index 's'. This variation is said to be triggered by a clock signal edge."
