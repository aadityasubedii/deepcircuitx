Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_arb_row_col.

Module specification: 

The 'mig_7series_v4_1_arb_row_col' module primarily handles the arbitration and scheduling of memory commands in a Memory Interface Generator (MIG) design specifically for the 7 series FPGA families. This involves controlling priority scheduling between column (write/read command) and row (activate/precharge command) arbitration, considering a number of parameters such as command mode, data width, latency, and clock cycles. 

This module has several input ports including clock(`clk`), reset(`rst`), signals for requests to row, insert maintenance read, column and rank-to-rank transfer (`rts_row`, `insert_maint_r`,  `rts_col`, `rtc`), and column write ready (`col_rdy_wr`). The module outputs include signal for row request grants (`grant_row_r`), sent row and column commands (`sent_row`, `sent_col`), valid signals for rank configuration (`rnk_config_valid_r`), and control signals for sending various commands (`sent_row`, `sending_row`, `sending_pre`, `grant_col_r`, `sending_col`, `sent_col`, `sent_col_r`, `grant_col_wr`, `send_cmd0_row`, `send_cmd1_row`, `send_cmd2_row`, `send_cmd0_col`, `send_cmd1_col`, `send_cmd2_col`, `send_cmd3_col`, `send_cmd2_pre`, `insert_maint_r1`, `sending_pre`, `grant_pre_r`), enable signals for chip selects (`cs_en0`, `cs_en1`, `cs_en2`, `cs_en3`), column channel offset(`col_channel_offset`), and signals for rank to rank config (`rnk_config_strobe`, `rank_config_valid_r`, `rnk_config_kill_rts_col`).

The module uses several internal signals as controls or intermediaries for the logic, such as a chain of delay signals (`rnk_config_strobe_r`) for controlling the timing of rank configuration commands, `block_grant_row` and `block_grant_col` for temporarily blocking the grant for row or column requests under certain conditions, `rnk_config_kill_rts_col_lcl` to block column requests while a config command is being issued, `granted_row_ns`, `granted_col_ns`, `granted_row_r`, `granted_col_r` to control the sequence of granting row or column requests, `sent_row_lcl` and `sent_col_lcl` to determine whether a row or column request is being sent, `insert_maint_r1_lcl` for ensuring the maintenance read gets a chance to transmit in the subsequent clock cycle after it arrives, and `sent_row_or_maint`, `sent_row_or_maint_r` for handling both row and maintenance commands simultaneously.

The module comprises different blocks of code that perform specific functions such as arbitration ('row_arb0', 'pre_arb0', 'col_arb0', 'config_arb0') for managing the round-robin sequence of each type of request (such as row, precharge, column, config), delay elements, and some specific functionality based on the address command mode and number of clock cycles per clock.
