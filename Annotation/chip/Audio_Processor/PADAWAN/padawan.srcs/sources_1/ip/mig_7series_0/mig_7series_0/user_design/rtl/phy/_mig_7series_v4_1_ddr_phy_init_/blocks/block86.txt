Comment: 
The provided Verilog code block manages the state of the 'complex_wr_done' signal, which indicates when a complex write operation is completed. The block responds to a rising edge of a clock signal and bases its actions on the current 'init_state_r', various trigger states and a wait counter 'complex_wait_cnt'. It specifically sets the 'complex_wr_done' to '0' when either 'init_state_r' is 'INIT_IDLE' or signalling mechanisms indicate task completion or a specific calibration is done. In contrast, 'complex_wr_done' is set to '1' when 'init_state_r' is either 'INIT_RDLVL_COMPLEX_ACT_WAIT' or 'INIT_OCAL_COMPLEX_ACT_WAIT', provided a row write is completed and 'complex_wait_cnt' equals 13. The defined delay '#TCQ' ensures the timing constraints are adhered to.
