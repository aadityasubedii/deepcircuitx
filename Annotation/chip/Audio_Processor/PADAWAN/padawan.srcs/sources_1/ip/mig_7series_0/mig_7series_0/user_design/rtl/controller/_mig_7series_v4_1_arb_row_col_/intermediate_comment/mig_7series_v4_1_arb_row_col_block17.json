    "block_comment": "The block's function is to determine when to enable a control signal (`cs_en1`) based on input signals (`sent_col_lcl` or `sent_row_or_maint`). This block employs an always construct, which ensures `cs_en1` is updated anytime there are changes in either `sent_row_or_maint` or `sent_col_lcl`. The control signal (`cs_en1`) is set to 1 if either `sent_row_or_maint` or `sent_col_lcl` is true as indicated by the logical OR operation."
