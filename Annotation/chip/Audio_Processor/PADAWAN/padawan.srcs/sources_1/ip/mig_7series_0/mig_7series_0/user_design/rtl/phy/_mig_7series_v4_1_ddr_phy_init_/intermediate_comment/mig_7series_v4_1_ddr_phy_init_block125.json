    "block_comment": "This Verilog block's function is to reset a two-bit `chip_cnt_r` register to 0 at the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. It exploits the delay modeling construct `#TCQ` to simulate propagation delay. This block is implemented within a conditional `else` block identified with the label `dual_rank`, suggesting its use within a state-machine or conditional flow based on rank.\n"
