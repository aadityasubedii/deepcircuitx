    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a pattern matching generator handling a scenario where the clock to data ratio is 4. It operates across the entire width of the DRAM, iterating from 0 to value less than DRAM_WIDTH, incrementing by 1 each time. It conditionally generates the pattern matching modules in the design, based on the genvar `pt_i`, which iteratively takes on integer values from 0 up to `DRAM_WIDTH - 1`, enabling parallel pattern detection across all DRAM data lines."
