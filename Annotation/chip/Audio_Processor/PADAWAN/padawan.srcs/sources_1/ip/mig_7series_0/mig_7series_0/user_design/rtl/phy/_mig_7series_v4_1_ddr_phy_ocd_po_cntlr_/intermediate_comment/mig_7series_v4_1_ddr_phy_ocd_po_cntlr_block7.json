    "block_comment": "This block acts as a sample register for a done signal based on a rising clock edge. The implementation uses a non-blocking assignment inside an always block, triggered on the positive edge of the 'clk' signal, to sample the next state (po_done_ns) of the 'done' signal after a delay of '#TCQ', and assigns this sampled value to the registered 'po_done_r' signal."
