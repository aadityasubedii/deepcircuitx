    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the state of the `pi_phaselock_start` signal in a clocked environment. Upon encountering a rising edge on the `clk` signal, it checks the state of the `rst` signal. If reset is high, it sets `pi_phaselock_start` to 0 after a time delay TCQ (representing the clock transition time), indicating that the phase lock process is not active. If reset is low, it checks if `init_state_r` equals `INIT_PI_PHASELOCK_READS`. If true, it sets `pi_phaselock_start` to 1 after time delay TCQ, indicating the beginning of the phase lock process."
