Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for creating a Pseudorandom Binary Sequence (PRBS). Leveraging the functionality of the linear feedback shift register (LFSR), it extracts bits from the specified range (from 1 to PRBS_WIDTH) in every change (always @) in the lfsr_q output and assigns these bits to the prbs variable.
