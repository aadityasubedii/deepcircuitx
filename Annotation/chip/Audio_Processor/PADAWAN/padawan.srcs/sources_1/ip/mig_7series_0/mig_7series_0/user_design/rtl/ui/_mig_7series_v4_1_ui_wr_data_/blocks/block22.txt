Comment: 
The block assigns the next state of the wdf_rdy signal, frequently used to indicate a ready status. Its operation is negatively influenced by five factors: a reset signal, the complement of the completion of RAM initialization, a situation when the 15th bit of occ_cnt and the wr_data_end signal are both high but rd_data_upd_indx_r is low, and finally, when the highest (16th) bit of occ_cnt is high while rd_data_upd_indx_r is low.
