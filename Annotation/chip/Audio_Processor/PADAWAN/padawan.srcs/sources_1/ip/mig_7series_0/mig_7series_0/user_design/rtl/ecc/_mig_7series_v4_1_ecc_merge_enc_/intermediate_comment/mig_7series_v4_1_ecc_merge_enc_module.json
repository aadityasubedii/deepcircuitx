    "module": "Module-level comment: The mig_7series_v4_1_ecc_merge_enc module serves to merge and ECC process the read and write data in Memory Interface Generators for 7-series devices. Using synchronous design techniques and conditional logic, it merges the write and read data per the applied mask and computes ECC using a Hamming code if the raw_not_ecc signal is de-asserted. The resulting data is prepared for memory write operation. The module's primary output is the merged and ECC processed data ready for memory, and a constant zero mask signifying all data bits validity.\n"
