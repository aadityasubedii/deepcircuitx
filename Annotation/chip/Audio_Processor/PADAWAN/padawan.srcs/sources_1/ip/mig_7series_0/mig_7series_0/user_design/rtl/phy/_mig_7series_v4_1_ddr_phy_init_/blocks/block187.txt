This block of code controls the assertion of the write leveling DQS signal in a DDR memory controller. It operates synchronously with the system clock. When a reset signal is detected or the write leveling count isn't one, the write leveling DQS assertion signal is cleared. On detecting that the write leveling count is one and write leveling is active, the write leveling DQS assertion signal is set. The delay parameter TCQ is used for the timing control on the DQS assertion.
