Comment: 
This block of Verilog code functions to store a snapshot of signal rise and fall values on the rising edge of a clock if certain conditions are met. The block accomplishes this via two conditional clauses. First, it checks whether 'sr_valid_r' or 'mpr_valid_r' is true, if so, the previous signal rise and fall values are assigned with some delay specified by '#TCQ'. The second condition also checks for 'sr_valid_r' or 'mpr_valid_r' as well as 'store_sr_r' being true, in which case an older snapshot of the signal rise and fall values is stored.
