    "block_comment": "This line of code sets the real-time status of `oclkdelay_calib_done` variable. `oclkdelay_calib_done` is assigned the value of `oclkdelay_calib_done_r`, effectively making it equal to the current state or value of `oclkdelay_calib_done_r`. This operation is achieved using the `assign` keyword, a continuous assignment statement that updates its left-hand-side whenever the value on its right-hand-side changes."
