    "block_comment": "This block of code describes a state-driven conditional counter control in a synchronous system. When reset, the control 'samples_cnt1_en_r' is set to 0 on the rising edge of the clock. If reset isn't asserted, the control can be set to 0 if the 'prbs_state_r' signal is in one of select states (PRBS_IDLE, PRBS_DEC_DQS, PRBS_INC_DQS, etc.). Alternatively, if the 'samples_cnt_r' equals 'NUM_SAMPLES_CNT' and 'rd_valid_r1' is true, then the control is set to 1. These enable operations are typically used to keep track of timing or events in hardware systems."
