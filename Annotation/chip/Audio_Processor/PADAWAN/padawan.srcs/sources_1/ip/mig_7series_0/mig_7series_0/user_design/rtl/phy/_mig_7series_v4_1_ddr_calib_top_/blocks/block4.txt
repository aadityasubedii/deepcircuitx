Comment: 
This block of code defines a state where the calibration of various parameters is disabled or skipped. In this state, all the enable signals (calib_po_f_en, calib_po_c_en, calib_pi_f_en, and calib_idelay_ce) and the increment signals (calib_po_f_incdec, calib_po_c_inc, calib_pi_f_incdec, and calib_idelay_inc) are set to 0, thus blocking any changes or updates on these parameters. The 'calibration tap increment done' signal is also set to 0, indicating that the increment process is incomplete or not initiated. Additionally, 'calibration tap increment byte count' is set to zero, resetting the byte count. Only 'skip calibration PO PI done' signal is set to high, indicating that decrement has been completed.
