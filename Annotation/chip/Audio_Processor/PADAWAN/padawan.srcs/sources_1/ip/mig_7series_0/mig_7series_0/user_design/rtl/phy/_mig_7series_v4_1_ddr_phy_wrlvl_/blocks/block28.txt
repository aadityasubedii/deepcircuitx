Comment: 
This Verilog RTL block primarily manages the 'done_dqs_dec' signal based on various conditions. It monitors the positive edge of the clock to control the 'done_dqs_dec' signal. There exist four different conditions to handle the signal: 1) It gets reset when reset condition is high or any one of 'wrlvl_byte_redo' and 'wrlvl_final' toggles from high. 2) If the calibration is not yet done or simulation calibration option is set to "FAST_CAL", it takes the value of 'wr_level_done_r'. 3) When write levelling is completed and the system is in idle state, it is set to high.
