    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a case statement based on the specific combinations of the variables `nCK_PER_CLK` and `ADDR_CMD_MODE`. The case statement handles three conditions represented by specific binary values (3'b000, 3'b001, 3'b010). If `nCK_PER_CLK` is equal to 4, `nCK_PER_CLK` is equal to 2, and `ADDR_CMD_MODE` is equal to '2T', then evaluate to true for each condition respectively and it will execute the associated labeled blocks `one_one_not2T`, `one_one_2T`, and `two_one_not2T`. Currently, the blocks are empty suggesting they may be filled with dedicated functionality in later development."
