    "spec": "Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ecc_buf. \n\nModule specification: The 'mig_7series_v4_1_ecc_buf' is an Error Correction Code (ECC) buffer module used in a Memory Interface Generator (MIG) design, managing buffer memory for read and write operations, potentially in a DDR memory context. The main input ports include 'clk', a clock for operational synchronization; 'rst', a reset for system initialization; 'rd_data_addr' and 'rd_data_offset', serving as read data memory pointers; 'wr_data_addr' and 'wr_data_offset', acting as write data memory pointers; 'rd_data', being the read data content; and 'wr_ecc_buf', an indicator for write operations to the ECC buffer. The output of the module is 'rd_merge_data', the processed read data. Internally, signals like 'buf_wr_addr' and 'buf_rd_addr_r' manage buffer addressing while 'payload' stores segmented read data, and 'buf_out_data' and 'buf_in_data' facilitate data transfer with the RAM buffers. The code is sectioned into areas defining parameters, inputs and outputs, internal registers; a generate condition for managing data addressing; a loop for segmenting read data; another generate statement which contains a further loop for RAM generation and data storage; and finally, assignment of read merged data. Through all these operations, the module achieves its purpose of managing data buffering within an ECC environment.",

The main input ports include 'clk', a clock for operational synchronization; 'rst', a reset for system initialization; 'rd_data_addr' and 'rd_data_offset', serving as read data memory pointers; 'wr_data_addr' and 'wr_data_offset', acting as write data memory pointers; 'rd_data', being the read data content; and 'wr_ecc_buf', an indicator for write operations to the ECC buffer. The output of the module is 'rd_merge_data', the processed read data. Internally, signals like 'buf_wr_addr' and 'buf_rd_addr_r' manage buffer addressing while 'payload' stores segmented read data, and 'buf_out_data' and 'buf_in_data' facilitate data transfer with the RAM buffers. The code is sectioned into areas defining parameters, inputs and outputs, internal registers; a generate condition for managing data addressing; a loop for segmenting read data; another generate statement which contains a further loop for RAM generation and data storage; and finally, assignment of read merged data. Through all these operations, the module achieves its purpose of managing data buffering within an ECC environment."
