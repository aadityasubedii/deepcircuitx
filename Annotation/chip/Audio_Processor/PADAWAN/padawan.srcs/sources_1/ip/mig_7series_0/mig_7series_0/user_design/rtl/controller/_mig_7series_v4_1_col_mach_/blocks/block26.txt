This block assigns the value of the variable 'col_wr_data_buf_addr_r' to 'wr_data_addr' using a continuous assignment statement. This function is achieved by using the assign keyword in Verilog which is used to set the value of a wire, in this case, 'wr_data_addr'. Continuous assignments are used for gate-level or dataflow modelling where changes to the RHS (right-hand-side) variables cause immediate propagation to the LHS (left-hand-side) 'wr_data_addr'. This design simplifies data routing from one net to another.
