    "block_comment": "This block of code describes a sequential logic functionality. Specifically, it handles a register update on the positive edge of a clock cycle (\"posedge clk\"). The new state of the 'stg3_r' register is assigned by the non-blocking assignment statement (\"stg3_ns\") which implies an action (assigning 'stg3_ns' to 'stg3_r') will happen at a certain time delay (defined by \"TCQ\") after the clock edge."
