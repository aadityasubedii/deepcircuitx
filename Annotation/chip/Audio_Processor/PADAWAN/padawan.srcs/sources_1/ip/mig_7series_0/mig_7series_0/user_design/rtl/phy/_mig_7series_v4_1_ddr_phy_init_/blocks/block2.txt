This block of Verilog RTL code is essentially a logic incorporated for updating the physical address information on a clock's rising edge. When the 'chip_cnt_r' equals to '00', it simply assigns address from 'address_w' to 'phy_address' after a delay of 'TCQ'. For 'chip_cnt_r' not equals to '00', it incorporates a swapping logic and then assigns the value from 'address_w' to 'phy_address'. Here, a ternary operator is used to define the swapping sequence between pairs of index (3 and 4),(5 and 6) and (7 and 8), within 'address_w'.
