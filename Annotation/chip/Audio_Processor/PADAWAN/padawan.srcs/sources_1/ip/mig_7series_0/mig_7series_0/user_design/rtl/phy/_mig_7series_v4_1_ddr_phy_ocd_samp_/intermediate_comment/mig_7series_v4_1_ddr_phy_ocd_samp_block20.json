    "block_comment": "The block of code functions as a flip-flop, storing the value of 'agg_samp_ns' at the rising edge ('posedge') of the 'clk' signal. The block achieves its function by using an 'always' procedural block that triggers on the rising edge of the 'clk' signal. The delay of the operation is adjusted using the '#TCQ' timing control parameter. In this manner, the value aggregated in 'agg_samp_ns' is sampled and stored securely in the 'agg_samp_r' register."
