Within the module, internal signals like `ht_matrix`, `seen0`, `trig1`, `ones`, `COMBOS_3`, and `COMBOS_5` exist. 'ht_matrix' stores the generated Hamming matrix, while 'seen0', 'trig1', and 'ones' are registers used inside 'next_combo'. 'COMBOS_3' and 'COMBOS_5' are local parameters storing specific combinations for the Hamming matrix.
