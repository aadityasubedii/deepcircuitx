This block manages an action starvation limit counter in a system using signals such as action request and action denied. The block uses an 'always' block triggering on changes to action request, the current value of the action starvation limit counter, or an action denied signal. The counter's next state is set to its current state or reset when there's no action request. If an action request is denied and the counter has reached its limit, the counter is incremented, setting the lower end bit and filling the remaining higher bits with zeroes.
