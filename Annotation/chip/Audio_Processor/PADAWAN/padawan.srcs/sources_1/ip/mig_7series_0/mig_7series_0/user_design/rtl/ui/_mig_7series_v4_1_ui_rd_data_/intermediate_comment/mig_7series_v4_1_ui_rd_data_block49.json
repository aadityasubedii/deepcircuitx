    "block_comment": "The block of code serves a data assignment task. Particularly, it assigns the value of \"app_ecc_multiple_err_r\" to \"app_ecc_multiple_err\". In Verilog, the \"assign\" keyword fulfills this task by continuously assigning the value on its right to the variable on its left. So, whenever \"app_ecc_multiple_err_r\" changes, \"app_ecc_multiple_err\" will be instantly updated with the new value."
