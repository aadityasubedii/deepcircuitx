Comment: 
This block assigns the value of 'data_end' based on the condition of 'col_size'. It uses a ternary operator to decide the value of 'data_end'. If 'col_size' is non-zero, it assigns the value of LSB bit of 'offset_r' to 'data_end'; otherwise, it assigns a logic 1 to 'data_end'. This is implemented using an 'assign' statement for continuous assignment in Verilog.
