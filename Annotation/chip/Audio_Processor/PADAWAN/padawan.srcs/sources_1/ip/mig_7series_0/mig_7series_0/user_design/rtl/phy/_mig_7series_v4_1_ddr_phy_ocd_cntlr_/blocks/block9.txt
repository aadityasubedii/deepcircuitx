This block of code is responsible for receiving an input signal, performing internal operations, and outputting a signal. The input signal 'po_counter_read_val' is a 9-bit vector, utilized in other sections of the code. 'ocd_cntlr2stg2_dec' serves as an output signal, driven by the internal register 'ocd_cntlr2stg2_dec_r'. The process is controlled by the readiness signal 'po_rdy'. Additionally, there are two 4-bit registers, 'po_rd_wait_ns' and 'po_rd_wait_r', used for temporarily storing the values for read-wait operations during the process.
