This block defines an always block which runs at positive clock edge. In particular, it updates registers based on a delay modelled by #TCQ. During each clock cycle, it sets `complex_byte_rd_done_r1` as the delayed value of `complex_byte_rd_done`. It also updates `complex_ocal_num_samples_inc` based on a logical operation involving `complex_byte_rd_done` and its previously delayed state `complex_byte_rd_done_r1`.
