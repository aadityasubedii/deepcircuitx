    "block_comment": "This block is a simple positive edge-triggered D flip-flop. It is used to store the signal `ocd_edge_detect_rdy_ns` at the rising edge of the clock 'clk'. The `#TCQ` is a delay control which introduces a delay equal to the propagation delay of a typical Flip-flop. Thus, this block is employed to synchronize `ocd_edge_detect_rdy_ns` signal with the system clock 'clk', adding realism to the propagation delay."
