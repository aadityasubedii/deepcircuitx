    "block_comment": "This block of code defines an instantiation of the `mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_byte_group_io` module, which handles memory I/O operations for byte groups in a DDR (Double Data Rate) context. The core functionality is to manage both input (read) and output (write) sequences to the DDR memory. Inputs are processed via ISERDESE2 (input serializer/deserializer) blocks, while outputs are managed via OSERDESE2 (output serializer/deserializer) blocks. The module also interacts with an IDELAYE2 block for input delay control and uses an IODELAY_GROUP block for further delay handling. Clock signals are also specified and managed within this instantiation along with a reset mechanism. The block achieves its function using granular control over data lanes via specified parameters and using proper synchronization via the clocks."
