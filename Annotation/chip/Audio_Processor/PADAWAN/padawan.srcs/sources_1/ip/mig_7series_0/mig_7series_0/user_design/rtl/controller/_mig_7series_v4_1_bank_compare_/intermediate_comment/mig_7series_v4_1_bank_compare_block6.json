    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for assigning the column address in a memory array. It does this by indexing a predefined column address template vector, specifically taking a subset from index `ROW_WIDTH-1` to `0`, implying that the length of the column address equals the defined row width. This approach allows dynamic allocation of addresses based on the specified row width."
