Comment: 
This block of Verilog code compares falling and rising edges in signal patterns and sets match results accordingly. On every positive edge of the clock, it compares each component of the current signal pattern ('sr_rise' and 'sr_fall') with the patterns set as idel (patterns of idle). The comparison is element-wise for each component from 0 to 3. It uses the postfix %4 to recur through the idle patterns. A match sets the corresponding 'idel_pat0_match' signal to 1 with a delay of TCQ time units, otherwise, it is set to 0.
