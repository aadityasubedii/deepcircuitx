    "block_comment": "This block is initializing interface control and data lines in a communication protocol. Resetting all the control flags and validating byte read enable for lane 2 is its main function. The block sets all the specified variables to either '0' or '1', ensuring that the interface lines are in a defined state before the transmission begins. Additionally, it also assigns '4'b1111' to the 'pi_phase_locked_lanes' and 'pi_dqs_found_lanes', indicating that all lanes are locked and in phase, ready for data transfer.\n"
