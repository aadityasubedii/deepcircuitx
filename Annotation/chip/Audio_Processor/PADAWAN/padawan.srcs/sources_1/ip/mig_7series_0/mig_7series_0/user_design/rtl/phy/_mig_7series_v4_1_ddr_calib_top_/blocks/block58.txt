Comment: 
This block assigns the value of 'wrlvl_err' to 'dbg_wrlvl_err'. Using the 'assign' keyword in the Verilog, this takes place continuously and concurrently, meaning 'dbg_wrlvl_err' will constantly reflect the current value of 'wrlvl_err'. This is a digital wire assignment implemented at the RTL (Register Transfer Level), which provides debugging functionality by mirroring the state of the 'wrlvl_err' signal.
