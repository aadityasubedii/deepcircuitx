This block of code is responsible for updating the write grant for a column in memory. It waits for the positive edge of the clock cycle (posedge clk) to update the grant_col_wr_r register with the value of the next state (grant_col_wr_ns), adding a delay equal to the time cycle question (TCQ). The immediate assignment also passes the state of the next write grant to the grant_col_wr, without any delay.
