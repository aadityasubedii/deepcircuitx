Comment: 
This block of Verilog code generates a mux read (mux_rd) design structure for dividing the input into four if the input nCK_PER_CLK equals 4. It does this by using a generate loop (controlled by genvar mux_i) iterating from 0 to one less than DRAM_WIDTH. The concluded structure is a series of multiplexer read units catered for reducing system latency in environments where the clock input is quadrupled. The operation depends heavily on the pre-processor define of DRAM_WIDTH and the dynamic value nCK_PER_CLK.
