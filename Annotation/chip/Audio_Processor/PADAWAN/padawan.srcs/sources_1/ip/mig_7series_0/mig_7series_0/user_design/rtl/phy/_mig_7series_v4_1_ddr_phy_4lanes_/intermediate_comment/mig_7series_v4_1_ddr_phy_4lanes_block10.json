    "block_comment": "This block is using a PHY_CONTROL module in a memory interface PHY design. The bus width, auxiliary input and output, associated operational timing controls, offset values for read/write commands, and duration of read/write operations are all parameterized. The module interfaces with the system's control bus, allowing the control of incoming signal ranks. The module also interacts with the main system's clock, the main PHY clock for data exposure, and various control signals for ensuring data integrity and handling calibrations and resets. This block of code ends with some optional test input and output controls, if the USE_PHY_CONTROL_TEST flag is defined."
