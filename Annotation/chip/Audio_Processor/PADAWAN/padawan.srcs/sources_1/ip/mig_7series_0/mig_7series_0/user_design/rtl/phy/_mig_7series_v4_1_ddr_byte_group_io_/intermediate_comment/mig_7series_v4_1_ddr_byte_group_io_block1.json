    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block facilitates double-data-rate (DDR) transmission for both data (DQS) and data strobe time stamp (DQSTS) using ODDR primitives. When the PO_DATA_CTL input is TRUE, a generate-if structure is employed to instantiate two ODDR primitives: oddr_dqs and oddr_dqsts. These primitives enable the transference of two bits of data per clock cycle (doubling the data rate). To ensure this, data (D1 and D2) and clock inputs are routed to the respective ODDR blocks. When PO_DATA_CTL is FALSE, the generate-if structure skips over the generation of the ODDR primitives, resulting in the block performing no operation.\n"
