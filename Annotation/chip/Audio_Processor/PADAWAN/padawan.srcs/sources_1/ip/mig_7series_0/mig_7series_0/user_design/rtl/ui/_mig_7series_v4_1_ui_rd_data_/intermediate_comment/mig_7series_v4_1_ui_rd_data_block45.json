    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling the memory read data buffer address. It operates in synchronization with the positive edge of the clock cycle, assigning the next state address to the local register when the clock edge rises. The time constant TCQ introduces a delay into this process, ensuring that the address does not change instantaneously but allows some time for data reading."
