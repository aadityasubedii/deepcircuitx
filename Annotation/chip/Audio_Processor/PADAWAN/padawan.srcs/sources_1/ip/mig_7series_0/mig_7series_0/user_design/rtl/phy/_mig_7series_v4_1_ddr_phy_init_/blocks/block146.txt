This block of Verilog RTL code implements a state-machine that handles the initialization phase of a DDR-style memory system such as DDR2 or DDR3. The state-machine sequences through various states associated with memory initialization, including enabling the memory clock (CKE), loading mode registers (MR), issuing write leveling (WRLVL), read leveling (RDLVL), write calibration (WRCAL) operations, and so on. The transitions between states depend on multiple conditions, like achieving a certain count, values of configuration parameters, readiness of certain units (like physical layer control), completion of previous steps etc. The block branches into different states based on these conditions, and prepares the next state accordingly. All states have pre-wait and wait sub-states to ensure operations are completed before moving to the next state.
