Module-level comment: The mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_ocd_data module performs phase calibration in a DDR memory interface using raw memory and PRBS data to optimize memory reading. This is achieved through shifting data based on a control signal, selectively disregarding bytes, and running comparison operations for calibration using internal registers. The process status and results are outputted through a 2-bit `match` signal.
