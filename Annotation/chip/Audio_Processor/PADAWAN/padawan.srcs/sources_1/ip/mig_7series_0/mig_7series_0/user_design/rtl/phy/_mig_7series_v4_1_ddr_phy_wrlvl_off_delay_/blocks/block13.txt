Comment: 
This block is a flip-flop circuit that controls the increment/decrement operation and enabling the second stage of a pipeline. The flip-flop latch is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When the reset signal is activated, or when the cmd_delay_start_r6 signal is not set or the po_delay_done signal is set, both the increment/decrement operation and the enabling of the pipeline's second stage get deactivated. But when the value of po_delay_cnt_r is greater than zero (meaning there's still some delay left), this block toggles the enabling of the pipeline's second stage.
