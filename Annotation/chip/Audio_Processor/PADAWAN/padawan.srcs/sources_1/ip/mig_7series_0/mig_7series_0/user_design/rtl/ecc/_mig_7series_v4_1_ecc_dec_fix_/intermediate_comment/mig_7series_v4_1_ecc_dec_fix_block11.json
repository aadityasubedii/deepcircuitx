    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for storing the next state value of 'ecc_rddata_ns' into 'ecc_rddata_r' at the rising edge of the clock signal. The assignment is done in a non-blocking manner, to ensure that the change in the state of 'ecc_rddata_r' does not affect other operations occurring within the same clock cycle. The inclusion of '#TCQ' induces a delay quantum based upon the 'TCQ' parameter before the assignment takes effect."
