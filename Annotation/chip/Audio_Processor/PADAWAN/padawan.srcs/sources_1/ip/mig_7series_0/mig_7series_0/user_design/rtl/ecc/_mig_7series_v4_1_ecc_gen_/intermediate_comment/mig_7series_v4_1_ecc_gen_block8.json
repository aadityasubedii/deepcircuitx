    "block_comment": "This function, named next_combo, returns the subsequent combination for a given input i of ECC_WIDTH. It initializes variables: index, dump_index, seen0, trig1, and ones. The function begins by setting the seen0 and trig1 registers to 0, and initializing ones with 0. It then enters a loop over the width of the ECC_WIDTH. Inside the loop, if trig1 is true, the function sets the next_combo array element as the corresponding input i element. Otherwise, it sets the next_combo array element to 0, adds the input i element to 'ones', and checks if both i element and seen0 are true. In that case, trig1 is set to true, and a nested loop sets leading elements of next_combo to 1. After the if clause, seen0 gets the inverted value of the i element. This function is useful for generating the next combination in binary sequences of a certain width."
