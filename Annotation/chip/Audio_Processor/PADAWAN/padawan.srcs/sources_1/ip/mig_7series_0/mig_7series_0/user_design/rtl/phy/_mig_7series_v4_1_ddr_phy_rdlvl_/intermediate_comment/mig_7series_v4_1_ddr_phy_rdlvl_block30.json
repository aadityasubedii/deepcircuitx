    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code deals with creating a shift register to handle the case when the clock division factor is 2 (`nCK_PER_CLK == 2`). The implementation occurs within a `gen_old_sr_div2` block with a `for` loop that iterates through every bit of the `DRAM_WIDTH`. The `for` loop contains a `gen_old_sr` block, likely implementing the logic for each individual shift register. The final bit width of the shift register implemented will be equal to the `DRAM_WIDTH`."
