Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is a clocked process that manages the state of the `wrlvl_byte_done` flag. It is triggered at the rising edge of the clock signal. If the reset (`rst`) signal is high or both `wrlvl_byte_redo` is high and its delayed version `wrlvl_byte_redo_r` is low, then `wrlvl_byte_done` gets reset after a delay defined by `#TCQ`. Alternatively, if `wrlvl_byte_redo`, `wr_level_done_r3` are high and `wr_level_done_r4` is low, then `wrlvl_byte_done` gets set after the `#TCQ` delay. The block thus controls the `wrlvl_byte_done` flag based on system status signals, working as a state machine with in-built latency.
