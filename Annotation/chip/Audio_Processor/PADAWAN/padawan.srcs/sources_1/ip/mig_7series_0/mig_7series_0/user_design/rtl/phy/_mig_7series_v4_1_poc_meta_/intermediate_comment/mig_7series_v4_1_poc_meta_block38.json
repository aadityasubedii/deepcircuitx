    "block_comment": "This block is a pipeline register used for propagating the `run_too_small_r2` signal one clock cycle later, synchronizing with the positive edge of the clock signal. The block utilizes a non-blocking assignment (<=) to ensure proper order of execution and uses a delay modeled by `#TCQ` to mimic a hardware propagation delay."
