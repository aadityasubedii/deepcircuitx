    "block_comment": "Without the complete context or a relevant Verilog generate construct, it's not possible to generate a meaningful comment for the \"endgenerate\" statement. The \"endgenerate\" is used to specify the end of a generate construct in Verilog which provides a way for the designer to create iterative or conditional structural hardware description constructs. Include the complete code block to provide an accurate comment."
