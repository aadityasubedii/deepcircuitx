    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for handling output buffers (OBUFs) based on some configuration parameters, connected to clock enable (CKE) pins in the DDR system. If the parameter CKE_ODT_AUX is set to TRUE, the block will be executed and depending on the CKE_WIDTH, it configures the OBUFs. In case CKE_WIDTH equals 1, there is only one OBUF (u_cke_obuf) whose input (I) is connected to the specific index on \"aux_out\" and outputs to \"ddr_cke\". However, if CKE_WIDTH is more than 1, it indicates multiple ranks, and hence, two OBUFs (u_cke0_obuf and u_cke1_obuf) are used. Both take input from different points on \"aux_out\" and output to ddr_cke[0] and ddr_cke[1] respectively."
