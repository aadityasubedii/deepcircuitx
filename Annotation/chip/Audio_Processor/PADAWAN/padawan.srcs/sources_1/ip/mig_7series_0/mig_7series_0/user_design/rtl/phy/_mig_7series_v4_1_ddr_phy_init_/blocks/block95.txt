This block of code is responsible for toggling the 'complex_row1_wr_done' signal based on various conditions. In a synchronous environment controlled by a clock signal, this block detects rising edges to trigger a sequence of checks. When the system reset signal 'rst' is High, or when a number of conditions such as 'prbs_rdlvl_done_pulse', a combination of write victim increment signal 'wr_victim_inc' with 'prbs_rdlvl_done' and 'complex_row_cnt_ocal <COMPLEX_ROW_CNT_BYTE-1', or 'complex_byte_rd_done' are met, the signal 'complex_row1_wr_done' gets low. However, when the signal 'complex_row0_wr_done' is High and the stage-1 write-read count 'stg1_wr_rd_cnt' equals to 2, 'complex_row1_wr_done' goes high. Delay of the assignments are denoted by '#TCQ'.
