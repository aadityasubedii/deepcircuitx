This always block is used for memory initialization trigger in a synchronous design style, governed by an active-high clock. It handles memory initialization for both DDR3 and DDR2 type DRAMs. The reset (rst) input asynchronously sets the memory initialization done signal (mem_init_done_r) to logic 0. When reset is not high, the logic checks two sets of conditions involving different signals and constants. If either of these conditions is met - i.e., specific states in DDR3 or DDR2 mode - the memory initialization done signal is set to logic 1 after the timing control delay (TCQ). This block thus serves as a memory initialization trigger for different types of DRAMs.
