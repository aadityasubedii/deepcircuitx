    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the start and read-to-send (rts) signals for a precharge command in a dynamic memory controller. According to the clocking mode and the address command mode, it chooses between two configuration setups. If nCK_PER_CLK is equal to 4 and ADDR_CMD_MODE is not \"2T\", the start_pre signal is driven by the logical AND of pre_wait_r, ras_timer_zero_r, and the OR of sending_pre and auto_pre_r. Additionally, rts_pre becomes the negation of sending_pre AND with pre_request. Otherwise, start_pre gets a similar expression, but it's based on sending_row instead of sending_pre, and rts_pre is set to low."
