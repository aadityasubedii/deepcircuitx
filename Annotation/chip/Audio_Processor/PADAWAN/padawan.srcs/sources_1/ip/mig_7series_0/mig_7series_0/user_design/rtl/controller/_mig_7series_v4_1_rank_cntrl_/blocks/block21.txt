Comment: 
This block of Verilog code manages the read-to-write delay by maintaining the count of cycles between the read and write commands. The system's reset state initializes the counter 'rtw_cnt_ns' to zero. If 'col_rd_wr' and 'sending_col' are true, the counter is updated to the pre-calculated constant value of read-to-write delay defined by 'CASRD2CASWR_CLKS'. The counter is decremented if it is not zero, ensuring the proper wait states before a read command follows a write.
