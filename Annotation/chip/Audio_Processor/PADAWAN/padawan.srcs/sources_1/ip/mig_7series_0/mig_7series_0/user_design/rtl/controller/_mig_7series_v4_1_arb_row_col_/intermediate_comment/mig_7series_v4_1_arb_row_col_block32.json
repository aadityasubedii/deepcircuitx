    "block_comment": "Since the provided code block is empty and does not contain any Verilog code, it is impossible to provide meaningful comment for it. However, in a general manner, Verilog RTL codes often include module definitions, inputs and outputs declaration, internal signals declaration, logic implementation including combinational and sequential logic etc. Therefore, please provide a valid Verilog RTL code block in order to get a accurate comment for it."
