    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for initializing the GSR_int and PRLD_int signals. It first sets both signals to high (1'b1) and after a delay, equivalent to the ROC_WIDTH units of simulation time, they are set back to low (1'b0). The initialization and timings ensure that the design elements connected to these signals start in a known state and follow the predefined sequence specified by ROC_WIDTH. This method is commonly adopted in digital design to avoid unknown or unpredictable circuit behavior."
