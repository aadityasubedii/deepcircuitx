    "spec": "Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_of_pre_fifo\n\nModule specification: \n\nThe mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_of_pre_fifo is a pre-FIFO buffer module designed for DDR (Double Data Rate) purposes in Xilinx's 7 Series Memory Interface Generator (MIG). The module features a user-defined width and depth, and provides flags for almost full (afull) condition. It also includes structural aspects to ensure data integrity through timing.\n\nThe input ports include clk (Clock signal acts as a synchronizer), rst (Reset signal initializes the system), full_in (indicates if FIFO is full), wr_en_in (Write Enable signal allows new data to be written into FIFO), and d_in (Data input line). The output ports consist of wr_en_out (Write enable output signal, enables writing if FIFO is not full), d_out (Data output line), and afull (The signal goes high if FIFO buffer is above the almost full limit).\n\nInternally, the module uses various signals and registers. PTR_BITS is the logarithm on base 2 of the defined DEPTH. ALMOST_FULL_VALUE is a constant defined as DEPTH - 5. my_empty and my_full are status variables for buffering the data. The write and read pointers in the memory array, wr_ptr and rd_ptr respectively, guide the data flow. rd_ptr_timing and wr_ptr_timing are the copies of rd_ptr and wr_ptr designed to meet timing constraints. The memory array 'mem' serves as FIFO memory through which data is passed. entry_cnt, a counter keeping the count of entries in the FIFO. nxt_rd_ptr and nxt_wr_ptr are signals signifying the upcoming read and write operation location in the FIFO. mem_out outputs the data read from the FIFO. wr_en is a Write Enable signal developed inside the module.\n\nThe code is organized in several blocks responsible for different tasks. First, parameters and signals are defined. Then, the behavior of the input, output, and internal signals is defined in relation to the clock (clk), reset signal (rst), and conditions of the FIFO buffer. The clock-buffering operations are managed in sections synchronized to the positive edge of the clk signal. The logic of read and write pointer updates are placed in separate blocks, managing write and read operations to the FIFO memory. Additionally, count management and alerting of almost full condition take place. The specifications of the wr_en_out and wr_en signals depending on conditions of my_empty, my_full, and full_in are defined. Overall, reading from and writing to the FIFO memory respecting the timing constraints are the core functionalities embedded in the module.",

The FIFO handles data with user-defined Width and Depth. It reads data (d_in) when write enable (wr_en_in) is true and the buffer is not full (full_in).

The module features a user-defined width and depth, and provides flags for almost full (afull) condition. It also includes structural aspects to ensure data integrity through timing.\n\nThe input ports include clk (Clock signal acts as a synchronizer), rst (Reset signal initializes the system), full_in (indicates if FIFO is full), wr_en_in (Write Enable signal allows new data to be written into FIFO), and d_in (Data input line). The output ports consist of wr_en_out (Write enable output signal, enables writing if FIFO is not full), d_out (Data output line), and afull (The signal goes high if FIFO buffer is above the almost full limit).\n\nInternally, the module uses various signals and registers. PTR_BITS is the logarithm on base 2 of the defined DEPTH. ALMOST_FULL_VALUE is a constant defined as DEPTH - 5. my_empty and my_full are status variables for buffering the data. The write and read pointers in the memory array, wr_ptr and rd_ptr respectively, guide the data flow. rd_ptr_timing and wr_ptr_timing are the copies of rd_ptr and wr_ptr designed to meet timing constraints. The memory array 'mem' serves as FIFO memory through which data is passed. entry_cnt, a counter keeping the count of entries in the FIFO. nxt_rd_ptr and nxt_wr_ptr are signals signifying the upcoming read and write operation location in the FIFO. mem_out outputs the data read from the FIFO. wr_en is a Write Enable signal developed inside the module.\n\nThe code is organized in several blocks responsible for different tasks. First, parameters and signals are defined. Then, the behavior of the input, output, and internal signals is defined in relation to the clock (clk), reset signal (rst), and conditions of the FIFO buffer. The clock-buffering operations are managed in sections synchronized to the positive edge of the clk signal. The logic of read and write pointer updates are placed in separate blocks, managing write and read operations to the FIFO memory. Additionally, count management and alerting of almost full condition take place. The specifications of the wr_en_out and wr_en signals depending on conditions of my_empty, my_full, and full_in are defined. Overall, reading from and writing to the FIFO memory respecting the timing constraints are the core functionalities embedded in the module."
