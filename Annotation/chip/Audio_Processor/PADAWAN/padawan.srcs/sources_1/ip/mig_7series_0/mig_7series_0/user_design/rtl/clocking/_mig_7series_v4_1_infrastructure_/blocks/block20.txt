Comment: 
This block of code is tasked with controlling a system reset signal specific to first rising edge of the clock. The inverted version of `rstdiv0` (system reset signal) is assigned to `first_rising_ps_clk_ns` (first rising edge of clock signal) in this combinational logic block. The assignment happens at all moments (specified by `always @(*)`), apart from those when the clock signal is on a rising edge, resetting the `first_rising_ps_clk_ns`.
