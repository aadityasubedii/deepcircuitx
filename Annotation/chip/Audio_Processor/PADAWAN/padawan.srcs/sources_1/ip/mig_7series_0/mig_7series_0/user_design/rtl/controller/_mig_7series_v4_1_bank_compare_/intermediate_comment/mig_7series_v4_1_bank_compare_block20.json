    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value of the local signal `req_rank_r_lcl` to the register `req_rank_r`. This is a simple assignment of the value from one register to another in the Verilog Register Transfer Level (RTL) design. The `assign` keyword in Verilog is used for continuous assignment statements which generate continuous or combinatorial logic networks. In this block, the updated state of `req_rank_r` (that is, any changes to `req_rank_r_lcl`) would propagate through to `req_rank_r` immediately and continuously, keeping the two registers synchronized."
