Module-level comment: This module, mig_7series_v4_1_bank_compare, is responsible for managing and comparing memory banks for specific operations. It uses parameters for configuration and receives control signals and data via input ports. The module processes these inputs and triggers specific memory operations according to interrelated conditions, demonstrated through manipulation and state transitions of internal signals such as rank_hit, bank_hit, and req_priority_ns. It provides feedback about memory operations through output ports like req_data_buf_addr_r and req_bank_r. It contributes to memory management within a larger memory system, with sections in the code handling setup, bank comparison, command execution, memory requests, row control, and rank busyness.
