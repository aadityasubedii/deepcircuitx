    "block_comment": "This block assigns the reg type variable device_temp_r to the wire type variable device_temp. This is a continuous assignment statement in Verilog, and is used to connect different parts of the design (like connecting output of one module to the input of another, etc). It's important to note that there's no delay in the assignment; whenever the value of device_temp_r changes, it's immediately reflected in device_temp."
