This block of Verilog RTL code is used to control the delay taps in memory ranks. It executes on the positive edge of a clock signal and checks for various conditions to perform its operations. The block first checks if a reset condition is set or if calibration option is set to skip, in this case, it initializes the delay tap counter for each rank and DQS width to a predefined initial value. If calibration option is set to fast, it increments or decrements the delay tap counter for each rank and DQS width by one, based on if increment flag is set or not. It also ensures the delay tap counter copying from the previous rank when certain conditions meet â€“ such as all ranks are processed and calibration state is idle. Lastly, it checks if load delay is applied then it sets the counter to zero. The "#TCQ" delays the assignation by one clock cycle.
