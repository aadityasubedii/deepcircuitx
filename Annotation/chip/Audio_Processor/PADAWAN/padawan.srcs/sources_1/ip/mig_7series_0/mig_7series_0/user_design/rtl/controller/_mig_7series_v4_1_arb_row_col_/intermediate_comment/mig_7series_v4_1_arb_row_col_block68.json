    "block_comment": "The block exists to coordinate memory access requests and grants within the Multi-Interface DDR3/DDR4 Memory controller. It utilizes two key processes: column request determination and round-robin arbitration. The column request line is set by 'rts_col' AND-ed with either a rank config control signal or an inserted maintenance request, both inverted. An arbiter, 'row_col_arb0', is employed to regulate the access requests for row and column based on the status of 'granted_row_ns', 'granted_col_ns' and 'upd_last_master', further distributing the access grants to 'block_grant_col' and 'block_grant_row'. The 'current_master' is derived from the state of the 'granted_row_ns' and 'row_col_grant'."
