    "block_comment": "This Verilog block handles the synchronous assignment of two signals `rdlvl_wr_r` and `calib_wrdata_en` relative to the rising edge of clock signal `clk`. It ensures that these registers are updated in the next clock cycle with a delay specified by `TCQ`. Using non-blocking assignments guarantees the simultaneous update of these registers within the same clock cycle."
