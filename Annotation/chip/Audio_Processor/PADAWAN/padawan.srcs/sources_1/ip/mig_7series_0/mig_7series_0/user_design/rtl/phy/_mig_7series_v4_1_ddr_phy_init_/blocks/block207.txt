Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for managing external internal reference requests `ext_int_ref_req` based on different state conditions in the initialization cycle of a controller module. When the reset signal `rst` is high or the initialization state `init_state_r` is at `INIT_RDLVL_COMPLEX_READ`, the code block de-asserts the `ext_int_ref_req` signal. Conversely, if `init_state_r` equals `INIT_RDLVL_ACT_WAIT` and `complex_rdlvl_int_ref_req` is high, it asserts `ext_int_ref_req`. All specified changes occur at the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`.
