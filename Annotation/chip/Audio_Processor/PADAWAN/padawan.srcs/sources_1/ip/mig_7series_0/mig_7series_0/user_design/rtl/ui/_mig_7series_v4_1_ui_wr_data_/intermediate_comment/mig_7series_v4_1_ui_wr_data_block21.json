    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for controlling the 'ready' flag for the write data buffer in response to the rising edge of the clock signal. It uses a non-blocking assignment, thus allowing the 'app_wdf_rdy_r' to be updated concurrently with other code. The ready flag status is later assigned to 'app_wdf_rdy'. In addition, if the MC_SVA module is defined, the logic also checks to ensure the buffer is not full when the reset flag is negative, and the ready flag is not set, which could otherwise lead to a buffer overflow. This check is performed at every rising edge of the clock."
