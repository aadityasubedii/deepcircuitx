Comment: 
This function calculates the factorial of an input integer. It begins by checking if the input is equal to 1, in which case it directly assigns the return value to 1. If the input is not equal to 1, it initializes the result to 1 and initiates a loop that multiplies the result by every integer ranging from 2 to the input integer.
