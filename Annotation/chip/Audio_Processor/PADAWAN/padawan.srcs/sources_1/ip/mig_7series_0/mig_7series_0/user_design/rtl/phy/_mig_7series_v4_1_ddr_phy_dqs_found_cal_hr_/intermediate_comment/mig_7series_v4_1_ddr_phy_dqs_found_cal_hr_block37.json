    "block_comment": "This block of code is a sequential always block in Verilog, whose purpose is to control the reset condition for PI (Phase Interpolator) calibration stage 1 in DDR (Double Data Rate) memory interface specifically for bank 2. The block operates with the rising edge of the clock signal (posedge clk). Initially, when reset (rst) is active or fine_adjust is high, it pushes logical low (0) to pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1[2]. If pi_rst_stg1_cal_r[2] is high, then pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1[2] is set to logical high (1). If there is no successfully found dqs signal in any or all banks (presence of 0 signal in pi_dqs_found_any_bank_r[2] and pi_dqs_found_all_bank[2]), it resets the pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1[2] to logical 0. All transitions are timed with #TCQ (Timing Control Quantums) to synchronize the operations."
