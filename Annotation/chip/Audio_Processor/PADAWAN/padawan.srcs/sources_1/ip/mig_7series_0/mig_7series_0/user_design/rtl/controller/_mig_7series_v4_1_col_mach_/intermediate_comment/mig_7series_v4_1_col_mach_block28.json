    "block_comment": "The selected block of Verilog code generates a register when the `DELAY_WR_DATA_CNTRL` is equal to one (`1`). The creation of the register, `col_wr_data_buf_addr_r`, is conditional (only when `DELAY_WR_DATA_CNTRL` equals `1`), and its purpose is to hold the address data for the write data buffer with a bit width specified by `DATA_BUF_ADDR_WIDTH`."
