Comment: 
This block is a single-line sequential logic unit that latches the value of "inv_poc_sample_ns" into "inv_poc_sample_r" upon a positive edge of the clock signal. Adhering to a delay specified by "#TCQ", it ensures a secure latching operation in the right clock domain by mitigating potential metastability issues.
