    "block_comment": "The block assigns a new address for a write operation in a buffer memory. The new address is generated by concatenating `rd_data_addr[3:0]` and `rd_data_offset`, where `rd_data_addr[3:0]` represents the four least significant bits of the read data address and `rd_data_offset` represents the offset for the data. This allows for alignment and positioning of write locations in the buffer within the given memory address range."
