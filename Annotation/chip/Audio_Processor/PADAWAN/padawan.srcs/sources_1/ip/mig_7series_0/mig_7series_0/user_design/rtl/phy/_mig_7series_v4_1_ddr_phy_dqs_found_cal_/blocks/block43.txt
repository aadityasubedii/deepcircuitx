Comment: 
This block of code is a sequential logic block that carries out data pipeline in the input signals on rising edge of the clock. The pipeline implementation takes a new input on every rising edge of the clock and perform a series of bitstream shifts at each clock cycle. This results in delayed versions of various input signals such as 'pi_dqs_found_lanes', 'init_dqsfound_done_r' and 'rank_done_r', 'dqsfound_retry' as indicated by the '_r<digit>' suffixes. These may be used elsewhere in the code to synchronize operations or to introduce a delay. The delaying operation is implemented with non-blocking assignments to ensure concurrency and correctness over multiple clock cycles.
