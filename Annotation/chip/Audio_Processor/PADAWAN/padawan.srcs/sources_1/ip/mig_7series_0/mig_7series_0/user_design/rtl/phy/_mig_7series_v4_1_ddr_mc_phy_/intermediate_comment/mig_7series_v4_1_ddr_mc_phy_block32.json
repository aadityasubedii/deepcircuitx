    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the reset of certain outputs in a synchronous design. It does this by checking for the positive edge of either the 'auxout_clk' or 'rst_auxout' signals. If the reset 'rst_auxout' signal is on, the values of 'aux_out[1]' and 'aux_out[3]' are immediately set to 0 with a delay of 100 units. However, if 'rst_auxout' is not active, 'aux_out[1]' and 'aux_out[3]' are set to the values of 'aux_out_[1]' and 'aux_out_[3]' respectively, after a delay of 100 units."
