    "block_comment": "The block of code is essentially a resettable counter controlled by the 'clk' and 'rst' signals. It counts the delay taps required for a specific slice in the design. On the positive edge of the clock signal, the counter is either reset to zero if 'rst' is asserted, or it takes the precalculated value from the multi-dimensional array 'idelay_tap_cnt_r' indexed by 'rnk_cnt_r' and 'cal1_cnt_cpt_timing'."
