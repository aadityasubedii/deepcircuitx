    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is designed to handle the register initialization and memory chip selection based on the state of the system. Upon each clock edge, if the reset signal is high, the hardware initializes the internal chip select signal to a default value. Similarly, if the machine is in the 'register write' state, the code performs initialization and based on the value of CWL_M, it updates select bits of the chip select signal. In all other conditions, the code updates the chip select signal based on the machine state and the chip count. Various chip-selecting operations inside case statements are executed based on the current state, which is further determined by certain condition checks. The updating operation is implemented with TCQ-delayed assignments which are contained in iterative loops that vary depending on the value of CWL_M."
