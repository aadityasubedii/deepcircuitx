This block is employing an instantiation of a high-speed clock buffer, `BUFH`, to carry an internally generated high-speed clock signal, `pll_clk3_out`, to other modules using the `pll_clk3` output. This function assists in reducing clock skew and latency across the FPGA chip. This is achieved via the `BUFH` buffer which serves as a distribution point for the clock signal, routing it quickly and simultaneously to various logic blocks which are the consumers of this clock. With the buffer, the design ensures that all consuming logic components receive the clock signal almost at the same time, minimizing clock skew. Thus, the code block describes an essential part in achieving reliable high-speed digital circuits.
