This block is responsible for assigning various status and validation flags to elements of the dbg_phy_wrcal array. Specifically, it assigns early1_data_match_r and early2_data_match_r signals to elements 88 and 89 respectively, representing two initial data matching conditions. Element 90 receives the result of bitwise AND operation between wrcal_sanity_chk_r (write calibration sanity check) and pat_data_match_valid_r (pattern data match validation) flags. The write calibration sanity check flag is also assigned directly to element 91. Lastly, wrcal_sanity_chk_done (indicating completion of the write calibration sanity check) is assigned to element 92. Each assignment directly maps a specific control or status signal to an element of the dbg_phy_wrcal array for monitoring and debugging purposes.
