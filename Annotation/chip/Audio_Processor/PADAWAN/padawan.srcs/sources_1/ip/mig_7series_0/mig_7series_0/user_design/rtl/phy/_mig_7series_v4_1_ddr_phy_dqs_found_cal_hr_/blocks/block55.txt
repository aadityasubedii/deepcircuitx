This block of code is designed to handle data detection on each clock edge for different banks in a memory system. On each clock edge, if a reset signal is issued, the code will iteratively reset all data lane detection flags for all memory banks. Otherwise, if the data detection process is started, using 'pi_dqs_found_start' signal, the block searches through each data lane in all memory banks. For each bank, it detects whether data is present in any or all lanes by logically evaluating the 'DATA_PRESENT' signals with internal data detection flags. Consequently, this block aims to aggregate data presence information across various data lanes for each memory bank, either on reset or data detection activation.
