    "block_comment": "This block manages the prbs_gen_clk_en signal which seems to control a clock enable function for a pseudo-random binary sequence generator in the given system. The signal is set to '0' when there is a system reset, some specific count condition meets, or a certain process completes. On the other hand, prbs_gen_clk_en is enabled (set to '1') during non-empty interface states, completion of some stage, and during several specific states of an initiation process. Various system states and counts are used to control the enabling of this clock, indicating a complex system state machine might be involved."
