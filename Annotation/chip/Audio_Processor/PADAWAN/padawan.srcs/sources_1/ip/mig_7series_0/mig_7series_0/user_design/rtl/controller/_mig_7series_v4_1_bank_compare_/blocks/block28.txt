Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code has the function of assigning the value of the local variable 'req_size_r_lcl' to the wire 'req_size_r'. The 'assign' keyword is used for continuous assignments in Verilog which makes the target wire take the value of the given expression (in this case, the variable 'req_size_r_lcl') right after it changes.
