Comment: 
The block of code sets a local parameter called RAW_BIT_WIDTH, which is used to represent the difference between PAYLOAD_WIDTH and DATA_WIDTH. PAYLOAD_WIDTH and DATA_WIDTH are two constants, likely defined elsewhere in the code. Using local parameters in Verilog, a hardware description language, allows for setting design-specific values that don't change during the operation of the code. Thus, the calculation of RAW_BIT_WIDTH sets up a constant for the size of the raw bit width based on the payload and data widths.
