Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for updating the values of `send_cmd0_row` and `send_cmd1_row` based on changes to `sent_row_or_maint` and `sent_row_or_maint_r`. This is achieved by employing an `always` block that is triggered whenever `sent_row_or_maint` or `sent_row_or_maint_r` changes in value; within this block, `send_cmd0_row` is set to the value of `sent_row_or_maint_r`, and `send_cmd1_row` is assigned the value of `sent_row_or_maint`.
