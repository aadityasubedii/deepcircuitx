Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for signal assignment. Specifically, it transfers the value of the local signal "accept_ns_lcl" to the "accept_ns" signal. This assignment is concurrent and happens whenever the value of the 'accept_ns_lcl' changes. This is a non-blocking type of assignment that is often used to avoid race conditions in sequential logic.
