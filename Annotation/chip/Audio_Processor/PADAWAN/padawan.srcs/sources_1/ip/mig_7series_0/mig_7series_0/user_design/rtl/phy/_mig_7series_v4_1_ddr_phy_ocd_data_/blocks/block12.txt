Comment: 
The block stores next state data at clock signal's positive edge. Utilizing a delay of #TCQ, the 'data_bytes_ns' is assigned to 'data_bytes_r' whenever there is a rising edge in the clock signal. This serves as a simple D flip-flop with asynchronous set and reset. The purpose of this code could be to synchronously update data, to prevent glitches and metastability in sequential logic, following the clock frequency.
