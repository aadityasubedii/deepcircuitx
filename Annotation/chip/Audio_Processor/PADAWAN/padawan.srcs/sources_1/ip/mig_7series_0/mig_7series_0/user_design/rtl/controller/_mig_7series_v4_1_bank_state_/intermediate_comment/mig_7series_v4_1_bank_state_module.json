    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/*\nThis module manages bank state for a memory interface generator, controlling\nactivation, read, write, and precharge operations for a single bank. It\nimplements complex timing logic, prioritization mechanisms, and interfaces\nwith other bank machines. The module uses state machines and counters to\ntrack various timing parameters, handle request priorities, and manage\nrefresh operations. It coordinates with the PHY layer for command and data\ntransfer, ensuring proper timing and preventing conflicts in multi-bank\nmemory systems.\n*/"
