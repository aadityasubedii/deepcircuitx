Comment: 
This block of Verilog code primarily executes clock synchronization and reset signal management. It responds to positive edges of the divided clock signal (`clk_div2`) or the temporary reset signal (`rst_tmp`). If `rst_tmp` is high, two registers `rstdiv2_sync_r` and `rstdiv2_sync_r1` are filled with logic '1's. Alternatively, if `rst_tmp` is low, the block performs a left shift operation on `rstdiv2_sync_r` and assigns the second last bit of `rstdiv2_sync_r` to `rstdiv2_sync_r1`. Delay is imposed using `#TCQ` to simulate propagation delay, maintaining the logical correctness of the design.
