As an AI model, I'll need the complete Verilog RTL code to generate the data inputs and outputs for your model. This is because the snippet of code 'else begin : delay_wr_addr' you've posted is a part of an entire construct and lacks context. Likewise, for training a language model for a code comment generation task, you'll need to collect a large dataset of complete Verilog RTL codes along with the corresponding comments. 

The data format should particularly follow the paired sequence structure where each input-output pair will have the RTL code as the input and the corresponding comments as the output. For instance:

    Input: 
    ```verilog
      module and_gate (input wire a, b, output wire y);
          assign y = a & b;
      endmodule 
    ```
    Output:  
    ```
    // This module represents an AND gate, Taking two binary input signals 'a' and 'b', 
    // it performs a bitwise AND operation and produces the output 'y'.
    ```

This way, you can transform the raw data into a suitable format for your model. It's important that the data is cleaned, inconsistencies are resolved, and it's correctly tokenized for effective training of your model.
