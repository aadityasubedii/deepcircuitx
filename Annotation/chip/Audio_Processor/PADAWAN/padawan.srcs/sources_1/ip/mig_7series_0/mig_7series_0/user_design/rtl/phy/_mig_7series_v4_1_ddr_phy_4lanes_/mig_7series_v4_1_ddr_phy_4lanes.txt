Module-level comment: This module implements a DDR PHY interface for 7 series FPGAs, supporting up to 4 byte lanes. It manages timing, calibration, and signal integrity for DDR memory operations using PHASER_IN, PHASER_OUT, and IDELAYCTRL components. The module handles clock generation, data alignment, and calibration processes for read/write operations. It is organized into sections for each byte lane, with a PHY_CONTROL block for overall management. The design incorporates configurable parameters for flexibility across different FPGA configurations and memory interfaces.
