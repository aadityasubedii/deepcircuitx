Comment: 
This block of Verilog code controls a write leveling counter, `enable_wrlvl_cnt`, by using a synchronous reset and various conditions. When the reset signal `rst` is raised, it forces the counter to be zero. If the state of initialization is `INIT_WRLVL_START` or `wrlvl_odt` along with counter being zero, the counter is set to 21. If neither condition is true and the counter is positive but neither `phy_ctl_full` nor `phy_cmd_full` signals are asserted, it decrements the counter by 1. The use of `#TCQ` ensures timely setting of `enable_wrlvl_cnt` relative to `clk`.
