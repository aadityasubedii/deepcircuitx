Comment: 
The block of code is used to control activation requests for different ranks. It checks the status of an existing activation request (`act_wait_r`), and if the request is active, it checks which rank (`req_rank_r`) the request is intended for. It then uses a loop to go through all available ranks and sets the `act_this_rank_ns` bit corresponding to the requested rank to 1, while the rest are set to 0.
