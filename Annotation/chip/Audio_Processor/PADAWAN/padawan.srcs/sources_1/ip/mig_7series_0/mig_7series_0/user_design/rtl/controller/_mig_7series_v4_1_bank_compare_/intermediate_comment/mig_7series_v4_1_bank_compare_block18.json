    "block_comment": "The block assigns the value of one register to another. Specifically, the value of 'req_bank_r_lcl' is assigned to 'req_bank_r'. It is a simple assignment operation performed at every positive edge of the clock cycle. The result will be that 'req_bank_r' will have the same value as 'req_bank_r_lcl' after the assignment operation."
