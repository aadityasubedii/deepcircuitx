    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code extracts specific data widths from the 'rd_data' and 'compare_data' inputs. The data widths are defined by the 'DQ_WIDTH' variable. For 'rd_data', eight different data widths are identified and assigned to different variables: 'rd_data_riseX' and 'rd_data_fallX', where 'X' ranges from 0 to 3. Similarly, for 'compare_data', eight different data widths are extracted and assigned to 'compare_data_rX' and 'compare_data_fX', where 'X' also ranges from 0 to 3. "
