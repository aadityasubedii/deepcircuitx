    "block_comment": "This block in Verilog RTL code is used to declare an output variable `samp_result` that is a 2-bit wide bus, and to assign it the value of a logic variable `samp_result_ns`. The code enables sampling results from the next state logic block `samp_result_ns` and outputting the value via `samp_result`. This assignment operation happens concurrently and continuously, meaning any changes in the value of `samp_result_ns` will immediately be reflected in `samp_result`."
