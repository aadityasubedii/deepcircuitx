This block primarily functions to manage a counter (add_rrd_ns) according to activity status (act_this_rank), current counter value (add_rrd_r), or a reset indicator (rst). If a reset condition is encountered, the counter (add_rrd_ns) resets to zero. Next, if the activity status (act_this_rank) is active, the counter is set to a specific value derived from nRRD_CLKS, considering the counter width. If these conditions are not met but the current counter value is non-zero, it decrements the counter by 1.
