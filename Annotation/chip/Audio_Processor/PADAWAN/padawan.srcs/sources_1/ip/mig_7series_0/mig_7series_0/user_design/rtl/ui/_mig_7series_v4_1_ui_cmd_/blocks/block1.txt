Comment: 
This block of code determines data transfer operations, their sizes, and priority, along with the acceptability of read and write requests. Three parameters (size, cmd, and hi_priority) are established conditional on the readiness of the application (app_rdy_r), with variations in the event readiness is unconfirmed. Boolean expressions define the conditions for acceptability of read (rd) and write (wr) requests, which are determined by specific designated bit patterns. By integrating the generated write and read commands with local address usage confirmation (use_addr_lcl) and application readiness, the block also validates the acceptability of read (rd_accepted) and write (wr_accepted) requests. Lastly, this block assigns data buffer address based on the write condition.
