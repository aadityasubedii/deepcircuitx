This block is responsible for controlling the write data enable signal (`wr_data_en`). It uses a ternary operator to decide its behavior based on the control constant `DELAY_WR_DATA_CNTRL`. If `DELAY_WR_DATA_CNTRL` is set to 1, it enables writing data when `sent_col_r1` is high or when `offset_r1` has at least one bit high and read/write condition for column (`col_rd_wr_r1`) is not ongoing. Otherwise, it enables writing data when `sent_col` is high or when `offset_r` has at least one bit high and read/write condition for a column (`col_rd_wr`) is not ongoing.
