    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a register update condition in a synchronous digital system. The register `up_r` is updated with the next-state value `up_ns` at every positive edge of the clock signal `clk`, after a delay of `TCQ` simulation time units. This infers a flip-flop with a setup time `TCQ`, essential for sequential logic."
