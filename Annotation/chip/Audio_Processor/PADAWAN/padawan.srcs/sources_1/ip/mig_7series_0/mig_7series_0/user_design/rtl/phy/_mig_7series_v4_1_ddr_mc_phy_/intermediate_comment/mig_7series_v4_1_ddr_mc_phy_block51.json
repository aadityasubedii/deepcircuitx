    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns values to a range within an array, `ddr_clk`, based on calculated shifts of entries in a second array, `ddr_clk_w`. The assignments occur contingent on specific 16-bit hex identifiers. The extracted sections of `ddr_clk_w` are calculated by shifting the values 12, 24, or 36 bits to the right, or not shifting at all, depending on the hex identifier. Then an AND operation is performed with `2'b11` to possibly truncate these shifted values before assigning them to the appropriate range within `ddr_clk`."
