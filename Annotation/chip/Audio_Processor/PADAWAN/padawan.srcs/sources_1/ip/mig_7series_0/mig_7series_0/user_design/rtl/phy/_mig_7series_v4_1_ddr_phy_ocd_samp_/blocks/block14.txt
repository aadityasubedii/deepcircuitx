[Function of the Block] This block is responsible for assigning the value of the variable `rd_victim_sel_r` to the variable `rd_victim_sel`. [Implementation Details of the Block] The assignment is immediate as per Verilog semantics. This is accomplished using the 'assign' keyword, which means the value of `rd_victim_sel` would immediately update as soon as `rd_victim_sel_r` changes. This block of code is usually part of a larger hierarchical RTL where `rd_victim_sel` could be used further in the code after its value has been updated timely.
