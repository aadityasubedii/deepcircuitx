    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code initiates the conditional construct when nRCD_CLKS exceeds the value of 2 ('else if (nRCD_CLKS > 2)'). It checks whether the value carried by nRCD_CLKS (likely to be a timer or a counter) is greater than 2, and only then, it executes the block of code nested within. The part labeled rcd_timer_gt_2 includes a register declaration 'rcd_timer_ns' with a width specified by RCD_TIMER_WIDTH, which is likely used for handling precise timing operations in the system where ns probably means 'nanoseconds'. If nRCD_CLKS is not greater than 2, this block will be bypassed. So, this block seems specifically tailored to manage certain operations under specific timing conditions."
