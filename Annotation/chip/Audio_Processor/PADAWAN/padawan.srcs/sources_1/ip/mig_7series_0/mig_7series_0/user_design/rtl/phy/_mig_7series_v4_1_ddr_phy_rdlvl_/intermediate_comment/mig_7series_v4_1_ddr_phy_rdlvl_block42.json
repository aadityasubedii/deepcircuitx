    "block_comment": "This block is mainly responsible for pattern detection in incoming data. On the rising edge of the clock, it checks if certain rising and falling patterns (denoted as 'rise0', 'fall0', 'rise1', 'fall1') occur in the data, with '#TCQ' indicating timing control for the check. If all the specified rising and falling patterns match, then 'idel_pat0_data_match_r' is set to true, indicating a pattern match for 'idel_pat0'. This combination of condition checking basically allows for pattern recognition with respect to rising and falling edges."
