    "block_comment": "This block of code is part of a state machine involved in initializing an MPR operation. The block is responsible for setting the next state to `INIT_MPR_WAIT`, implying a transition from the current state `INIT_MPR_RDEN` where typically some read enable operation occurs, to a wait state where the process will stay until specific conditions are met. The transition is done by simply assigning the state `INIT_MPR_WAIT` to the variable `init_next_state`."
