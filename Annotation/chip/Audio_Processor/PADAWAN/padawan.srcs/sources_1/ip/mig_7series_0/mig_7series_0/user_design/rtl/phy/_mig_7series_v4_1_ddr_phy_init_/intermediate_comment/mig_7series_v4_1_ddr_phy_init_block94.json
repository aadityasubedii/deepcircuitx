    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for handling the read-done signal for the first row of a complex operation. The block operates based on the system clock. Whenever a reset signal is received, the read-done signal for the first row is reset to 0. This also happens when the 'prbs_rdlvl_done_pulse' becomes true or when the counter for complex sampling gets incremented. However, if the starting signals for either 'prbs_rdlvl' or 'complex_oclkdelay_calib' become true, and the write-read counter is equal to 2 with both the first and second rows write-done signals being true, the block sets the first row read-done signal to 1, marking that the first row's read operation is complete."
