    "block_comment": "This block of code is involved with the assignment of input data to the read buffer. It concatenates certain elements to form a block of input data, involving usage of error correction codes (ECC). It achieves this by using an `assign` operation to build `rd_buf_in_data` using a concatenation of several pieces of data. Specifically, it appends zero-padding (6 remaining bits filled with '0' binary values), a single error correction code, a multiple error correction code, and finally, the `rd_data` itself."
