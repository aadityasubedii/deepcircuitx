    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements PRBS read leveling for DDR memory interfaces. It calibrates timing by adjusting delay taps to find optimal read data sampling points. Using a state machine, it performs pattern comparison, DQS increment/decrement, and tap calculation. The module supports both coarse and fine-grained per-bit delay adjustments, iteratively finding the best timing window for each DQS group. It processes input data, compares against expected patterns, and adjusts PI (Phase Interpolator) settings to achieve optimal read timing across all bits."
