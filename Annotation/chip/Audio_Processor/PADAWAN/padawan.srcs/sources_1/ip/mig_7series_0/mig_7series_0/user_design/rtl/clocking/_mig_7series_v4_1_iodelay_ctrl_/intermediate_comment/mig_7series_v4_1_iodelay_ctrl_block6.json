    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code is primarily responsible for the assignment of a reset signal. The particular signal being assigned is `rst_tmp_idelay` and it is given the value of `sys_rst_act_hi`. This is a direct assignment operation, so the reset signal `rst_tmp_idelay` will mirror the state of `sys_rst_act_hi`. Therefore, when the `sys_rst_act_hi` signal is asserted high, the `rst_tmp_idelay` will also be asserted high, effectively initializing or resetting the specific stage or part of the system that `rst_tmp_idelay` controls."
