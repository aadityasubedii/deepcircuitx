    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code essentially serves as a datapath component for propagating read data. The output wire `rd_merge_data` with bit width `2*nCK_PER_CLK*DATA_WIDTH` is being defined and assigned the value of `buf_out_data[2*nCK_PER_CLK*DATA_WIDTH-1:0]`. Hence, the function of this block is to transfer the data read from the buffer output, `buf_out_data`, to the `rd_merge_data` wire. The implementation is done using an assignment statement which links the buffer output to the defined output wire, thus enabling the propagation of the read data."
