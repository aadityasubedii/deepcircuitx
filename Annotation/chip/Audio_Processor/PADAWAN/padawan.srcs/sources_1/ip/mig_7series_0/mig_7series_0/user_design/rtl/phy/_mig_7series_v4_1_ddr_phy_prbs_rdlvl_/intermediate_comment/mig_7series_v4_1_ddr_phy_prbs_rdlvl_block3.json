    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily functions in two different states, RD_DONE_WAIT_FOR_PI_INC_DEC and PRBS_DONE. In ther RD_DONE_WAIT_FOR_PI_INC_DEC phase, it checks if the complex activity is starting and doesn't have read level error. If conditions are satisfied, it determines state of the pseudo random binary sequence (PRBS). In the PRBS_DONE phase, several binary parameters are reset to 0 and only prbs_rdlvl_done takes inverse of complex read level error. The parameters being reset or updated are mainly related to the sequence read level and read address operations, assisting in controlling and managing these operations."
