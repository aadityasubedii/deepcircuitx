Comment: 
The block handles signal thresholding. It starts by assigning the values of `samps_zero_r` and `samps_one_r` to `samps_zero_ns` and `samps_one_ns` respectively. Then, it compares `samps_lo` with `samps_solid_thresh` and `samps_hi_r` with `samps_solid_thresh`. If either `samps_lo` or `samps_hi_r` are greater or equal to `samps_solid_thresh`, `samps_zero_ns` and `samps_one_ns` are updated again. This simplifies sampling data and eliminates signal fluctuation.
