    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is focused on implementing a DDR byte lane block, specifically for byte lane 'C'. This byte lane block is instantiated only when the corresponding bit (3rd bit) in BYTE_LANES is set. When active, the byte lane block uses the 'mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_byte_lane' module which contains various parameters and I/O signal interfaces such as AB, CD control signals, Bitlanes, FIFO parameters, speed grade, and many more. The module is used to handle data output remapping, memory read/write operations, phase-locked loops, and delay controls for the DDR interface. If byte lane 'C' is not used (indicated by 'BYTE_LANES[2]' being unset), then the else-clause sets default values for the output signals associated with ddr_byte_lane_C."
