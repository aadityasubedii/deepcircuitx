    "block_comment": "This block signals the readiness of an output port in Verilog. It works through the use of \"assign\", implying continuous assignment, delegating the value of \"po_rdy_r\" to \"po_rdy\". This operation happens in every simulation time unit, keeping the readiness state of the output port up to date."
