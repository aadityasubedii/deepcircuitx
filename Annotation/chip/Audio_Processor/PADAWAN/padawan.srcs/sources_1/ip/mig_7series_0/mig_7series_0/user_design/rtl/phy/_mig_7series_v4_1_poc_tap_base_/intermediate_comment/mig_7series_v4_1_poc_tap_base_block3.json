    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code is assigning the value of the register 'samps_one_r' to the wire 'samps_one'. This operation is usually done to transfer some intermediate or final result held in the register to the wire for further use in the execution sequence or output. Remember that in Verilog, wires reflect the output of a digital system and registers serve as storage units within the digital system."
