    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code assigns the value of 'rd_data' to the signal 'app_rd_data' in every simulation cycle where 'rd_data' alters its value. The always block, by triggering and executing upon changes in 'rd_data', is effectively used to bind the two signals, creating a defined path for the 'rd_data' signal updates to be transmitted to the 'app_rd_data' signal throughout the simulation."
