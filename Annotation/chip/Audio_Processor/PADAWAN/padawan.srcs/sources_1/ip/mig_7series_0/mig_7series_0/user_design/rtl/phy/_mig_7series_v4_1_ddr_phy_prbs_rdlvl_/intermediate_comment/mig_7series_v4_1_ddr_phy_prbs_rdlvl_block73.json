    "block_comment": "This block of code is mainly designed for triggering events based on clock edges and controlling debug pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) edge taps. In the implementation, a clock signal causes state updates. When a reset condition is met, both `dbg_prbs_first_edge_taps` and `dbg_prbs_second_edge_taps` are set to zero. However, during the PRBS calculation phase, if the first edge and second edge are found, their respective taps are updated. Similarly, in the fine calculation phase, if the stage counter equals 2, the first edge and second edge taps are updated with corresponding calculated values.\n"
