Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for updating the value of the register `head_r` at the rising edge of the clock signal `clk`. The new value is assigned after a delay specified by `TCQ`, based on the next-state value of `head_ns`. This is a typical synchronous design pattern in Verilog and is used to buffer changes to the `head_r` register, thereby ensuring they occur consistently relative to the clock signal.
