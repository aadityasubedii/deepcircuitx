This block of code is used to duplicate raw bits from a given data set (ecc_rddata_r) to another data set (rd_data). If the RAW_BIT_WIDTH is greater than zero, this code will continuously copy raw bits from the original data set to the new one for 2*nCK_PER_CLK times. This happens in a loop where for every step, a certain number of raw bits (determined by PAYLOAD_WIDTH and RAW_BIT_WIDTH) from the original data set are copied to the corresponding location in the new data set, again defined by PAYLOAD_WIDTH and RAW_BIT_WIDTH.
