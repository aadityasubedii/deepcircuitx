The block of code is designed to handle and update the state of data queues in phase interpolator for all available banks and any bank respectively, based on the rising edge clock signal. This is achieved using non-blocking assignments in an always block; the updated values of 'pi_dqs_found_all_bank' and 'pi_dqs_found_any_bank' are stored in 'pi_dqs_found_all_bank_r' and 'pi_dqs_found_any_bank_r' respectively after a delay determined by 'TCQ'.
