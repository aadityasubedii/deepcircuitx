This block is responsible for resetting and setting a tap limit counter. On every positive edge of the clock, if there is a reset request, new counter or some specific conditions related to calibration state or multipurpose register read level are met, the tap limit counter is reset to zero. If not meeting these conditions but the tap count counter equals to 63, the tap limit counter is set to 1.
