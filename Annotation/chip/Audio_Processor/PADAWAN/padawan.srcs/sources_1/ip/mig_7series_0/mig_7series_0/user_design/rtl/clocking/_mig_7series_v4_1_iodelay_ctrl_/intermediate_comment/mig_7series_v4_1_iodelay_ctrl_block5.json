    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for a conditional logic reset assignment within a generate statement in a verilog design. When the condition `REF_CLK_MMCM_IODELAY_CTRL` is set to \"TRUE\", this block of code will trigger a synchronous reset `rst_tmp_idelay` or a clock edge signal `clk_ref[1]`. This conditional block of code is labeled as `rst_ref_gen_1`."
