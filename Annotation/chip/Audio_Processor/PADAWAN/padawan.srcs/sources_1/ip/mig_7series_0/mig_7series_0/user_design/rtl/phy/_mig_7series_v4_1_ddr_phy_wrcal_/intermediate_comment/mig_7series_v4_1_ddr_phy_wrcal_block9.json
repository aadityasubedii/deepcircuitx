    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code carries out data matching operations conditioned upon the rising and falling edges of signals over two cycle intervals, \"early1\" and \"early2\". On each positive edge of the clock, the block updates the results of AND operations on match rise and match fall signals after a delay determined by the time constant TCQ. In the \"early1\" cycle, this is done independently, while in the \"early2\" cycle, the operations are coordinated with the \"rd_active_r3\" signal. Once all the match rise and match fall signals have been processed, the results are combined by a series of AND operations to give the overall match results for the \"early1\" and \"early2\" cycles."
