This block of code is responsible for updating read data offsets for different ranks based on calibration read data offsets. To achieve this, the block is listening for changes on the variables `calib_rddata_offset`, `calib_rddata_offset_1`, and `calib_rddata_offset_2`. Whenever any of these variables change, the 6 least-significant bits of each calibration read data offset ([5:0] bit slice) are assigned to respective `rank_rddata_offset`.
