    "block_comment": "This block of code is a flip-flop that captures the value of the 'prbs_ignore_first_byte' signal on every rising edge of the clock 'clk'. By using non-blocking assignments and timing control, this block delays the 'prbs_ignore_first_byte' input and assigns the value to the 'prbs_ignore_first_byte_r' signal with the delay defined by '#TCQ'. The implementation ensures the signal status is sampled and updated synchronously with respect to the system clock, critical in staged or pipelined designs for correct logical progression."
