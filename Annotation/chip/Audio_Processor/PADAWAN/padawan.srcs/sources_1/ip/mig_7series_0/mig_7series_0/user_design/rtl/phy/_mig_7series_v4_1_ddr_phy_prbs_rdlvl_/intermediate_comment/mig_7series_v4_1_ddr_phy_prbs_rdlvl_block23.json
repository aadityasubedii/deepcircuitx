    "block_comment": "The block of code handles the update of the reference bit count (`ref_bit_per_bit`) under various conditions, acting essentially as a synchronised state control. It leverages the system clock (`clk`) as its trigger and resets (`rst`) as the primary control points. When a reset is called or if the PRBS generator state (`prbs_state_r`) is waiting for a new DQS signal (`PRBS_NEW_DQS_WAIT`), the reference bit count is reset to 0. However, under the condition of the PRBS generator transitioning to a stage of fine PI increment (`FINE_PI_INC`) and if the stage counter (`stage_cnt`) is zero, the reference bit per bit value is updated with the left edge update signal (`left_edge_updated`). This balance of controls and dependencies ensures a dynamic response of the system under various scenarios."
