Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for managing the data read operation status from an application in a hardware system. The `app_rd_data_valid_ns` is assigned based on whether the RAM initialization has completed and whether the operation is a bypass operation or read data is ready. The `app_rd_data_end_ns` indicates if current reading operation has ended or not, which is determined by the bypass situation or the second bit status of read status.
