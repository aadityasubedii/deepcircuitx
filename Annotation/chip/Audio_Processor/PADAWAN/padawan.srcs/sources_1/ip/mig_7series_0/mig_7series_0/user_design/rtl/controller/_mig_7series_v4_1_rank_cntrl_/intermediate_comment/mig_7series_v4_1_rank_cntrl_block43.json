    "block_comment": "This block is a counter setup for a round-robin distributor (rrd) in the module. This is conditional upon two parameters, nADD_RRD being greater than 0 and ADD_RRD_CNTR_WIDTH being greater than 1. When these conditions are met, two registers, add_rrd_ns and add_rrd_r, are defined with bit-widths equal to ADD_RRD_CNTR_WIDTH. These registers will likely be used for the next state and current state of the round-robin distributor respectively."
