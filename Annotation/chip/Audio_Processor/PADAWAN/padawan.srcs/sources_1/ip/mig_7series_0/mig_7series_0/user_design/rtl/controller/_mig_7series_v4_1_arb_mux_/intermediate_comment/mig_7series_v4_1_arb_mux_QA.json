This arbiter decides which inputs should be routed to the outputs at any given point in time. It receives various inputs regarding commands, banks, rank, row, and column specifications along with requests and grants for read/write cycles. It also receives control signals like clock (clk), reset (rst), and calibration signals. Based on these inputs, it outputs the commands and addresses to be used by the memory controller for operation, including the handling of signals for specific periodic reads, read modification writes, row and column addresses, chip selects, and other various tasks related to the management and operation of the memory interface."
