    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles rank processing in a design where the ranks are determined by the constant 'RANKS' and the highest active bank is determined by the constant 'HIGHEST_BANK'. Therein is declared a generate structure that includes a loop iterating through the ranks. Within the loop, an array of 6-bit registers ('final_do_cand') is instantiated for each rank. There's also a condition that checks whether the value of 'HIGHEST_BANK' is 3 but the action corresponding to this condition is not provided in the given block."
