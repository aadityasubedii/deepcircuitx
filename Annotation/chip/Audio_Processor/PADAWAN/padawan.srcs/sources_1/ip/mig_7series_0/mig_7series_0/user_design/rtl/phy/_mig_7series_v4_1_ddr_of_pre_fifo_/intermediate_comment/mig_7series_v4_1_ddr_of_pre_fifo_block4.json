    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines the operation of a write pointer for a buffer. Implemented within a clocked always block, it responds to a rising edge clock signal. In the presence of a reset signal, the write pointer and its timing counterpart are set to zero. However, in absence of a reset but with the presence of a write enable signal and given conditions, the write pointer and the timing pointer are updated to the value of 'nxt_wr_ptr'. The particular conditions for this update involve certain full and empty flags related to the buffer status."
