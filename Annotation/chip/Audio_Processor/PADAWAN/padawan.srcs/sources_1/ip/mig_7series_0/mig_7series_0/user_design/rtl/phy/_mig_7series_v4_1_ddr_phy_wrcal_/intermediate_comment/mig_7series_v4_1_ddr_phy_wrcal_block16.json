    "block_comment": "This block of code is tasked with detecting edges (rising and falling) in the data stream, and capturing these events in a set of registers. The operation is synchronized with a rising edge of the clock signal. Technically, at each clock tick, the code assigns new values to a series of registers named `early2_match_rise{0..3}_and_r` and `early2_match_fall{0..3}_and_r` based on the logical AND between some delay (`#TCQ`) and the previous state of respective rising and falling registers. Lastly, the register `early2_data_match_r` is set to the logical AND of all these registers which provides an overall match when all rises and falls are detected. The delay seems to assist in handling inputs with some time constraint."
