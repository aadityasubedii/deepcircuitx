    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for error handling in a PRBS (Pseudorandom Binary Sequence) system during pattern comparison. Upon every rising edge of the clock signal, an error latch is updated based on the current state of the PRBS system. If the system is in the pattern comparison state, then possible errors ('compare_err') are captured and latched into 'compare_err_latch'. Otherwise, the latch is cleared to zero. Updates to the latch value are delayed by the technology-specific clock quantization delay ('#TCQ')."
