This block of code carries out the preparatory task of calculating pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) taps. In the initial stage, the 'complex_pi_incdec_done' signal is reset to 0, and the next state of 'prbs_state_r' depends on the 'fine_calib' condition. When the 'center_comp' is true and 'fine_calib' is false, tap edges are computed based on if the 1st and 2nd PRBS edges have been found or not, with 'largest_left_edge' and 'smallest_right_edge' being set accordingly using pre-defined delay '#TCQ'.
