    "block_comment": "The function of this code is to generate different logic patterns based on the value of `nCK_PER_CLK`. When `nCK_PER_CLK` equals 4, it assigns hexadecimal values to arrays of logic nets. When `nCK_PER_CLK` equals 2, binary values are assigned. These arrays are, presumably, used elsewhere in the RTL for defining waveform patterns. The logic could therefore be used within digital clock modulation, bus communication protocols, or signal generation testing. Implementation details involve conditional statements to generate multiple unique 4-bit patterns, assigning hex values when `nCK_PER_CLK` equals 4, and binary values when it's 2."
