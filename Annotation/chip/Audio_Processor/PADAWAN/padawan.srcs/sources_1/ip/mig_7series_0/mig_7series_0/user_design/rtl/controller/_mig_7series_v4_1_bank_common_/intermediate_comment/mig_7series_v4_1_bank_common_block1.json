    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the value of `maint_end` based on a specific condition. The function of `maint_end` is assigned to be true when `rfc_zq_xsdll_timer_r` equals the constant `THREE[RFC_ZQ_TIMER_WIDTH-1:0]`. The implementation uses a conditional assignment operator to control the flow, providing a way to manage the maintenance end signal within the hardware design."
