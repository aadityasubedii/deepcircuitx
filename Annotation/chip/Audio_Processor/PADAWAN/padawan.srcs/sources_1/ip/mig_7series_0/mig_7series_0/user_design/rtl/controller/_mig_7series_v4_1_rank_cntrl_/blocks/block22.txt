Comment: 
This block generates a signal to indicate a read operation from a particular rank in a multi-bank memory system. It uses a loop that runs `nBANK_MACHS` times to scan through each bank machine, checking if currently it is sending a column (`sending_col`) and reading for this rank (`rd_this_rank_r`). The result is obtained by OR-ing with the previous value of `read_this_rank`, ensuring that `read_this_rank` is high if any bank machine fulfills the condition. The indexing is such that it handles the signal for different ranks in a bank machine in parallel.
