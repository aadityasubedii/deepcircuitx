Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for controlling the row commands, `send_cmd0_row` and `send_cmd1_row`, in response to the `sent_row_or_maint` signal. When the `sent_row_or_maint` signal experiences a change in its value, this block of code simultaneously updates the values of `send_cmd0_row` and `send_cmd1_row` to match the latest value of `sent_row_or_maint`. This is achieved through the use of an `always` block sensitive to `sent_row_or_maint` in a Verilog RTL code which provides continuous monitoring and real-time response capability.
