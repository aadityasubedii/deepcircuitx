    "block_comment": "The block is an instantiation of a phase-locked output (PHASER_OUT_PHY) module. It uses different configuration parameters such as CLKOUT_DIV, FINE_DELAY, etc. for the precise delay control of the output clock (OCLK) which is well synchronized with the system clock (SYSCLK). It also controls the data output (DQSBUS) and timestamp bus (CTSBUS) using the same offset as the output clock. FINEOVERFLOW and COARSEOVERFLOW ports ensure the overflow management. The PHASER_OUT_PHY block can be reset using the RST input pin and the reset command for OSERDES can be supplied through OSERDESRST input pin. The delay controls can be enabled or disabled using COARSEENABLE and FINEENABLE control pins."
