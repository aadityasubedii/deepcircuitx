Module-level comment: 
/*
This module manages bank state for a memory interface generator, controlling
activation, read, write, and precharge operations for a single bank. It
implements complex timing logic, prioritization mechanisms, and interfaces
with other bank machines. The module uses state machines and counters to
track various timing parameters, handle request priorities, and manage
refresh operations. It coordinates with the PHY layer for command and data
transfer, ensuring proper timing and preventing conflicts in multi-bank
memory systems.
