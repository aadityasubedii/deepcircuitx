    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code governs the operation of a timer used for RAM control functions (RFC, ZQ, SRX, SRE) along with local maintenance requests. When reset, the timer is initialized to 0. On receiving a local maintenance request, the timer is set to either nZQCS_CLKS, nXSDLL_CLKS, nRFC_CLKS, or zero based on the type of maintenance request. As long as the timer value is non-zero, it is decremented in every clock cycle."
