    "block_comment": "This block of code is tasked with controlling the output wire `demand_priority`. It implements this control using bitwise logical operations. The `demand_priority` is set to true (1) only when `demand_priority_r` is true, `demanded_prior_r` is false, and `sending_col` is also false. This suggests that the block is used for priority management in demand signals, with a priority level defined by the specific conditions of these flags."
