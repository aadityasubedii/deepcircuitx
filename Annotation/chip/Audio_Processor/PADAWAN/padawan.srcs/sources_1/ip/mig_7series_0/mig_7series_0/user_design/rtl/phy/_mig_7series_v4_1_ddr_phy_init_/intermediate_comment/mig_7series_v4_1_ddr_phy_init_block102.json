    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a write victim selector in a memory system. At each positive edge of the clock signal, if a reset signal is high, or if a write victim increment condition is met at the end of a complex row counter (represented by the number of data quantities (DQ) per data strobe (DQS) minus 1), the write victim selection is reset to zero with a delay equal to the time to read or write data (TCQ). If the first stage of read leveling is finished and a write victim increment is required, the write victim selector is incremented after the same TCQ delay."
