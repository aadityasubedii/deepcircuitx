    "block_comment": "This block is a flip-flop with preset and conditional updates, controlled by a clock signal. When a positive edge (rising edge) of the clock signal is detected, the code block checks if a reset signal is asserted. If the reset is high, it assigns value '0' to the complex_address immediately. Alternatively, if the reset is '0' and either of two condition pairs is satisfied, where the current upper level state is waiting while the previous state was not waiting, it assigns the lower COL_WIDTH bits of the phy_address to the complex_address with a delay equivalent to TCQ. These controlled transitions are essential for the timing and synchronization, particularly for operations like read-leveling and write calibration in high-speed memory systems."
