Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for assigning a value to `wl_po_fine_cnt_sel` based on the bits [5:0] from `wl_po_fine_shifted`. Specifically, it uses bit-wise selection to take the 6 least significant bits (LSB) from the `wl_po_fine_shifted` bus and assigns this value to `wl_po_fine_cnt_sel`.
