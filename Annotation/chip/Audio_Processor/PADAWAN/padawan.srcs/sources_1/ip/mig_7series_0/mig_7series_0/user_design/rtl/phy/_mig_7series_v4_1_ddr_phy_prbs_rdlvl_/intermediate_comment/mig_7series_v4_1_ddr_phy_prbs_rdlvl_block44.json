    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL primarily functions as a synchronizer working on a positive edge clock system with a reset condition. The block sets 'pi_en_stg2_f_timing' and 'pi_stg2_f_incdec_timing' to 0 during reset, or when 'prbs_tap_en_r' is no longer enabled. On the contrary, when 'prbs_tap_en_r' is active, the block sets 'pi_en_stg2_f_timing' to 1 and 'pi_stg2_f_incdec_timing' takes the incoming value of 'prbs_tap_inc_r'; all these changes occur on the next positive clock edge due to the sequential nature of always blocks in Verilog."
