    "block_comment": "The block serves as a pattern matching logic in a synchronizer design for detecting rising and falling edges in the idle patterns. It operates synchronously on a positive clock edge. Based on four conditional statements, it updates four 'match' signals ('idel_pat0_match_rise0_r', 'idel_pat0_match_fall0_r', 'idel_pat0_match_rise1_r', 'idel_pat0_match_fall1_r') corresponding to whether an idle pattern is matched or not. The comparison is performed between the idle pattern (repeated every four cycles with '%4') and the input signals ('sr_rise0_r', 'sr_fall0_r', 'sr_rise1_r', 'sr_fall1_r') for detecting rises and falls in the signal. After each latch comparison, the 'match' signals are updated using non-blocking assignments to maintain synchronization with the main clock."
