This Verilog block defines a state machine to control specific operations based on different conditions in a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) or a Timing circuit. Implementation begins by checking for a reset or specific PRBS state, "PRBS_NEW_DQS_WAIT". If either condition is met, several initializations take place such as resetting the bit count, setting reference right edge to maximum, and resetting reference bit. If the PRBS state "FINE_CALC_TAPS_WAIT" and stage count is zero, and bit count is less than DRAM_WIDTH are all true, the bit count is incremented. Furthermore, if reference bit per bit at the current bit count is one and the right edge of current bit is lesser or equal to the reference right edge, then the reference bit is updated to current bit count and the reference right edge is updated to the right edge value of the current bit.
