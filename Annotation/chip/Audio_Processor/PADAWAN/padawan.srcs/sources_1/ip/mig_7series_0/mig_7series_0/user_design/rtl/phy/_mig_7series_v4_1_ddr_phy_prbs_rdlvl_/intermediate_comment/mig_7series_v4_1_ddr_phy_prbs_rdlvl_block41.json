    "block_comment": "This Verilog block implements a synchronous counter for the tap count in a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) and Read Levelling Capture Phase (RDLVL_CPT) operation. The block is clocked by the 'clk' signal and it can be asynchronously reset by the 'rst' signal. On the positive edge of 'clk', if 'rst' is high, the counters 'prbs_dqs_tap_cnt_r' and 'rdlvl_cpt_tap_cnt' are reset to zero. If the 'new_cnt_dqs_r' signal is high, the counters are updated with the value of 'pi_counter_read_val'. The block also has a feature to increment or decrement the 'prbs_dqs_tap_cnt_r' counter if 'prbs_tap_inc_r' is high and 'prbs_dqs_tap_cnt_r' is non-zero respectively, given that 'prbs_tap_en_r' is high."
