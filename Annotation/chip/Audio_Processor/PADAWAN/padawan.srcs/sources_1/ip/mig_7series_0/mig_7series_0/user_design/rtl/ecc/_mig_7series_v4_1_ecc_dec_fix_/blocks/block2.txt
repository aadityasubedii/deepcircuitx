The block code is an arbiter that prioritizes traffic from four input sources. It is implemented using an array, 'req,' that retrieves and stores requests. The block also uses a 'generate' to loop through this array to gather requests. When a valid request comes, it prioritizes older requests by checking where the 'grant' bit is set to 1 in a sequential manner, thus ensuring fairness. This is controlled by a 'CaseZ' statement conditionally sequencing the array. The block loops until all the requests have been validated and prioritized.
