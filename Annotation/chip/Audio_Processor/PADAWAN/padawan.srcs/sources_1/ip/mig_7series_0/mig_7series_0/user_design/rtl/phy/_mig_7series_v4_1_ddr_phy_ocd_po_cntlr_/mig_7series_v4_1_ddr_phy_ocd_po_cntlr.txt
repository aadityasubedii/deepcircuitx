Module-level comment: 
/*
This module controls On-Chip-Delay (OCD) Postamble Offset (PO) for DDR memory interfaces.
It implements a Finite State Machine to manage calibration and adjustment processes,
including scan completion, offset adjustments, and center calibration.
The module iteratively tunes on-chip delay across two stages, using various input signals
and internal registers to track states and control the calibration flow.
