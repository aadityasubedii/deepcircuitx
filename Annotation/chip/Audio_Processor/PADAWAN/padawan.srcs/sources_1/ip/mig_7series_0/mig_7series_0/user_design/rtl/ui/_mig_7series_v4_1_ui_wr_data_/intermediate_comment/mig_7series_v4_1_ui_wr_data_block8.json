    "block_comment": "This block of code declares a register in Verilog RTL with a size dependent on the defined 'RAM_WIDTH'. The register, named 'wr_buf_out_data', is used for storing and manipulating data that is intended to be written into a buffer for outgoing data flow. The width of this register is defined by the 'RAM_WIDTH' constant minus one bit, allowing dynamic scaling of the register size as per the targeted RAM size in the hardware implementation."
