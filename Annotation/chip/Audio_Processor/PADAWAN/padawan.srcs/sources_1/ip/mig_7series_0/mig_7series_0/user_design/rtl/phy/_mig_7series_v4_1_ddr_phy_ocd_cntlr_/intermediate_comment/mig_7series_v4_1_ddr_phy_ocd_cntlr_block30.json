    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the update of the write leveling final 'wrlvl_final_r' register. The 'always' block specifies that on the positive edge of the clock signal 'clk', the register 'wrlvl_final_r' will be updated ('<=') with the value of 'wrlvl_final_ns' after a delay specified by 'TCQ'. This is a typical way to design a flip-flop with a non-blocking assignment in a synchronous system design in Verilog."
