The block of code handles the temporal synchronization of a request column signal, 'req_col_ns', in line with the positive edge of the system clock, 'clk'. Employing a delay modelled by '#TCQ', the code block assigns the current state of 'req_col_ns' to the register 'req_col_r' precisely at the rising edge of 'clk'. This ensures that the system only updates 'req_col_r' based on 'req_col_ns' at defined clock intervals, such facilitating synchronization with other system functions that are also clock-dependent.
