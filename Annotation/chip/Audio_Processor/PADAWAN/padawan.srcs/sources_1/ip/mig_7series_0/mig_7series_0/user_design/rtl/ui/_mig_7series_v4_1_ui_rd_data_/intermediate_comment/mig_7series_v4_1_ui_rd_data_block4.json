    "block_comment": "The block of code initiates a register for a data buffer address. The register, named 'rd_data_buf_addr_ns', is defined with a width determined by the constant 'DATA_BUF_ADDR_WIDTH'. The specific width, reduced by one, is used to represent the full range of addresses that the data buffer can occupy, providing addressing capability for the respective memory unit or buffer. This implementation is created with a named begin-end block 'data_buf_addr', which organizes the code for readability and debugging."
