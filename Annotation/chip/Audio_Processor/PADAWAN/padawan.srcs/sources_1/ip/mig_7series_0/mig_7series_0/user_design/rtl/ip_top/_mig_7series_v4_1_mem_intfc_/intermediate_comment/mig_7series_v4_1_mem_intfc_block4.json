    "block_comment": "This block of code monitors the presence statuses of two slots, slot_0 and slot_1. It utilizes an 'always' block which is triggered whenever the status of either slot_0 or slot_1 changes, i.e., when there is an event (a 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 transition) on 'slot_0_present' or 'slot_1_present'. Inside this block, the current status of each slot is assigned to 'slot_0_present_mc' and 'slot_1_present_mc' respectively."
