    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs remapping operations on `phy_din` based on the conditions `PRESENT_DATA_C` and `HIGHEST_LANE` and depending on the values of `LANE_REMAP`. When `PRESENT_DATA_C` is true, it assigns different segments of `phy_din_remap` to `phy_din` depending on `LANE_REMAP`. In other circumstances, when `HIGHEST_LANE` is greater than 2, the segments of `phy_din` are set to zero according to the value of `LANE_REMAP`."
