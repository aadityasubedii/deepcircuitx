    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code defines a function, `clogb2`, used to calculate the logarithm base 2 of the input `size`, rounded up to the nearest whole number. The function operates by repeatedly halving `size` (via the right shift operation `size >> 1`) and incrementing a counter (`clogb2=clogb2+1`) in a for loop until `size` is less than or equal to 1. This is effectively computing the ceiling of the base-2 logarithm of the initial input `size`."
