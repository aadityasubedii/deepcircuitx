The function `clogb2` computes the ceiling logarithm base 2 of an input integer `size`. It works by iteratively right shifting `size` by 1 and incrementing a counter until `size` is less than or equal to 1, thereby achieving an approximate logarithm operation. It first subtracts 1 from `size` to handle edge case where `size` is an exact power of 2.
