Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code is assigning the value of `sm_r` to the signal `sm`. `assign` statements in Verilog are used to set signals to always equal a certain other value or calculation. The right-hand side `sm_r` of the equation is being constantly assigned to the left-hand side `sm`. This occurs continuously throughout the simulation or device operation. This is a simple assignment operation, often used to provide clarity or possibly to rename a signal in a module.
