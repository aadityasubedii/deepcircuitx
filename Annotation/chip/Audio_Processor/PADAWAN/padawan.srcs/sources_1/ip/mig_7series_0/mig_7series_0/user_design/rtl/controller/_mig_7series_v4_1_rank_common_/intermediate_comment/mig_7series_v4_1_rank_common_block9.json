    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a flip-flop which is utilized for controlling periodic read operations. The flip-flop is clock-sensitive and is reset upon a high 'rst' signal. Upon receipt of both local periodic read signal 'periodic_rd_r_lcl' and periodic read acknowledgment signal 'periodic_rd_ack_r', the flip-flop 'periodic_rd_r_cnt' toggles its state. The flip-flop state is typically used for managing and synchronization of read operations in a periodic manner in digital systems."
