Comment: 
This block of code manages an integer register counter in two specific states of a finite state machine. When the system is in the INIT_IDLE state, the register control count is reset to zero. Conversely, when the system is in the INIT_REG_WRITE state, the register control count is incremented by one at every clock cycle. The update happens at the positive edge of the clock signal, implying that it is a synchronous system.
