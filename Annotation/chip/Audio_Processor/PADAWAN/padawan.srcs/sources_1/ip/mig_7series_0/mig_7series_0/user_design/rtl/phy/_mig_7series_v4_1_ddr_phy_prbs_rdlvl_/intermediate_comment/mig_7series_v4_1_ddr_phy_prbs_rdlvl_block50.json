    "block_comment": "This code block is a sequential logic unit, primarily controlling a sample done flag in different conditions. Leveraging the synchronous property of hardware description language, it gets activated at the positive edge of a clock. It first checks the reset signal. If it's asserted, it sets `num_samples_done_r` to zero. If non-reset conditions like `PRBS_DEC_DQS`, `PRBS_INC_DQS`, `FINE_PI_INC`, `FINE_PI_DEC` states are encountered, `num_samples_done_r` is also reset to 0. Finally, when the sampled count equals `NUM_SAMPLES_CNT` and `rd_victim_sel` is 'd7', the `num_samples_done_r` flag is set to 1."
