Comment: 
The block of code controls the memory controller's Clock Enable (CKE) signals. Depending on the value of CKE_ODT_AUX and nCK_PER_CLK, the block selectively assigns values to individual bits of the mc_cke array. If CKE_ODT_AUX is set to "FALSE", mc_cke[0] and mc_cke[1] are assigned values of cke0 and cke_ns respectively. This means, by default, the first two bits reflect the state of cke0 and the next state of the clock. If furthermore, nCK_PER_CLK equals four, the 3rd and 4th bits of mc_cke are additionally assigned the value of cke_ns, making the means the final two bits also reflect the next state of the clock.
