    "block_comment": "The block of code handles the real-time scheduling conflict signal (rts_col) output. This output is implemented as an active-low wire-type signal, and is assigned the result of a logic calculation that combines the negation of a sending_col signal, the status of demand_ok, or the status of override_demand_r. This shows that a real-time scheduling conflict arises when the block is not sending a \u2019col' flag and either 'demand_ok' is active or 'override_demand_r' is valid."
