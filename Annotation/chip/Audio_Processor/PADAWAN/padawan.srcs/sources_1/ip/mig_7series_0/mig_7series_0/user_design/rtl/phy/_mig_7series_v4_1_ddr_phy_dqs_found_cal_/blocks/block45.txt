Comment: 
The block is responsible for controlling the initialization status of data strobe signal detection across all memory banks. It uses asynchronous reset with active-high, or synchronous reset based on the significant 'OR' of the reset stages to make 'init_dqsfound_done_r' low-level. If a data strobe signal is found across all banks, then it checks the rank count. When the rank count equals the total number of ranks minus one, it sets 'init_dqsfound_done_r' high, otherwise, it retains it at a low state.
