This block of code updates certain variables based on the positive edge of the clock cycle. It leverages synchronous sequential logic, where each change occurs in step with the system clock. This mechanism is typically used in digital systems where synchronized state changes are essential, such as in computations or operations that need to occur in a specific order. Each variable in this code block, denoted with _102, gets the current value of its corresponding _101 variable in a temporally controlled manner, dictated by the clock edge.
