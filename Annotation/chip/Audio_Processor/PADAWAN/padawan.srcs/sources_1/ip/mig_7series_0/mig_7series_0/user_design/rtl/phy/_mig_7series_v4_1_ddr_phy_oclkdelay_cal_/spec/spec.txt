Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_oclkdelay_cal. Module specification: This module is designed for calibration and control of the DDR physical layer clock delay in 7-series FPGA memory interface generators. It utilizes various parameters to define clock delay increments, sample wait times, and scan samples. The module accepts inputs such as system clock (clk), calibration start signals (oclkdelay_calib_start, complex_oclkdelay_calib_start), physical layer read data (phy_rddata), and write leveling fine count (wl_po_fine_cnt). It produces outputs including calibration done signals (oclkdelay_calib_done, complex_oclkdelay_calib_done), debug information (dbg_poc, dbg_phy_oclkdelay
