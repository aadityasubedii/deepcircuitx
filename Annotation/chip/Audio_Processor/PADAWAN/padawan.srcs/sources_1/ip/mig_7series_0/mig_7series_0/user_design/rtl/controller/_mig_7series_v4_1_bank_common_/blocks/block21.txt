Comment: 
The block assigns the value of the local variable 'maint_idle_lcl' to the 'maint_idle' wire. This is achieved through the use of the 'assign' keyword in Verilog which continuously assigns the value of the right-hand-side expression (in this case 'maint_idle_lcl') to the left-hand-side net (in this case 'maint_idle'). This assignment remains active as long as the module is active, ensuring that any changes in 'maint_idle_lcl' are mirrored in 'maint_idle'.
