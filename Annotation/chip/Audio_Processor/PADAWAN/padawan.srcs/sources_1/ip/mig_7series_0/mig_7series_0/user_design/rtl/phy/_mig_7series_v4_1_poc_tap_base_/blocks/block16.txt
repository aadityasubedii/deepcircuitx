This block of code is used to update a sample counter on every positive edge of the clock cycle. The implementation is achieved using the non-blocking assignment '<=' to update the 'samp_cntr_r' register asynchronously, ensuring simultaneous change with other register updates on the same clock edge. The system task identifier '#TCQ' sets an interconnection delay for the assignment to simulate physical propagation delays on circuit boards.
