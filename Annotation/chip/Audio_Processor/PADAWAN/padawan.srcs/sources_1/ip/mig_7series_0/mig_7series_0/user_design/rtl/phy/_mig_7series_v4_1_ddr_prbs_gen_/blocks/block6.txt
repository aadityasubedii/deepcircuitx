Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code assigns the value of the register "prbs_ignore_last_bytes_r" to the variable "prbs_ignore_last_bytes". This assignment operation ensures that the variable "prbs_ignore_last_bytes" is updated to match the current state of the "prbs_ignore_last_bytes_r" register. By doing this, the variable "prbs_ignore_last_bytes" can reflect the signal or condition represented by the register "prbs_ignore_last_bytes_r" in the subsequent logic or calculations. This is a simple assignment operation commonly seen in digital system design.
