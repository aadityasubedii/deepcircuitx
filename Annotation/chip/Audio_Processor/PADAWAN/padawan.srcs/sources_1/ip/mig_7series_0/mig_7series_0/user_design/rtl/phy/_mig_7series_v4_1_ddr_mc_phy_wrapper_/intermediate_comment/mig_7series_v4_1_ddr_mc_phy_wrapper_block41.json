    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to handle on-die termination (ODT) for a DDR memory interface with two ranks. It is done through an output buffer, instantiated as `u_odt1_obuf`, which takes `aux_out[4*CKE_ODT_RCLK_SELECT_BANK+3]` as an input, and outputs to `ddr_odt[1]`, specifically when `ODT_WIDTH` equals to 2 and `RANKS` equals to 2. This setup allows the controller to set the appropriate ODT strength for each rank during a read or write operation, managing signal integrity and reducing power consumption."
