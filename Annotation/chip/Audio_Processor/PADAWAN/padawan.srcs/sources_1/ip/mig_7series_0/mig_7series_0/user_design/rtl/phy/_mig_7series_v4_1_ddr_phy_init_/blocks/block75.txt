Comment: 
This block of code controls a signal, `complex_sample_cnt_inc_ocal`, in a clocked system. Upon the positive edge of a clock signal, if a reset (`rst`) is triggered, the signal will reset itself. However, if certain conditions (`stg1_wr_rd_cnt == 9'd1`, `complex_byte_rd_done`, and `prbs_rdlvl_done`) are met, the signal would be set high. In any other case, it defaults to a low signal state. This effectively creates a conditional gate for further operations based on the system's state variables and reset signal.
