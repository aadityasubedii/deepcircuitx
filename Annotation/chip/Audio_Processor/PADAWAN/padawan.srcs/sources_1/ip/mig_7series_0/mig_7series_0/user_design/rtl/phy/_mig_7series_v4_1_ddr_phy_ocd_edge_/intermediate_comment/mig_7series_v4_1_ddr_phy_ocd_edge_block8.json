    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a flip-flop that is triggered on the positive edge of the `clk` (clock) signal. The function of the `f2o_r` register is to store the next state `f2o_ns` of the finite state machine after a delay denoted by `#TCQ`. This delay ensures synchronization with the clock signal and establishes the time taken for the state to change."
