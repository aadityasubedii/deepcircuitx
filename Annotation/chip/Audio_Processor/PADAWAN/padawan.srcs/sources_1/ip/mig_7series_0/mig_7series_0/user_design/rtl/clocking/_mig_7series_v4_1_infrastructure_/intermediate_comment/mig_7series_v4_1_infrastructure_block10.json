    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the reset signal (`rst_tmp`) in a memory system based on system specifications. Depending on the type and speed of the memory (DDR3 and tCK <= 1500), two different reset conditions are defined. In the first condition (`rst_tmp_300_400`), reset is active (`rst_tmp`) if system reset is active high (`sys_rst_act_hi`), or I/O delay controller is not ready (`~iodelay_ctrl_rdy[1]`), or the reference delay locked loop is not locked (`~ref_dll_lock`), or the MMCM (Mixed-Mode Clock Manager) is not locked (`~MMCM_Locked_i`). In the second condition (`rst_tmp_200`), similar reset conditions are defined, with the difference being the I/O delay controller readiness check (`~iodelay_ctrl_rdy[0]`)."
