This block of code represents a flip-flop operation that controls the start of mpr_read leveling operation. On every positive edge of the clock, the block checks if a reset signal is active, mpr_rdlvl_start is set to 0 with some propagation delay specified as TCQ. If the reset signal is not active, and both 'pi_dqs_found_done' signal is active and 'init_state_r' equals 'INIT_MPR_READ', mpr_rdlvl_start is set to 1 after the same propagation delay.
