Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_bank_state. Module specification: This module implements a bank state controller for a memory interface generator (MIG) in 7 series FPGAs. It manages the timing and control of memory operations such as activation, read, write, and precharge for a single bank in a multi-bank memory system. The module has numerous input ports including clk, rst, bm_end, sending_row, rcv_open_bank, sending_col, rd_wr_r, req_wr_r, phy_rddata_valid, and various timing and configuration signals. Output ports include start_rcd, act_wait_r, rd_half_rmw, ras_timer_ns, end_rtp, bank_wait_in_progress, start_pre_wait, rts_row, rts_col, and several control
