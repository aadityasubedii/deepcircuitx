    "block_comment": "This block regulates the delay value assigned to each data element in data queues across ranks as per the simulation calibration option. It sets delay values to zero if `SIM_CAL_OPTION` is `SKIP_CAL` or `rst` is active, and incrementally updates them otherwise. If `SIM_CAL_OPTION` is `FAST_CAL`, it iterates over all ranks and data queue widths, incrementing or decrementing delay values based on `dlyinc_dq_r`. When fast calibration isn't in action, it handles updating delay values for a specific data element identified by `cal1_cnt_cpt_r` in a particular rank `rnk_cnt_r`, also based on `dlyinc_dq_r`."
