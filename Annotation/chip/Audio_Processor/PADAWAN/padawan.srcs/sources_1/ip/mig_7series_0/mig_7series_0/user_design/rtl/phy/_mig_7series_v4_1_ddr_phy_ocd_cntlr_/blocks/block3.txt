Comment: 
This block represents a sequential logic circuit in which the state machine register (sm_r) is updated to the next state (sm_ns) on the rising edge (posedge) of the clock cycle (clk). The delay (#TCQ) indicates how long after the positive edge of the clock the state machine register's value will be updated. This implementation is crucial for synchronous digital circuits, keeping operations in sync with the system clock.
