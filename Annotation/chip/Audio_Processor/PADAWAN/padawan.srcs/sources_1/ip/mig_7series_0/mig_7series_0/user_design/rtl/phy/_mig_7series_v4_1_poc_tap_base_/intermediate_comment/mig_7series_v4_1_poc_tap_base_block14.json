    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for updating the value of `samps_hi_r` at each positive edge of `clk` in order to implement sample storage. The implementation achieves this function by using `always @` to monitor the race condition of `clk`, then when a positive edge comes, the assignment `samps_hi_r <= #TCQ samps_hi_ns` is carried out with a delay of `TCQ` time units, ensuring the correct value is stored into `samps_hi_r`."
