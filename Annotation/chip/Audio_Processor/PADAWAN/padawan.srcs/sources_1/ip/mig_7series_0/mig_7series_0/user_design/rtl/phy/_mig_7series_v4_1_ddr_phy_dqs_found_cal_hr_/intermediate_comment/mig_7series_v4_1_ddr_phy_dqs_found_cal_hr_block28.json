    "block_comment": "This block implements a memory controller's read latency handling mechanism, which updates the read byte data offset register as per the system's reset and timing conditions. On every positive edge of the clock, it checks if a system reset signal is active. If yes, it iteratively resets the initial offset for each memory rank. If the reset is not active, it updates the offset register based on certain conditions which are related to memory rank completion, DQS (Data Strobe) signal detection and number of clock cycles latency. The register value is either updated to the sum of column and active line latency subtracted by two, or it is incremented by one if the DQS signal is detected and some adjustment factors are satisfied. The block uses bit slicing and arithmetic operations to compute the offset for read operation, and it uses delay modeling (#TCQ) to emulate memory control timing behavior."
