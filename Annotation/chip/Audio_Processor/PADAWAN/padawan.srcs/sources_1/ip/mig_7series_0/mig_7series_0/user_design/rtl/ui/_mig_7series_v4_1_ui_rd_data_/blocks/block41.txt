This block of code sets the value of the signal 'app_rd_data_valid' based on the signal 'rd_data_en'. Whenever there's a change in the 'rd_data_en' signal, the 'always @' statement triggers and assigns the current value of 'rd_data_en' to 'app_rd_data_valid'. Essentially, it's a hardware-level way of saying "Let 'app_rd_data_valid' be always equal to 'rd_data_en'".
