    "block_comment": "This single line of Verilog RTL code block assigns a 6-bit value from the `simp_stg3_final_shft` bus to `simp_stg3_final_sel`. This operation is a bit-slice selection, where a specific 6-bit subset of `simp_stg3_final_shft` is assigned to `simp_stg3_final_sel`. This code block plays a role in extracting or isolating a particular portion of the available data."
