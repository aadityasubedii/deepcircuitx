This block computes the next write pointer for a circular buffer in Verilog. The block increments the current write pointer ('wr_ptr') by 1 ('1'b1' is Verilog syntax for the binary number 1), and uses the modulus operator ('%') to ensure that the next write pointer ('nxt_wr_ptr') wraps around to the start of the buffer when it reaches its depth ('DEPTH'), thereby creating a circular or ring buffer.
