    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the operation of the PHY's (Physical Layer) RAS (Row Address Strobe) signals based on the state of initialization. If the system is in one of the listed initialization states, it sets the PHY's RAS values to an active high (1'b1) and a low (1'b0), respectively. In any other case, it sets both RAS signals to a high state (1'b1). The transition is synchronous with the positive edge clock, and has a certain propagation delay defined by 'TCQ'."
