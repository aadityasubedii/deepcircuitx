    "block_comment": "This block refers to a sequential logic circuit that updates the state of `order_q_r` on the positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. The delay element `#TCQ` is used to model the non-zero delay in updates, effectively emulating the real-life update delay in a hardware implementation. Consequently, the state of `order_q_r` is updated to `order_q_ns` with a delay modeled by `#TCQ` on every rising edge of `clk`."
