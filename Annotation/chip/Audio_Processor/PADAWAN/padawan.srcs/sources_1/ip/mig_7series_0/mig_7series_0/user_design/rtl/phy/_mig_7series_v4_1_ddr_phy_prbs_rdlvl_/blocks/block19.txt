This block of code is responsible for edge detection in a Pattern Reconciliation by Symmetry (PRBS) state machine. It initializes values and sets specific flags on positive edge of the clock while in reset or wait state, and further manipulates these values and flags under different PRBS states. In the state of comparison per bit, it checks for certain conditions using flags and error analysis. Depending on the condition, it calculates left and right edges, updates flags, and makes loss/gain analysis. If the state machine is in decrease or increase state, it resets flags and status bits accordingly. The intention behind is to have fine control over device-related parameters which assist in performance improvement.
