    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code is designed to control system reset activation logic. It functions as a conditional assignment, setting the logic level of 'sys_rst_act_hi' depending upon the value of 'RST_ACT_LOW'. When 'RST_ACT_LOW' is true, it inverts the input reset signal 'sys_rst_i'; and if 'RST_ACT_LOW' is false, 'sys_rst_act_hi' directly takes the value of 'sys_rst_i'. This helps in handling different active levels of reset effectively in system design."
