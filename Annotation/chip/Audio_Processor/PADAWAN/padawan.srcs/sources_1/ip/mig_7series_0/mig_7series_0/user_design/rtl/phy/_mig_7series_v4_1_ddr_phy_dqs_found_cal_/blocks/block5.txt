This block of code implements a sequential logic for updating an array "final_do_max[i]" based on certain input conditions. On a positive edge of 'clk', if 'rst' is enabled, the array index 'i' of "final_do_max[]" is cleared; otherwise, it retains its previous value. The code then checks the value stored within a specific data range within 'DATA_PRESENT', as selected by 'final_do_index[i]'. If 'final_do_max[i]' is less than 'final_do_cand[i]', it updates 'final_do_max[i]' with the value of 'final_do_cand[i]' either decremented by 1 if 'CWL_M' is odd, or as is for even 'CWL_M'. In case, a valid case is not matched, 'final_do_max[i]' retains its previous value.
