Module-level comment: This module "mig_7series_v4_1_bank_cntrl" is designed for memory operation control in DDR system of Xilinx 7 series, where the parameters define the memory properties. It uses input ports for command instructions, counters and memory addresses, and returns outputs for status and control signals. The functionality relies on internal signals and three sub-modules: bank comparison, bank state management, and queue operation for memory requests. The module orchestrates data transfers, command sequencing, and buffering mechanisms in the memory bank.
