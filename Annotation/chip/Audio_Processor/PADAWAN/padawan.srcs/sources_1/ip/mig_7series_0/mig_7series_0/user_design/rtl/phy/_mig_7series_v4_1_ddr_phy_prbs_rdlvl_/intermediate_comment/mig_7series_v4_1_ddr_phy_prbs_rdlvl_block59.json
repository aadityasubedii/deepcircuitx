    "block_comment": "This block is designed to handle the timing and sequencing of input signals, specifically through edge triggering on a rising clock signal. Upon the positive edge of a clock signal, the code checks for validation of information read by the multiplexer (mux_rd_valid_r). If the read is valid, the module captures and carries the rise and fall times of different input signals (mux_rd_rise#_r1 and mux_rd_fall#_r1) and delays them by a time constant (TCQ) at different stages. The process is repeated three times denoted by r2, r3, and r4 respectively. For less significant bits (rise/fall2 and rise/fall3), the process is overridden with null values."
