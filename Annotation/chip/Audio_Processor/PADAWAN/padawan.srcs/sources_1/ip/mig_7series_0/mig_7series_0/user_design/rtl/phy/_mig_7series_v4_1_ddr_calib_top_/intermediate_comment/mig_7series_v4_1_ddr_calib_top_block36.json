    "block_comment": "This block of code is a hardware selection condition statement in Verilog. Specifically, it aims to check if the clock period `tCK` is greater than or equal to 2500 units. The associated logic under this condition is presumably designated under the identifier `gen_byte_sel_div2` which starts if `tCK` is greater than or equal to 2500. The details about how this condition is used to influence the Verilog system design will be in the code block associated with `gen_byte_sel_div2` which is not shown here."
