Comment: 
This block of code declares two register elements in Verilog: `ocal_scan_win_not_found_ns` and `ocal_scan_win_not_found_r`. They can be used to store temporary values typical to sequential logic implementations, possibly in the context of some scanning process. The '_ns' and '_r' suffixes suggest these could be used to hold the next-state and reset values respectively for a certain state machine.
