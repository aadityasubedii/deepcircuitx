    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages a periodic read timer. The timer value is always updated based on changes in the variables `init_calib_complete`, `maint_prescaler_tick_r`, `periodic_rd_timer_r`, and `int_read_this_rank`. Initially, the timer is set to the value stored in `PERIODIC_RD_TIMER_DIV`, until `init_calib_complete` is asserted. This technique is used to ensure the timer is initialized before being used. After initialization, the timer value is updated either upon the ranks' internal read or when `periodic_rd_timer_one` is triggered. In an alternative case, it's decremented by one unit whenever there's a tick in `maint_prescaler_tick_r` and when `periodic_rd_timer_r` is non-zero."
