    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a flip-flop that registers the signal 'raw_not_ecc' at the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk'. The registered signal 'raw_not_ecc_r' retains its value throughout the clock cycle until the next positive edge of 'clk'. The '#TCQ' represents the time delay from when 'raw_not_ecc' is sampled to when 'raw_not_ecc_r' is updated."
