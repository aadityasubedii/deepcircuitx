    "block_comment": "This block assigns the current status of the prioritization flag for the variable 'q'. The assignment operator is used to achieve this implementation, where the status of 'q_has_priority' is constantly updated with the value of 'q_has_priority_r'. This operation is typically used in designs when the value of 'q' needs to be monitored continuously for priority decisions."
