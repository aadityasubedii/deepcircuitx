    "block_comment": "The block of code initiates an asynchronous latch in digital circuit design. This latch responds to the fluctuations in the `inhbt_rd_ns` input signal. As soon as `inhbt_rd_ns` changes, the new value is securely held by the `inhbt_rd` latch, maintaining the state until `inhbt_rd_ns` is modified again. This latch performs the storage functionality, acting as a memory cell for the hold-time and setup-time with respect to the system clock. The latch is asynchronous in implementation as there's no mention of a clock signal. Thus, this latch is sensitive to changes in the `inhbt_rd_ns` signal without any dependence to a system clock signal."
