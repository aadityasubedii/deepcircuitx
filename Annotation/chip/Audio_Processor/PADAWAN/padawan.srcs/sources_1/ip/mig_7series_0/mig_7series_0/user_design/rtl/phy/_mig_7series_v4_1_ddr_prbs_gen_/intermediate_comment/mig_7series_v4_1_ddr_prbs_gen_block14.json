    "block_comment": "This block is a pseudo random bit sequence (PRBS) generator that uses a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) for its implementation. The block generates a PRBS when the clock is enabled i.e., `clk_en_i` is high and either the PHY interface is not empty or the PRBS read level has not started. If the generator is reset, turned off, or it is in reseed mode, PRBS generator is seeded with the supplied seed `prbs_seed_i`. The core operation in the sequence generation relies on shifting and XORing of certain positions in the linear feedback shift register for the specified fields, implementing a specific polynomial. Specific bits in the `lfsr_q[]` register are bitwise XORed together and feedback to the shift register, creating a pseudorandom sequence of bits."
