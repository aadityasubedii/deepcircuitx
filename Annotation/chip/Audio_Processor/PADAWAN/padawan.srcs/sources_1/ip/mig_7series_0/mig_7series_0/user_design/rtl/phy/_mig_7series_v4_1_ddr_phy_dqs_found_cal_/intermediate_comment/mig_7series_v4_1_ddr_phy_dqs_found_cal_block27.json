    "block_comment": "This code block is primarily responsible for managing read byte data offset timings for different memory ranks in a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) system. Upon each rising edge of the system clock, the block first checks if a reset is active. In the event of a reset, the block resets the read byte data offset for each rank, effectively clearing previous data. If there's no reset but the rank operation is done or certain conditions on data latency are fulfilled, the offset is updated with a new timing value. Finally, if a data query sequence (DQS) is initiated, and all necessary conditions including DQS findings, read count checks, and other adjustment factors confirm, the offset is further fine-tuned by decrementing the current value."
