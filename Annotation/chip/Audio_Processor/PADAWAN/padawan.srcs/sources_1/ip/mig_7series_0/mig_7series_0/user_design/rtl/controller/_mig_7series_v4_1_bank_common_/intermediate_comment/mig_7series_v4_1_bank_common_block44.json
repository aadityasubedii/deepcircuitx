    "block_comment": "This block of code represents a register transfer within a synchronous system. The key function of this block is to latch the value of the accept_ns_lcl signal onto the accept_r signal at the positive clock edge. The implementation is achieved by Verilog's delay mechanism denoted by '#TCQ', allowing the register transfer to occur after a delay of TCQ time units."
