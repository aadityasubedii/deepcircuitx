Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code assigns signals to different variables within a module. These boolean assignments are used to control specific logic within the module, signaling certain stages to execute operations or influencing components like writing requests, stages decimated/increment signals, boundary limit, and completion status. These assignments, characterized as wires, are essentially real-time connections between different parts of the module and carry critical status or control information.
