    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a clocked register in a hardware description. On every positive edge (rising edge) of the clock signal 'clk', the register 'simp_stg3_final_r' gets updated to the value held by 'simp_stg3_final_ns' after a certain delay defined by #TCQ. The '#TCQ' argument simulates the propagation delay between these two registers, reflecting the actual hardware performance where transfer of data takes some amount of time."
