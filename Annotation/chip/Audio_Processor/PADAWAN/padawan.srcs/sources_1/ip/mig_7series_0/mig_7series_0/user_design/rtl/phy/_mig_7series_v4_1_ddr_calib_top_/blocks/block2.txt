Comment: 
The block handles the process initiation and values resetting in synchronization with the positive edge of the clock (clk). It ensures the proper initiation of specific calibration and temperature measuring processes. It initializes 'calib_tap_req', 'calib_device_temp', and 'skip_cal_tempmon_samp_en' to zero on each clock cycle's rising edge. This is done to halt any ongoing calibration request, reset the device temperature value and disable the skipping of temperature monitor samples respectively.
