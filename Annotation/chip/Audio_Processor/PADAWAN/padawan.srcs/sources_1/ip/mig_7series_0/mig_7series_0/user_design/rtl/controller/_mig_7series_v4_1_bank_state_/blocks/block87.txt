Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code performs a signal assignment operation for a control logic block in a digital system. The active wait signal `act_wait_r` is assigned the value from another signal, `act_wait_r_lcl`. The '_lcl' suffix suggests that this variable is local, perhaps computed elsewhere in the module. This assignment is made continuously whenever `act_wait_r_lcl` changes, reflecting the synchronous design of most digital systems.
