    "block_comment": "This block handles the decrementing of a post-read counter. Upon a positive clock-edge, if a reset signal is given or if the post-read value count equals 0, it sets the post-read decrement count to 0. If there's a valid 6th stage control signal and the post-read value count is more than 0 with a wait count of 1, it triggers a decrement in the post-read counter by setting its decrement count to 1. In all other scenarios, it defaults to setting the post-read decrement count back to 0."
