    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs display generation based on the positive edge of 'pi_dqs_found_done'. The block uses an always statement to monitor the positive edge of the 'pi_dqs_found_done' signal. If a rising edge is detected and if reset ('rst') is not active, the block executes a \"$display\" statement. This effectively prints out a message (\"PHY_INIT: Phaser_In DQSFOUND completed at %t\") along with the current simulation time, which is fetched using the \"$time\" system function."
