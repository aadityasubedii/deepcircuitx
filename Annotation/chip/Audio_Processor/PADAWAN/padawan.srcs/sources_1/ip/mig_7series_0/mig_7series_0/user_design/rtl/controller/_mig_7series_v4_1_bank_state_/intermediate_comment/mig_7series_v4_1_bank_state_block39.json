    "block_comment": "This Verilog block seems to be part of a memory controller managing read and write operations. It employs a condition that checks if the number of rank (RANKS) is equal to 1. If so, it invokes an 'always' construct which is triggered by a change in either the 'req_rank_r', 'req_rank_r_in', or 'start_rcd_in' signals. It then sets the 'inhbt_act_rrd' signal to false, possibly inhibiting a Read-to-Read data turn around time (tRRD) between different ranks condition when there's only one rank."
