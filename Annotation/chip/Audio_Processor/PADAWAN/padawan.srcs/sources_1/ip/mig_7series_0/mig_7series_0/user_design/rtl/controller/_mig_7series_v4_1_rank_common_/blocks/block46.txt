The block is used to store the value of the next state signal 'sre_request_ns' on every rising edge of the clock signal in the 'sre_request_r' register. It does so by implementation of flip-flop functionality using 'always @(posedge clk)' which signifies that the block will only run on the positive edge of the clock signal. It delays the propagation of the 'sre_request_ns' signal to 'sre_request_r' by an amount of time defined by #TCQ to maintain the setup and hold conditions.
