The block of code regulates the pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) tap limit in a phased-lock loop system. Upon each positive clock edge, if a reset signal occurs or a new count for the DQS buffer read register is tallied, the PRBS tap limit is reset within a time constant quantization delay (#TCQ). Additionally, if the PRBS tap count reaches 63, the PRBS DQS tap limit is set to 1 signifying an overflow condition, else it remains reset.
