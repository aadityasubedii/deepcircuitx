    "block_comment": "The main function of this block is to implement a register update based on the rising edge of the clock signal. The implementation details show that on every positive edge of the clock signal (posedge clk), the register named 'wr_data_r' is set to take the value of 'wr_data' after a delay specified by 'TCQ'. This delay mocks the real-world delay faced by circuits due to propagation delays in gates."
