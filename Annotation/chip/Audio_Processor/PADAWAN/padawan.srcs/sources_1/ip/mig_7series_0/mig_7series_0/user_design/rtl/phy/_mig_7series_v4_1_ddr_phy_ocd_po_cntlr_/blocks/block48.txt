Comment: 
The given Verilog block is designed to register the next state signal 'oclk_center_write_resume_ns', introducing a delay specified by 'TCQ', at the positive edge of the clock 'clk'. The block uses a non-blocking assignment which ensures that the updates happen simultaneously at the end of simulation time step, capturing the essence of real-world hardware where state changes occur synchronously with the rising edge of a clock signal.
