Comment: 
The block of code defines and assigns logical HIGH value (1'b1) to two signals, namely 'pi_dqs_found_w' and 'pi_phase_locked_w'. These signals are declared and directly assigned using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog hardware description language. The assignment operation allows for the signal values to be held at logic one state, indicating their active status in the succeeding code. Since they are declared outside of any procedural blocks, the assignments are made concurrently and their values will not change throughout the simulation of the whole code.
