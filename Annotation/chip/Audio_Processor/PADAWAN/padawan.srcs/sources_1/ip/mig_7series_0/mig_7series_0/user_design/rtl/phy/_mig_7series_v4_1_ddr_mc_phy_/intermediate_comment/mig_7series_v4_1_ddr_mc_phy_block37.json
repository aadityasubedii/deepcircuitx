    "block_comment": "This block dynamically assigns read enable signals for byte operation for different memory banks when the highest bank count is set to 3. It uses the generate construct for conditional compilation based on the HIGHEST_BANK variable being 3. For each pair of the memory banks (other than the current bank), it assigns values based on different byte read enable signals. For example, for the first bank, byte_rd_en_oth_banks[1:0] consider the byte read enable signals from bank 1 and 2. Similarly, other assignments are done for other pairs of banks."
