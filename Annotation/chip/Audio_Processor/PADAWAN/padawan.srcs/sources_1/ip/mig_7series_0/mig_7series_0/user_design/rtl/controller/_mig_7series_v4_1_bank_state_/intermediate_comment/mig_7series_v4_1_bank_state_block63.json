    "block_comment": "This code block represents a Register Transfer Level (RTL) description of a delay flip-flop logic in a Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). The function of this block is to sample and hold the value of the 'rtp_timer_ns' signal at every positive edge of the 'clk' clock signal, with the delay factor defined by the delay control '#TCQ'. This block achieves its function by using the always@ construct which signifies a behavioral description that is sensitive to changes in the signals specified within the parentheses, in this case, posedge 'clk'. This means that every positive edge in the clock signal will trigger this block to evaluate 'rtp_timer_ns' after the '#TCQ' delay time is reached and assign this value to the 'rtp_timer_r' register."
