Comment: 
This block of code describes a synchronous reset mechanism for debugging purposes for a phase interpolator (PI) control. The synchronous reset is triggered by a rising edge clock (clk) and a reset signal (rst). The block initializes and sets the values of `dbg_pi_f_inc_r`, `dbg_pi_f_en_r`, and `dbg_sel_pi_incdec_r` to zero during a reset, otherwise, their values are updated based on specific conditions - `dbg_pi_f_inc_r` gets the value of `dbg_pi_f_inc`, `dbg_pi_f_en_r` gets a logical OR operation result of `dbg_pi_f_inc` and `dbg_pi_f_dec` and `dbg_sel_pi_incdec_r` gets the value of `dbg_sel_pi_incdec`. The "#TCQ" is a delay element used for timing-control in the logic.
