    "block_comment": "These codes are performing clock signal assignment for a double data rate (DDR) memory system. Each code line is indexed with a hexadecimal value and assigns a specific part of the 'ddr_clk' array to a bit-shifted and masked version of the 'ddr_clk_w' array entry. The assignment is done via a shift operation that multiplies the current index 'i' with 'LP_DDR_CK_WIDTH' and a bitwise AND operation with '2'b11' to mask the final value. Different shifts are applied based on the line index to vary the extracted signal bits from 'ddr_clk_w'."
