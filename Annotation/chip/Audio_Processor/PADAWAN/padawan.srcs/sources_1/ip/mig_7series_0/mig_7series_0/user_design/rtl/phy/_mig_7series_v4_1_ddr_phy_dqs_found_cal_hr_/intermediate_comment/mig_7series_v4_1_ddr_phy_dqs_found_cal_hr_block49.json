    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code registers the start signal of a Read Data Strobe (DQS) found during phase interpolation (PI). Utilizing a positive-edge triggered sequential always block, it assigns `pi_dqs_found_start` with a delay of `TCQ` time units to the `dqs_found_start_r` signal on every rising edge of the clock `clk`."
