This block of code is primarily for implementing a delay pipeline for a set of signals. These signals consist of reset and data leveling done flags. By successively shifting the current value of a signal to the next register on every rising edge of the clock, the block effectively creates a delay pipeline. The delay length is determined by the number of stages (TCQ). The pipeline handles both data leveling processes (rdlvl and prbs), and an iterated reset signal, each progressing through a multi-stage delay process up to a ninth stage in the case of the reset signal.
