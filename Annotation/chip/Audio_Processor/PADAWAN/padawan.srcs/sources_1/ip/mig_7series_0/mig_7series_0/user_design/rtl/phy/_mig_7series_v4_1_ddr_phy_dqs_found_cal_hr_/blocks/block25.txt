This block implements a type of digital control logic. On each positive edge of the clock signal, it assesses certain conditions and performs a reset operation based on those evaluations. The reset operation is executed if a reset signal is sent, the calibration stage is reset, or a fine adjustment is made. If none of these activities are noticed, it checks for the start of DQS signal detection, variation in DQS signal detection across memory banks, or a comparison of read byte data offset surpassing certain latency factors. If any of these conditions are met, the calibration stage is set.
