Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_if_post_fifo 

Module specification: 

The mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_if_post_fifo is an Interface Post Fast-FIFO block specifically designed for Double Data Rate (DDR) memory interfaces. The parameters for this module consist of TCQ, a clock period latency, DEPTH, the FIFO depth, and WIDTH, for the data path width. 

The module's input ports include clk (synchronized sequential logic clock), rst (reset signal), empty_in (4-bit bus for FIFO empty flags), rd_en_in (read enable), and d_in (data input, with WIDTH-defined width). Its output ports are empty_out (FIFO empty indicator), byte_rd_en (byte read enable), and d_out (data output). 

Internally, the module calculates PTR_BITS for size determination of pointers based on DEPTH. It uses registers mem for data storing, my_empty and my_full to monitor FIFO status, rd_ptr and wr_ptr as respective read and write pointers, rd_ptr_timing to control read timing, a wire mem_out to deliver read data from memory, and wire wr_en to control write operations. 

The principal tasks in the module are performing synchronous updates (updt_ptrs tasks) on pointers and flags based on control signals, providing control statements for memory data management, and producing output based on FIFO status. 

Special features of this module include a variety of control scenarios for writing to and reading from memory, error detection in case of bad access, and conditional data output based on the FIFO empty state. All data operations are synchronized to the input clock, making the operation of this module reliant on the frequency and stability of this clock signal.
