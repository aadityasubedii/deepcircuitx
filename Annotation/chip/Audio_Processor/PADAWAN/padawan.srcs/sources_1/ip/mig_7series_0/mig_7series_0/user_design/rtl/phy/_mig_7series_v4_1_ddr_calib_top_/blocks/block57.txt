Comment: 
The block is essentially assigning debug communications for the read level start and completed signals. Two individual signals, 'mpr_rdlvl_start', 'rdlvl_stg1_start', are packed together and assigned to 'dbg_rdlvl_start'. Similarly, 'mpr_rdlvl_done', 'rdlvl_stg1_done' are combined and assigned to 'dbg_rdlvl_done'. This way, the block is facilitating a combined signalling mechanism for debugging read level operations' starting and completion status.
