Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_prbs_gen. Module specification: This module generates pseudo-random bit sequences (PRBS) for DDR memory testing and calibration. It takes inputs such as clk_i (clock), rst_i (reset), prbs_seed_i (PRBS seed), and various control signals. The module outputs prbs_o (PRBS data), dbg_prbs_gen (debug output), and ignore flags. Internally, it uses signals like lfsr_q (Linear Feedback Shift Register), rd_addr (read address), and dout_o (intermediate output data). The module consists of several blocks: a PRBS generator using LFSR, a memory-based pattern lookup table, victim bit selection logic, and output formatting for DDR interfaces. It supports different pattern types (VCCO, VCCAUX
