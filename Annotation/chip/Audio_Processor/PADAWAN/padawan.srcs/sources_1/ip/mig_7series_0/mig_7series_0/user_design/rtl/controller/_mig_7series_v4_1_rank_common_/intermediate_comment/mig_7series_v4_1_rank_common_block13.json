    "block_comment": "This block of code is used for the assignment of a signal. Specifically, the signal \"app_zq_ack\" is assigned the same value as \"app_zq_ack_r\". The \"assign\" keyword in Verilog is used to create continuous assignments which are used to drive combinational logic. In this context, it means that any change in the value of \"app_zq_ack_r\" triggers a change in \"app_zq_ack\" real-time. It's implied that the operation of the assigned logic will be synchronous, dependent on the updating of \"app_zq_ack_r\"."
