    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the read value count (pi_rdval_cnt) in a pipeline. It implements this on the rising edge of a clock signal, with synchronous reset logic to initialize the counter to 0. The count is incremented when the decoder (dqs_po_dec_done_r1) finishes its operation and is not yet done in the next cycle (dqs_po_dec_done_r2). When there is a countdown signal (pi_cnt_dec), the pi_rdval_cnt is decremented, otherwise, its current value is retained. If the counter value reaches 0, it holds its value. The '#TCQ' delay is observed in the assignment of counter values."
