    "block_comment": "This block assigns the constant value of 3 to the variable col_channel_offset. This is a straightforward assignment operation, using the 'assign' keyword which defines a continuous assignment in Verilog. The variable col_channel_offset is presumably used elsewhere in the code to offset some column channel related computations by the value 3. No loops or conditions are used in this simple assignment block."
