    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a synchronous reset divider, specifically for a higher frequency reset signal, driven by clock signal `clk_bufg` and reset signal `rst_tmp`. The block uses two registers `rstdiv0_sync_r` and `rstdiv0_sync_r1` to hold the reset state. Once a reset event `rst_tmp' occurs, the registers are set to high states. In absence of a reset event, they shift the stored states to right, with `rstdiv0_sync_r1` inheriting the pre-last of `rstdiv0_sync_r` states, effectively dividing the frequency of the original reset signal."
