    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for synchronization of the 'insert_maint_ns' signal with the clock signal 'clk' in reaching the 'insert_maint_r_lcl'. The mechanism it employs is edge-triggered, meaning it updates the state of 'insert_maint_r_lcl' on the rising edge (positive edge) of the clock signal - 'clk'. The delay for state update has been set to a time constant 'TCQ' to manage synchronization timing effectively."
