    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for the propagation of the read activation signal. Upon the positive edge of the clock, 'phy_rddata_en' is sampled and passed down a pipeline stages from 'rd_active_r1' through 'rd_active_r5', effectively creating a delay of 5 clock cycles before the read signal is activated. This delay helps ensure that the data is ready for reading, an approach commonly used to manage read operations and sync data in system designs."
