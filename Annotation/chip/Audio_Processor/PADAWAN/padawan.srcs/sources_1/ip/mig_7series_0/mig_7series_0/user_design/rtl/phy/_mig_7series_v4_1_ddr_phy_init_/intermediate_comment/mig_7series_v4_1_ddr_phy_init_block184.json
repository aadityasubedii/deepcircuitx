    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for resetting or updating the 'wl_sm_start' signal. It acts upon the positive edge of the clock signal. If the reset signal ('rst') is high, 'wl_sm_start' is asynchronously reset to 0, ensuring that the system returns to its default state. Otherwise, on every clock cycle, the signal 'wl_sm_start' is synchronously updated to the value of 'wr_level_dqs_asrt_r1' after a delay defined by 'TCQ'."
