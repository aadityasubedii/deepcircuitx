Comment: 
This block manages a stable delay counter regulated by clock edges, specifically for timing calibration. On each rising edge of the clock, it checks multiple conditions such as system reset, initial calibration state, and incumbent versus current edge rise/fall conditions. If any condition is met, the idle counter is reset to zero. Else, if the delay counter and pattern recognition are validated, conditions for stable rise-fall match of all bit patterns are checked; if these conditions and a capped counter limit are met, the idle counter increments by one.
