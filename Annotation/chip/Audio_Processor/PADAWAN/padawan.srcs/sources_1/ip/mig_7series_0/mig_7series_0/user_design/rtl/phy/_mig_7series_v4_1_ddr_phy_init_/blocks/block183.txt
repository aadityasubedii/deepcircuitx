Comment: 
This block acts as a flip-flop chain for monitoring and tracking the write levelling (wrlvl) activities. During the positive edge of the clock signal, it registers the present state of the wrlvl activities - the active state, DQS assertion, completion, and the progression by ranks, introducing a clock delay with each stage.
