    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages a signal flag called `inhibit_edge_detect_r` that is used to inhibit or enable edge detection based on various conditions. It does so in a sequential always block that gets evaluated on the positive edge of a clock signal. If the `rst` signal is high or all rising edge detection signals are active and falling ones are inactive, then `inhibit_edge_detect_r` is set to 1, disabling edge detection. Alternatively, if the system is in a specific state (`CAL1_MPR_PAT_DETECT`) and the value of `idelay_tap_cnt_r` is greater than 1 for the current rank and timing, and all the rising edge detection signals are inactive while the falling ones are active, then `inhibit_edge_detect_r` gets set to 0, enabling edge detection."
