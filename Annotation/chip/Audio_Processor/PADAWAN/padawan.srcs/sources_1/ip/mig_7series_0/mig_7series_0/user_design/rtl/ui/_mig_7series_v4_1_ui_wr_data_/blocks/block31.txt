Comment: 
This block design is responsible for managing the index of write data. It either initializes the index with a default value at reset or increments the index each time a write data address latch enable is triggered. The current index state is stored in the variable 'wr_data_indx_ns', and updated according to control signals 'rst' and 'wr_data_addr_le'. Some of the operations performed by the block are conditional, depending on the state of these control signals.
