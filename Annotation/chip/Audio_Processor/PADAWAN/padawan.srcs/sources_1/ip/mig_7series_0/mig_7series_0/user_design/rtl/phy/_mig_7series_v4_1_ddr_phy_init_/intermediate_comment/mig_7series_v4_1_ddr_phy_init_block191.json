    "block_comment": "This Verilog block controls the state of a write-leveling On Die Termination (ODT). This control is usually implemented for signal integrity optimization. The block operates synchronously with the rising edge of the 'clk' signal. It ensures that if 'rst' or 'wrlvl_odt_ctl' is active, 'wrlvl_odt' signal will be asynchronously reset after T CQ delay. Otherwise, if 'enable_wrlvl_cnt' equals to 1, the 'wrlvl_odt' is set to 1 also after T CQ delay. If none of these conditions meet, the block does nothing. The use of delay in signal assignment indicates that this is most likely related to some timing requirements in the system."
