This block of code is used to update a register 'new_maint_rank_r' with the value of 'upd_last_master_r' at the positive edge of clock cycle after a delay specified by 'TCQ'. The always block ensures that the value assignment happens in every clock cycle when there is a rising edge (posedge). The delay '#' operator is used to simulate the behavior of the real-world hardware which requires a certain amount of time to perform an operation.
