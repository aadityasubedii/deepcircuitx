    "block_comment": "The Verilog block primarily performs memory resetting and edge tracing for a debugging mechanism. On each positive edge of the clock cycle, if a reset or a certain start condition is detected, it nullifies debugging variables. When a \"FAST_CAL\" simulation option is active and the calibration state is \"CAL1_CALC_IDEL\", it iterates through a predefined width to check for different edge conditions and update the corresponding variables. In case these conditions are not met, but calibration state remains \"CAL1_CALC_IDEL\", it updates the debugging variables if certain edges are detected."
