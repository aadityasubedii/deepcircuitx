This block of code is responsible for capturing the value of `app_sr_active_ns` on the rising edge of `clk` and storing it in `app_sr_active_r`. The implementation involves an always block which samples `app_sr_active_ns` at the positive edge of `clk` and uses a time-delay model, denoted by `#TCQ`, to simulate setup and hold times, thereby reflecting the actual behavior of real hardware. The sampled value is then assigned to `app_sr_active_r`, effectively creating a simple flip-flop for state retention between clock cycles.
