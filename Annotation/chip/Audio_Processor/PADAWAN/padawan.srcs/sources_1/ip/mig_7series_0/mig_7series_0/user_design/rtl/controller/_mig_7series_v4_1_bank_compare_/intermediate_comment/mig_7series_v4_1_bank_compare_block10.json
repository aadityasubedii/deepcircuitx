    "block_comment": "The given block of code is responsible for synchronizing the 'rb_hit_busy_ns_lcl' signal to the clock, specifically on the rising edge of the clock ('posedge clk'). It uses non-blocking assignment ('<='), thus allowing concurrent updates in the same simulation timestep. A '#TCQ' delay is imposed on the process to depict the propagation delay of the circuit. The resultant 'rb_hit_busy_r' signal represents the delayed, synchronized version of the 'rb_hit_busy_ns_lcl' signal."
