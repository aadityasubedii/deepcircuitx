Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_dqs_found_cal. Module specification: This module performs DQS (Data Strobe) signal detection and calibration for a DDR (Double Data Rate) memory interface. It handles the process of finding and adjusting the timing of DQS signals across multiple ranks and banks of memory. The module takes inputs such as clk (clock), rst (reset), pi_dqs_found_start (start signal), and pi_dqs_found_lanes (DQS found status for each lane). It outputs signals including pi_rst_stg1_cal (reset signal for stage 1 calibration), rd_data_offset (read data offset values), and pi_dqs_found_done (overall DQS found process completed). Internally, it uses signals like dqs_found_start_r (registered start
