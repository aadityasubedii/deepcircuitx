    "module": "Module-level comment: This module generates and controls various clocks and reset signals for a memory interface in Xilinx 7 series devices. It uses a PLL and MMCM to create multiple clock outputs with configurable frequencies and phases. The module implements clock generation, phase shifting, and reset synchronization logic. It also includes power-on control and optional user interface clocks. The design ensures proper timing and stability for memory operations through careful clock management and reset handling."
