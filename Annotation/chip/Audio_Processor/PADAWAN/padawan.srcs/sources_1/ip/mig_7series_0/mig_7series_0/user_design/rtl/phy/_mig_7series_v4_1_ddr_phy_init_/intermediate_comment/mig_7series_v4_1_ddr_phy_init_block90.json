    "block_comment": "This block implements a counter for accessing complex rows during read operations in a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) design. Upon encountering a positive edge of the clock, the block resets the counter if the reset signal is high or the PRBS reading level is completed. If these conditions are not met, the block updates the counter based on logic involving the read done signals' states. The block increments the reading counter by 1 given certain conditions, otherwise, it maintains the same value. The ternary operator also helps to handle the edge case where the reading counter reaches its maximum count (COMPLEX_RD-1), in which case, it resets the counter to zero."
