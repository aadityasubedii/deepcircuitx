    "block_comment": "This block of code serves as a register block in a memory controller design. It implements a large amount of non-blocking assignments, ensuring all registers have their values updated in a synchronous manner. This routing mechanism waits for a change in any of the signals listed in the `always` construct, and subsequently assigns their new state values to corresponding variables with a delay of `#TCQ`. Thus, it controls the flow of data through the memory controller circuit, offering precise timing control and ensuring data integrity during operation."
