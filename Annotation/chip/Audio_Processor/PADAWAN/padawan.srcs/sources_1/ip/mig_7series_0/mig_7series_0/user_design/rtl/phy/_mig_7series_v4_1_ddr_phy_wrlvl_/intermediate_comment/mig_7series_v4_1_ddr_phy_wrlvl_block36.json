    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is a synchronous (clocked) logic module that controls the read/write leveling procedure in a DDR memory system. It employs a series of pipelined registers, implemented through the use of nonblocking assignments, to delay the propagation of the `phy_ctl_ready` signal. After every clock cycle, each register will capture the state of the previous register, creating a chain of delayed signals. The `wr_level_done` signal, which signifies the completion of the write leveling procedure, is conditionally assigned based on the current and previous states of the `wrlvl_byte_redo` and `wrlvl_final` signals. If either signal is high while the preceding one is low, this implies that either a byte or the final stage in the write leveling is intended to redo hence the `wr_level_done` signal is forced low, indicating that the write leveling operation is not complete. Otherwise, the `wr_level_done` signal takes the value of `done_dqs_dec`."
