Comment: 
This block of Verilog code describes a combinational logic operation where the output depends only on the current inputs. The function of the block is to compute the logical NOR of the inverted values of the variables 'first_rising_ps_clk_r' and 'mmcm_hi0_r'. The operator '~' is a bitwise NOT operator that inverts the value of its operand. The operator '||' is a logical OR operator. The result of this operation is assigned to 'mmcm_hi0_ns' immediately at any change in the input values, as indicated by the always @(*) statement. This code block is typically used to detect certain states or conditions based on the values of the input signals.
