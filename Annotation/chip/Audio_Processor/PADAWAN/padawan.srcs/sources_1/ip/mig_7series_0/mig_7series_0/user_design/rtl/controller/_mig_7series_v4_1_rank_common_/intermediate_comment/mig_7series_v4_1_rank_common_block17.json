    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code aims to create an assignment for 'app_ref_ack'. Specifically, the code establishes a continuous assignment statement which immediately assigns the value of 'app_ref_ack_r' to the 'app_ref_ack' wire. This means that any change in the value of 'app_ref_ack_r' causes an instant update to the 'app_ref_ack' wire, demonstrating real-time relationship between these two components."
