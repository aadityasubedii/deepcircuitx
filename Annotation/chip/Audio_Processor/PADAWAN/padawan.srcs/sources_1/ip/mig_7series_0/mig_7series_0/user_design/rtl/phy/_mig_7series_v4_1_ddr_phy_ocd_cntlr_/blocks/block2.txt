Comment: 
This Verilog code block describes a state machine for DDR calibration, which monitors and modifies various aspects like read latency, write latency, and clock delay calibration. The state machine has eight states (0 to 7), with different operations performed in each state. The machine is reset with 'rst' (reset) as 1. If calibration is needed ('oclkdelay_calib_start' or 'complex_oclkdelay_calib_start' are true), it proceeds to the next state. In these calibration stages, it adjusts latency ('lim_start_ns') and scans for optimal values ('reset_scan_ns'). If a 'scan_done' or 'lim_done' condition is met, it advances to the subsequent states. Upon reaching state '3\'d6', it checks for a match with 'DQS_WIDTH' and then adjusts 'byte_ns' and 'po_rd_wait_ns'. In state '3\'d7', it checks 'po_rd_wait_r' and 'po_counter_read_val' to decide whether to continue 'byte_ns' increment or conclude calibration by resetting states and enabling output flags ('oclkdelay_calib_done_ns', 'wrlvl_final_ns', and 'complex_oclkdelay_calib_done_ns').
