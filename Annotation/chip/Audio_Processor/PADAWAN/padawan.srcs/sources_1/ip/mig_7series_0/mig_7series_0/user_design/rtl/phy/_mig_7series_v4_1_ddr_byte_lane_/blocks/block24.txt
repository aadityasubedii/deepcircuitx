Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code is assigning the value '1' ("high" logic level or "true") to the signal 'phy_rd_en_' after a 25 time-units delay. This implementation is made using the non-blocking assignment operator ('assign') with a delay value ('#(25)'), a common method for modeling combinational logic or continuous assignments in hardware description language.
