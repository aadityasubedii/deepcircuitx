This block is responsible for controlling the 'num_samples_done_r' flag using the system clock. It achieves this through a series of conditional if-else statements which check various states of the 'prbs_state_r' variable and also evaluate the 'samples_cnt_r'. If the system is in reset state, or if 'prbs_state_r' is in either 'PRBS_DEC_DQS', 'PRBS_INC_DQS', 'FINE_PI_INC', or 'FINE_PI_DEC' states, 'num_samples_done_r' is set to 0. In addition, if 'samples_cnt_r' matches 'NUM_SAMPLES_CNT', 'num_samples_done_r' is set to 1 denying further samples. Lastly, if none of these conditions hold, it jumps to the 'victim_not_fixed' state.
