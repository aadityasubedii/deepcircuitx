    "block_comment": "The block of code functions as a timer to refresh a system at a specific clock cycle. The first line of the block utilises the positive edge of a clock, 'clk', to set the refresh timer, 'refresh_timer_r' with a delay defined by the constant '#TCQ'. The second line assigns a local refresh tick, 'refresh_tick_lcl', if 'refresh_timer_r' equals to a constant 'ONE' sliced with REFRESH_TIMER_WIDTH and a maint_prescaler_tick_r_lcl is true. This operation serves as a condition to enable the refresh tick locally when the designated refresh time is reached and the prescaler tick is present."
