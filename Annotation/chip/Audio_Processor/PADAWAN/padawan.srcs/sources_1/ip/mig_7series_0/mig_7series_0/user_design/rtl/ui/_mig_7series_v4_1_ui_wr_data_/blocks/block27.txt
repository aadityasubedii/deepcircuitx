This block of Verilog code updates and assigns the write data address for a wishbone bus with synchronous reset capabilities. Upon positive edge trigger of the clock, it captures the next state 'wb_wr_data_addr0_ns' into register 'wb_wr_data_addr0_r' after a time delay defined by 'TCQ'. The effective write data address 'wb_wr_data_addr' is formed by concatenating two registered addresses 'wb_wr_data_addr_r' and 'wb_wr_data_addr0_r'. The future write-data-address 'wb_wr_data_addr_w' is similarly formed by concatenating two next-state addresses 'wb_wr_data_addr_ns' and 'wb_wr_data_addr0_ns'.
