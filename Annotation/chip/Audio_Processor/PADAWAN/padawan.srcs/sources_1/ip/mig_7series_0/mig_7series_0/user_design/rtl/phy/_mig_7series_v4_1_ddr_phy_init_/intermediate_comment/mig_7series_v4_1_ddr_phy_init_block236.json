    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the write calibration final check \"wrcal_final_chk\" based on certain conditions. Upon a rising edge of clock \"clk\", if a reset \"rst\" is detected, the output of the block \"wrcal_final_chk\" is set to 0 with a delay of \"TCQ\" time units. If a reset is not detected, but instead if in the next state the write calibration is active \"init_next_state == INIT_WRCAL_ACT\" and either write calibration is done \"wrcal_done\" or the Calibration is skipped \"SKIP_CALIB==TRUE\" and the DRAM Type is DDR3, \"wrcal_final_chk\" is set to 1 after a delay of \"TCQ\" time units."
