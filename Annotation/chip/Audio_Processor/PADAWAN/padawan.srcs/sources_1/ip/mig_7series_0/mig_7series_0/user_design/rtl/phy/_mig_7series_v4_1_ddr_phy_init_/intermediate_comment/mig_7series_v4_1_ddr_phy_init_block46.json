    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs write calibration that hasn't been done yet, discerned by the `wrcal_done` control signal. If `wrcal_done` is true, it means write calibration has been completed. When write calibration isn't completed (`wrcal_done` is false), the block generates and assigns patterns to `phy_wrdata` based on the value of `wrcal_pat_cnt`, which seems to be a 2-bit counter value. These patterns are assigned after a delay specified by a parameter `TCQ` and replicated based on `DQ_WIDTH/4` for each hexadecimal value within the brackets. Various bit patterns ('5A0F', '695A', '4E1B', '8DE4') are used in this calibration step."
