    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the grant processing for periodic read operations in a multi-rank memory system. Specifically, it defines logic for updating the rank number when a read grant is issued. The block performs these tasks whenever a change happens to periodic read grants, the local copy of periodic read rank, or the signal for rank master update. Initially, it assigns the local copy of periodic read rank to the next state. Then, if the update rank master signal is high, it iterates over all ranks, and if a periodic read grant is active for a particular rank, it assigns the rank number to the next state's periodic read rank, utilizing the least significant bits of 'i'."
