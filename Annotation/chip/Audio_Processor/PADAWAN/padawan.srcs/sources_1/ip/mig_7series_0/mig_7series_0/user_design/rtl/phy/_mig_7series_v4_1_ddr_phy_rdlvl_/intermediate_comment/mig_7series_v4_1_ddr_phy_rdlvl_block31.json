    "block_comment": "This block within a Verilog RTL code captures and stores the rise and fall times of certain signals related to 'sr' and 'mpr' whenever they are valid. It operates synchronously with a clock signal (posedge clk). On each clock cycle, if either 'sr_valid_r' or 'mpr_valid_r' is true, the code captures the current rise and fall time values of the signals 'sr_riseX_r' and 'sr_fallX_r' (where X ranges from 0 to 3), delayed by a specific #TCQ time and places them in the 'prev' storage variables. Similarly, if 'store_sr_r' is also true along with either 'sr_valid_r' or 'mpr_valid_r', these values are additionally stored in 'old' storage variables."
