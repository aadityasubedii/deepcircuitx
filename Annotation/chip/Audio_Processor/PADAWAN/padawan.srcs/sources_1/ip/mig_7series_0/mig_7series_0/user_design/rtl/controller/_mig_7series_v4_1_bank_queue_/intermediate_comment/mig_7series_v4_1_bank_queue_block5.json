    "block_comment": "This line of code represents a continuous assignment statement into the 'q_has_rd' wire in a Verilog code. It indicates that the value of 'q_has_rd' will keep track of 'q_has_rd_r' value in real time. Whenever there's a change in the 'q_has_rd_r', the same will be reflected instantaneously to 'q_has_rd'. This mechanism of assigning values continuously plays a crucial role in maintaining synchrony between various registers in a hardware circuit during its operation."
