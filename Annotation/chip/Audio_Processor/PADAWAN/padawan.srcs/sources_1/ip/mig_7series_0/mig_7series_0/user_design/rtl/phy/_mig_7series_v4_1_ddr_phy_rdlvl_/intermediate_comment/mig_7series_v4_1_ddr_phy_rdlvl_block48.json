    "block_comment": "This block of code corresponds to a verilog block that controls pattern matching when the event of (nCK_PER_CLK equals 2) occurs and is part of a larger case block, or decision-making mechanism. This particular block's purpose is to loop over the entire width of a theoretical DRAM memory component, iterating over one \"DRAM unit\" at a time within the for loop. It's important to note that this conditional block instance is tagged as \"gen_pat_match_div2\" to allow for later hierarchical referencing, and the generative component of the loop is tagged as \"gen_pat_match\"."
