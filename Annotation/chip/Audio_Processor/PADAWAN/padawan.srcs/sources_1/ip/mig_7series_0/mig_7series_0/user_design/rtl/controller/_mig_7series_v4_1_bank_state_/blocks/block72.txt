Comment: 
The function of this block is a D flip-flop that is utilized to store and delay the `rmw_wait_ns` signal by a time determined by `TCQ` for the next clock cycle. The block achieves this function by using an `always` statement that is triggered at the positive edge of the clock signal. When a rising edge on the `clk` is detected, the `rmw_wait_ns` signal gets latched and retains its state over the period denoted by `TCQ` until the next positive edge is encountered.
