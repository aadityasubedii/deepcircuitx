Comment: 
This is a flip-flop block that is generally used for storing the next state of the `app_rd_data_valid` signal in a synchronous system design. When a clock (`clk`) edge (specifically the rising edge) is detected, the signal `app_rd_data_valid` is assigned the value of `app_rd_data_valid_ns` after a delay of time #TCQ. This implementation is typical in pipelined modules where latching the signal helps in data synchronization during different clock cycles.

Note: 
Without the full context of the verilog file, assumptions were made. `#TCQ` is assumed as the delay number from the clock's positive edge and `app_rd_data_valid_ns` is assumed as the signal to be stored.
