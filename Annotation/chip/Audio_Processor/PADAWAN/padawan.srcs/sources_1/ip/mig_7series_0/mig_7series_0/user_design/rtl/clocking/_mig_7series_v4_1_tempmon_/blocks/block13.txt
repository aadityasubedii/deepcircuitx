This block of code constitutes a timer utilized in an XADC (Xilinx Analog to Digital Converter) environment. It performs operations at the rising edge of the XADC clock. On reset (either through 'rst_r2' or 'sample_timer_clr'), the timer is set to zero. When enabled by 'sample_timer_en', the timer increments its count. The delay element '#TCQ' mitigates any race conditions in the digital circuit.
