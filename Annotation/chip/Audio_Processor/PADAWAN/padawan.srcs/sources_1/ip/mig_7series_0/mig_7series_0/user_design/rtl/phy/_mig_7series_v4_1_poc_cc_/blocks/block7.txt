Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code handles the registering of the next-state ‘poc_error_ns’ value into the current-state register ‘poc_error_r’. The block’s function is triggered at the positive edge of the clock signal, conforming to standard digital synchronous design methodology. Under delay modeling, the register value change happens after a delay specified by the '#TCQ' timing control, which is used to represent the time required for the signal to propagate through a component in a real-world hardware situation.
