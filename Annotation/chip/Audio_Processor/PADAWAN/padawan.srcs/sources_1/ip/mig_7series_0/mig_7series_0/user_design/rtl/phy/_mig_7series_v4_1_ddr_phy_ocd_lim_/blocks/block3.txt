This block of code implements a reset synchronization circuit for three types of limiter: `stg3_left_lim`, `simp_stg3_left_lim`, and `cmplx_stg3_left_lim`. At every positive edge of the clock cycle, if a reset command is received, it initializes these three limit registers to zero. In the absence of a reset command, if certain condition (`stg3_inc2init_val_r && !stg3_inc2init_val_r1`) is met, the stage-3 tap count value is stored in limiters depending upon the `oclkdelay_calib_done` condition. Finally, if a limiter start command is received, `stg3_left_lim` gets reset to zero. The delay between input and output is set by `#TCQ`.
