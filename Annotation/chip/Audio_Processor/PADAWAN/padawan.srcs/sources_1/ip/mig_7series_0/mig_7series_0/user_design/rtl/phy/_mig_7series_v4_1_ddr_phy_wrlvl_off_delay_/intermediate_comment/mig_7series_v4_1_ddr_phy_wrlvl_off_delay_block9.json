    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a series of delay elements in the form of registers for the 'po_delay_done' signal. The operation starts at each positive clock edge of 'clk'; afterward, the signal 'po_delay_done' is sequentially delayed by a time constant 'TCQ' through the flip-flops 'po_delay_done_r1', 'po_delay_done_r2', 'po_delay_done_r3', and 'po_delay_done_r4'. This essentially creates a pipeline of delayed versions of 'po_delay_done'."
