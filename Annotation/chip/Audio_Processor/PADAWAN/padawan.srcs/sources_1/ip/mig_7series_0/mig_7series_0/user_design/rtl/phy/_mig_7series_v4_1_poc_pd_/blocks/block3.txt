Comment: 
This block of Verilog code creates a flip-flop that is triggered on the positive edge of the clock cycle. It assigns the value of the variable q1_delayed to pos_edge_samp on each rising edge of the clock signal. This implementation implies that there's a requirement to capture and store the status of q1_delayed synchronously. Note the use of the non-blocking assignment operator (<=), which provides a method to mimic concurrent behavior akin to actual hardware.
