    "block_comment": "This block assigns binary values to eight pattern variables in total, possibly representing varied signal patterns. There appear to be two sets of variables, one for rising edge (pat_rise) and the other for falling edge (pat_fall), each further divided into four numbered segments (0 through 3). Specifically, it sets '1' for rising patterns and '0' for falling patterns in the first pair, whereas it reverses this assignment in the other two pairs."
