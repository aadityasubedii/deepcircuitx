This block of code is a wrapper around a PHASER_REF module instance. The PHASER_REF is responsible for handling the phasing operations between the reference clock and the clock in phase-locked-loop design. Input signals include a reference clock (freq_refclk), and a reset signal that is triggered when the PLL is not locked (!pll_lock). The 'LOCKED' output is asserted when the DLL has achieved phase lock. Also, the 'PWRDWN' is constantly set to false (1'b0), indicating that the module does not go through a power down sequence.
