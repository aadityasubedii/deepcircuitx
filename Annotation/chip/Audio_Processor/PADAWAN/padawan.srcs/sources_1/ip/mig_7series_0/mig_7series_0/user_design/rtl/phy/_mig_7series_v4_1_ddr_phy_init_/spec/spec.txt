Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_init. Module specification: This module is responsible for initializing and calibrating a DDR (Double Data Rate) memory interface. It handles various initialization stages including power-on, mode register programming, write leveling, read leveling, and calibration procedures for DDR2 and DDR3 memory types. The module takes inputs such as clk, rst, prbs_o, delay_incdec_done, and various status signals, while providing outputs like pi_phaselock_start, pi_calib_done, and various control signals. Key internal signals include state machines (init_state_r, init_next_state), counters (cnt_pwron_cke_r, cnt_init_mr_r), and configuration registers (mr1_r, mr2_r). The module is divided into several functional blocks
