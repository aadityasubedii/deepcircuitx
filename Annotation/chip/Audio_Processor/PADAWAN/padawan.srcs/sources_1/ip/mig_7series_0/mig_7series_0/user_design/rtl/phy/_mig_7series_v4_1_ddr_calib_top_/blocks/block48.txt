Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is providing signal assignments for part of a complex oclock calibration system. It achieves this through three assignments. 'complex_oclkdelay_calib_cnt' is assigned the current value of 'oclkdelay_calib_cnt', 'complex_oclk_calib_resume' is assigned the value of 'oclk_calib_resume' and 'complex_ocal_ref_req' receives the current status of the 'oclk_prech_req'. These assignments suggest a system which copies over certain signals to other parts for further usage or processing, keeping the original values intact for other operations.
