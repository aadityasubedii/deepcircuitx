Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code implements a register for a state machine. On every rising edge of the 'clk' signal (a positive clock edge), the next state of the state machine ('sm_ns') is captured and stored in the state machine register ('sm_r'), after a delay specified by 'TCQ', which represents the clock-to-Q delay.
