    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a wire `maint_hit_this_bm` that detects if a certain condition is met. The condition is that both `maint_idle` should be false (represented by `~maint_idle`) and `maint_hit` should be true. The wire `maint_hit_this_bm` will be true only when `maint_idle` is not in idle state and a hit is detected by `maint_hit`. This is achieved using logical AND (`&&`) operator which ensures that both conditions have to be true for the output to be true."
