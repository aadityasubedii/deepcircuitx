    "block_comment": "This line of code performs a wire assignment task in the Verilog design. Specifically, it assigns the right-hand signal (`ocd2stg2_inc_r`) to the left-hand wire (`ocd2stg2_inc`). This wiring signifies that the state or values for `ocd2stg2_inc` will replicate the current state of `ocd2stg2_inc_r`, and any change in the state of `ocd2stg2_inc_r` will instantly propagate to `ocd2stg2_inc`. It serves as a basic link between `ocd2stg2_inc_r`, and `ocd2stg2_inc`, ensuring that they remain identically synchronized."
