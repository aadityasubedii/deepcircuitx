    "block_comment": "This block handles the initialization of the DQS (Data-strobe) found flag for all memory ranks. It uses synchronous reset logic, triggering on the positive edge of the clock signal. If a reset condition is met (global reset or stage 1 reset), the 'init_dqsfound_done_r' flag is set to 0, clearing any previous flag state. If the DQS has been found for all banks (indicated by the 'pi_dqs_found_all_bank' flag), the 'init_dqsfound_done_r' flag is set appropriately based on the comparison of the current rank count with the total number of ranks. This comparison ensures the flag is set only when all ranks have been accounted for."
