    "block_comment": "This block of code is an always block, triggered on the positive edge of the system clock. The block assigns a non-blocking delay of TCQ units to the rd_data_indx_ns, and the result is updated to rd_data_indx_r on every rising edge of the clock. The delay represents the propagation delay, modeling the time it takes for changes to propagate through the logic element represented by the variable TCQ."
