    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog describes the functioning of the FINE_CALC_TAPS and FINE_CALC_TAPS_WAIT states within a Finite State Machine (FSM). While in the FINE_CALC_TAPS state, the block of code resets multiple flags and two counters, preparing for fine delay-line tuning. Specifically, it sets match flags to all high, indicating no match initially, and initializes the prbs_state_r as FINE_CALC_TAPS_WAIT for the countdown. When the FSM moves to the FINE_CALC_TAPS_WAIT state, it performs additional calculations for the fine delay-line control. Depending on the condition of center_comp, it adjusts the fine_pi_dec_cnt by calculating the offset from the right edge or the center, and also sets an error flag if there's a decimal underflow during calculation. After processing all bits, it proceeds with stage incrementation, sets fine_delay_sel to true, and transitions to the RD_DONE_WAIT_FOR_PI_INC_DEC state, signaling the end of fine delay tuning."
