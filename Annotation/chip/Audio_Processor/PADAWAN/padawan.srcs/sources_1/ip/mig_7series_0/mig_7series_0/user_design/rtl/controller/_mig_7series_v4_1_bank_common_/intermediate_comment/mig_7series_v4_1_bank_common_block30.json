    "block_comment": "This block of code either disables the operation mode or enables and counts the idle cycles depending on the condition specified by `nOP_WAIT`. If `nOP_WAIT` equals to zero, the operation mode is disabled assigning the `op_exit_grant` a value of 0 for each `nBANK_MACHS`. On the other hand, if `nOP_wait` is non-zero indicating operation mode is enabled, two registers `idle_cnt_r` and `idle_cnt_ns` are declared - these are used to track the idle cycles in the operation mode with `BM_CNT_WIDTH`, a width of the register being defined by the constant `BM_CNT_WIDTH`."
