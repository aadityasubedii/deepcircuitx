    "block_comment": "The block of code appears to be a state machine for controlling a pulse generation operation in a digital circuit, implemented using Verilog HDL. When a reset signal (_rst_) is high, the state machine resets various parameters including counters, flags, and next-state variables to their default values. In the absence of reset, a case-switch based logic decides the value of the parameters and the next state based on the current state (_sm_r_). There are four distinct states (0 to 3), with state 0 being responsible for sampling controls, state 1 transitioning to state 2, state 2 handling pulse generation, counters, and polarity update logic, and state 3 waiting for a done signal (_psdone_) to reset. The block also includes arithmetic and conditional operations for counters and logic manipulation."
