    "block_comment": "The code block is a synchronous counter with reset functionality. Triggered by positive-edge clock cycles, it initially sets `final_do_index[i]` to 0 during reset condition (`rst`). After reset, the block, on each clock cycle, incrementally counts the index by adding 1 to `final_do_index[i]`, which introduces a delay defined by `TCQ`."
