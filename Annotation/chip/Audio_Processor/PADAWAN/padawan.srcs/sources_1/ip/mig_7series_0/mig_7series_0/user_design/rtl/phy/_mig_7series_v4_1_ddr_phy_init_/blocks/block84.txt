This block is a counter module in Verilog RTL that manages different wait states in complex Read/Write actions. Upon receiving a clock edge, the counter either resets if the reset signal is high or increments if the system is in certain complex states and the count is below a specific threshold. In other situations, it clears the counter to zero. It uses inferred flip flops for the counter logic which is clocked by a positive edge of clk signal, where the active high reset(rst) asynchronously resets the counter and in the absence of reset, the counter increments based on various conditions checked for init_state_r state machine. If none of the conditions are true, the counter is reset to zero.
