    "block_comment": "The given Verilog RTL code block is responsible for updating a select signal, 'sel', upon a rising edge ('posedge') of the input clock signal 'clk_i'. It employs a delay-based latch behaviour where the 'sel' value is assigned after a delay of only 'TCQ' time units. Specifically, the new value given to 'sel' is obtained by repeating 8'h08 for 'DQ_WIDTH/8' times. Consequently, this represents a simple repetitive pattern generator, where the 'sel' signal is driven to a constant, repeating pattern each and every time a clock pulse occurs."
