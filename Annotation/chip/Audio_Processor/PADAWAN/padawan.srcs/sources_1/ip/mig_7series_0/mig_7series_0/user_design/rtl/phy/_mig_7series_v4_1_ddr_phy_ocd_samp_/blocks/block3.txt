Comment: 
This block of code declares a wire named `samp_end` that checks if the current sample count `samps_r` is equal to the maximum value represented by a binary vector of width `SAMP_CNT_WIDTH`. This is implemented in Verilog by comparing `samps_r` with `ONE[SAMP_CNT_WIDTH-1:0]`, effectively making `samp_end` a flag that indicates when the sampling has reached its end or max count.
