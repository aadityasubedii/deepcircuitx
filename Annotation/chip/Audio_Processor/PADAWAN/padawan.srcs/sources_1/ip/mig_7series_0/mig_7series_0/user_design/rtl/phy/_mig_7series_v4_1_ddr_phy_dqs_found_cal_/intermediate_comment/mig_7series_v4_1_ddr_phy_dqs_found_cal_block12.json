    "block_comment": "This block of code is a synchronizer for the retry counter in a memory read or write operation. Whenever a clock pulse arrives, the logic within the block is executed. If a reset signal is activated, or a rank operation is complete (as denoted by 'rank_done_r'), the retry counter is reset. If neither of these conditions prevail, but a memory read operation is in progress (where the data offset pointer of the rank is less than the sum of column and activation latency) and no data has been found in any bank (as per 'pi_dqs_found_all_bank[0]'), the retry counter increments. If none of these conditions hold true, the retry counter remains the same."
