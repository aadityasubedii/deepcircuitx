    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines an output FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory buffer, named `out_fifo`, for data management. The FIFO accepts input data on a write clock (`WRCLK`) and provides output data on a read clock (`RDCLK`). Parameters like the 'almost empty' and 'almost full' indicators are set during instantiation. Inputs to the FIFO are defined by signals `D0-D9`, centered around the write clock, and controlled by the write-enable (`WREN`) signal. Outputs are given by signals `Q0-Q9`, synchronized with the read clock and triggered by a read-enable (`RDEN`) signal. Safety mechanisms include the 'almost empty' and 'almost full' flags, and the 'empty' and 'full' flags, used for flow control. The collection of Q and D signals imply this is a 10-bit wide FIFO memory management module."
