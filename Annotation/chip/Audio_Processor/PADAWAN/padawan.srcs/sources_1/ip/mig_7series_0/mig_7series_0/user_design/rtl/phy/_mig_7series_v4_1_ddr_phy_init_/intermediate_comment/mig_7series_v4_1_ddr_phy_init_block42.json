    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for writing data to a DDR3 DRAM physical interface. Based on different statuses of clock delay calibration and write calibration, it assigns different patterns to 'phy_wrdata'. When 'oclkdelay_calib_done' is not set and the DRAM type is DDR3, it writes a pattern of alternating 'F' and '0' hexadecimal values. If 'wrcal_done' is not set and the DRAM type is DDR3, the pattern written depends on 'extend_cal_pat' and 'first_wrcal_pat_r': if these are true, a more complex pattern ('6', '9', 'A', '5') is written to 'phy_wrdata'. These operations occur at the positive edge of the clock signal, incorporating a delay parameter 'TCQ'."
