    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is designed to set the `run_too_small_ns` flag when specific conditions are met. The flag `run_too_small_ns` gets set if the current run is nearing its end (`run_end` is true) and if it's less than a quarter of the total allowable value (`run < TAPSPERKCLK/4`). This is essentially a warning system to allow for remedial action if the run clocks fewer ticks than a set threshold."
