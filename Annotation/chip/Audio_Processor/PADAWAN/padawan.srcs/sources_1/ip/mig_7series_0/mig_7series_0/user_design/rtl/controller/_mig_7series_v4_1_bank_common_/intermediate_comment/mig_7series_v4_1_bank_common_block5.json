    "block_comment": "The presented block of code initializes and controls a synchronous reset for a circuit module. The reset operation is controlled by the `if` statement which is responsible for checking incoming `rst` signal (which stands for reset). The module `rst` will set `n` (output signal) to zero when `rst` is 1, according to the condition specified by the if condition. This is an asynchronous operation because the action of resetting `n` is not governed by any clock signal, it occurs immediately once the `rst` signal triggers the `if` conditional. So, basically, this block is fast reacting to reset conditions to instantly pull down the output signal `n`. It's a common design practice in digital circuit design to reliably drive the logic to a known state under respective reset conditions."
