    "block_comment": "This block of code institutes a delay element for a pipelined design in a synchronous system. More precisely, it sets a delayed previous version of the `cmplx_stg3_final_ns` signal to the `cmplx_stg3_final_r` register on the positive edge of a clock. The delay is determined by the `#TCQ` time delay, ensuring that `cmplx_stg3_final_ns` is processed through the pipeline stages in synchronization with the `clk` signal."
