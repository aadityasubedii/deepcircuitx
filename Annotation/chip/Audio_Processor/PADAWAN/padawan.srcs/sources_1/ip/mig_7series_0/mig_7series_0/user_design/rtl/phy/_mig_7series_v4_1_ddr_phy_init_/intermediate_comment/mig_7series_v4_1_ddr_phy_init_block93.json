    "block_comment": "This block directs a specific action to occur upon the positive edge of the clock cycle. Specifically, it sets the value of the `complex_row0_rd_done_r1` signal after a delay defined by `TCQ`, based on the value of the signal `complex_row0_rd_done`. This operation ensures that the `complex_row0_rd_done_r1` only gets updated, after the desired delay, when a new clock cycle starts, thus managing the timing of operations in the overall RTL design."
