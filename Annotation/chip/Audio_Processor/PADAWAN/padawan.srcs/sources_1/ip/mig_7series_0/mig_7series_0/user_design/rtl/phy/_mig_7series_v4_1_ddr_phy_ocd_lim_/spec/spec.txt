Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_ocd_lim. Module specification: This module is part of a memory interface generator (MIG) for 7series FPGAs, designed to handle on-chip delay (OCD) limits of the DDR PHY. It manages delay calibration processes through various states, including IDLE, INIT, WAIT_WR_REQ, and others. The module takes inputs such as clk, rst, lim_start, po_rdy, and various alignment taps, and outputs signals like lim2init_write_request, lim2poc_rdy, and lim2stg3_inc. Internal signals include state registers, tap counters, and debugging signals. The module implements a state machine to control the calibration process, adjusting stage 2 and 3 taps based on MM
