    "block_comment": "This block of code is a combinational block that updates widths of fine and coarse tap counters based on DQS signal interface width (DQS_WIDTH). It uses a for loop to iterate through all tap counters and assign their fine and coarse widths into appropriate portions of po_fine_tap_cnt_w and po_coarse_tap_cnt_w vectors respectively, with index derived from scaling the tap number (d) up by 6 and 3 respectively."
