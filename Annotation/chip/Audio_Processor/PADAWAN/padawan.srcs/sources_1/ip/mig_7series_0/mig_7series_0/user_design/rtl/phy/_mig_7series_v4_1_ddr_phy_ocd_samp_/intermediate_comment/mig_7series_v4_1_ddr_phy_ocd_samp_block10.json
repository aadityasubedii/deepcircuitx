    "block_comment": "This block of code handles updating the sampled results within a digital circuit. The block listens for a reset signal; if it's high, it will reset the sampled result to 0. If not, it either maintains the current sampled results or changes certain bits based on a combination of the validity of the sampled signal and the value of specific thresholds. Particularly, bit 0 flips to 1 if it was 0 and the variable 'zero_ge_thresh' is true, or to 0 if it was 1 and 'zero_le_half_thresh' is true. Likewise, bit 1 flips to 1 if it was 0 and 'oneeighty_ge_thresh' is true, or to 0 if it was 1 and 'oneeighty_le_half_thresh' is true. This conditional implementation manages the state of the system samples, being sensitive to the values of different thresholds, supporting thus a level of adaptability.\n"
