    "block_comment": "The function `clogb2` in this block of code calculates the ceiling of log base 2 of an input integer. It begins by decrementing the input size by 1. Then, it enters a loop where with each iteration, the function increments a counter and right shifts the size by one place until the size is no longer greater than 1, effectively dividing it by 2 each time. This way, it achieves the calculation of the ceiling of log base 2 and returns the count as the output."
