    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages the error handling for the data strobe signal (DQS) during read and write operations. On every rising edge of the clock, if the reset signal is active, the error flag for the first DQS signal is cleared. If the reset signal is not active, but the DQS signal was not found across all memory banks, a retry count equals the required number of calibration sequences and the read byte data offset is less than the sum of the Column Address Strobe Latency (nCL) and the Added Latency (nAL) minus one, an error is raised for the first DQS signal."
