This block oversees the operation of the ZQ timer, particularly its value update process. Triggered whenever initialization calibration is completed, a maint_prescaler tick signal is received, or a zq_tick event happens, the block primarily resets the ZQ timer to some predefined value (`ZQ_TIMER_DIV`). If both `zq_timer_r` is non-zero and a `maint_prescaler_tick_r_lcl` event occurs, the timer countdown begins (`zq_timer_r - ONE[ZQ_TIMER_WIDTH-1:0]`).
