    "block_comment": "This block of code essentially manages the tracking of the phase shift of a clock through a Phase-locked loop (PLL) using variables `compare_err_pb_and` and `compare_err_pb_or`. Essentially, it miptures system state to control the PLL adjustments. More specifically, on each rising edge of the clock, it checks if the system is in a reset state, a phase increase state, a phase decrease state, or not in a waiting period following a phase increase or decrease. If any of these conditions are met, it sets `compare_err_pb_and` and `compare_err_pb_or` to 0. Otherwise, it adjusts these variables based on the value of `compare_err_pb`, indicating whether there is an error in phase tracking. It uses a bitwise AND and OR operation respectively to update these variables."
