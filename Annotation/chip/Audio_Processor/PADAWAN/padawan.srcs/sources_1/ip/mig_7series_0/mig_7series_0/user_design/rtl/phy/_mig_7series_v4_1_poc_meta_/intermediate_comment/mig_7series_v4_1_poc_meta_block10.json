    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block is used for updating the previous state signal 'prev_ns'. It accomplishes this update using a conditional assignment operation based on the value of 'done_ns'. If 'done_ns' holds a true (or high) value, then the value of 'diff_r' is assigned to 'prev_ns'. If 'done_ns' holds a false (or low) value, then the value of 'prev_r' is assigned to 'prev_ns'. This operation takes place at every positive edge of the clock signal, ensuring the status of 'prev_ns' is updated in each clock cycle."
