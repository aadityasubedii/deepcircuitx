    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block implements multiple registers for handling events based on the rising edge of the clock. These registers are used for storing the status of phase locking, DQS signal detection, and calibration completion. The values of these flags are delayed by one clock cycle, facilitated with the use of \"#TCQ\" delay. This lets the system wait for a clock cycle before updating the status in these registers, helping with synchronization."
