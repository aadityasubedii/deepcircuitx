    "block_comment": "This block assigns the output 'auto_pre_r' the value of the internal signal 'auto_pre_r_lcl'. The implementaion involves simply connecting the signals with the '=' operator in Verilog, often used to assign values in continuous assignments. The assigned value will update as soon as 'auto_pre_r_lcl' changes, due to the continuous nature of the 'assign' statement."
