Comment: 
This block assigns the value of the local variable 'rb_hit_busies_r_lcl' to 'rb_hit_busies_r'. The line of code implements a continuous assignment, which means whenever there is a change in the value of 'rb_hit_busies_r_lcl', the new value is immediately applied to 'rb_hit_busies_r'. This design choice allows for real-time data updates.
