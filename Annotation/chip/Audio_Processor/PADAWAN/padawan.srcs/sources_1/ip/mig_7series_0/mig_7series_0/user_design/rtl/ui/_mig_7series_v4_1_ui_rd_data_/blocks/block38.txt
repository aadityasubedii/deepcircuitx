This block of code is responsible for handling the read data validity in a synchronous design. The 'always' block is triggered at the rising edge of the clock signal (clk). Depending on the value of rd_data_en, the value of app_rd_data_valid is updated after a delay specified by the constant TCQ, capturing the delay of transferring the read data valid condition.
