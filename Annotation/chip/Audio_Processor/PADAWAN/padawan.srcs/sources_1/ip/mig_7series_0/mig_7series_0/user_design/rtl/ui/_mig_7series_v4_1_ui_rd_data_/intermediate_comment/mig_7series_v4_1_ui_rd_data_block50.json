    "block_comment": "This is a one-line Verilog RTL code statement that assigns a value to the variable `ram_init_addr`. It does this by fetching a specific section from the variable `rd_buf_indx_r`. Specifically, it retrieves the bit range from index 3 down to 0, and assigns this 4-bit value to `ram_init_addr`. This method is a common way to extract and use subsets of larger bit-width variables in hardware design."
