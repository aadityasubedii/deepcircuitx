This block of code is responsible for managing the store sample-and-hold memory within a computer system. The functionality is solely dependant on the rising edge of the clock signal, hence making it a synchronous sequential circuit part. When the system reset (rst) signal is high, the store sample-and-hold register (store_sr_r) is cleared. However, when the reset signal is not set, the value of the store_sr_r depends on the store request signal (store_sr_req_r) and condition of sample ready (sr_valid_r) or multipurpose register available (mpr_valid_r). If there is a store request, store_sr_r sets to 1, or if sample ready or multipurpose register available, and store_sr_r stores a sample, store_sr_r resets to 0. The propagation delay (TCQ) ensures that the affected signals will transition after the specified time.
