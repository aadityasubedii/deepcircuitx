    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for connecting a reference clock signal. Specifically, it assigns the input reference clock (clk_ref_i) directly to the clk_ref_ibufg signal. This straightforward assignment is performed continuously, ensuring the clk_ref_ibufg signal always mirrors the clk_ref_i input. It might be a part of a larger clock distribution network in a digital design."
