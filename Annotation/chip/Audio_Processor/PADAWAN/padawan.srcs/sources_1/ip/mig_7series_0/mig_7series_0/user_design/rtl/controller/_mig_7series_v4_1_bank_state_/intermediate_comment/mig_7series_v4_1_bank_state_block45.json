    "block_comment": "The block of code defines parameters related to a Precharge command timer in a dynamic RAM controller. It declares a local parameter, \"nRP_CLKS_M2\", which equals to the result of \"(nRP_CLKS-2 < 0) ? 0 : nRP_CLKS-2;\", this is basically setting \"nRP_CLKS_M2\" as \"nRP_CLKS-2\" if \"nRP_CLKS-2\" is non-negative, otherwise, it sets \"nRP_CLKS_M2\" as 0. The second line declares another local parameter, \"RP_TIMER_WIDTH\", whose value is obtained from a function \"clogb2\", taking the argument \"nRP_CLKS_M2+1\", the function computes the ceiling of the base-2 logarithm of \"nRP_CLKS_M2+1\", serving as a way to determine the width of the timer."
