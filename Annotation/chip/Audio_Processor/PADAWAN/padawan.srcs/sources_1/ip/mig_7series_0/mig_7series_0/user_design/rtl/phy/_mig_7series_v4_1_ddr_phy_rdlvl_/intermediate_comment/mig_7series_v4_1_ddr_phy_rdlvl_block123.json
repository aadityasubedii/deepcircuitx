    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns various internal signals and states to a debug PHY Read Level (rdlvl) signal array. Specific bits in the dbg_phy_rdlvl[] bit-vector are linked with different internal signals. For example, bits 0 to 3 are assigned to rdlvl_stg1_start, pat_data_match_r, mux_rd_valid_r and idelay_tap_limit_r respectively. Bit array positions 8 to 4 are zeroed, positions 14 to 9 are assigned with cal1_state_r[5:0], positions 20 to 15 are bound to cnt_idel_dec_cpt_r and positions 21 to 24 are tied to different edge detection signals. This block facilitates debugging by providing visibility to these essential signals through the dbg_phy_rdlvl vector."
