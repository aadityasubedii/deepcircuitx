    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a state machine register in a synchronous sequential digital logic circuit on positive edge of clock signal. It updates the value of the 'cal2_state_r1' register at each positive edge of 'clk' signal by introducing delay of time #TCQ, thus ensuring that the new state occurs precisely after a delay based on TCQ from the clock's rising edge. It helps to maintain the accuracy of timing in the design."
