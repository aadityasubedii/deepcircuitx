This block manages the write request count in a system. It's triggered whenever there's a change in the `rd_data_upd_indx_r`(read data update index), `rst`(reset), `wr_accepted`(write accepted), or `wr_req_cnt_r`(write request count register) signals. The new write request count (`wr_req_cnt_ns`) is initially set to its previous value, and reset to zero if the reset signal is active. If the reset signal is inactive, the write request count increment or decrement is determined based on the values of `wr_accepted` and `rd_data_upd_indx_r` signals. If `wr_accepted` is high and `rd_data_upd_indx_r` is low, the count reduces by one. If `wr_accepted` is low and `rd_data_upd_indx_r` is high, the count increases by one. All other states leave `wr_req_cnt_ns` unchanged.
