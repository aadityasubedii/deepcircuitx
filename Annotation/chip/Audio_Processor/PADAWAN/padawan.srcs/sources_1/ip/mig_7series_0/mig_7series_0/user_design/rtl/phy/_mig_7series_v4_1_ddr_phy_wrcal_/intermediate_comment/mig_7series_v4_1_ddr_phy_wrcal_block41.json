    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code implements a sequential storage of edge-triggered data. The block is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. It updates the values of `sr_riseX_r` and `sr_fallX_r` arrays on each clock cycle with the delay set by `#TCQ`. The data stored in these arrays come from the corresponding `mux_rd_riseX_r` and `mux_rd_fallX_r` arrays, where `X` is a label ranging from 0 to 3. The specific element updated in each array is chosen by the `rd_i` index."
