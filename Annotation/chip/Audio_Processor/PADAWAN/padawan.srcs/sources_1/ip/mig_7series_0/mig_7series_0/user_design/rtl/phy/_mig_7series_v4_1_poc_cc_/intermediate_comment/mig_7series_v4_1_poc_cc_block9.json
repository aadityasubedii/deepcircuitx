    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily used for edge detection in a MMCM (Mixed-Mode Clock Manager) block. The system operates synchronously, where the block triggers at the rising edge of the clock signal (posedge clk). It uses a non-blocking assignment to load the `mmcm_edge_detect_done` flag into the `mmcm_edge_detect_done_r` register after a delay specified by `#TCQ`. This arrangement ensures synchronization of the edge detection completed flag with the system clock, leading to a robust design."
