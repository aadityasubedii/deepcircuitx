Comment: 
The block's purpose is to maintain synchronicity with an assumed clock cycle by updating a certain variable `upd_last_master_r`. Implementation is executed using a delay element, `#TCQ` which provides a delay equal to the propagation delay of a digital logic gate. Upon achieving a positive edge in the clock cycle (`posedge clk`), the variable `upd_last_master_r` is updated to the next state, `upd_last_master_ns`. The operation is completed within a singular clock cycle, maintaining synchronous operation.
