    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for muxing read data using a clock signal. On each positive edge of the clock signal, the block selects and stores read data from four different sources (rd_data_rise0, rd_data_fall0, rd_data_rise1, rd_data_fall1) indexed by the product of DRAM_WIDTH and rd_mux_sel_r added to mux_i, into four different registers (mux_rd_rise0_r, mux_rd_fall0_r, mux_rd_rise1_r, mux_rd_fall1_r). The process delay is defined by the constant TCQ."
