Comment: 
This code block serves as a digital synchronous process in a Verilog design, monitoring for a change on the rising edge of a clock signal (`clk`). The flip-flop `temp_wrcal_done_r` gets assigned the value of `temp_wrcal_done` signal after a delay of `#TCQ` time units. The usage of delay `#TCQ` implies a timing control delay, replicating typical flip-flop behavior.
