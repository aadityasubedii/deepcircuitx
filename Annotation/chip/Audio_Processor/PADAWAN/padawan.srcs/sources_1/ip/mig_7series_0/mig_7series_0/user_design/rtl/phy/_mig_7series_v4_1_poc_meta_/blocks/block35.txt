This block of code handles signal registration. The purpose of the block is to ensure there's a delay from `run_end_r1` to `run_end_r2` every rising edge of the clock, improving the design's overall synchronization. The delay is precisely the value assigned to `#TCQ` every single clock cycle. This action achieves synchronization by mitigating the risks of data corruption due to timing differences, ensuring stability even when working with higher-speed signals.
