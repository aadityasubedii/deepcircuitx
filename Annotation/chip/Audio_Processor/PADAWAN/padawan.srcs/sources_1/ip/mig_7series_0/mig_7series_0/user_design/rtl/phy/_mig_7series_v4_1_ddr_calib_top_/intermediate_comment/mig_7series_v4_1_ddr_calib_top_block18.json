    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for assigning default values to certain hardware control signals. The signals are initialized to their non-active states, with the exceptions like 'oclkdelay_calib_done' which is set to an active state. In the case of bus signals, default values are represented in hexadecimal format for clarity. The code generally ensures proper hardware initializing and setup before runtime to stabilize the system. After initialization, these signals are expected to be driven by other modules within the design."
