This block of code triggers on the rising edge of the 'clk' signal and enables an updating of the 'ninety_offsets_r' register. On each clock cycle, the 'ninety_offsets_r' register is updated with the value of 'ninety_offsets_ns' after the delay defined by '#TCQ'. This delay signifies the time taken for transferring data from 'ninety_offsets_n's to the 'ninety_offsets_r' register.
