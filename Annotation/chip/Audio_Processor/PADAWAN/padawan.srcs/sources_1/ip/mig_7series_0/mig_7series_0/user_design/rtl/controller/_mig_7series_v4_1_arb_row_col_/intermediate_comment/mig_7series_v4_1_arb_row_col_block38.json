    "block_comment": "This block is a sequential logic that updates a register value. On each rising edge of the clock signal (clk), the value of \"sent_col_lcl\" is stored in the register \"sent_col_lcl_r\" after a delay specified by the constant TCQ. This block is essentially a delayed assignment used to synchronize the update of the register value with the system clock."
