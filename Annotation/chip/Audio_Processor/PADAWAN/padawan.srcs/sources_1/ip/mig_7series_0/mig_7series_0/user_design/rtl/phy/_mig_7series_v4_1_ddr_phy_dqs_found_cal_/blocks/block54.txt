This block assigns a value to 'pi_dqs_found_lanes_int' based on the value of 'HIGHEST_LANE'. Depending on the value of 'HIGHEST_LANE', 'pi_dqs_found_lanes_int' is either equal to 'pi_dqs_found_lanes_r3' or shifted bit versions of 'pi_dqs_found_lanes_r3' concatenated with specific bits of zeros to its left. The conditions in the if-statements determine the amount of shift. The 'generate' keyword indicates that the appropriate code for each condition will be instantiated during compile time.
