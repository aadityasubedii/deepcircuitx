Comment: 
This block instantiates a flip-flop which captures the value of 'rise_lead_ns' at every positive edge of 'clk' with propagation delay determined by 'TCQ'. The assignment operation inside the always block signifies that a flip-flop is being modeled: the value of 'rise_lead_ns' will be stored in 'rise_lead_r' at every positive edge of the clock signal 'clk', following the delay defined by '#TCQ'.
