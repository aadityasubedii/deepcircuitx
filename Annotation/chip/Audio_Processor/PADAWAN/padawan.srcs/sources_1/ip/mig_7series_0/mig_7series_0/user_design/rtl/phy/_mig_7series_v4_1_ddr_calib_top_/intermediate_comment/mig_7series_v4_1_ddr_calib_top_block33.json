    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog block is focused on clock-driven calibration control, dealing with various calibration stages such as calibration complete, delay decrement, fine adjustment and writing/reading level operations. At each cycle, based on different conditions, certain calibration options are selected: calibration selection bits' values are set according to different stages, while the calibration inputs and controls are also appropriately adjusted. The bits are derived from mappings or from highest bank configurations, with optional specific bit assignments depending on conditions. Delays are implemented using an instruction (#TCQ) connected to the assignment statements. It also employs extensive use of conditions to manage different calibration scenarios, highlighting its extensive and careful calibration procedures."
