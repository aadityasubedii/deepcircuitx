    "block_comment": "This block simply assigns the reset value for a module named `iddr_rst`. It achieves this function by assigning the value of `rst_sync_r1` to the `iddr_rst`. This is a basic operation in Verilog where a variable (in this case, the `iddr_rst` module) is given the value of another variable (`rst_sync_r1`)."
