Comment: 
The block of code is a sequential circuit that updates a register (`q_has_priority_r`) value based on the next-state value (`q_has_priority_ns`). This operation is activated on every positive edge of the clock pulse (`clk`). The register captures the value of `q_has_priority_ns` with a delay specified by `#TCQ`.
