    "block_comment": "This block of code specifies a register update on the rising edge of the clock signal. The register, po_setup_r, is assigned the value of po_setup_ns, but the assignment is delayed by a specified time delay, TCQ, indicating a timing constraint. This delay is typically used to model a setup requirement or setup time for a subsequent data path element."
