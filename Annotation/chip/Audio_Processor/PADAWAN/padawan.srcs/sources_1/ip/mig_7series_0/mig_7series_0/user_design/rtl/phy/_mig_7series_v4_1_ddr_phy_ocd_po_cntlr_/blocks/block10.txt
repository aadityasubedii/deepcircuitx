Comment: 
The block serves as an increment update control logic, more specifically a flip-flop for an incremented process output. Upon each rising edge of the clock signal (posedge clk), the current value of 'inc_po_ns' is stored in the 'inc_po_r' after the period determined by defined 'TCQ' delay. This block is necessary for ensuring synchronicity of the system operation and to prevent possible issues arising from changes in the 'inc_po_ns' signal between clock cycles.
