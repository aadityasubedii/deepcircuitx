Comment: 
The block of code is for managing ADD_RRD counter in a non-zero condition. It declares two register arrays, add_rrd_ns and add_rrd_r. Each is the width of ADD_RRD_CNTR_WIDTH. The former is used for future states, while the latter is for present states of the register. The counter processing occurs when 'nADD_RRD' is greater than zero. The specific operation of these registers depends on the context of the wider codebase.
