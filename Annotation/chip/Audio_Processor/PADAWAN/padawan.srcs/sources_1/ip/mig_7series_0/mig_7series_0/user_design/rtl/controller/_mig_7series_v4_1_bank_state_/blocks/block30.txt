This block is a register assignment for demand_act_priority_r, triggered on every positive edge of the clock. The register demand_act_priority_r takes value after a delay of the constant TCQ from demand_act_priority_ns. This mechanism ensures synchronization with the clock and delay is introduced to model various circuit phenomena like wire delay or to synchronize across multiple clock domains.
