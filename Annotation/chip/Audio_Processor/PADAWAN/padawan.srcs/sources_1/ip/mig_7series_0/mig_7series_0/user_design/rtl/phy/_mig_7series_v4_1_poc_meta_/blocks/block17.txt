This block of code is performing a register update operation for the variable `center_diff_r`. On every positive edge of the clock (`clk`), it updates the value of the register `center_diff_r` from the non-blocking assignment of `center_diff_ns` with a delay specified by `#TCQ`. This delay ensures the timing constraint for the update. Hence, this block implements a latching mechanism with a specific delay for the `center_diff_r` register.
