    "block_comment": "The block of code calculates the base-2 logarithm of the input integer. To achieve this, the block first subtracts one from the size. Then, in a for loop, the block halving the size using bitwise shift until it becomes less than or equal to one, while incrementing the result clogb2, ultimately returning the count of shifts performed - effectively implementing a simple, hardware-efficient, base-2 logarithm calculation."
