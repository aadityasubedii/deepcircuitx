Comment: 
This block of code handles the ready condition for a write operation to a column. It uses a bitwise AND operator to combine the 'col_rdy' signal, which indicates the readiness of the column, and the negated 'rd_wr_r' signal, which signifies whether a read or write operation is underway. If 'col_rdy' is high (ready) and 'rd_wr_r' is low (indicating a write operation), 'col_rdy_wr' takes a high value, signaling that a write operation is ready to proceed.
