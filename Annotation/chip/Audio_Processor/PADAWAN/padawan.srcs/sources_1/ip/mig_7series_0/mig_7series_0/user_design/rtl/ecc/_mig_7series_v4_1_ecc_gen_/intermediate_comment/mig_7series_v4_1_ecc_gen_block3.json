    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to create an [ECC (Error Correction Code) Hamming matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code). It does this by assigning a vector of a predefined length (ECC_WIDTH) to the nth element of the 'ht_matrix' array. The vector is comprised of seven \"1\" values, followed by ECC_WIDTH-7 number of \"0\" values. This structure allows the system to correct any bit errors that may occur during data transmission or storage."
