    "block_comment": "The given Verilog code block is used for error detection related to data strobe (DQS) in a memory interface scenario. It works synchronized with a clock signal and gets cleared during a reset condition. If the data strobe is not found across all memory banks, it checks if the retry count matches a predefined calibration parameter and if the read byte data offset surpasses the sum of clock latency (nCL), additional latency (nAL), and latency factor minus one. If these conditions are fulfilled, it flags an error to signal a problem with DQS detection process."
