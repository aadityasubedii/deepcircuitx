The block is functioning as a logical OR operation. It assigns the output `pat_data_match_r` a boolean value based on the logical OR operation result between the two signals, `pat0_data_match_r` and `pat1_data_match_r`. This mean, if either `pat0_data_match_r` or `pat1_data_match_r` or both are true, the output `pat_data_match_r` will be true, otherwise it will be false.
