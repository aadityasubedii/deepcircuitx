    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a Verilog wire with a constant value. Specifically, `col_channel_offset` is assigned a fixed value of zero. By using the `assign` keyword, this code is continuously driving the `col_channel_offset` wire with a zero value in every clock cycle. This indicates that `col_channel_offset` does not change its value throughout the execution, serving as a constant in this context."
