This block of code creates a double request signal ("dbl_req") based on the input request signal ("req"). It operates in response to any change in "req". The implementation is done through concatenation ({req, req}) in Verilog, effectively doubling up the "req" signal's value. This means if "req" changes, the "dbl_req" signal will instantly reflect that change twice.
