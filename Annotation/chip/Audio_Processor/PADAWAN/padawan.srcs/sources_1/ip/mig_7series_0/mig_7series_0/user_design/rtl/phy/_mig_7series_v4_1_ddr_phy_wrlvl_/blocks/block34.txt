Comment: 
This block generates an 8-bit counter that resets either on the active-high reset signal or when a specific signal (`po_cnt_dec`) goes high. With every positive edge of the clock, if the reset condition is not active and signal `phy_ctl_ready_r6` is high and `wait_cnt` is greater than zero, `wait_cnt` will decrement by one. Otherwise, it will maintain the count at 8 if a reset condition is met.
