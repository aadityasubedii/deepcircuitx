    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for Control and Command Calibration sequences. The module detects whether the system has been reset or the count power (cnt_pwron_cke_done_r) and phy_ctl_ready conditions are met, but the control or command of the 'phy' is not full. If the system is reset, it clears the calibration control and command write enable flags and sets the calibration sequence to initial state. In the other scenario, if the conditions are satisfied and neither of the 'phy' parameters are full, it enables the calibration control and command write, and increments the calibration sequence. In all other conditions, the code retains the original state of the calibration flags and sequence."
