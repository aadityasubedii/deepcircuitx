    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code controls the offset of read byte data during memory access operations based on different conditions. At the rising edge of the clock signal, this block resets the 'rd_byte_data_offset' to a certain value (calculated from parameters 'nCL', 'nAL', and 'LATENCY_FACTOR') if a reset signal is asserted. Otherwise, if the memory rank operation is done and data queue (DQS) is not initialized yet or if the existing offset is less than a certain threshold, it again sets the offset to the above value. Lastly, if a DQS start signal has been asserted but DQS for all banks hasn't been found and certain other conditions are met (detecting a found DQS and a read count equalling 'd1', DQS initialization not done yet and fine adjustment is not requested), it decreases the offset by 1."
