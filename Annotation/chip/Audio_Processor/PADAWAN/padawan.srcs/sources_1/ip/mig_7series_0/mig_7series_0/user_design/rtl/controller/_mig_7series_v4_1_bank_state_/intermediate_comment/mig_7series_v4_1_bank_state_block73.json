    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for setting the `rd_half_rmw_lcl` flag. The flag is turned 'on' only when both `req_wr_r` and `rd_wr_r` are true. Here, the 'always' keyword means that this block of code will continuously monitor changes in `req_wr_r` and `rd_wr_r`, triggering a reevaluation of the `rd_half_rmw_lcl` flag when either of these inputs changes."
