    "block_comment": "This module handles the maintenance cycle works in progress bit (maint_ref_zq_wip_r) of a dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) control system. It resets (sets to '0') the maint_ref_zq_wip_r signal when a reset condition (rst) is triggered through a clock-edge-triggered synchronous design. Additionally, if a ZQ calibration (zq_request) or refresh request (refresh_request) received along with the first maintenance cycle (insert_maint_r1) the maint_ref_zq_wip_r is set to '1'. Finally, if there are no maintenance works in progress (maint_wip_r is '0'), it ensures that the maint_ref_zq_wip_r signal is also '0'."
