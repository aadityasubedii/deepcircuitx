    "block_comment": "This block of code sets the registers \"if_empty_reg\" and \"pi_stg2_en_reg\" based on the signals \"phy_if_empty\" and \"pi_en_stg2_f\" respectively. It does this at the rising edge of the clock. The setters have a delay defined by the constant \"TCQ\". In terms of implementation, this is done within an 'always' block that only triggers at the positive edge of the input clock, ensuring synchronous updating of the values.\n"
