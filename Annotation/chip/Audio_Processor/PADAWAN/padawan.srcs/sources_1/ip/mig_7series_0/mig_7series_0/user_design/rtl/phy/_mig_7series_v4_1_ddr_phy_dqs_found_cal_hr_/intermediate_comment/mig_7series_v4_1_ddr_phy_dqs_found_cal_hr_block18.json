    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily responsible for managing the initialization and offset adjustments of read byte data per rank in a memory system. If a reset condition is asserted, the read byte data offset values for all ranks are initialized sequentially to 'nCL + nAL - 2'. In the absence of a reset, the block conducts read data time offset checks and adjustments. If the rank initialization wasn't properly done or the read data time offset is greater than a threshold, then it resets the offset to 'nCL + nAL - 2'. Additionally, if a DQS signal is found and a certain condition is met, the read data time offset is incrementally adjusted. The output time offset is controlled using system clock edge-induced delays, 'TCQ', in each case."
