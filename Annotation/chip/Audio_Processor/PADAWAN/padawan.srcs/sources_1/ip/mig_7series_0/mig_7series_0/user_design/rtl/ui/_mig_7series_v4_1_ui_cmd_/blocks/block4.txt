This block of code implements a Verilog process that sequentially updates values of several variables. The process is triggered on the positive edge of the clock signal (clk). If the reset signal (rst) is active, the block resets the values of app_addr_r1 and app_addr_r2 to zero. If the reset is not active, the block updates app_addr_r1 and app_addr_r2 with the values of app_addr_ns1 and app_addr_ns2 respectively. Independently of the reset signal, other variables such as app_cmd_r1, app_cmd_r2, app_sz_r1, app_sz_r2, app_hi_pri_r1, app_hi_pri_r2, app_en_r1, and app_en_r2 are always updated with the next state values with some delay defined by the #TCQ parameter.
