    "block_comment": "This block of code is functioning as a register to hold the value of 'wr_this_rank_ns' at the rising edge of the clock signal (clk). Utilizing an always block, this Verilog code captures the value of 'wr_this_rank_ns' every time there is a positive edge of the clock, and after a delay denoted by #TCQ, it assigns it to 'wr_this_rank_r'. This is a common hardware design pattern used in designs operating on clock-based (synchronous) logic."
