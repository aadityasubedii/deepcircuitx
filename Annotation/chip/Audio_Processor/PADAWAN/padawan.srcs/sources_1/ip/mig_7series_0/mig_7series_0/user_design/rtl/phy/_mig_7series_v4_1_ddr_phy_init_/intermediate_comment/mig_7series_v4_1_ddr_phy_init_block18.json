    "block_comment": "The provided block describes a clock-driven sequential logic block. Its function is to control calib_cke and calib_odt signals based on several conditions. This block gets activated at the positive edge of the clock signal. During a reset condition, calib_cke gets set to a zero value dependent on clock cycles and calib_odt gets set to '00'. When not in reset, the calib_cke value is determined by the cnt_pwron_cke_done_r signal. Similarly, variation in calib_odt's values are based on conditions regarding DRAM type, and states of RTT_NOM, RTT_WR, init_state_r, etc. The change in states of these variables drives calib_odt to different states and values. This block essentially makes use of different conditions imposed by various control signals to perform different operations."
