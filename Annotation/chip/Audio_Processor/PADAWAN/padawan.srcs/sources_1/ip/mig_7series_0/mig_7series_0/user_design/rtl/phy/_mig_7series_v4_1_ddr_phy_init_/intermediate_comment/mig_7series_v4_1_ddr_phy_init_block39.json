    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block manages the write data processing for DDR3 type DRAM. It operates on every positive edge of the clock signal. The function of each segment is dictated by different conditionals. If 'oclkdelay_calib_done' is not set and it is DDR3 type, a specific data pattern is written into 'phy_wrdata'. For calibrating write operations, different data patterns are written to 'phy_wrdata' based on the pattern count, 'wrcal_pat_cnt'. More patterns are loaded during stage 1 read level adjustment when 'rdlvl_stg1_done' is unset. If neither pattern based continuous read leveling is completed nor the 'phy_data_full' is high, a pseudo-random binary sequence output 'prbs_o' is presented to 'phy_wrdata'. If the complex clock delay calibration is not done and 'phy_data_full' is low, the 'prbs_o' is again assigned to 'phy_wrdata'. The code uses '#TCQ' delay modeling to sync with the clock period."
