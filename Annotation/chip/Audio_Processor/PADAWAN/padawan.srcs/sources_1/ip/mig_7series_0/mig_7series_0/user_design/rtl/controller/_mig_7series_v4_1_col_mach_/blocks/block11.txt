This block of code defines a register that updates on the rising edge of a clock signal. The data is read from a FIFO (First In, First Out) structure and propagated after a delay defined by the constant TCQ. The use of `<=` ensures that the data update happens at the end of the simulation step, keeping the operation synchronous with the clock signal.
