    "block_comment": "This block manages the control signals for precharge requests in a memory operation. Triggered on positive edge of the clock, it initializes precharge request and pending signals to zero when a reset occurs. When the system isn't in reset, it updates the precharge request signal and captures the raising edge of the request. On this edge, it sets the precharge pending signal. When a precharge operation is complete, it clears the pending signal."
