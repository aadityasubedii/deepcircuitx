    "block_comment": "The block of code provides the conditional implementation of a pre-output FIFO (First In, First Out) in a DDR (Double Data Rate) memory system. If the USE_PRE_POST_FIFO flag is set to \"TRUE\", a pre-output FIFO instance mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_of_pre_fifo is generated using a phy_clk clock, ofifo_rst reset, phy_wr_en write enable, and phy_dout output data inputs. The output of the FIFO instance is assigned to of_(d9-d0) and control signals. If the flag is not set, the direct phy_dout output data is assigned to of_(d9-d0) and the phy_wr_en is assigned directly to of_wren_pre."
