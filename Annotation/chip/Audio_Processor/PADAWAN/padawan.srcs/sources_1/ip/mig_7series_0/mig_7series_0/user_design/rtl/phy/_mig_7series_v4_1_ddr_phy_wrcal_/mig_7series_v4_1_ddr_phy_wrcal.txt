Module-level comment: This module implements a write calibration procedure for DDR memory interfaces, supporting 2:1 and 4:1 clock ratios. It determines optimal write timing for each DQS group by generating known patterns, reading back data, and comparing it to expected values. The module uses a state machine to control the calibration process, including pattern generation, data capture, comparison, and delay adjustment. It handles early/late data detection, performs sanity checks, and includes error handling mechanisms to ensure reliable calibration results.
