Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for setting reset primitives and controlling the system's clock delay on the rising edge of the physical clock signal. It triggers on the positive edge of the `phy_clk` signal and sets the reset signal for a group of primitives (rst_primitives to D_rst_primitives) based on the 'not' value of `phy_ctl_ready`. It controls the bit shifting and assigns a value to the lag of `rclk_delay` that is a combination of the shifted value and logical AND ('&&') of inverse `rst_primitives` and `phyGo`. It also prepares the master control go-ahead `mcGo` by assigning the `rst_out` after one time unit delay.
