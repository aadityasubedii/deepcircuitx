    "block_comment": "The block of code generates a condition that checks if nRCD_CLKS is equal or less than 2. This part of Verilog RTL code, using the 'generate' keyword and the 'if' condition, dynamically instantiates either lesser or equal to 2 delay line stages for the Read Command to Data (RCD) timers, based on the value of nRCD_CLKS. This allows for flexible and optimal configurations depending on the defined delay counts."
