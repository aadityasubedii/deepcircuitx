Comment: 
This Verilog block focusses on data partition for further operations based on the clock pulse count. When the clock count is 4, the whole data, both read and comparison data, is divided into 8 parts assuming the data unit width as DQ_WIDTH. For every rise and fall of the clock cycle, each part is assigned to a different, respective variable, thus ensuring parallel assignment and usage in the upcoming steps. If the clock count isn't 4, the routine is skipped, indicating the potential presence of different handlers for other clock counts.
