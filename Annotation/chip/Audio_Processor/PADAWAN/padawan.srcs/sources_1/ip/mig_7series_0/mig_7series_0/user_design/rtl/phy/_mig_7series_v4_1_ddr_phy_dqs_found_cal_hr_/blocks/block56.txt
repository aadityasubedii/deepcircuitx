Comment: 
This block assigns specific values to the `pi_dqs_found_lanes_int` variable based on the value of `HIGHEST_LANE`. The condition for assignment depends on a set of comparisons with `HIGHEST_LANE`, and each condition provides a different value assignment to `pi_dqs_found_lanes_int`. For the conditions where `HIGHEST_LANE` is 4, 8, or 12, directly assign `pi_dqs_found_lanes_r3` to `pi_dqs_found_lanes_int`. If `HIGHEST_LANE` is 3, 7, or 11, a bit '0' is appended at the beginning. Similarly, for `HIGHEST_LANE` being 6 or 10, two zeros are appended and for 5 or 9, three zeros are appended to `pi_dqs_found_lanes_r3` before assignment.
