Comment: 
The block of code assigns the state of the registered signal `scanning_right_r` to the wire `scanning_right`. This implementation allows `scanning_left` to directly reflect the registered state of `scanning_right_r`, without any additional logic or manipulation on the signal. This could be an interface signal exposed for debugging or monitoring purposes or used for controlling the direction of a scan operation within the system.
