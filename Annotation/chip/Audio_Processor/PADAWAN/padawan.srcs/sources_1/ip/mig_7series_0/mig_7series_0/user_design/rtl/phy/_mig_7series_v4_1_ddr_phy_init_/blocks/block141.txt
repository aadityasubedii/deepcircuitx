Comment: 
This block of code manages state transitions in a memory controller initialization sequence. If the command counter has completed and the controller is not full, it transitions to the `INIT_WRCAL_READ` state. Otherwise, if a condition requires a retry, it transitions to the `INIT_RDLVL_STG2_READ_WAIT` state. Within the `INIT_WRCAL_READ` state, it further determines the next state based on the `burst_addr_r` signal. If `burst_addr_r` is `1'b1` (which can be connected with logic for finer control), it transitions to the `INIT_WRCAL_READ_WAIT` state.
