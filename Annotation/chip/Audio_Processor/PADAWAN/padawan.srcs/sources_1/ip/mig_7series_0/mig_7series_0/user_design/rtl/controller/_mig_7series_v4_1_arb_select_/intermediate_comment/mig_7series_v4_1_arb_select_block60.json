    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code manages data offset assignment based on various conditional parameters. The offset is computed according to whether the 'EVEN_CWL_2T_MODE' is turned ON or not, which in turn determines the set of conditions to assign 'mc_data_offset', 'mc_data_offset_1', and 'mc_data_offset_2'. If 'sent_col' is not '1', offset is set to '0'. If 'col_rd_wr_r' or 'col_rd_wr_ns' is '1' depending on the mode, offset calculation includes 'rank_rddata_offset' with respective elements and 'col_channel_offset'. However, if neither hold true, offset is calculated based on the number of clock per CLK 'nCK_PER_CLK'. If 'nCK_PER_CLK' equals '2', 'col_channel_offset' is subtracted from 'CWL', if not, then offset consideration includes addition of '2' with 'CWL' and 'col_channel_offset'."
