    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL block manages data calibration process cycles and selections in a memory system. The block functions by running a series of conditional checks at every clock positive edge. Recurrent parameters `byte_sel_cnt`, `ctl_lane_sel`, and `calib_in_common` are updated based on these checks. Resets and operational flags are treated differently - `byte_sel_cnt` and `ctl_lane_sel` are reset to zero often, and `calib_in_common` alternates between 0 and 1 to signal calibration status. Furthermore, various count parameters are used to update these values in absence of external control signals, showing this module can function autonomously as well."
