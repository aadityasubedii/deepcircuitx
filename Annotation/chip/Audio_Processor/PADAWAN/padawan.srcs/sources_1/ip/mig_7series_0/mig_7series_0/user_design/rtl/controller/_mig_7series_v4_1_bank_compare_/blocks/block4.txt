Comment: 
This line of code sets a constant value to the req_cas signal. It does this by using the Verilog 'assign' keyword, which means that req_cas is given the constant value of 1'b1, or simply '1', at every time instant. This action typically signifies that a request for a Read or Write (RW) operation is perpetually present, as inferred from the signal name 'req_cas' (Request Column Address Strobe) which is frequently used under memory applications. However, the details of what this '1' will activate or control would require a broader context of the Verilog RTL code (such as the connections and interactions of 'req_cas' with other modules or signals).
