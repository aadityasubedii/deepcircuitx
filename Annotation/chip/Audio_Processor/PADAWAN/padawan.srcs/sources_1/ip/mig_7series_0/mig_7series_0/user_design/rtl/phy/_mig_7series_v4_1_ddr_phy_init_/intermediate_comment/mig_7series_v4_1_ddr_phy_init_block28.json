    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code serves a conditional assignment function for the `phy_we_n` vector in a DDR memory initialization sequence. By responding to a rising edge clock signal, the block checks multiple initiation states and the `rdlvl_wr` and `new_burst_r` conditions. If any of these states is true, the `phy_we_n` vector will be assigned with values of 1'b1 for `phy_we_n[0]` and 1'b0 for `phy_we_n[1]`, creating dynamism in write-enable signaling during memory operation. Otherwise, `phy_we_n` would be assigned as 1'b1 for both indices, preparing the memory for other operations. The delay models with `#TCQ` indicate this logic operates within a specific clock quantum."
