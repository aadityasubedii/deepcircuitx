    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a counter `cnt_dllk_zqinit_r` which is used for tracking initialization status, specifically related to the 'ZQCL' state, of a memory subsystem during the `DLLK` phase. It resets the counter at the beginning of the 'ZQCL' state while disabling the `cnt_dllk_zqinit_done_r` signal. The counter increments every clock cycle as long as neither `phy_ctl_full` nor `phy_cmd_full` is active. Finally, the `cnt_dllk_zqinit_done_r` signal is set to active once the count equals `TDLLK_TZQINIT_DELAY_CNT`, indicating the initialization delay counter has finished counting."
