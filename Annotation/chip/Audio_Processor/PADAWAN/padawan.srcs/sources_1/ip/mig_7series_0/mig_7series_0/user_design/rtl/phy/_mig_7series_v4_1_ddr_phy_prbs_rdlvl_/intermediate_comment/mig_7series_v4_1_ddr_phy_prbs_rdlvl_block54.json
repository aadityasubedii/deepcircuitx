    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a process that updates 'rd_victim_sel' during every positive edge of the clock signal. If the reset signal 'rst' is high or 'num_samples_done_r' is true, 'rd_victim_sel' will be set to 0. Otherwise, when the count of the samples 'samples_cnt_r' equals a pre-defined number ,'NUM_SAMPLES_CNT', the 'rd_victim_sel' would increment by 1, as long as it's less than 7. The increment operation is applied with a delay of 'TCQ' time units."
