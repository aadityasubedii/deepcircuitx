    "block_comment": "The block performs a loop operation on a variable 'j' from '0' to less than 'HIGHEST_BANK'. The loop incrementally increases the value of 'j' at each iteration. It is implemented using a for-loop structure in Verilog. Within this loop, potentially multiple statements or even other loops or conditions could be inserted to perform operations on each bank, but these operations are not given in the code snippet."
