    "block_comment": "This block of code declares three one-bit registers: `rst_auxout`, `rst_auxout_r`, and `rst_auxout_rr`. The functionality of these registers is not specified by the provided block alone, but typically in a larger context, these registers may be used to process or store specific bit values during computations, with potential shift or delay operations represented by the suffixes '_r' and '_rr'. These suffixes may imply that the registers are used in a shift register or a delay line for synchronization, delaying the effect of reset, or pipelining to improve throughput."
