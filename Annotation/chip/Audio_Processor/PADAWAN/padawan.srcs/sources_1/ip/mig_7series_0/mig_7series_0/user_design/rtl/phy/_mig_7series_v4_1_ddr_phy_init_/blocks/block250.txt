The block of code is a trigger-based debug message printout mechanism in a Verilog test environment. Upon the positive edge of the 'wrlvl_done' signal, it checks if the system isn't in 'rst' (reset) state and the 'WRLVL' (Write Leveling) feature is enabled. If these conditions are satisfied, it prints out a debug message indicating that the Write Leveling process has successfully completed at the current simulation time.
