Comment: 
This code block operates as a wire assignment in the Verilog hardware description language, specifically assigning the value of `samps_hi_r` to the wire `samps_hi`. In terms of its implementation, it uses the `assign` keyword, which sets up a continuous assignment in Verilog. Continuous assignments are used to drive a wire's value either in procedural code blocks or outside any procedures. Simply put, it copies the value of `samps_hi_r` to `samps_hi` whenever `samps_hi_r` changes its value.
