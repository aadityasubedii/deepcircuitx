This is a clocked register block that stores the next state of a signal called `auto_pre_ns` into `auto_pre_r_lcl` on every positive clock edge. Utilizing a non-blocking sequential element, it uses a delay modelled by `#TCQ` to simulate propagation delays, thereby ensuring accurate modeling of the circuit's behavior.
