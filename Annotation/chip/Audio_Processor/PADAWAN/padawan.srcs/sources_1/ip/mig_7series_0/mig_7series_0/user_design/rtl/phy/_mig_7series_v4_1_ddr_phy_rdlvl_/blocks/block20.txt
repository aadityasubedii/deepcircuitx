This block of code serves as an edge counter in a synchronous system. Every time the clock (clk) signal transitions from low to high (rising edge), the code within the 'always' block is executed. If the reset (rst) signal is high, the sample edge count is reset to 0. If the reset signal is not active and the samp_edge_cnt0_en_r signal is false, the sample edge count is also reset to 0. Otherwise, if the samp_edge_cnt1_en_r signal is true, the sample edge count is incremented by one. All time delays are parameterized with #TCQ signifying time-clock-quarter period.
