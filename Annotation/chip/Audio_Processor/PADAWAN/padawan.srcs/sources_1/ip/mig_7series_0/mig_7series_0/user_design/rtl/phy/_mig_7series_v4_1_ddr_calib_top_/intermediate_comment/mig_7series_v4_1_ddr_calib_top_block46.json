    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for assigning the values of rd_data_offset_ranks_mc_0, rd_data_offset_ranks_mc_1, and rd_data_offset_ranks_mc_2 to the corresponding calib_rd_data_offset variables. This is part of a calibration process in a memory controller, where the read data offset values for various ranks are copied to variables indicating the calibrated offsets. This is accomplished using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog which allows direct assignment from one variable to another."
