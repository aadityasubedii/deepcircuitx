Comment: 
This block is responsible for setting the current MMCM value based on the reset and stage 3 decode signals and the comparison between tap counter and decode/increment values. On every positive edge of the clock cycle, if reset is active, the block sets 'mmcm_current' to 0. In the case where 'stg3_dec_r' is high, the block checks if 'stg3_tap_cnt' is equal to 'stg3_dec_val', assigning 'mmcm_current' correspondingly. If 'stg3_dec_r' is not high, it makes a similar comparison with 'stg3_inc_val'. This logic is synthesized using conditional statements, allowing the block to react dynamically to changes in system state.
