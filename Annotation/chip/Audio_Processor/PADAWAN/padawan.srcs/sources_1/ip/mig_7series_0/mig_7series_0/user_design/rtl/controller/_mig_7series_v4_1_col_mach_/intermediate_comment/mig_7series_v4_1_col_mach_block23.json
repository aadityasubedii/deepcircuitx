The function employs a bitwise shift operation to progressively halve the input `size` until it becomes 1 or less. The count of halving operations necessary to reach this state, plus one, gives the ceiling value of log base 2. This is an efficient method to calculate this mathematical operation using the properties of binary numbers."
