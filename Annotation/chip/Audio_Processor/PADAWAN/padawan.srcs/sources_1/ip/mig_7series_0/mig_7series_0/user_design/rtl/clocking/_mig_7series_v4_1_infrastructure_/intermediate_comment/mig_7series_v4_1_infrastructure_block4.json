    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog is performing signal assignment. The `assign` keyword is used to connect the `rstdiv2_sync_r1` signal to `rst_div2`. The value stored in `rstdiv2_sync_r1` would be assigned to `rst_div2` at every evaluation. The primary function of this block is for signal reassignment or routing purposes inside the RTL design."
