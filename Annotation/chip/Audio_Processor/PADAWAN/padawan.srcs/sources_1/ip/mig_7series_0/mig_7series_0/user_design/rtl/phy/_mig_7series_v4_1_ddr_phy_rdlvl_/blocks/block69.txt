This block of code handles the updating of signal register values. It does so by triggering on the rising edge of the clock signal, then checking if the multiplexer read is valid. If valid, it updates four different signal registers: sr_rise0_r, sr_fall0_r, sr_rise1_r, and sr_fall1_r, pulling the new values from corresponding multiplexer read outputs, with a delay defined by TCQ (Time Clock to Q). The registers updated are linked to the current read index (rd_i).
