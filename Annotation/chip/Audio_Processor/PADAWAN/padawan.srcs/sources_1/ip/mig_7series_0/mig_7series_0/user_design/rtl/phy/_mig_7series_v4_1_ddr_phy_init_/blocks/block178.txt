Comment: 
This block of code develops a synchronous reset logic serving as a calibration completion detector for the complex mask limit. This function is accomplished by using a clock-driven `always` block that reacts to the rising edge of `clk`. If the reset `rst` signal or the `prbs_rdlvl_done_r3` flag is set, it sets the `complex_mask_lim_done` flag to 0, effectively indicating that the calibration is not yet completed. On the other hand, if calibration is started (`complex_oclkdelay_calib_start_int` is true) and `prbs_rdlvl_done` is not true, it sets `complex_mask_lim_done` to 1, signaling the completion of the calibration.
