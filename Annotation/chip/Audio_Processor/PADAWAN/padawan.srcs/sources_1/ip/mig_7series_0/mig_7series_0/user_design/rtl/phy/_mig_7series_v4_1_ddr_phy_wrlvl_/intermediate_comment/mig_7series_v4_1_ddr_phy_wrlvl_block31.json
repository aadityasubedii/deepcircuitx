    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code resets or sets the 'po_dec_done' flag depending on a few conditions. It is implemented using a sequential logic block that triggers at the positive edge of the clock. If a reset command is detected, 'po_dec_done' is asynchronously reset. On the other hand, 'po_dec_done' is set to high under two conditions: either when both 'po_cnt_dec' and 'po_rdval_cnt' are high, or when 'phy_ctl_ready_r6' is high while 'po_rdval_cnt' is low. The propagation delay defined by TCQ is followed for the assignment of 'po_dec_done'."
