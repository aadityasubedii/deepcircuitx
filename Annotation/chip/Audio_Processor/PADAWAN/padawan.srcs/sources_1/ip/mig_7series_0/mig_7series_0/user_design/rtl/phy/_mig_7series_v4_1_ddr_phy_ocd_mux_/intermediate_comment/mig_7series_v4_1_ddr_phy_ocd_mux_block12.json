    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block is used for signal assignment. Specifically, it assigns the value of 'po_en_stg23_r' to 'po_en_stg23'. This operation is likely a part of a digital logic design where the state or output of one part of the circuit/system (represented by 'po_en_stg23_r') is used to control, manipulate or indicate the state of another part of the circuit/system ('po_en_stg23'). The 'assign' keyword is used in continuous assignment statements which create continuous assignments for vector and scalar nets."
