    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a clocked process that dictates the behavior of the signal 'complex_ocal_odt_ext' based on the state of the system and the clock. When the reset signal 'rst' is high, the signal 'complex_ocal_odt_ext' is assigned a low value with a delay specified by 'TCQ'. If the system is in either 'INIT_PRECHARGE_PREWAIT' state and 'cnt_cmd_done_m7_r' is true, or in the 'INIT_OCLKDELAY_READ_WAIT' state, 'complex_ocal_odt_ext' is again assigned a low value with a delay. However, if the system state is either 'INIT_OCAL_CENTER_WRITE' or 'INIT_OCAL_CENTER_WRITE_WAIT', 'complex_ocal_odt_ext' is set to a high value, again after a delay specified by 'TCQ'. This code segment essentially controls the signal 'complex_ocal_odt_ext' based on certain conditions."
