This block of code implements a state machine for controlling the timing of phase interpolator signals. The state machine is synchronized with the positive edge of the clock. There are several conditions determining the behavior, based on signals: reset (rst), pi_cnt_dec, and cal1_dlyce_cpt_r. Each of these conditions respectively sets the signals pi_en_stg2_f_timing and pi_stg2_f_incdec_timing to certain values, with a specific delay denoted by #TCQ. SIM_CAL_OPTION switch defines two modes of operations: "NONE" or "FAST_WIN_DETECT" and "FAST_CAL". Both modes have same results on pi_en_stg2_f_timing and pi_stg2_f_incdec_timing.
