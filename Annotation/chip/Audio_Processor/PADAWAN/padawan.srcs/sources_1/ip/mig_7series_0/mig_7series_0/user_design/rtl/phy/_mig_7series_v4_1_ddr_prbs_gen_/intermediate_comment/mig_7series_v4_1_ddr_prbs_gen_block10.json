    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for controlling memory outputs based on provided read addresses and specific condition flags. Numerous conditions are checked synchronously on a positive edge of clock: if read address is less than 42 and VCCO_PAT_EN is set, memory output is provided, if it is below 127 and VCCAUX_PAT_EN is set, memory output is given, and if read address is greater than 126 and ISI_PAT_EN flag is set, the memory output is again provided. Otherwise, the output is forced to zero delay state. Memory output is always delayed by #TCQ and it's the lower 32 bit section of the memory that is accessed in each condition."
