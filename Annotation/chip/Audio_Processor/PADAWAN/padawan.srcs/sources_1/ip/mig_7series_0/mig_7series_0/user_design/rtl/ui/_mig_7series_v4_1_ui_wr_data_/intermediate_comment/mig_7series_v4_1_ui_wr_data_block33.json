    "block_comment": "The block of code is a synchronous process that updates the status of four wires (app_wdf_rdy_r_copy1-4) on the rising edge of a clock signal. The update reflects the next state of the wdf_rdy_ns signal after a delay of TCQ time units. Specifically, it leverages a posedge clock edge triggering and non-blocking assignment to update the states accurately and in a synchronized way, ensuring reliable digital timing for this component."
