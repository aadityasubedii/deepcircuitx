This block of code is responsible for managing complex write operations in different states under various circumstances. The functionality is implemented using conditional statements in a Verilog always block. If the system is in an idle initial state, or in the middle of a read operation, or calibration has completed, it sets the complex write operation as not done. Otherwise, if the system is waiting to act after a complex read level operation, and the complex wait countdown equals 13, it sets the complex write operation as done. The same condition applies when the system is waiting to act after a complex offset calibration. The write operation's done status is represented by the boolean `complex_wr_done`.
