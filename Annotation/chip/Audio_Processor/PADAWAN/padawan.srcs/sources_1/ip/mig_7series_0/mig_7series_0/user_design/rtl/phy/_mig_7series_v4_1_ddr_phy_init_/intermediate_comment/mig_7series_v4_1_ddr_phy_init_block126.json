    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is developing a conditional hardware structure during compile time by using the generate-construct. Its purpose is to conditionally instantiate a single rank if the value of RANKS is less than 2. The way it has been implemented is by using the generate-construct and an if-statement within it. In practice, this essentially means that the hardware within the body of this block (not shown in your snippet) is only instantiated if the condition (RANKS < 2) is true."
