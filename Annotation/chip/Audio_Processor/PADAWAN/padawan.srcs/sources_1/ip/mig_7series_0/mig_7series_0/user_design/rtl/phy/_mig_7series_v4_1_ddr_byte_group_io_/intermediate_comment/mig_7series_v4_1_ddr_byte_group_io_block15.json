    "block_comment": "This code block assigns the value of the `iserdes_clk` signal to the `iserdes_clk_d` signal in a combinational always block. This operation essentially duplicates the incoming clock signal (`iserdes_clk`) to another variable (`iserdes_clk_d`), which can then be used separately in the design. The `always @(*)` construct is used to indicate that this operation should be performed whenever there are changes in the inputs. This provides a simple way to distribute the same clock signal to different parts of the design."
