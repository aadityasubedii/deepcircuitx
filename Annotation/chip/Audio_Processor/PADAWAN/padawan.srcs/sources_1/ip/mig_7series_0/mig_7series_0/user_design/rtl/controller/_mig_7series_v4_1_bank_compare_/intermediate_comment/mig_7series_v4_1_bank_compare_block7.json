    "block_comment": "This block of code primarily processes column address data. It initializes 'col_addr_template' with 'req_col_r' values, and then modifies certain bits based on other control signals. Bit 10 of 'col_addr_template' is set to the logical AND of 'auto_pre_r' and the inverted 'rd_half_rmw'. Bit 11 is a copy of Bit 10 from 'req_col_r', bit 12 is set to the value of 'req_size_r_lcl', and bit 13 is a copy of Bit 11 from 'req_col_r'. This manipulation is crucial to generating the desired bit pattern for 'col_addr_template'."
