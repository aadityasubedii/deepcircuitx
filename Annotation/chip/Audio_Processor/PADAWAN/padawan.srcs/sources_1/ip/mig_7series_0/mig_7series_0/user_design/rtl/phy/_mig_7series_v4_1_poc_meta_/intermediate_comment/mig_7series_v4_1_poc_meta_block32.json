    "block_comment": "This block determines and holds the polarity of a running process based on the end status. It utilizes a ternary operator that checks the status of \"run_end\". If \"run_end\" is true, it assigns the value of \"run_polarity\" to \"run_polarity_held_ns\". Otherwise, it holds the current state by assigning the value of \"run_polarity_held_r\" to \"run_polarity_held_ns\"."
