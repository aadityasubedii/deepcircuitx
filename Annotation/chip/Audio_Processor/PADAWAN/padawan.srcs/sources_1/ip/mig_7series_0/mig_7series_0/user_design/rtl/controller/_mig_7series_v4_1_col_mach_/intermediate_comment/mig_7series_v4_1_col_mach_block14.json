    "block_comment": "This block of code is functioning as a register for the variable 'tail_ns'. The implementation utilizes a non-blocking operation (indicated by '<=') to assign a new value to 'tail_r' from 'tail_ns' at every rising edge of the clock cycle (indicated by 'posedge clk'). This operation implies that the update of 'tail_r' will not occur immediately when the assignment is made, but rather, will be updated at the end of the current simulation time unit. The delay '#TCQ' is employed to model the flip-flop delay, in which TCQ refers to the clock-to-q delay."
