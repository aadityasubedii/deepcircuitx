Comment: 
The block is responsible for managing the assignment of new state variables that depend on the `calib_sel` selector and `calib_in_common` flag. The behavior is governed by a clock-triggered case structure. The `calib_sel` selector determines specific input groups (`A`, `B`, `C`, or `D`) to be processed. If `calib_in_common` flag is set, a common `pi_dqs_found` state is used across all groups, otherwise individual `pi_dqs_found` state from each group is used. The default case maintains the last value of `po_coarse_overflow`.
