    "block_comment": "The block of code controls the active demand signal (act_demanded) in response to a change in demand active priority input (demand_act_priority_in) specifically for the 'BM_SHARED_BV' bit-vector. It employs a bitwise OR operation across all bits of 'demand_act_priority_in' for 'BM_SHARED_BV' and assigns the result to 'act_demanded'. This mechanism ensures that if any bit within 'BM_SHARED_BV' of 'demand_act_priority_in' has a high signal, 'act_demanded' will be high, thus implementing a priority-based demand-activation scheme."
