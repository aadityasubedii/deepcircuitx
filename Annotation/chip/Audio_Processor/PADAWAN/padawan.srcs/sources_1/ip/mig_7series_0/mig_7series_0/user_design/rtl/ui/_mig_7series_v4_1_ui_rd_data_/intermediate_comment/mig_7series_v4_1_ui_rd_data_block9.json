    "block_comment": "The block of code is a positive edge-triggered flip-flop. This flip-flop is sensitive to the rising edge, or positive transition, of the clock input signal. When a positive transition occurs for 'clk', the logical state of signal 'app_rd_data_valid_ns' is captured and held in 'app_rd_data_valid_copy' after a certain small delay dictated by the parameterized time constant '#TCQ'."
