    "block_comment": "The block of code is primarily for generating a tick signal for ZQ calibration based on a prescaler tick signal and a maintained timer value. This is achieved by an 'always' block which is sensitive to changes in either the maintenance prescaler tick signal (maint_prescaler_tick_r_lcl) or the ZQ timer value (zq_timer_r). The tick signal for ZQ calibration (zq_tick) is activated when the ZQ timer value matches a constant value (ONE) and the maintenance prescaler tick signal occurs. The functionality relies on effective binary matching and time-based event triggering in synchronised systems."
