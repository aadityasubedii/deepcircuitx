Comment: 
This block of Verilog code depicts a D flip-flop that captures and delays the `req_row_ns` signal by one clock cycle. The captured value is stored in `req_row_r_lcl` variable. Specifically, at every positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`), the current value of the `req_row_ns` signal is sampled and then assigned (`<=`) to `req_row_r_lcl` after a delay defined by the `#TCQ` (Time Constraint Quantification). This construct is commonly used for synchronization and pipelining purposes in digital circuits.
