Comment: 
This line of Verilog code assigns the value of 'app_wdf_rdy_r' to 'app_wdf_rdy'. Here, the 'assign' keyword is used for continuous assignment which means that 'app_wdf_rdy' will always equal to 'app_wdf_rdy_r'. Therefore, whenever there's a change in the value of 'app_wdf_rdy_r', 'app_wdf_rdy' will also change instantaneously.
