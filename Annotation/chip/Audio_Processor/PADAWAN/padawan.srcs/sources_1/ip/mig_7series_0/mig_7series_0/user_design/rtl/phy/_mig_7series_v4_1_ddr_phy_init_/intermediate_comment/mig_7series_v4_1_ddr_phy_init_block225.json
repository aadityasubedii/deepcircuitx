    "block_comment": "The block definitively sets certain bit values for a load_mr2 register, depending on if the DRAM type is DDR3 or not. If DRAM type is DDR3, it sets specific bit ranges of load_mr2 according to some predefined logic, based on the value of nCWL. On the other hand, if DRAM type isn't DDR3, it simply sets all bits of load_mr2 to 0. The 'generate' construct ensures the relevant logic is synthesized at compile time, based on the parameter DRAM_TYPE."
