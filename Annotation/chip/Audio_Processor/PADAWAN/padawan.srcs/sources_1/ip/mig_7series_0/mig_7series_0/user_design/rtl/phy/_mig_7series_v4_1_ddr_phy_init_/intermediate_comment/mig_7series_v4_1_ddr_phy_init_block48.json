    "block_comment": "This block acts as a conditional clock divider for data read and write leveling process, particularly when the ratio of clock period to number of clocks per clock is greater than 2500 and the number of clocks per clock equals 2. It uses the 'generate' and 'if' constructs of Verilog to set up these specific conditions, thereby controlling the activation of the wrdq_div2_2to1_rdlvl_first process. If these conditions are met, the effective clock speed is halved, thereby facilitating the read and write leveling process."
