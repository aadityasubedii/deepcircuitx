    "block_comment": "The provided code block functions to synchronize and match specific patterns in a rising and falling edge detection system. Upon every positive edge of the clock, the block cross-references four synchronous registers ('sr_rise0/1_r', 'sr_fall0/1_r') with the idle patterns ('idel_pat1_rise0/1' and 'idel_pat1_fall0/1'). If a match occurs, the respective 'idel_pat1_match_rise/fall' registers are set to 1 after a time delay specified by the constant TCQ. If no match is found, the registers are reset back to 0 after the same delay. This pattern matching ensures clock edge events correlate with desired idle patterns."
