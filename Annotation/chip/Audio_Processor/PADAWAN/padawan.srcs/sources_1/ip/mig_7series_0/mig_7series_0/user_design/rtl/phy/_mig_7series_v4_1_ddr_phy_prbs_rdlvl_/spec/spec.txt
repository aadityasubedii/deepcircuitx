Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_prbs_rdlvl. Module specification: This module implements a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) read leveling mechanism for DDR memory interfaces. It performs timing calibration by adjusting delay taps to find optimal sampling points for read data. The module uses a complex state machine to control the calibration process, which includes steps like pattern comparison, DQS (Data Strobe) increment/decrement, and tap calculation. Key inputs include clk (system clock), rst (reset), prbs_rdlvl_start (start signal), rd_data (read data from memory), and compare_data (data for comparison). Important outputs are prbs_rdlvl_done (completion signal), pi_en_stg2_f and pi_stg2_f_incdec (Phase
