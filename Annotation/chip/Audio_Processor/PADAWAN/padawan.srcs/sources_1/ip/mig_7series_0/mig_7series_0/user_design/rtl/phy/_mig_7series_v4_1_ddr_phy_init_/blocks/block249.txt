This block of code is designed to monitor and display a status message upon the completion of the Read Leveling Stage 1 process in the PHY Initialization phase. The logic behind its operation lies in the 'always' block which gets triggered at the positive edge of the 'rdlvl_stg1_done' signal, indicating the completion of the first stage of Read Leveling. When the system is not in reset state, as indicated by the 'if' condition checking the 'rst' variable, a system status message is displayed, reporting that the Read Leveling Stage 1 process was completed at a specific timestamp provided by the '$time' system function.
