Comment: 
This Verilog code block handles read-write requests within a certain rank of a memory subsystem. The 'always' block is triggered when a read-write ('rd_wr_r') or a request rank ('req_rank_r') signal changes. Initially, 'wr_this_rank_ns' and 'rd_this_rank_ns' arrays are reset for all ranks. Proceeding within a loop, these arrays' specific index, matching with the current request rank ('req_rank_r'), is set based on the type of request (read or write indicated by 'rd_wr_r'). If 'rd_wr_r' is high, a read-request is identified for the corresponding rank, else a write-request.
