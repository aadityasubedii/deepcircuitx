    "block_comment": "This block of code is a multicycle reset control logic section, applied to `no_rst_tg_mc`, synchronously driven by the positive edge of `clk`. The block primarily acts as a Guarded signal assignment mechanism; upon a high `rst` signal, `no_rst_tg_mc` resets immediately, ensuring the system goes into a predetermined safe-state. However, if the `init_state_r == INIT_WRCAL_ACT` and `wrcal_read_req` conditions are both met, `no_rst_tg_mc` is set to \"1\", linking the reset signal to other parts of the system's operation. In all other situations, the `no_rst_tg_mc` retains its reset state, a valuable guard to prevent undesirable system behavior."
