    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is used as part of pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) generator control logic. The block starts by asynchronously resetting the 'prbs_tap_en_r' and 'prbs_tap_inc_r' flags and checks if it is in the 'cnt_wait_state'. If the decremental PRBS tap count 'prbs_dec_tap_cnt' is above zero, the state of the PRBS generator is updated to the 'PRBS_DEC_DQS' state. If the count is at zero, the block signals the completion of the incremental and decremental operations in the complex PI by setting 'complex_pi_incdec_done' to logic high and then transitions the PRBS generator state to 'PRBS_PAT_COMPARE' state."
