Comment: 
The block handles the generation of phased incremental and decremental (INCDEC) dividers when the PI_DIV2_INCDEC is set to TRUE. It creates two asynchronous registers named "pi_rst_div2r1" and "pi_rst_div2r2". These registers are used to reset or initialize hardware components associated with the phased INCDEC dividers. The 'generate' keyword indicates that the enclosed code should be dynamically instantiated depending on the conditional statement. As a note, the attributes enclosed in (* *) are vendor-specific commands that, in this case, force the synthesis tool to treat these registers as asynchronous.
