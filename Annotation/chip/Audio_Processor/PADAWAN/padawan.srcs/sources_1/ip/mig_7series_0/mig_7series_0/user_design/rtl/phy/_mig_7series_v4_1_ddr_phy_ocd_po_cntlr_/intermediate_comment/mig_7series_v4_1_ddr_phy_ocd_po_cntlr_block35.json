    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block is responsible for the right shift operation on `simp_stg3_final_r`. As a part of achieving this function, it uses `oclkdelay_calib_cnt` as the shift count. `simp_stg3_final_r` is a multi-bit wire of width equal to six times `DQS_WIDTH`. The result of the shift operation is stored in `simp_stg3_final_shft`, another multi-bit wire whose width is the same as `simp_stg3_final_r`. The shift operation is used for alignment or adjustment purposes based on the calibration count variable."
