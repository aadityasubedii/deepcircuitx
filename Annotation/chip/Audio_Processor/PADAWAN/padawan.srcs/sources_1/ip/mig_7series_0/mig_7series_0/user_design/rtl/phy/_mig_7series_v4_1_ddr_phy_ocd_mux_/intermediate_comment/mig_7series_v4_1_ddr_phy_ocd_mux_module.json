    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_ocd_mux' module controls the output clock delay in a DDR interface, managing the status of stage2 and stage3. It uses internal signals like 'clogb2', 'PO_WAIT', and 'wl_po_fine_shifted' for computing log2, setting wait state and counting selection respectively. The module takes in several inputs including control signals and clock signals, and provides outputs for KTAP, edge detection readiness, and various stages of operation. Implementation is accomplished through a combination of 'assign', 'always' and 'input/output' blocks providing efficient hardware design."
