Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is designed to handle signal delay decoding. The operation of this block is synchronous with the system clock and can also be reset by either a system reset signal or the negation of a command delay start signal. On reset, the delay decode done signal is set to 0. Alternatively, if either the TAP counter or TAP decoder is at 0, or if the delay decode counter, delay counter, and control lane counter have reached specific values, the delay decode done signal is set to 1.
