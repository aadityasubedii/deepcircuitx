Comment: 
This block handles the generation of an inhibit signal based on a request rank and the initiation of a read command. It primarily uses an always block that updates at every change in req_rank_r, req_rank_r_in, or start_rcd_in. Inside, it resets the inhibit signal to low then enters a for loop. In the loop, it gets a temporary inhibit signal by logically OR'ing the current inhibit signal with the read command initiation state of indexed machines in a range from current ID plus one to the total number of Bank machines. It thereby inhibits a subsequent Act signal if any higher ranked bank machine initiates a Read command.
