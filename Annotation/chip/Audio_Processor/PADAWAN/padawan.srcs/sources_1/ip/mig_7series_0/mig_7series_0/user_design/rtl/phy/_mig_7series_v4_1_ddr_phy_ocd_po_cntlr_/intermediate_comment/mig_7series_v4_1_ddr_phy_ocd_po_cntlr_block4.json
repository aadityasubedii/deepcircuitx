    "block_comment": "This block is a sequential logic circuit updating the state memory. The flip-flop(s) in the state machine are only updated to a new state during a positive edge of the clock cycle (posedge clk), where 'sm_r' represents state memory and 'sm_ns' represents the next state, with propagation delay equal to the time constant '#TCQ'. Therefore, it waits for the next clock tick to transfer the future state 'sm_ns' into the current state 'sm_r', ensuring state machine transitions only on the positive edge of the clock."
