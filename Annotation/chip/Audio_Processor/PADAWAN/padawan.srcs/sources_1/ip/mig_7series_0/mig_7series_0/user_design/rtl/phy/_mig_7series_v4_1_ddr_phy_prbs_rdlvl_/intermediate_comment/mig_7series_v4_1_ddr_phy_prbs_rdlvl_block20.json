    "block_comment": "The code block generates a for loop that iterates over the width of a Dynamically Random Access Memory (DRAM). It sequentially accesses each bit of the memory width, starting from the least significant bit (0) to the most significant bit (DRAM_WIDTH-1). The 'genvar' keyword declares 'eg' as a generate loop variable that gets incremented by one in every loop iteration until it reaches the DRAM_WIDTH."
