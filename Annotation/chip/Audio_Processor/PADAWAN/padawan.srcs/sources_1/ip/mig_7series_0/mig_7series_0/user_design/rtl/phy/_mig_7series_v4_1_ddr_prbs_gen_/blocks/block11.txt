Comment: 
This block of code describes a synchronous operation, primarily handling read address (`rd_addr`) updates. At every positive edge of the clock (`clk_i`), the system checks a set of conditions and updates the `rd_addr` accordingly. If there's a reset signal (`rst_i`) or `reset_rd_addr` is true, the `rd_addr` is reset to zero. Otherwise, under enabled CLK (`clk_en_i`), the `rd_addr` is incremented by one. Conditions like `prbs_rdlvl_done`, `phy_if_empty_r`, `complex_wr_done`, and `prbs_rdlvl_start` influence the incrementing operation. Depending on the specific condition, the read address counter wraps back to zero when it reaches either 156 or 148.
