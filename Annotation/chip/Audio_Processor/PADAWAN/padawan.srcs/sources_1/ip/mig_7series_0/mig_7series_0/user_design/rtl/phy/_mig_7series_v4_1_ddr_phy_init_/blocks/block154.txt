This block of code manages the initiation and refresh states for a memory component in a clock-based hardware system. When the system is in its initial idle state, it resets the initiation and refresh counters. If the system enters refresh mode and the memory initiation process is still ongoing, it increments the initiation counter and checks if it has reached its maximum value, upon which it sets the initiation counter completion flag. The clock signal `clk` controls these state transitions synchronously. The use of non-blocking assignments ensures that these state changes occur simultaneously at the end of each time step.
