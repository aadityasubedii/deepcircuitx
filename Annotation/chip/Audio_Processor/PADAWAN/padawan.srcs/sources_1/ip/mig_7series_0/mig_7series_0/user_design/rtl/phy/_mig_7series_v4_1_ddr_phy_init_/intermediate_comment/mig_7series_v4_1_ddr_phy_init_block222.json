    "block_comment": "This block activates the start of clock delay calibration. It does so by assigning the value of the operation `(init_state_r == INIT_OCAL_CENTER_ACT)` to the variable `oclkdelay_calib_start_pre`. The calibration starts only when `init_state_r` equals to `INIT_OCAL_CENTER_ACT`, indicating the system is in the operation calibration center active state.\n"
