    "block_comment": "This block is a sequential logic for updating the `samp_cnt_done_r` signal. On reset(bring up the circuit to its normal state), the `samp_cnt_done_r` signal is turned off. During normal operation, if sampling edge counter, `samp_edge_cnt0_en_r`, is off, the `samp_cnt_done_r` signal remains off. In Fast Calibration or Fast Window Detection mode, when the sample edge count, `samp_edge_cnt0_r`, is equal to `SR_VALID_DELAY` subtracted by one, it sets `samp_cnt_done_r` signal to high, indicating that sampling is done. For other cases, the `samp_cnt_done_r` signal is set to high when `samp_edge_cnt1_r` equals `DETECT_EDGE_SAMPLE_CNT1` and sampling counter 1 is enabled."
