Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_bank_mach. Module specification: This module serves as the main control unit for managing memory operations in a memory interface generator (MIG) for 7 Series FPGAs. It handles various memory operations including read, write, and refresh, based on input parameters that define memory characteristics such as bank width, clock behavior, and column/row sizes. The module features numerous input ports for control signals, memory addresses, and configuration data, and output ports for memory control signals and status information. Key inputs include clock, reset, command, address, and configuration signals, while outputs comprise memory control signals, data buffer addresses, and status flags. Internally, the module utilizes a variety of signals for state management, timing control, and coordination between different bank machines. The design is structured around two main sub-modules: mig_7series_v4_1_bank_cntrl, which
