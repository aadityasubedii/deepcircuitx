This block of Verilog code performs pattern matching and data matching operations with a delay of TCQ. Specifically, on each rising edge of the clock, this code block checks if certain conditions 'pat1_match_rise0_r', 'pat1_match_fall0_r', 'pat1_match_rise1_r', and 'pat1_match_fall1_r' are met by ANDing each with a delay of #TCQ. These intermediate signals are then used to compute 'pat1_data_match_r', which is high if all conditions were true with the same delay. The delay denotes the transfer characteristics and corresponding setup time required for the match signal to get stable. Therefore, this block helps with synchronicity at higher clock rates.
