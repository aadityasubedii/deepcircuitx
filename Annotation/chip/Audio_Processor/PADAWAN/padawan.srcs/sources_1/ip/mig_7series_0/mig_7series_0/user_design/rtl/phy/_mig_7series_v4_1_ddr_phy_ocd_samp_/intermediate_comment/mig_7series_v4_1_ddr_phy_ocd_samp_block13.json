    "block_comment": "This line defines a sequential circuit whose output, `zero_r`, is updated to the value of `zero_ns` at every positive edge of the clock signal `clk`. The delay time `#TCQ` specifies the time taken by the output signal `zero_r` to reflect the change in its driving logic, simulating the race condition between the positive edge of the clock and the input signal `zero_ns`. The `<=` non-blocking assignment ensures that all assignments within the same time step will be evaluated before updating the outputs, which is crucial for accurate simulation of real hardware behavior in synchronous designs.\n"
