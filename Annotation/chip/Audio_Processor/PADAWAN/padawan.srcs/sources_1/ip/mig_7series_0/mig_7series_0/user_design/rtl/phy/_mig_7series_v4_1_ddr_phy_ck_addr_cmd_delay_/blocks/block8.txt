Comment: 
This block of Verilog code defines a synchronous reset logic for incrementing a post output count 'po_cnt_inc'. This is done on the positive edge of a clock 'clk'. The count increment is set to 0 by default-- it only increments (set to 1) when 'delay_cnt_r' is larger than 0 and 'wait_cnt_r' equals 1, unless there is a reset, 'delaydec_cnt_r' is larger than 0, 'delay_cnt_r' equals 0, or 'TAP_DEC' is 0, in which cases it is not incremented. All assignments are performed with a delay specified by '#TCQ' time units.
