    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs the function of detecting various match patterns under rising and falling edges of a clock signal. It specifically handles this by using a set of registers 'pat0_match_rise_and_r' and 'pat0_match_fall_and_r' that are updated at each rising edge of the clock. They are then AND-ed together to form a data match signal 'pat0_data_match_r'. Delays are ensured through '#TCQ', a constant defined elsewhere."
