    "block_comment": "This block of code performs the function of assignment in the Verilog programming language. It assigns the value of the register 'poc_backup_r' to the wire 'poc_backup'. This is a concurrent assignment that will continuously update the value of 'poc_backup' to match the current value of 'poc_backup_r' as soon as 'poc_backup_r' changes. Verilog's 'assign' statement accomplishes non-blocking assignment, ensuring real-time data transfer from the register to the wire."
