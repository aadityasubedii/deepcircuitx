Comment: 
This block of code sets the assignment operation of the `samp_cntr` signal to reference the `samp_cntr_r`. Essentially, the value of `samp_cntr_r`[synchronous counter registered value] gets assigned to `samp_cntr`[sample counter] in every simulation time step. This might be part of a larger design where `samp_cntr` is used as a reference value throughout the rest of the system. The `assign` keyword in Verilog implies this is a continuous assignment operation, which reflects any changes in `samp_cntr_r` in `samp_cntr` instantaneously.
