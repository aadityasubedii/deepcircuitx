    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for sampling data at the rising and falling edges of the clock signal from multiple data streams. At every positive edge of the clock, the block samples the rising and falling edge of data from multiple sources indexed by rd_mux_sel_r and DRAM_WIDTH. This is achieved by sequentially assigning the samples to a corresponding set of registers (mux_rd_rise0_r to mux_rd_fall3_r). These register arrays are indexed by a loop counter (mux_i) and driven by a delay (#TCQ)."
