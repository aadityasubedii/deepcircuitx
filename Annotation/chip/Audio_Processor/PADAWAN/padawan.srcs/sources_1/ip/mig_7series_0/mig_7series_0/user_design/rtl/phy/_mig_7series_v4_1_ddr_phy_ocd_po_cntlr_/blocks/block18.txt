This block of code is responsible for updating a backup process operation code (POC). The POC is intended to back up when there's a rising edge on the clock input, achieved by a non-blocking assignment which allows other code to process parallelly. The delay #TCQ here is a technology-dependent constant proposing a setup time guarantee for the signal to become stable before the next positive clock edge.
