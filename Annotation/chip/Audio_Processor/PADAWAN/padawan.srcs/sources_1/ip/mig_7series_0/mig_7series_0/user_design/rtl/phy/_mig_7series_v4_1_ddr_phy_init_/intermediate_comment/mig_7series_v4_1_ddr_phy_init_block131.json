    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling the calibration process of a Phase Interpolator (PI) rank. If the reset signal (`rst`) is active, the calibration is regarded as incomplete, thus setting the `pi_calib_rank_done_r` flag to 0. If the PI is phase-locked for the current cycle, but not for the next cycle (`pi_phase_locked_all_r3` is True, and `pi_phase_locked_all_r4` is False), the calibration is completed, and the `pi_calib_rank_done_r` flag is set to 1. In all other cases, the calibration is again marked as incomplete by setting `pi_calib_rank_done_r` to 0. The changes to `pi_calib_rank_done_r` occur at the rising edge of the `clk` (clock signal) with a delay of 'TCQ' time units."
