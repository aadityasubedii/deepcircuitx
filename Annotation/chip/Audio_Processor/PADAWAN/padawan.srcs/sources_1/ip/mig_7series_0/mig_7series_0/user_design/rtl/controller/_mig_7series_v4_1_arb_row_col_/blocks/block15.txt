Comment: 
This block is responsible for updating the send command columns, specifically `send_cmd0_col` and `send_cmd1_col`. The assignment is executed each time the value of `sent_col_lcl` changes. Implementation-wise, it uses an 'always' block with a sensitivity list limited to `sent_col_lcl`. Upon any change in `sent_col_lcl` value, the same value is assigned to `send_cmd0_col` and `send_cmd1_col`.
