    "block_comment": "This block of code is a flip flop that manages the control signal 'stg1_wr_done' for write operations during specific states of a DDR init sequence. On the positive edge of the clock cycle, it checks if the DDR init state machine is in IDLE state or if a read level training byte sequence is completed (`rdlvl_last_byte_done`), if a complex byte read operation is completed (`complex_byte_rd_done`), or if a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence read operation is finished (`prbs_rdlvl_done_pulse`), then 'stg1_wr_done' signal is reset. If the DDR init state machine is in the READ LEVEL Stage 1 Write/Read state, the 'stg1_wr_done' signal is set high. This helps to control the state transitions during DDR initialization."
