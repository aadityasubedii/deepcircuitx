Comment: 
This block of code represents a sequential logic block that uses a positive-edge triggered flip-flop. On every positive transition of the clock signal "clk", the flip-flop captures and stores the value of "stg2_ns" into "stg2_r" after a delay defined by the constant "TCQ". This effectively transfers the signal "stg2_ns" from the present state to the next state after the clock pulse, providing a fundamental building block for many digital systems.
