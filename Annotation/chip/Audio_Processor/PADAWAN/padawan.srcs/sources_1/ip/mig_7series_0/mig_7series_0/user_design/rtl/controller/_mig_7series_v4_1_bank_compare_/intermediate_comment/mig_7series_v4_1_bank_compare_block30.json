    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code assigns the value of the variable 'req_size' to the variable 'req_size_r_lcl'. This assignment allows for the propagation of the request size from the logic where it is initially computed or received (potentially from an input or another module) to the local module or logic block where 'req_size_r_lcl' is used. This way, the assigned variable can be used later in the Verilog module for further computation, data handling, or condition checks.\n"
