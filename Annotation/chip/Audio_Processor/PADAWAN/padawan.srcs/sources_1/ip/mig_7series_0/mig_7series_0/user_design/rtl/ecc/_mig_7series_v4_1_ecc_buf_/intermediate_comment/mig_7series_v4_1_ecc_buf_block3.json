    "block_comment": "The block functions as a read and write buffer for a RAM memory structure using the RAM32M module. If the value of REMAINDER is zero, the input data (payload) is directly assigned to buf_in_data. Otherwise, buf_in_data is zero-padded on the left of payload with a size that depends on the value of REMAINDER. The process repeats for every RAM_CNT through a for-loop generating multiple instances of RAM32M. Data is extracted and assigned to the appropriate parts of buf_in_data and buf_out_data. In each RAM32M instance, the address inputs ADDRa, ADDRb, and ADDRc receive the buf_rd_addr_r value, while ADDRD receives buf_wr_addr. The write-enable (WE) input is assigned the signal wr_ecc_buf and the write clock (WCLK) is assigned the signal clk."
