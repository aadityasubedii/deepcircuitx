    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for incrementing the read pointer of a circular buffer. The read pointer, 'rd_ptr', is incremented by one every time the code block is executed and the modulus operator ensures that the result wraps around on reaching the buffer depth, 'DEPTH', thus maintaining the circular queue's functionality."
