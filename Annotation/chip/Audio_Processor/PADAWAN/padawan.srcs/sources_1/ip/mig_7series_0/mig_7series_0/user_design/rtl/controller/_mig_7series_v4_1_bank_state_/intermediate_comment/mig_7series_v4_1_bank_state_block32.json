    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for the management of the activation starvation limit counter. The counter is updated based on the status of the activation request (`act_req`) and the activation-denied signal (`rts_act_denied`). When there is no active request, the counter resets to zero. However, when an activation request is denied (`rts_act_denied` is high) and all bits of the counter are high (signifying the reach of the limit), the counter is incremented by one. The update of this counter is designed to prevent constant denial of requests by ensuring a grace period ('Starvation limit'), after which the requests must be processed."
