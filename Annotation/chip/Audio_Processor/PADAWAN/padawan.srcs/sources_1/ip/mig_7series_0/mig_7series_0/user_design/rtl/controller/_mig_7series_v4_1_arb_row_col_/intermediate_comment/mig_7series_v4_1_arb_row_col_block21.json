    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for enabling chip select signal (cs_en0). This action is performed whenever a change is detected in either the sent_row_or_maint_r or sent_col_lcl_r signals. It sets cs_en0 to high (1) if either sent_row_or_maint_r or sent_col_lcl_r is high, representing a logical OR operation between these two signals.\n"
