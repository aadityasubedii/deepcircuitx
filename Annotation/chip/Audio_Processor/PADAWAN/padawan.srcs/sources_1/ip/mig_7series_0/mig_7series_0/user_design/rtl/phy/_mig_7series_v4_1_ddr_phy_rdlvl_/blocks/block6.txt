This block of code is responsible for the generation of synchronous logic. The functionality is triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal. Specifically, it is assigning a delayed version of `cal1_cnt_cpt_r` to the `cal1_cnt_cpt_timing_r` register. The delay is determined by the value of `#TCQ`. This process ensures that the data in `cal1_cnt_cpt_r` is captured at the proper timing interval defined by `#TCQ` on the positive edge of the clock cycle, supporting reliable data transmission.
