    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog RTL code is designed to display a message when the PRBS/PER_BIT calibration process is completed. The \"always\" procedure is sensitive to the positive edge of the 'prbs_rdlvl_done' signal. When the 'prbs_rdlvl_done' signal goes high, indicating the completion of the PRBS/PER_BIT calibration, the message \"PHY_INIT : PRBS/PER_BIT calibration completed at %t\" is displayed on the console, given the reset signal, 'rst', is low. This execution is achieved through the use of conditional if statement inside the 'always' block."
