    "block_comment": "This block aims to configure the on-die termination (ODT) for DDR memory based on the number of ranks and the width of ODT. Depending on the configuration parameters of ODT_WIDTH and RANKS, it assigns different bits from aux_out to the output ports of the respective output buffer instances (OBUF). The if-else structure is used to switch between different configurations and accordingly instantiate the required OBUF modules. The module's output assigns ddr_odt according to the ODT_WIDTH and RANKS input parameters using an appropriate bit from aux_out at the offset determined by CKE_ODT_RCLK_SELECT_BANK."
