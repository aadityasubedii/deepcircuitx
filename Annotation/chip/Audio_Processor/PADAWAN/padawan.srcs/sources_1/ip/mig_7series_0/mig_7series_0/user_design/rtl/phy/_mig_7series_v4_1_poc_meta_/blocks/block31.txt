This block of code is a delay line that registers an event signal. It uses the concept of delay and clock edge detection to register the end of a specific run. Upon every positive edge detected on the system clock (posedge clk), it delays 'run_ends_ns' by time unit 'TCQ', and assigns the delayed value to 'run_ends_r'.
