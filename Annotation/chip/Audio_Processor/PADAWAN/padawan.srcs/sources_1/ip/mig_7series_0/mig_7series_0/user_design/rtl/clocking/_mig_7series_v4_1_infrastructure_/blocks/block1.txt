Comment: 
This block of code serves the function of assigning the last bit of the `rst_phaser_ref_sync_r` signal array to the signal `rst_phaser_ref`. The block extracts the most significant bit (MSB) from `rst_phaser_ref_sync_r` by indexing the collection using `RST_DIV_SYNC_NUM-1`, which is then assigned to `rst_phaser_ref`.
