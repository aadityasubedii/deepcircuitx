    "block_comment": "This block of code is set to reset or sync outputs with incoming signals. This is achieved by on the falling edge of 'auxout_clk' or the rising edge of 'rst_auxout'. If 'rst_auxout' is high, it will reset two specific registers (at positions 5 and 7 in 'aux_out') to 0 after a delay of 100 units of time. If it is not high, it will instead update these registers to match 'aux_out_' at positions 5 and 7 respectively, again after a delay of 100 units of time."
