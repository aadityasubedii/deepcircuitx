    "block_comment": "This block of code is implementing a register that updates its value at each positive edge of the clock. The value logged into the register `rtw_cnt_r` is whatever is present at `rtw_cnt_ns` with a delay defined by `#TCQ`. In this specific case, the `#TCQ` may be a delay element implemented as per the circuit design specifications or might be an explicit delay operator in Verilog, meant to simulate an actual timing delay in the hardware."
