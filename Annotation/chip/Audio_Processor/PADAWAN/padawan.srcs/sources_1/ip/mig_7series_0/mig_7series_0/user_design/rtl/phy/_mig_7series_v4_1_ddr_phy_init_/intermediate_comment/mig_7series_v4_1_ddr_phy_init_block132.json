    "block_comment": "This specific block of Verilog code is used for controlling a Pi calibration process in synchronous sequential logic circuits. On a rising clock edge detection, it checks if the reset signal ('rst') is on. If so, the calibration done status of the Pi ('pi_calib_done_r') is set as not complete (0). However, if the Pi calibration rank is completed ('pi_calib_rank_done_r'), then 'pi_calib_done_r' is set as complete (1). It illustrates the use of control sequences in a clocked process."
