    "block_comment": "This code block creates a ZQ control for DDR3 DRAM type in Verilog. If the DRAM type is DDR3, a register `zq_tick` is established and defaulted to 0. The code block then checks for a non-zero `ZQ_TIMER_DIV`. If it isn't zero, two registers `zq_timer_r` and `zq_timer_ns`are created with a width defined by `ZQ_TIMER_WIDTH`."
