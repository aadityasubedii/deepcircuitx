Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_mc_phy_wrapper. Module specification: This module serves as a wrapper for the DDR memory controller PHY (Physical Layer) interface in a 7 Series FPGA design. It handles the physical interface between the memory controller and DDR memory devices, managing various signals such as data, address, command, and control lines. The module takes inputs like clocks, resets, control signals, and data, and outputs memory interface signals. Key inputs include rst, clk, phy_cmd_wr_en, phy_data_wr_en, phy_ctl_wd, mux_address, mux_bank, and mux_wrdata. Outputs include ddr_clk, ddr_addr, ddr_ba, ddr_cas_n, ddr_ras_n, ddr
