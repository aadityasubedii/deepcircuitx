Comment: 
This block of Verilog code constitutes a flip-flop circuit which updates its output on the rising edge of the input clock. The logic being implemented is a typical edge-triggered D-type flip-flop with a delay propagation defined by the parameter 'TCQ'. Upon every positive clock edge, the flip-flop captures and holds the value of 'rcd_active_ns' and assigns it to 'rcd_active_r' after a delay of 'TCQ' time units. This block forms an essential element of a synchronous digital system, facilitating the sequential logic and temporal storage of state information.
