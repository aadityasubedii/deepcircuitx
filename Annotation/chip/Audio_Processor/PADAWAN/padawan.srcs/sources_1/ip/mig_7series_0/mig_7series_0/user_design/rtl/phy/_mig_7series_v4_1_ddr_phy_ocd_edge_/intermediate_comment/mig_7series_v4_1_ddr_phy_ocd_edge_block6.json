    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as an edge-triggered flip-flop. It is updated at the rising edge (positive edge) of the clock cycle. Once the clock goes high, the flip-flop captures the future state of `zero2fuzz_ns` from the input and assigns it to the `zero2fuzz_r` output after a delay defined by `TCQ`. It provides synchronization, ensuring that `zero2fuzz_r` changes only at specified clock cycle times."
