The block serves as a Round Robin arbiter module for controlling access to shared resources by multiple bank machines in a system. This particular block utilizes a positive edge triggered flip-flop to update a control signal (`granted_pre_r`) synchronized with the system clock, controlling access permissions. The implementation employs the `mig_7series_v4_1_round_robin_arb` module which utilizes parameters like clock, reset and request signals, current master, and an enable/disable grant signal to control access. The implementation procedure and parameters ensure fair access to the shared resources by all contenders.
