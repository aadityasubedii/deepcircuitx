This block of code executes a synchronous reset operation for a Pseudo Random Binary Sequences (PRBS) read leveling procedure in Verilog RTL. It is triggered by the positive edge of a clock signal, resetting all necessary variables and states used throughout the PRBS process if the reset signal (rst) is high. It resets count variables, state indicators, edge-detection variables, and PRBS status flags, while assigning default values to tap parameters for PRBS and variables used in fine delay calibrations. Additionally, it sets the state as idle. In the case of "FAST_CAL" simulation option, it marks the PRBS read leveling as done. Implementation-wise, the delay time constant ("TCQ") is used to control propagation delay, thus ensuring stable signal assignment.
