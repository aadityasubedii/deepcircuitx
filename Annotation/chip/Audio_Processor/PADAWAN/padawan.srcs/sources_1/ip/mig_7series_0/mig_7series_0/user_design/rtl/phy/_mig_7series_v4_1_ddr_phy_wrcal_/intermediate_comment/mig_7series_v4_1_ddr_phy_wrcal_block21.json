    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code checks for specific pattern matches for rising and falling edges in a signal. Based on the clock's positive edge, the block compares current and past state values in the signal - specifically, if the rising (falling) state at timestamp 'i' matches the pattern's rising (falling) state at the modulo 4 of 'i'. If a match occurs, it assigns the 'pat_match' register as '1' for that edge type and timestamp, otherwise assigns '0'. The assignment time delay is given by #TCQ."
