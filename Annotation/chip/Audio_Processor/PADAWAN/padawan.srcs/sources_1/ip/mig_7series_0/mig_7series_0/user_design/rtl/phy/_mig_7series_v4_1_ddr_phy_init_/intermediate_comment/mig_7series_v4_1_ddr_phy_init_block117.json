    "block_comment": "This block of code controls internal chip select signals based on system initialization and operation states. It responds to a clock edge, with most actions gated by a reset signal or an initialization state indicating register writes. If reset or writing mode is active, the chip sees all ranks as selected, with special handling if Write Latency (CWL) is even. Alternatively, when in normal operation, the chip select signal varies depending on the 'chip_cnt_r' value and further conditioned based on diverse system states. For each case, it effectively enables specific chip ranks according to the state machine output."
