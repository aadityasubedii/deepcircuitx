    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code assigns two debug flags, specifically related to memory write leveling (wrlvl). The execution begins when 'wrlvl_start' is triggered and ends when 'wrlvl_done' is flagged. The operational codes are implemented using simple assignment operators which enqueue the designated signals onto 'dbg_wrlvl_start' and 'dbg_wrlvl_done'."
