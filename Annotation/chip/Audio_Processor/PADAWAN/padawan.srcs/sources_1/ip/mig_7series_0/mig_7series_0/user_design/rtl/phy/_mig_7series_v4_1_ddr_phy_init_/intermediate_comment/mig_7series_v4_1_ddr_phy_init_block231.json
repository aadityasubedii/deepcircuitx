    "block_comment": "This block of code provides a synchronization mechanism for initialization and calibration completion signals in a digital circuit. Upon each positive edge of the clock, it checks if a reset signal has been received. If so, the initialization state and all related signals are asynchronously cleared to 0. If not, the block checks if the initialization state is complete (INIT_DONE). If true, it triggers a sequence of synchronizers in which the 'init_complete_r' and 'init_complete_r_timing' signals are set to 1. Subsequently, these completion signals are passed through stages of registers (init_complete_r1, init_complete_r1_timing, init_complete_r2, init_calib_complete) with the help of #TCQ delay, forming a 3-stage synchronizer chain to reconcile clock domain crossing."
