Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code manages a reading counter in a synchronous design environment. Triggered by a positive edge on the clock, the counter is reset if a reset signal is received, or if the read count equals zero. Otherwise, if a read detection signal is found and the read count is greater than zero, the read count is decremented by one.
