Comment: 
This block of code implements a synchronous reset-able register with some specific logic for "ocal_last_byte_done". The operation is entirely synchronous to the rising edges of the clock `clk`. The register `ocal_last_byte_done` is cleared (set to 0) whenever the reset signal is active (`rst`). When the reset is not active and the condition (`complex_oclkdelay_calib_cnt == DQS_WIDTH-1` and `oclkdelay_center_calib_done`) becomes true, the register `ocal_last_byte_done` is set to 1. This suggests the block is responsible for signaling the completion of a byte processing operation in a calibration process.
