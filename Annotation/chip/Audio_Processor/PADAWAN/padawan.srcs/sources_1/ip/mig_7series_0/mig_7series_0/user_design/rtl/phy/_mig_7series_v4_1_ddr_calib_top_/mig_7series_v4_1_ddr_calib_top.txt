Module-level comment: This module implements the top-level calibration logic for a DDR memory interface. It orchestrates various calibration processes including write leveling, read leveling, and DQS calibration. The module integrates multiple sub-modules, each responsible for specific calibration tasks, and manages the overall calibration sequence. It handles timing adjustments, processes status signals from DDR components, and generates control signals for the memory interface. The module also includes temperature monitoring and debug features to ensure proper DDR operation across different conditions and configurations.
