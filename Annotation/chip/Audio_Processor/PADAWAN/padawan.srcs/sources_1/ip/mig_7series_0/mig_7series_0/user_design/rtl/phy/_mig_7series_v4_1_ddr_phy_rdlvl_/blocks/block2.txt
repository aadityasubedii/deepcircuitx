This block of code implements a delay pipeline for the 'cal1_state_r' signal. Through the use of non-blocking assignments and clocked, sequential logic, the signal is sequentially propagated across three registers (cal1_state_r1, cal1_state_r2, and cal1_state_r3). These registers act as a delay pipeline, where each register introduces a delay of #TCQ, effectively delaying the input signal by three clock cycles.
