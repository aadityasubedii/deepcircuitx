The block's function involves creating a pipeline for processing signals, more specifically the 'rdlvl_stg1_done_int' and 'rdlvl_last_byte_done_int' signals, within a digital system. This block achieves its function by employing three pipeline stages and ensuring that transitions between stages occur on the rising edge of a clock signal, as defined by the 'always @ (posedge clk) begin...' line. The pipeline stages are represented by '_r1', '_r2', and '_r3'. The delay defined by '#TCQ' drives the inter-stage transitions, allowing each stage to process the respective signals sequentially, thus building a pipeline.
