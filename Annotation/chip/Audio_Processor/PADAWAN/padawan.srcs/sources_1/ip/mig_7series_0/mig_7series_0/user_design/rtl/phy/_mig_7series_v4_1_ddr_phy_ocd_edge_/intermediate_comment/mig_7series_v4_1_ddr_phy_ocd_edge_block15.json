    "block_comment": "This block functions as a register, specifically for storing the previous sample value of a system. The register is updated at the rising edge of the system clock, following a delay specified by #TCQ, which contains the value of the variable \"prev_samp_ns\". This method forms a sequential logic, hence, the functionality strongly depends on timing control behavior."
