Comment: 
The block of code is a sequential logic block that controls the states of 'dqs_wl_po_stg2_c_incdec' and 'dqs_wl_po_en_stg2_c' based on system reset or 'wl_state_r'. During a system reset or when 'wl_state_r' is not WL_CORSE_INC, both 'dqs_wl_po_stg2_c_incdec' and 'dqs_wl_po_en_stg2_c' are assigned the value of 0. If 'wl_state_r' is equal to WL_CORSE_INC, both variables are assigned the value of 1. The assignments occur on the positive edge of the system clock, indicated by 'posedge clk'.
