Comment: 
This block of Verilog code generates clock signals for a system, based on the type of clock input (differential, single-ended or no buffer). Depending on the `SYSCLK_TYPE`, the code configures specific input buffers. If the system clock type is `DIFFERENTIAL`, an `IBUFGDS` differential input buffer with specific input parameters is instantiated to process both positive(`sys_clk_p`) and negative(`sys_clk_n`) clock signals. For a `SINGLE_ENDED` system clock, an `IBUFG` input buffer is used to interface with the input clock(`sys_clk_i`). In the case where no clock buffer is required(`NO_BUFFER`), the system clock signal is directly assigned from the input(`sys_clk_i`) to the output(`sys_clk_ibufg`).
