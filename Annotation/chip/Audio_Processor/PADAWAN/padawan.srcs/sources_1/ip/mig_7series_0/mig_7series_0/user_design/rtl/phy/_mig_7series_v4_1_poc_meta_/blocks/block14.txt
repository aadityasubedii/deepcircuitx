This line of code represents an assignment operation where the net `window_center` is continuously assigned the value of the register `window_center_r`. This is one way of connecting a register which stores data to a net which physically connects components in a digital system within the Verilog code. `window_center_r` likely stores the center value of a certain window in a system, and this value is made accessible across the system using the `window_center` net.
