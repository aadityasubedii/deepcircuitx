Module-level comment: The mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_tempmon is a FPGA component that monitors and controls temperature. It dynamically adjusts based on real-time temperature data from device_temp input. Multiple states, like IDLE, INIT, FOUR_INC, etc., dictate the operation and aid in temperature regulation by switching states based on different temperature limits. The module receives parameters and signals via input ports and generates signals with output ports. It utilizes internal control variables to track and guide the state of monitoring, including comparison, synchronization, and sample counting. The functionality is realized through a mix of combinational and sequential logic within the module. The module is integral for maintaining device performance and stability.
