    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of `oclkdelay_calib_cnt` based on `byte_r`. Specifically, the register `oclkdelay_calib_cnt` is assigned a two-bit value where the most significant bit is '0' and the least significant bit is taken from `byte_r`. This implementation is a simple way of expanding the bit width of `byte_r` for further usage in the rest of the RTL code."
