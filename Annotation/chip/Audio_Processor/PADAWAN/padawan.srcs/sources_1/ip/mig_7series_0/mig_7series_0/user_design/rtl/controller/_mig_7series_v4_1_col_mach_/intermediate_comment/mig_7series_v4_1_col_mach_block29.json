    "block_comment": "This block of code defines an input and an output for a data buffer in Verilog hardware description language. The input, `col_wr_data_buf_addr`, is a binary number with the size defined by `DATA_BUF_ADDR_WIDTH`. This input is used to write data to a particular address in the buffer. The output, `wr_data_addr`, also a binary number of the same size, allows the system to track the address the data has been written to. Both input and output interfaces use wire data type suggesting real-time communication flow."
