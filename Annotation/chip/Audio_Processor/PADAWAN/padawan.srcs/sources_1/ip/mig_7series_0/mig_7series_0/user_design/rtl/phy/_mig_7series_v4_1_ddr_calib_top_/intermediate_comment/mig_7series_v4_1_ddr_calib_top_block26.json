    "block_comment": "The block dynamically configures the output of a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) based on the clock period (nCK_PER_CLK). If the clock period is equal to 4, the output PRBS (prbs_o) is directly assigned the value of prbs_out. However, if the clock period is not equal to 4, the output PRBS is assigned a specific range of prbs_out indices (from 0 to 4 times the Data Quantity Width (DQ_WIDTH) minus 1)."
