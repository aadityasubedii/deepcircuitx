This block of code controls the signal 'new_burst_r' with respect to clock edge and few other conditions. Upon the positive edge of the clock, if 'rdlvl_wr_rd' is true, it checks for the value of 'nCK_PER_CLK'. If 'nCK_PER_CLK' equals 2 and 'phy_ctl_full' is not true, then 'new_burst_r' toggles its state after a delay of 'TCQ', otherwise, it's set to 1 after the 'TCQ' delay. In any other case i.e. if 'rdlvl_wr_rd' is not true, 'new_burst_r' is directly set to 1 after the 'TCQ' delay.
