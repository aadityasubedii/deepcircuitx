Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is designed to synchronize various control signals upon the change of the 'sent_col_lcl' signal. It asserts three specific control signals 'cs_en3', 'send_cmd2_col', and 'send_cmd3_col' with the value of 'sent_col_lcl' when it changes. This is done inside an always block which ensures that these signal values are updated whenever there's a change in 'sent_col_lcl'.
