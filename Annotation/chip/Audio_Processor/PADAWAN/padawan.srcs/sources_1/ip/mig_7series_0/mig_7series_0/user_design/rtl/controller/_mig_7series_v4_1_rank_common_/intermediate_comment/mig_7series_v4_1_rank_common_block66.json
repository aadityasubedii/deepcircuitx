    "block_comment": "This code block generates a maintenance prescaler. It declares two arrays 'maint_prescaler_r' and 'maint_prescaler_ns' of width MAINT_PRESCALER_WIDTH and initializes them as registries. It also generates a wire 'maint_prescaler_tick_ns' that turns true when the value of 'maint_prescaler_r' equals to 'ONE' array of the same size as 'maint_prescaler_r'. This block primarily serves as a clock divider that slows down the main clock by the specified prescaler value."
