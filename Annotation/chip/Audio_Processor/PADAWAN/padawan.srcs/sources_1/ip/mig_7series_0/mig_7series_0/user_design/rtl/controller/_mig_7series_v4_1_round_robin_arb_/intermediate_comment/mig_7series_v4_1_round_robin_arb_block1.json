    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for setting the value of a register, `last_master_r`. It does this in sync with the rising edge of a clock signal (`posedge clk`) which means it updates `last_master_r` at each positive transition of the clock. The value of `last_master_r` is set to the value of `last_master_ns` but the update is delayed by `#TCQ`, which is a timing control specifying the delay time."
