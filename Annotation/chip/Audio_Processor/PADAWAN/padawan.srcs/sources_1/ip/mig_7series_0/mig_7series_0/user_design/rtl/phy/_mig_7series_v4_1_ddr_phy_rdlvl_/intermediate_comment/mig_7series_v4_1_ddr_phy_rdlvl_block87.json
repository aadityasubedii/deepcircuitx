    "block_comment": "This block of code performs a reset action and conditional read-leveling delays in a DDR memory system. When a reset signal is detected or the done count equals 0, the load and store timings for the second stage of the Pipelined Interleaved memory are set to low (0), effectively clearing these registers. If a series of condition checks related to calibration states, DQS counter and done counter passes, the code enables the load timing and uses a read-leveling DQS tap count to set the store timing for optimized delays. In all other cases, the block falls back to clear the timings for resetting or preparing for the next cycle of operations."
