    "block_comment": "This block of code is assigning a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) seed value. The exact value set, `64'h9966aa559966aa55`, is a hardcoded 64-bit hexadecimal value. This seed is used to generate a pseudorandom sequence for certain tasks such as testing. Hardcoding a seed provides determinism in the random sequence generated for repeatability of tests or other purposes. The `assign` statement is used to set the seed value, making it available for use in other parts of the code."
