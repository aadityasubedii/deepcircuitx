Comment: 
This block of Verilog code implements a `wire` named `upd_last_master`. The purpose of this wire is to monitor the status of the `end_rtp` signal and update accordingly. Implementation-wise, it uses the bitwise OR operator (`|`) across all bits of `end_rtp`. Such a design can be typically used to create a flag that gets high (`1`) if any bit of `end_rtp` is high, and stays low (`0`) otherwise.
