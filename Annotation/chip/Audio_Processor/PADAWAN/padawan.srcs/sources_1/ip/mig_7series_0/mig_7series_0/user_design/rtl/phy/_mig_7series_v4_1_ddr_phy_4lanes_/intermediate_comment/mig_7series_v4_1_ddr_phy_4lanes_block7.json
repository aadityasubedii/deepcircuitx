    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a generate construct that controls the muxes (B_mux_ctrl, C_mux_ctrl, D_mux_ctrl) based on the highest lane available and the calibration conditions. Based on the `HIGHEST_LANE` condition, the muxes are enabled depending on the lane availability. Moreover, each mux control receives a Boolean value, depending on whether calibration for the corresponding lane is not zero and the calibration control is not in effect or the corresponding `DATA_CTL_N` bit is set. If the lane is unavailable, the mux control is explicitly set to zero."
