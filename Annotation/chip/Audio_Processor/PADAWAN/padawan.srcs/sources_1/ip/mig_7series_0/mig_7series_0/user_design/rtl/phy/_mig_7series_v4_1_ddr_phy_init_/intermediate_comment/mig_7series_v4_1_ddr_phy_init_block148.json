    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code mainly controls the number of refresh cycles (`num_refresh`) in a DRAM. It's triggered on the rising edge of a clock signal (`clk`). Initially, `num_refresh` is reset to zero under certain conditions, for instance, at a reset signal (`rst`) or during several states of the initialization process (`init_state_r` equals to different values). However, if `init_state_r` is at the 'INIT_REFRESH' state and certain conditions regarding read leveling, write leveling, calibration, and clock period are met, `num_refresh` increments by one."
