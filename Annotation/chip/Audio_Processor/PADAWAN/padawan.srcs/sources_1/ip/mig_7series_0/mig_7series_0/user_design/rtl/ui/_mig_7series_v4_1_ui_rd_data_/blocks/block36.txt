This block of code holds the responsibility for an error-checking process. It leverages a flip-flop that is sensitive to the rising edge of a clock signal (posedge clk) to update the state of 'app_ecc_multiple_err_r'. This operation will be performed with a delay of a fixed amount specified by the '#TCQ'. The value of 'app_ecc_multiple_err_r' will be updated to the present state of the 'ecc_multiple' variable each time when there is a rising edge in the 'clk' signal.
