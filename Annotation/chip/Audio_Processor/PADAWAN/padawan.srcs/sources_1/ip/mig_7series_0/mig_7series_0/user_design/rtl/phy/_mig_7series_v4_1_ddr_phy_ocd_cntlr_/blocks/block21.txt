This block of code is responsible for setting a register delay on a clock signal. Upon every positive edge of the `clk` signal, the output `complex_oclkdelay_calib_done_r` is asynchronously delayed by `#TCQ` before it is set to the value of `complex_oclkdelay_calib_done_ns`. The purpose of this delayed assignment is to synchronize signals that are asynchronous to the `clk` signal, minimizing setup and hold time violations.
