The primary function of this block of code is to control the writing to a complex number in a memory system. It accomplishes this by using the system clock and the reset signal to determine the number of writes to the complex number, as well as the time delay between each write operation. This is done by watching for certain conditions in the 'init_state_r' and 'stg1_wr_rd_cnt' variables. When 'init_state_r' equals 'INIT_OCAL_COMPLEX_WRITE_WAIT' and 'complex_wait_cnt' is equal to 14 and  'complex_row0_wr_done' is false, a series of conditions based on 'stg1_wr_rd_cnt' alters the value of 'complex_num_writes'. If 'stg1_wr_rd_cnt' is equal to or exceeds certain thresholds (85, 73, and 39), and 'complex_num_writes' is less than a certain value (6, 5 and 10 respectively), 'complex_num_writes' is incremented. Otherwise, it's reset to 1. Additional conditions on 'init_state_r' and 'complex_row0_wr_done' may set 'complex_num_writes' to 1 or 30 as well.
