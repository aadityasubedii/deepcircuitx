    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code primarily functions as a synchronous reset controller and fine adjuster for the first stage of calibration (`pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1[1]`) within a digital circuit. It deploys different conditions on the positive clock edge (`posedge clk`). On reset (`rst`) or a fine adjustment (`fine_adjust`), it clears or resets the `pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1[1]` bit back to 0, otherwise, if there's a previous valid stage of calibration (`pi_rst_stg1_cal_r[1]`), it sets the `pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1[1]` bit to 1. Another condition this block checks is if no DQS was found in any bank (`~pi_dqs_found_any_bank_r[1]`) or in all banks (`~pi_dqs_found_all_bank[1]`), which would then clear `pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1[1]` bit back to 0. The block essentially uses these logics to perform fine control of calibration stages.\n"
