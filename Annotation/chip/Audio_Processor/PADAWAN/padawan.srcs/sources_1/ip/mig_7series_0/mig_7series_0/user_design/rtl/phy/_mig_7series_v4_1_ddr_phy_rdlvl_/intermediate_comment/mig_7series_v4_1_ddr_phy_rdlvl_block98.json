    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a flip-flop mechanism, with a slight delay defined by TCQ, to capture the inverse of the value `phy_if_empty`. At every positive edge of the clock signal (`clk`), the value of `~phy_if_empty` is stored into `mux_rd_valid_r`. The delay introduced by `#TCQ` presents a timing control, simulating the time it takes for the logic gate to propagate the signal. The flip-flop is asynchronously reset, indicated by the absence of a reset condition in the always block."
