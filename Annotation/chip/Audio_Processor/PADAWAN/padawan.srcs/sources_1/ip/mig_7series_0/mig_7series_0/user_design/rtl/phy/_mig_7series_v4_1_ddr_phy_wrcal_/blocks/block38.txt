Comment: 
This code block appears to be incomplete, as you provided only the "endgenerate" keyword. `endgenerate` keyword is used to limit the scope of the generate if, generate case, generate for loop and other construct begins with generate. To give a better and more accurate summary, the full block of code this `endgenerate` is closing, would be necessary.
