Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used for writing data (drive values) to the 'phy_dout' bus based on a mapping index determined by 'WE_MAP'. Depending on the value of 'WE_MAP[3:0]', the write location is determined through a generate construct that creates either a < 10 or >= 10 hardware condition. If 'WE_MAP[3:0]' is less than 4'hA (hexadecimal 10), the 4-bit segment of 'phy_dout' bus determined by calculated indexing equation is assigned to multiple 'mux_we_n' values. If 'WE_MAP[3:0]' is equal or greater than 4'hA, a different part of the 'phy_dout' bus is assigned the 'mux_we_n' values, as determined by a slightly different indexing equation.
