    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to implement a looping control structure in Verilog for a memory width described by the parameter 'DRAM_WIDTH'. The implementation uses a 'for' loop with integer 'pt_i' as the incrementing index. The loop starts at index '0' and increments by '1' each iteration until 'pt_i' is equal to 'DRAM_WIDTH,' at which point the loop ends. The for loop is labelled 'gen_pat_match' for easy identification. The specifics of the actions taken inside the loop are not given in the provided snippet."
