Comment: 
This block of code is performing the role of a flip flop or a latch. The operation of this block is tandem to the positive edge of a clock signal `clk`. Every time the clock signal `clk` has a positive edge, the value of `phy_rddata_en` is assigned to `prde_r1` after a delay of `TCQ`. This is achieved through the always block in Verilog, which executes its body whenever there's a change (positive edge in this case) in the specified condition (clock signal `clk` here). The delay is introduced by the `#TCQ`.
