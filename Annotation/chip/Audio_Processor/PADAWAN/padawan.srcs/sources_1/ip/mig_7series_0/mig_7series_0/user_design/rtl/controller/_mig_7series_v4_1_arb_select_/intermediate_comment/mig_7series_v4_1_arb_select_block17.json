    "block_comment": "This block assigns values to a section of the `mc_cs_n` array, based on a particular control set. The operation takes a logical shift of `cs_one_hot`, left-shifting it by `nCS_PER_RANK` times the `ra2` value, then inverting the result. This value is then logically OR'd with the inverted form of `cs_en2`, extended to fit `CS_WIDTH*nCS_PER_RANK` times. The resultant bit pattern controls the addressing scheme for the memory system arrays. This is to select a particular memory chip select (CS) line, supporting a mechanism enabling the control of multiple chips independently on the same bus lines."
