    "block_comment": "The block of code signals the completion of the OCLKDELAY calibration in the PHY_INIT process. It works by continuously observing the rising edge (posedge) of the \"complex_oclkdelay_calib_done\" signal. When a positive edge on this signal occurs, denoting the completion of the calibration, it checks whether a reset (\"rst\") is not in process. If there's no reset in progress, it displays a message notifying the user of the completion of the calibration, along with the time at which this event occurred. This action provides a valuable debugging and monitoring mechanism."
