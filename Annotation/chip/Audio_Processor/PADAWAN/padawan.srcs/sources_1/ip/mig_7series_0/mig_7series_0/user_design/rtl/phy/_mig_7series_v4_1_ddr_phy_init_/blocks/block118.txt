This block of code switches on a two-rank DDR3 functionality when two conditions are met: The REG_CTRL is set to "ON" and the number of RANKS is equal to 2. The block of code uses an 'if' conditional and logical AND operator to check these conditions. If both conditions are satisfied, then it begins the section labeled as DDR3_2rank which implies activating a two-rank DDR3 related functionality. It's within this named begin-end block, the operations related or specific to the two-rank DDR3 feature would be written. Please, ensure to check the code inside the DDR3_2rank block for more specific details.
