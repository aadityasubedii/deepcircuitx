This block primarily handles the delay functions necessary for Verilog RTL code's digital logic design. It manifests actions on the rising edge of the clock signal. The delay introduced by the #TCQ style of delay helps maintain the functionality in line with the time of the system clock. This block is important for managing delay in the Read Leveling stage 1 (rdlvl_stg1_done), Pseudo Random Binary Sequence Read Leveling (prbs_rdlvl_done), and Write Calibration (wrcal_resume, wrcal_sanity_chk). The propagation delay is realized from one register to another (prbs_rdlvl_done_r2 and prbs_rdlvl_done_r3) insuring synchronization.
