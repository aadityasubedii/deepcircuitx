Comment: 
This line of Verilog RTL code represents a register that is triggered on every positive edge of the clock cycle. The function of this block is to hold and update the write data address for a Wishbone bus protocol. It does this by storing the next state (`wb_wr_data_addr_ns`) of the write data address into the register (`wb_wr_data_addr_r`) after a clock cycle delay of `TCQ` units, where `TCQ` is the clock quality time. This ensures data integrity by allowing proper timing and synchronization of the data movement within multiple elements of the system.
