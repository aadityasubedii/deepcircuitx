Comment: 
This block assigns the sum of 'idle_cnt' and 'idlers_below' to the 'temp' variable. This operation is carried out using the 'assign' statement that facilitates continuous assignment in Verilog, meaning the assigned value will change whenever the values of 'idle_cnt' or 'idlers_below' change.
