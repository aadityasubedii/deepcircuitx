    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for temperature monitoring of the device. Depending upon the 'TEMP_MON_CONTROL' signal, the temperature can be externally supplied, or monitored by an On-Chip XADC. If the TEMP_MON_CONTROL signal value is 'EXTERNAL', the device temperature is simply assigned to the input signal 'device_temp_i'. Otherwise, a state machine is implemented with states including: idle, request reading temperature, waiting for read, and read. Also, it includes a sample timer that's enabled or cleared upon certain conditions, and the temperature data is held in the 'temperature' variable. The state machine reads the temperature from the XADC regularly, controlled by the sample time parameters. To ensure system stability, the reset is synchronised using a two stage synchroniser pattern, 'rst_r1' and 'rst_r2'."
