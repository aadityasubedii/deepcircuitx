Comment: 
This block outputs the 'rtc' signal based on the several conditions. The 'rtc' signal is generated as a result of a Boolean AND operation of the complements of 'rnk_config_match' and 'rnk_config_kill_rts_col' signals, as well the normal assertion of the 'order_q_zero', 'col_wait_r', and's 'demand_ok' signals. This setup makes 'rtc' high only when 'rnk_config_match' and 'rnk_config_kill_rts_col' are not asserted, and 'order_q_zero', 'col_wait_r', and 'demand_ok' signals are asserted.
