    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for sequencing the 'oneeighty_r' signal with the clock's rising edge, thus synchronizing data flow in the design. The 'oneeighty_r' signal is assigned the value of the 'oneeighty_ns' after a delay of 'TCQ' units, where 'TCQ' represents time of the clock period."
