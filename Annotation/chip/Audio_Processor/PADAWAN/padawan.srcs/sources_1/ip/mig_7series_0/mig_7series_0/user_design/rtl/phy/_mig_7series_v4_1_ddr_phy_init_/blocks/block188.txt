This block controls the write level active signal (wrlvl_active). The write level active signal is set to inactive state when a clock edge occurs and a reset command is issued, a write level for a rank is done, or done DQS tap increment signal is returned. However, when write level enabling count reaches 1, write level ODT is set and write level active is not set, the block will set write level active flag to be active.
