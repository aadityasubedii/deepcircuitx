Comment: 
This block of Verilog code implements the function of an edge-triggered register. It updates the `demand_priority_r` register value on every positive edge of the `clk` signal, following a certain delay specified by `TCQ`(Time Clock to Q), with the new value `demand_priority_ns` coming from possibly some sort of priority arbitration logic. The `#TCQ` mechanism is used to mimic the actual delay within hardware implementation.
