    "block_comment": "This block of code is intended to determine which row is being sent based on the functionality of a machine bank. It takes into account whether a particular bank has been granted permission to send a row or not. In its implementation, it uses a bitwise AND operation between the grant_row_r_lcl signal and the negated value of block_grant_row, replicated nBANK_MACHS times, to produce the sending_row signal. The resultant of this operation reflects the row transmission privilege for each bank in the machine."
