    "block_comment": "The block of code designates a clock signal event detection, specifically for the rising edge of the clock 'mmcm_ps_clk'. This is achieved through the 'always @' construct, triggering the block whenever there is a positive edge change in 'mmcm_ps_clk'. Upon detection, it assigns the current timestamp value, fetched using the '$time()' system task, to the variable 'rising_mmcm_ps_clk'."
