    "block_comment": "The function of this block is simple; it continuously assigns the value of `tail_r_lcl` to `tail_r`. This line of verilog RTL code essentially forms a wire between `tail_r_lcl` and `tail_r`, meaning `tail_r` will always reflect the current value of `tail_r_lcl`. Because this is an `assign` statement, this assignment is always active and `tail_r` will instantaneously take the value of `tail_r_lcl` whenever it changes."
