This block of Verilog code is responsible for an asynchronous update of the command signals. The command signals are updated at every positive edge of the clock (posedge clk) after a delay equal to TCQ (likely a pre-defined constant). This implementation utilizes a non-blocking assignment (indicated by the '<=' operator), allowing the code to mimic the parallel nature of hardware design, where multiple operations can occur concurrently. This non-blocking assignment, paired with an always block triggered by a positive clock edge, allows for synchronization with the system clock. This execution style ensures that the row_cmd_r signals take on the values of row_cmd_ns, but the actual update occurs at a later time, dictated by the TCQ delay.
