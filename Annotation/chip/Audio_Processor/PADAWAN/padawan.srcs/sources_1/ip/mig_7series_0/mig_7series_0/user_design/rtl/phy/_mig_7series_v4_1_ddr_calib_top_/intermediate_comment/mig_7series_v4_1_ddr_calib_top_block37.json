    "block_comment": "This block performs dynamic setup and calibration in a system based on clock-triggered events. It uses conditions such as reset states, calibration values, and custom instructions to determine the behaviour of byte selection, control lane selection, and a common calibration input. At each clock cycle, the block checks these conditions in sequence and sets the values of the variables correspondingly. The control queue delay (#TCQ) ensures the operations are serialized during signal propagation. For calibration and debugging purposes, various parameters and flags are used like `skip_cal_po_pi_dec_done`, `ck_addr_cmd_delay_done`, `fine_adjust_done`, etc. to customize the system operation accordingly."
