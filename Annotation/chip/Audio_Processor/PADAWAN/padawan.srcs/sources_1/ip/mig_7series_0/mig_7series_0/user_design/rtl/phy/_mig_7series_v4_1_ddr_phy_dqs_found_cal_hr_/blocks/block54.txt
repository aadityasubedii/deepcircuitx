Comment: 
This block of Verilog code latches the status of data strobe detection for all banks and any bank upon the positive edge of the clock. The status, indicated by 'pi_dqs_found_all_bank' and 'pi_dqs_found_any_bank', is delayed by a time period equivalent to 'TCQ' before being assigned to 'pi_dqs_found_all_bank_r' and 'pi_dqs_found_any_bank_r' respectively. This implementation suggests the presence of a data handling or memory module in a broader context.
