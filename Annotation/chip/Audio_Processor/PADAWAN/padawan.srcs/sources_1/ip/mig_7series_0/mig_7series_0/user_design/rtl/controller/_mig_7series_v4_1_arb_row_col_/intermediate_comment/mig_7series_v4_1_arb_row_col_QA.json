The code is responsible for priority scheduling between column (write/read command) and row (activate/precharge command) arbitration, considering a number of parameters including command mode, data width, latency, and clock cycles. The module is also designed to generate control signals necessary for sending commands and handling rank configuration. Implementations for different combinations of command mode and clock per cycle are encapsulated. Additionally, it controls the timing for sending various commands and enabling chip selects with different scenarios."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \n1. `rnk_config_strobe_r`: This is a register array used as a delay chain for controlling rank configuration commands timing.\n\nExplanation: This signal basically takes `RNK2RNK_DLY_CLKS` cycles before allowing another rank configuration command to be issued. This delay mechanism implies that if a rank configuration strobe signal comes in, it will need to wait out `RNK2RNK_DLY_CLKS` clock cycles before another one can be launched. This ensures proper timing between rank configuration commands, complying with the specified delay requirements.\n\n2. `block_grant_row` and `block_grant_col`: This wire is used to temporarily block the grant for row or column requests when the respective command mode and clock condition applies. \n\nExplanation: They are used to control the interleaved scheduling between row (activate/precharge command) and column (write/read command) grants, this is particularly useful for memory scheduling algorithms to optimize the memory performance.\n\n3. `rnk_config_kill_rts_col_lcl`: The signal is even asserted under local conditions calculated in the current module.\n\nExplanation: This local signal will be assigned to the output pin rnk_config_kill_rts_col and this output signal is a control signal which blocks column requests when there's a config command being issued, this is done for ensuring the prioritized execution of the rank to rank config.\n\n4. `granted_row_ns`, `granted_col_ns`, `granted_row_r`, `granted_col_r`: These signals control the sequence of granting row or column requests.\n\nExplanation: Their values will determine if the request is accepted or not.
