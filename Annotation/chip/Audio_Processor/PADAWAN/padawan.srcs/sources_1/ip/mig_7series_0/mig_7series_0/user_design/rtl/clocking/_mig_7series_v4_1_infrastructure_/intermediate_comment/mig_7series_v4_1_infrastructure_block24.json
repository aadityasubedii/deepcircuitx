    "block_comment": "This block regulates the updating of a register 'qcntr_r'. The register 'qcntr_r' is updated asynchronously on the rising edge of clock signal 'clk' as specified in the 'always' block using a non-blocking assignment (<=). The new state 'qcntr_ns' is assigned to 'qcntr_r' after a delay of 'TCQ' time units, where 'TCQ' is a defined constant. Thus, it's a latch implementation block which uses the value of 'qcntr_ns' from the previous clock cycle to update 'qcntr_r'."
