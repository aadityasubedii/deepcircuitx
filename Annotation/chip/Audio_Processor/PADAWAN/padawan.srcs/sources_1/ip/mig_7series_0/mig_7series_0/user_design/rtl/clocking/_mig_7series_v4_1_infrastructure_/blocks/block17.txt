Comment: 
This block of Verilog code performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation on two signals: `inv_poc_sample_ns` and `mmcm_hi0_r`. This function is implemented using the always @(*) construct in Verilog, which means the output `poc_sample_pd_ns` changes whenever the input (`inv_poc_sample_ns` or `mmcm_hi0_r`) changes. The resulting value is stored in the `poc_sample_pd_ns` variable. The exclusive OR operation is performed bit-by-bit, so if the two bits are the same the result bit is 0, if the bits are different, the result is 1.
