    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to manage calibration commands and adjust calibration data offsets based on certain conditions during the high clock signal. The implementation takes into account variables such as write leveling assert, read leveling write with a new burst, read leveling read with a new burst, and the default state. Depending on the condition, it assigns a specific calibration command and modifies the calibration data offsets and the calibration cas slot. Furthermore, the calibration cas slot and the calibration data offset are calculated based on whether the CWL_M variable is even or odd. For certain conditions, the number of clocks per clock signal (nCK_PER_CLK) and the finished flag status for processes such as PI calibration and DQS found are also taken into account."
