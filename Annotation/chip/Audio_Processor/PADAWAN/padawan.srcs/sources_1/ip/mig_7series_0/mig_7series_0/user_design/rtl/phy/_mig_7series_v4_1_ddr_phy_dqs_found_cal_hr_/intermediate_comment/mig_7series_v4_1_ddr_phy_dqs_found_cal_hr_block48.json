    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a counter, `rnk_cnt_r`, in a synchronous digital design. Upon receiving the positive edge of a clock signal, the behavior is governed by three conditions. If reset is active the counter is reset to zero immediately. If a flag, `init_dqsfound_done_r`, is set, then the counter retains its value. If another flag, `rank_done_r`, is set, then the counter is incremented by one. The counter value is held until the next positive edge of the clock signal."
