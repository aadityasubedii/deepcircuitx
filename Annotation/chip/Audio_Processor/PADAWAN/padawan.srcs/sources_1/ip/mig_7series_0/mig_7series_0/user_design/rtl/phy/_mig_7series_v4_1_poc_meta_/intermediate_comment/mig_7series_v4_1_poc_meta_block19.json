    "block_comment": "This code block defines a wire named 'center_diff_ns', which has the function of computing the modulus difference between the variables 'right' and 'left' using the 'mod_sub' function. The width of the wire is determined by the constant 'TAPCNTRWIDTH'. The operation of modulus subtraction takes into account the wrap-around effect, especially useful in digital systems dealing with timing and synchronization related circuits. The 'TAPSPERKCLK' parameter in the 'mod_sub' function likely refers to the clock rate or frequency, providing a periodic reference for the wrap-around effect. The result of 'mod_sub' operation is assigned to 'center_diff_ns'."
