    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to detect matching patterns between stored and target patterns based on rising and falling edges for two different signals. Each 'if' statement compares a bit from the current snapshot of the stored pattern (sr_rise0_r, sr_fall0_r, sr_rise1_r and sr_fall1_r respectively) indexed by pt_i, with the corresponding bit from the target pattern (pat2_rise0, pat2_fall0, pat2_rise1, pat2_fall1) indexed by the remainder of pt_i divided by 4. On every positive edge of the clock signal 'clk', if a stored pattern bit aligns with the target pattern bit, the corresponding matching flag (pat2_match_rise0_r, pat2_match_fall0_r, pat2_match_rise1_r, pat2_match_fall1_r) is asynchronously set to 1 otherwise it is set to 0. The delay defined by #TCQ simulates any inherent delay in a Real-world digital system."
