This block of code implements a pipeline for handling propagation delays. This pipeline registers sequential logic at every positive cycle of the clock. Specifically, the block implements delay elements named "mc_aux_out_r", with the delay time defined by the "TCQ" parameter. These delay elements store the value of "mc_aux_out0" and shift the value down the pipeline at each clock tick.
