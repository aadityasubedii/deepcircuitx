    "block_comment": "The block of code manages the states of the 5th and 7th elements of the aux_out array. It operates on either the rising edge of the auxiliary output clock (auxout_clk) or when the auxiliary output reset (rst_auxout) is high. If the rst_auxout signal goes high, the 5th and 7th output elements are synchronously reset to zero after a delay of 100 units. If the rst_auxout signal isn't high (else branch), the current values of the 5th and 7th elements of aux_out_ array are assigned to the 5th and 7th elements of aux_out array after a delay of 100 time units."
