    "block_comment": "This block of code updates the value of `prev_valid_ns` based on a set of conditions. The `prev_valid_ns` signal goes high if there's no reset (`~rst`), the Kernal Tap is not at either right or left edges (`~ktap_at_right_edge` and `~ktap_at_left_edge`), and the edges are not aligned (`~edge_aligned_r`). Alternatively, if the task has been marked as done (`done_ns`), `prev_valid_ns` also goes high. These conditions are realized by using a combinational always block in Verilog which reacts instantly to inputs. The signal update process is ensured by the bitwise OR `|` operation."
