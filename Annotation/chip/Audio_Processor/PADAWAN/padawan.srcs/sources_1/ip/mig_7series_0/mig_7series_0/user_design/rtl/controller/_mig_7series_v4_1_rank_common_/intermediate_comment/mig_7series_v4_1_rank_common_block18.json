    "block_comment": "This block handles the update of the acknowledgement signal for an application reference touched on every clock cycle's rising edge. Using Verilog's non-blocking assignment, the new state of `app_ref_ack_r` is determined by the state of `app_ref_ack_ns` but gets updated only at the rising edge of the provided clock signal, and with a delay specified by `#TCQ` to simulate the physical time delay in hardware implementation."
