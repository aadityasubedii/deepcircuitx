    "block_comment": "This line of code is for assigning the value of a local variable to a wire in an asynchronous process in a Verilog module. In this specific case, the 'accept_req' wire is assigned the value of the 'accept_req_lcl' variable each time there's a change in the state of 'accept_req_lcl'. This acts as an interface between the local processing within the module and the outside world for request acceptance signal propagation. This technique is a standard way of passing signal values in concurrent, non-blocking assignments to maintain a synchronous process flow."
