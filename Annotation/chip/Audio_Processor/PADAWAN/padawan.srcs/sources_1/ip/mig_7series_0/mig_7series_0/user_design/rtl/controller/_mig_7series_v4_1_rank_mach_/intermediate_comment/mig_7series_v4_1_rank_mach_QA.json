In particular, this module manages ranks in DDR memory operation. It receives requests (like periodic read, refresh, impedance control ZQ, self-refresh etc.), control signals (like row and column commands, read/write executions), and other signals from the system. Based on these, it controls or inhibits operations to different ranks via a series of sub-modules (each for a rank) 'mig_7series_v4_1_rank_cntrl' instantiated inside a generate loop. It also has an instance of module 'mig_7series_v4_1_rank_common' handling common functionalities like periodic read requests and refresh requests etc. across all ranks. The overall operation of the module is to maintain optimum DDR operation by managing the ranks considering the requests and state of the system."
