    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a flip-flop with a synchronous positive edge trigger for signal \"phy_rddata_en_r1\". The signal \"phy_rddata_en_r1\" gets assigned the value of \"prde\" at the positive edge of the clock signal \"clk\". The delay \"#TCQ\" sets the time it takes for the assigned value to propagate to the output, hence implementing a latch timing mechanism."
