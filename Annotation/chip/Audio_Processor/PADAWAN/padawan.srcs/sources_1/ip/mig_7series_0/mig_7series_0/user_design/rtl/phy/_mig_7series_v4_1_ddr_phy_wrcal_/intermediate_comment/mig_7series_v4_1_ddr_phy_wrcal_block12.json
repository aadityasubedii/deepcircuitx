    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for matching and storing the status of a Early1 circuits\u2019 rising and falling time values in specific registers. This occurs at every positive edge of the clock cycle. The matching process involves a modulo operation on the index with 4, presumably to implement circular buffer-like behavior where the index loops back to 0 after exceeding 3. If a match occurs between the sampled rising or falling value (sr_riseX and sr_fallX) and the early1 circuit measurements (early1_riseX or early1_fallX), a '1' is stored to the corresponding register (early1_match_riseX_r or early1_match_fallX_r), otherwise a '0' is stored. These comparisons and assignments are carried out with an assumed delay \"#TCQ\"."
