    "block_comment": "The block is an \"always\" loop that sets the state of 'auto_pre_ns' depending on multiple conditions. The 'auto_pre_ns' signal is generally held equal to 'auto_pre_r_lcl'. If 'clear_req' signal is active, 'auto_pre_ns' is reset to 0. In a more complex condition, if 'accept_req', 'tail_r_lcl', 'allow_auto_pre', 'rb_hit_busy_r' are all active, and either 'row_hit_r' is inactive or both 'maint_hit_this_bm' is active and 'wait_for_maint_r_lcl' is inactive, then 'auto_pre_ns' is set to 1. Thus, this block establishes the logic to control 'auto_pre_ns' based on various system states and requests."
