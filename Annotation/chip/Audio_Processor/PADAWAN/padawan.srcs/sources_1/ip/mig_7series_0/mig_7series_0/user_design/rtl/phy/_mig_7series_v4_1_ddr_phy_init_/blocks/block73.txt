This block of code is responsible for incrementing a complex sample counter upon each rising edge of the system clock. During each clock cycle, this increment operation uses two pipelined registered stages, namely 'complex_sample_cnt_inc_r1' and 'complex_sample_cnt_inc_r2', to relay the incremented value of the 'complex_sample_cnt_inc' forward thereby synchronizing data processing tasks within the system's digital logic. The delay `#TCQ` represents typical clock-to-output delay, ensuring proper timing constraint adherence for coherent signal propagation throughout the system.
