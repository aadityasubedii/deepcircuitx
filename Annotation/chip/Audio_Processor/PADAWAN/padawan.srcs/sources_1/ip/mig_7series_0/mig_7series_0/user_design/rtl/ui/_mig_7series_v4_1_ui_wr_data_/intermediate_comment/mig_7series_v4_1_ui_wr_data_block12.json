    "block_comment": "This block is defining an output wire with width 4 (bits from 3 to 0 inclusive) named 'wr_data_buf_addr'. In Verilog, wires represent connections between hardware elements and here it's likely used to convey an address to a write data buffer. This implementation might be part of a memory write, data input, or buffer management subsystem."
