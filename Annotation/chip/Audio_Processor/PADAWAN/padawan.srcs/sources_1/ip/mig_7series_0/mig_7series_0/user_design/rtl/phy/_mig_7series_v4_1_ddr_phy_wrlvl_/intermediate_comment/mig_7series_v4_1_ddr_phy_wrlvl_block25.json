    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for adjusting write leveling (wl) and coarse tuning for memory applications. It functions by either initializing the tap count and coarse tuning count when a reset is asserted or updating these counts based on the state of the write leveling state machine. Particularly, the code contains several for-loops to process multiple ranks and DQS widths during reset, and it separates conditions for different states of a write leveling operation. Additionally, it includes a fast calibration option for the write leveling DQS check state, which allows for speedier tuning."
