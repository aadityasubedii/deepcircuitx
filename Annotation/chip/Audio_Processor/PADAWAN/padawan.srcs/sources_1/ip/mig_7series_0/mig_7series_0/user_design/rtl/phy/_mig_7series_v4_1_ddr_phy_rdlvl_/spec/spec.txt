Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_rdlvl. Module specification: This module implements a read leveling calibration algorithm for DDR memory interfaces. It adjusts the timing of read data capture to ensure proper alignment with the memory clock. The module takes inputs such as clock, reset, calibration start triggers, and read data, and outputs status signals, delay control signals, and calibration results. Key internal signals include counters for tracking calibration progress, flags for edge detection and pattern matching, and shift registers for storing read data. The module operates through several states, including initializing delays, detecting data patterns, finding valid edges of the data eye, and centering the read capture point. It supports multiple ranks and handles both DDR3 and DDR4 memory types. The calibration process involves incrementing delays, detecting data patterns, finding valid eye regions, and centering the read capture point within
