    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code uses conditional constructs and loop structures to control outputs related to Output Off-Chip Driver (ODT) and Clock Enable (CKE) signals. Specifically, when CKE_ODT_AUX is \"FALSE\", the code modifies the ODT and CKE signals based on the number of memory ranks. It assigns the output value based on computed indices from the ODT and CKE mapping arrays. The structures for ODT and CKE follow similar patterns, the key difference being the signal they handle. Memory control signals like ODT and CKE may be uniformly distributed or based on particular pins through the generated mux_odt_remap and mux_cke_remap arrays, which is controlled by checking the USE_ODT_PORT condition. Out_odt and out_cke are then assigned based on computed indices and the remapped arrays."
