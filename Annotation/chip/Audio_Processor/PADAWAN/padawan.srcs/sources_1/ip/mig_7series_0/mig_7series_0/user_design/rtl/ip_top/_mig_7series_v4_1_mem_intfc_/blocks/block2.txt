This block of code is a decoder handling two slots, slot_0 and slot_1. The function of this block is to update slot_0_present_mc and slot_1_present_mc based on the values of slot_0_present and slot_1_present. The block has eight cases based on the concatenated value of four binary slot present values, each of which has different assignments for the two mc variables. For example, if the binary value is '1000' it sets slot_0_present_mc as '0000_0001' and 'slot_1_present_mc' as '0000_0000'. Other cases handle different binary entry values correspondingly.
