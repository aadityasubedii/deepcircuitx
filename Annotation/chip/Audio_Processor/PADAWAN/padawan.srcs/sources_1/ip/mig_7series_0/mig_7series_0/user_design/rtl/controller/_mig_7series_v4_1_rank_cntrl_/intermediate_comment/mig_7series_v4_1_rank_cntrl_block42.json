    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog primarily functions as a counter with reset and decrement capabilities. Under reset condition, it resets 'add_rrd_ns' to zero. Otherwise, if 'act_this_rank' is high, it loads 'add_rrd_ns' from the 'nRRD_CLKS' array. If none of these conditions are met and 'add_rrd_r' is non-zero, it decrements the 'add_rrd_ns' counter."
