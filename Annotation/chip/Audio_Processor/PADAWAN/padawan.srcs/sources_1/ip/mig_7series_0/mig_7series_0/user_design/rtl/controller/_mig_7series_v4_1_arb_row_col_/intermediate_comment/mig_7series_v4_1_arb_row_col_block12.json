    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of `sent_row_or_maint` to `cs_en1` and `send_cmd1_row` whenever `sent_row_or_maint` changes. The `always @` statement ensures that the assignments occur at every positive edge of the `sent_row_or_maint` signal. This implementation results in `cs_en1` and `send_cmd1_row` mirroring the value of `sent_row_or_maint` throughout operation."
