This block is responsible for managing the leveling process used in memory interfacing. It updates four key variables (rdlvl_stg1_start_r, mpr_rdlvl_done_r1, mpr_rdlvl_done_r2, mpr_rdlvl_start_r) by listening for rising edges in the clock (clk) signal. Using delay (#TCQ) after each posedge clk, the block ensures that variables are updated synchronously and orderly, providing the necessary control for the read leveling process.
