    "block_comment": "This block is primarily orchestrating memory initialization and pre-charge timings. If the power on routine has not been completed (`cnt_pwron_cke_done_r`), it resets the count and all other initialization flags. Once power on routine finishes, it increments a counter (`cnt_init_pre_wait_r`), and when a pre-determined threshold(`DDR2_INIT_PRE_CNT`) is reached, it signals that the pre-charge wait period is done (`cnt_init_pre_wait_done_r`). Timing control is enforced using `#TCQ` for each modification to the variables."
