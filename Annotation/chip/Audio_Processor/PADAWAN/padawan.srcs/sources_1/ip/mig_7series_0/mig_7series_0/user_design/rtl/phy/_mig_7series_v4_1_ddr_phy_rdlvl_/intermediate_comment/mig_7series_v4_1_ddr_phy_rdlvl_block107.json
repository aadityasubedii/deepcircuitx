    "block_comment": "This code block is responsible for updating the register values in a digital circuit triggered by a clock edge. Specifically, when the cal1_state_r is in CAL1_MPR_NEW_DQS_WAIT state, or when it's in the CAL1_MPR_PAT_DETECT state and idel_pat_detect_valid_r is set, the block copies the first bit of several mux_rd signals into the corresponding mpr_rd_prev signal. This operation is delayed by the TCQ time unit to mimic the circuit's propagation delay, thus ensuring the alignment of signals in the context of this digital system's operation."
