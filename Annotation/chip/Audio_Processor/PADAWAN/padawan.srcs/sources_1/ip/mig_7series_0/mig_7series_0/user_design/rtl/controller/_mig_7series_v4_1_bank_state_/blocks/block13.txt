Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for generating a coverage property to check if there are multiple demands raised simultaneously in a system with more than one bank machine. It creates a conditional monitor using a `generate` and`if` statement that gets activated when `nBANK_MACHS` is more than one. It then checks the condition at every positive edge of the `clk` clock signal using `@(posedge clk)`. The coverage property checks if the count of ones in the `demand_priority_in[`BM_SHARED_BV]` signal is greater than one, using the `$countones` function, indicating that there are multiple demands. This is especially useful for formal verification process of the optimal operation and interaction of multiple bank machines within the system.
