    "block_comment": "The provided block instantiates an output serial data register (OSERDESE2), used for interfacing with high-speed communication protocols. Configurable parameters are set for data rates, widths, initial and reset values, and the mode of operation. The instantiated OSERDESE2 'oserdes_dq_i' has input data taken from successive sections of the 'oserdes_dq' array, which are serialized and output through the oserdes_dq_buf[i] pin, following the clock 'oserdes_clk'. Preset tristate control signals are used to enable the block outputs."
