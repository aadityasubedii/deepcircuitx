    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the signal `idelay_inc` the value of `cal1_dq_idel_inc`. This is a simple assignment operation in Verilog Hardware Description Language that sets idelay_inc equal to cal1_dq_idel_inc, which is done in continuous time (real-time hardware assignment). The values of cal1_dq_idel_inc are propagated to idelay_inc as soon as they are changed, mimicking actual hardware behavior."
