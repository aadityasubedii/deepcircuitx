This block of code implements a synchronous counter decrement operation. It operates on a positive edge clock and resets to zero whenever there is a reset or delaydec_cnt_r's value drops to 0. If a delay command is initiated, delaydec_cnt_r is greater than 0, and wait_cnt_r is 1, the count decreases, otherwise, it remains at 0.
