    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the update of the 'wr_level_start_r' signal at the rising edge of the clock signal. Whenever a positive clock edge is detected, a delay specified by the '#TCQ' parameter is introduced before the 'wr_level_start_r' signal is updated to the value of 'wr_level_start'. This makes sure that any changes to the 'wr_level_start' signal does not immediately affect 'wr_level_start_r', providing a controlled environment for signal updates."
