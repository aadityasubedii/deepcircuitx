Comment: 
This Verilog block of code controls the generation of the module compute_act_demanded, contingent on the condition that `nBANK_MACHS` is more than 1. The construct `generate ... if ... begin` is a conditional generation of hardware. Only if the number of bank machines is greater than 1 will this additional computation module be instanced, in order to handle the demands of more complex interactions between the different bank machines. If `nBANK_MACHS` is not more than 1, the RTL compiler will not generate an instance of `compute_act_demanded`, saving resources.
