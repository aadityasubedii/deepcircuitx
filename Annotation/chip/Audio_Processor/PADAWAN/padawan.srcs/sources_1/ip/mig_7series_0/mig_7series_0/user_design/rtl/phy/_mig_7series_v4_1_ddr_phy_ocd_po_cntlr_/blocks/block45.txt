The block's function is to continuously assign the value of the wire 'ocd2stg3_inc_r' to the wire 'ocd2stg3_inc'. The implementation of this function is achieved using the assign keyword, which in Verilog RTL, is used to make continuous assignments. This means that anytime the value of the wire 'ocd2stg3_inc_r' changes, the change would immediately reflect on 'ocd2stg3_inc'. The direction of the assignment is from right to left.
