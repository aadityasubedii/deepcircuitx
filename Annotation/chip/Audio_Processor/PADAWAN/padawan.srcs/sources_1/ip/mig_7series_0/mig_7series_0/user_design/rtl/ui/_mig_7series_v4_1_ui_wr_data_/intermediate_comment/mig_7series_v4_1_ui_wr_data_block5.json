    "block_comment": "The above Verilog block is for executing the memory storage mechanism. It uses RAM32M elements in a loop to host the received data and retrieve the buffered data out. The total storage capacity is controlled by the predefined constant `RAM_CNT`. Higher the `RAM_CNT`, larger will be the buffering system size. Write and read addresses are referenced with the signals `rd_addr_w` and `wb_wr_data_addr_w` respectively, while their data transfer is handled by the signals `wr_buf_in_data` and `wr_buf_out_data_w`. The buffer is operational while the `wdf_rdy_ns` signal is high. This whole process is synchronized with the system clock signal `clk`."
