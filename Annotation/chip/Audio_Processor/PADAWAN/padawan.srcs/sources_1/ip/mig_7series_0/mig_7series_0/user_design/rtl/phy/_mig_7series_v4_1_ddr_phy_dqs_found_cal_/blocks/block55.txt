This block assigns the value of `ctl_lane_cnt` to `fine_adjust_lane_cnt`. In the context of this hardware design, this allows for dynamic adjustment of the `fine_adjust_lane_cnt` value based on the current `ctl_lane_cnt` value in real time. This assignment operation, being the essence of this block, aligns with the working behavior of the control logic, primarily straightforward and efficient.
