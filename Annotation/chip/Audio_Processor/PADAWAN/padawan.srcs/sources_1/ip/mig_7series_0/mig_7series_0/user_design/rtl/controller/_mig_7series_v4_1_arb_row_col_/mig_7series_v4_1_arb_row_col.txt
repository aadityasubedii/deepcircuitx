Module-level comment: 

// The 'mig_7series_v4_1_arb_row_col' module serves as a memory command scheduler for 7 series FPGA MIG designs, particularly handling the arbitration between column and row commands. It uses multiple input/output ports for request/control signals, internal signals for process controls and implements round-robin sequence via arbitration blocks for each type of request i.e., row, precharge, column, config. It also manages timing constraints, command sequence via delay mechanisms, and specific functionality based on address command mode and clock cycles per clock.
