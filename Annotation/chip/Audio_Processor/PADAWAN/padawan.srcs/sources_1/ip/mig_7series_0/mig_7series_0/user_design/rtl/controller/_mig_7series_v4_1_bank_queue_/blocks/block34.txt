Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is essentially handling the activation and deactivation control signals for a particular state of a hardware. It updates the next state of 'idle' state based on the values of 'accept_this_bm', 'clear_req', or the current 'idle' state. If 'accept_this_bm' is active, idle state transitions to an active state, represented by binary value '1'b0'. Conversely, if 'clear_req' is active, idle state gets cleared or deactivated, represented by binary value '1'b1'. If neither of these signals are active, the 'idle' state simply retains its previous state.
