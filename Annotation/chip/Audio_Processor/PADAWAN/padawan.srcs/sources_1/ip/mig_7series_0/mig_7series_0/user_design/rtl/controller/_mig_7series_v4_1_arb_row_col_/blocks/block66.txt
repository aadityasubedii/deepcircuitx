This block of code deals with the allocation of grant rows within a certain number of bank machines. More specifically, it declares a local wire array `grant_row_r_lcl` with a size equal to `nBANK_MACHS` subtracted by one. Further, it defines an output wire array `grant_row_r` of the same size as `grant_row_r_lcl`. A relationship between `grant_row_r` and `grant_row_r_lcl` is established via an assign statement. Lastly, a register `granted_row_r` is declared, probably to hold a row that's currently granted.
