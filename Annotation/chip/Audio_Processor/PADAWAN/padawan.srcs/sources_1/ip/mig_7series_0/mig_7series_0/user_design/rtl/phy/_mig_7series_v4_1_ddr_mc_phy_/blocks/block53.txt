Comment: 
This block of Verilog code generates clock signals for DDR modules. There exists a 'for' loop iterating over each DDR clock signal with variable 'i'. Each clock signal is based on the conditions specified within a 'case' structure, mapping different sequences of bits from the 'GENERATE_DDR_CK_MAP' to various segments of 'ddr_clk_w'. These segments are calculated using bitwise shifts and logical operations. For unrecognized clock specifications, the default case will execute a display statement specifying the error details.
