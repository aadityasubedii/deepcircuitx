Comment: 
This block updates several register states based on the rising edge of a clock signal. These registers appear to be associated with data matching operations at various stages ("early1_match"). The update operation is delayed by a time defined by #TCQ, indicating a Transfer Control Queue. Each 'rise' and 'fall' register is updated individually. The block concludes with the 'early1_data_match_r' register that sums up the states of the previous registers, effectively acting as a collective match status indicator.
