Comment: 
The block of Verilog code provides assignment operations for some variables. It assigns the values of `pi_phase_locked_r4`, `pi_dqs_found_r4`, and `pi_counter_read_val_r4` to `pi_phase_locked`, `pi_dqs_found`, and `pi_counter_read_val` respectively. These type of assignments are concurrent and will happen instantly whenever the right hand side value, e.g., `pi_phase_locked_r4` in the first line, changes.
