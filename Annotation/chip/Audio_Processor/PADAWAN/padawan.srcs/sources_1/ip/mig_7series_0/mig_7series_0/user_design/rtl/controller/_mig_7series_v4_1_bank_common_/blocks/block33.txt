This block of Verilog RTL code is used to calculate the total number of active bank machines. The code does this by initializing a counter called 'order_cnt' to zero and then iterating through all the bank machines denoted by 'nBANK_MACHS'. For each SDRAM bank machine that is ordered (indicated by 'ordered_r[i]' being true), 'order_cnt' is incremented by one.
