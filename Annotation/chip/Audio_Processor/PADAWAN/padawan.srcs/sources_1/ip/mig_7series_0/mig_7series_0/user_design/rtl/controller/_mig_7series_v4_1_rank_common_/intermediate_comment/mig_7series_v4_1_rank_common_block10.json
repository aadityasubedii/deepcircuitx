    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code implements a D-type flip-flop for the signal 'periodic_rd_ns' using a clock signal 'clk' to latch this input signal. The latched signal is then stored in 'periodic_rd_r_lcl'. The operation of this block occurs on the rising edge (posedge) of the 'clk' signal ensuring data is synchronously updated in 'periodic_rd_r_lcl' with a delay defined by '#TCQ'."
