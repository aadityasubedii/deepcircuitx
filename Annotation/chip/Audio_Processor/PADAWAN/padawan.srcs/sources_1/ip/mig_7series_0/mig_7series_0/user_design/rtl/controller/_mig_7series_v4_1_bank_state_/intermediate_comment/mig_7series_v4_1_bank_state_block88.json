    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for a state transition in a Finite State Machine (FSM) working on the rising edge of a given clock cycle. The `always @(posedge clk)` signifies that this operation will take place at the positive edge (rising edge) of the clock. `act_wait_r_lcl` is assigned to the value of `act_wait_ns` after a certain delay defined by `#TCQ`. This delay is generally used to model the timing properties of a real flip-flop. This block is typically implemented in clocked sequential modules that rely on state transitions."
