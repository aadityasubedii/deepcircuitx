Comment: 
This block of code handles the update of the `req_priority_r` variable upon a positive edge of the `clk` signal. The operation uses a non-blocking assignment (`<=`), implying that the change in the `req_priority_r` variable's state will take effect at the end of the current simulation time unit, which is defined by the delay '#TCQ'. The source for the new value is another variable `req_priority_ns`, which is likely calculated elsewhere in the code.
