This block is used for managing memory initialization states based on a clock signal. It resets two counter registers (cnt_init_mr_r and cnt_init_mr_done_r) whenever the system is in idle or during a refresh operation when memory initialization is not done. When the system is in the INIT_LOAD_MR state, it increments cnt_init_mr_r while the second counter (cnt_init_mr_done_r) is set when cnt_init_mr_r matches with INIT_CNT_MR_DONE. It ensures memory registers are correctly initialized and updated based on different operational states.
