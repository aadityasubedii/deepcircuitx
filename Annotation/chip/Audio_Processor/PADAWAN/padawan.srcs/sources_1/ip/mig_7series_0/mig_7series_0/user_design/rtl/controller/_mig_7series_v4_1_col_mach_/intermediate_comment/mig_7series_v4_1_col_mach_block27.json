    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code handles the writing process in a synchronous sequential logic circuit. On every positive edge of the clock signal, the write data buffer address is updated with a delay equivalent to Timing Control Queue (TCQ). The updated address is then assigned to 'wr_data_addr', defining the location where the next data will be written in the memory."
