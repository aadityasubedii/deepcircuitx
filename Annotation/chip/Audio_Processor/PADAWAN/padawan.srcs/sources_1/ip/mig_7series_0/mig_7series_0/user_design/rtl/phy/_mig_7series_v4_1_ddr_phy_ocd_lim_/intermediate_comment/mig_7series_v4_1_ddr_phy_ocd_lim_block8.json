    "block_comment": "This code block controls a state machine for a certain process. At each positive clock edge, the process checks if a reset signal is high, and if so, resets its state and its multiple cache registers to their default states. Otherwise, it saves the state of the various inputs into their respective registers, effectively caching them for the next clock cycle. It also performs a few arithmetic operations to compute 'stg3_dec_val' and 'stg3_inc_val' based on 'wl_po_fine_cnt' and 'stg3_init_val'. If 'stg3_init_val' is within a certain range, 'stg3_dec_val' and 'stg3_inc_val' are accordingly adjusted. If not, they are set to predefined limits."
