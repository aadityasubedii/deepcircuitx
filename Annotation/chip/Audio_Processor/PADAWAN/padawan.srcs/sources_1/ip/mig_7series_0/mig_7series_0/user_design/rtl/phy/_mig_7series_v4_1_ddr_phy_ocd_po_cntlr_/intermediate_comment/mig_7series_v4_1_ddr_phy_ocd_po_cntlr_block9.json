    "block_comment": "The Verilog code block is a simple flip-flop with a delay. The block is designed to capture and hold the value of 'dec_po_ns' at the positive edge (rising edge) of the clock cycle (clk). The held value (dec_po_r) is then delayed by a certain time period defined by the time constant 'TCQ'. This process is primarily used in synchronizing operations or implementing delay in signal operations within digital systems."
