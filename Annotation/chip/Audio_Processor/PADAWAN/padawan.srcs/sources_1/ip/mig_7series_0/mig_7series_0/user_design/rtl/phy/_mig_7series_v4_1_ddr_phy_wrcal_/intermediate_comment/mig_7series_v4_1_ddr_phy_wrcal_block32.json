    "block_comment": "This block simply initializes eight single-bit arrays -- four as a rising pattern and four as a falling pattern. Essentially, `pat_riseX` variables are set to high and `pat_fallX` variables to low. This allows the system to process time-dependent signals and keep track of their changes in future operations."
