    "block_comment": "The block initiates and updates debug control signals. When the reset signal is active, the block resets four debug control signals to zero. In another case, when there isn't an active reset signal, the block updates each control signal with the current values coming from different parts of the design. The operations are performed on the rising edge of the clock making the block synchronous."
