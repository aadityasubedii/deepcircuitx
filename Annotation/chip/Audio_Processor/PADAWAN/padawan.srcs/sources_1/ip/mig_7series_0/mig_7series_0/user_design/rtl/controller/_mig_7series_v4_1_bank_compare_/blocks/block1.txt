The given block of code creates a synchronously updateable storage element for the 'rank_busy_ns' signal, using the rising edges of the 'clk' clock signal. This is accomplished by using the 'always @' syntax to monitor changes in the 'clk' signal, and the non-blocking (<=) assignment operator to update the 'rank_busy_r' register with a delay defined by TCQ after a positive edge of the 'clk' signal is detected.
