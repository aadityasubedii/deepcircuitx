The purpose of this module is to control the queue operations associated with the bank machines in the memory controller. It manages the flow of read and write requests to memory. This includes handling idle signals, passing open bank requests, maintaining hit registers, handling auto precharge, managing the active request queue of different banks, managing read/write requests for the memory, along with various auxiliary operations. Critical operations are handled at every clock cycle while monitoring for reset signals. The actual operation varies based on the parameter configurations provided while invoking the module."
