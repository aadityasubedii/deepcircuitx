    "block_comment": "This code implements a counter, specifically, a countdown mechanism that resets on a specific condition. As per the implementation, on the positive edge of the clock cycle, if the reset (rst) condition is true or pi_cnt_dec is true, the countdown (wait_cnt_r) is reset to 8 (or 'd8 in Verilog). However, if those conditions are not met, and if dqs_po_dec_done_r2 is true and the countdown is more than 0, the countdown is decremented by one."
