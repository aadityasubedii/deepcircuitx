    "block_comment": "The block of code is a register-level Read Leveling (rdlvl) mechanism that is triggered on an upward clock edge for memory applications. The block resets control signals when a reset condition is active or when the first stage of read leveling for the current rank is done. In the absence of these conditions, the block sets several control signals, `rdlvl_stg1_start_int`, `rdlvl_start_pre`, and `prbs_rdlvl_start` based on various operational statuses such as completion of command count, status of DQS signal, read leveling stage, and write leveling stage indicators. It employs hardware delays and handles multiple states (`INIT_RDLVL_ACT_WAIT`, `INIT_RDLVL_STG1_READ`, `INIT_RDLVL_COMPLEX_PI_WAIT`) of initialization."
