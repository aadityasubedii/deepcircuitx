    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements write leveling for DDR memory interfaces by adjusting DQS signal timing. It uses a state machine to incrementally adjust fine and coarse delay taps, detecting data edges to determine optimal timing. The module supports multiple ranks, performs initial calibration and fine-tuning, and includes error handling. It processes input signals, manages internal counters and flags, and outputs control signals and debug information for write leveling operations."
