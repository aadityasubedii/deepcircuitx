    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for determining the write data for a status RAM. The write data is dependent on whether RAM initialization has completed. If the RAM initialization (`ram_init_done_r_lcl`) is done, the write data is generated based on the `rd_data_end` and a negated decision between `wr_status_r1` and `wr_status[0]`, controlled by `rd_data_offset`. If the RAM initialization isn't done, the `status_ram_wr_data_ns` wire leads to a default '0' value. This data is stored in a 2-bit register, `status_ram_wr_data_r`.\n"
