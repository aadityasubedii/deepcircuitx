    "block_comment": "This block of code calculates the count of present bits. The block utilizes an iterative approach to achieve this goal where, for each bit in an 8-bit input vector 'present', its value is added to the 'present_count'. The operation is initialized with a count of 'RANK_WIDTH' zeroes and iterates eight times for each bit in 'present'. The count of '1's is then stored in 'present_count'. This is executed every time there is a change in 'present'. Each iteration ensures addition operation with higher precedence over bit concatenation."
