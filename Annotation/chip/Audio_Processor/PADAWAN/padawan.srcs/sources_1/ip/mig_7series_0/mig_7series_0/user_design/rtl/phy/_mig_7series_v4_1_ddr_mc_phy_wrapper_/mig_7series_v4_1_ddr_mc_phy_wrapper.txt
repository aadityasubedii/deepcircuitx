Module-level comment: This module implements a DDR memory controller PHY wrapper for 7 Series FPGAs. It manages the physical interface between the memory controller and DDR memory devices, handling data, address, command, and control signals. The module uses IOBUFs and IODELAYs for signal management, implements data alignment and timing adjustments, and supports various DDR memory types and configurations. It includes functionality for input/output buffering, per-bit deskew, write leveling, and read calibration to ensure proper signal integrity and timing across the memory interface.
