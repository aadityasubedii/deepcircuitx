Comment: 
This block of code manages the Write Leveling On-Die Termination (ODT) control signal in memory operations. It's triggered at the positive edge of the clock signal. Initially, the `wrlvl_odt_ctl` is reset either with a high-level on the `rst` signal or when there's a transition from any state other than `INIT_WRLVL_START` to `INIT_WRLVL_START` in the initialization state. This block also sets the `wrlvl_odt_ctl` signal to 1, after a clock cycle, when the `wrlvl_rank_done` is done but has not been done previously as indicated by `wrlvl_rank_done_r1`.
