Comment: 
This block initiates a calibration start for the complex clock delay system. It is activated with a positive edge of the clock signal and can be reset using the reset signal. When reset, it asserts the `complex_oclkdelay_calib_start_int` signal low. Alternatively, if the system is in the `INIT_RDLVL_COMPLEX_PRECHARGE_PREWAIT` state and the last byte of a pseudo-random binary sequence has been processed (`prbs_last_byte_done_r`), it asserts the `complex_oclkdelay_calib_start_int` signal high. The time constant quality (TCQ) provides a delay in assigning these signal levels.
