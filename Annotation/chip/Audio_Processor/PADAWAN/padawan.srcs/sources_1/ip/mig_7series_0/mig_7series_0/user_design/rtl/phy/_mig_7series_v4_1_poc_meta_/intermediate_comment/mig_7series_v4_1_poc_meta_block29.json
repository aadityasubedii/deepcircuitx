    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog represents a 2-bit output array and an assignment operation. The output is named \"run_ends\". The \"assign\" command directly assigns the value from \"run_ends_r\" to \"run_ends\". This could imply that \"run_ends_r\" is a register storing the end status of certain operations. So, during the execution of the RTL, this block routes the stored value of 'run_ends_r' to the output 'run_ends' with a 2-bit aspect."
