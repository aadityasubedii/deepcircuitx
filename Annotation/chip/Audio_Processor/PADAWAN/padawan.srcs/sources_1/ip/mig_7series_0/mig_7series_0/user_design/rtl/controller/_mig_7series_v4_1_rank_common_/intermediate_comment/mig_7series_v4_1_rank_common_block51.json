    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for the generation of ZQ calibration requests for DDR3 DRAM type. Initially, the boolean wire 'zq_clears_zq_request' is assigned, indicating whether a maintenance request is issued when running on a local ZQ calibration schedule. In the following, the ZQ request logic monitors several conditions to generate a ZQ calibration request. This includes cases when the initialization is incomplete and the ZQ timer is non-zero, or when a ZQ tick signal is present, and even when there is ZQ request from application after the initialization is complete. The logic of ZQ request is also sensitive to reset signal. The code block uses efficient boolean logic representation to implement the ZQ request logic."
