    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for synchronization of the 'calib_complete' signal with the system clock. At the rising edge of the system clock ('clk'), this block updates the value of 'calib_complete_r' with the value of 'calib_complete', the updating process employs a delay defined by 'TCQ'. This ensures the synchronization of 'calib_complete' with the system clock."
