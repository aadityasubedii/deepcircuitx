Comment: 
This block represents a synchronous sequential circuit that handles the `dqs_found_done_r` signal. When rising edges of the `clk` are detected, the logic inside the block is executed. If a reset (`rst`) signal is given, the `dqs_found_done_r` is set to 0 after a delay of `TCQ`. If the reset signal isn't detected but all banks have determined DQS (Data Strobe) as indicated by `pi_dqs_found_all_bank`, the rank count `rnk_cnt_r` matches the total ranks minus one, the flag `init_dqsfound_done_r1` is true, and the `fine_adj_state_r` equals `FINE_ADJ_DONE`, `dqs_found_done_r` is again set to 1 after `TCQ` delay. In all other cases, `dqs_found_done_r` resets to 0 post `TCQ` delay.
