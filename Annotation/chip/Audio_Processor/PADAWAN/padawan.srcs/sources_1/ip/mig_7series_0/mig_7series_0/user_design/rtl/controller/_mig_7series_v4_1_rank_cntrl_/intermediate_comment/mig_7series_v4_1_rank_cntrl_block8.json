    "block_comment": "This block of code is a register for holding the `read_this_rank` state value, updated each rising clock edge. This clocked process takes the value from `read_this_rank` and assigns it to `read_this_rank_r` after a delay specified by `#TCQ`. This delay indicates a wait operation to mimic the operation pipeline and transfer characteristics."
