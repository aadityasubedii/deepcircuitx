    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the updating of 'cmd2' and 'cmd3' commands based on certain flagged conditions. Initially, 'cmd2' and 'cmd3' are filled with 1s to their full width, acting as reset. If 'send_cmd2_row', 'send_cmd2_col', or 'send_cmd2_pre' flags are set, the value of 'cmd2' is updated to 'row_cmd_ns', 'col_cmd_ns', or 'pre_cmd_ns' respectively. Similarly in case of 'send_cmd3_col' flag, 'cmd3' is updated with 'col_cmd_ns'. The commands are updated only when changes are detected in any of the conditional signal, facilitating an efficient event-driven design."
