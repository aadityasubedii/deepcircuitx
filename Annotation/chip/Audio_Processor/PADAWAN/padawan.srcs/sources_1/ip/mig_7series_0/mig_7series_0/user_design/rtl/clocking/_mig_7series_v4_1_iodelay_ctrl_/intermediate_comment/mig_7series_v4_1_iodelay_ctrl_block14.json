    "block_comment": "This line of code is used for assigning system reset signal. It involves the assignment operation for signal 'sys_rst_i', which gets its value directly from 'sys_rst'. The 'assign' keyword in Verilog is used for continuous assignment statements and this is typically used for designating values to wires. Here, it's used to assign the input system reset signal to the internal signal 'sys_rst_i'."
