Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_bank_compare.
Module specification: 

The mig_7series_v4_1_bank_compare is a module responsible primarily for managing memory operations by comparing banks in a memory system. The module allows configuration through input parameters such as BANK_WIDTH, BURST_MODE, COL_WIDTH, ECC, RANK_WIDTH, RANKS, and ROW_WIDTH. 

Input ports like clk, idle_ns, idle_r, data_buf_addr, periodic_rd_insert, size, cmd, sending_col, rank, periodic_rd_rank_r among others govern the operations associated with memory management and act as control and data input for the module. It uses these signals to determine what memory operation to carry out, based on the specific comparisons between different elements such as bank, row, column, rank, and specific command operations.

Output ports such as req_data_buf_addr_r, req_periodic_rd_r, req_size_r, rd_wr_r, req_rank_r, req_bank_r, req_row_r, req_wr_r, req_priority_r allow the module to produce signals for use in managing memory operations. They convey information about the memory operation specifics such as the buffer address, the requested operation's size, read/write operation, request rank, bank, row, and priority of request among others.

Internally, the module utilizes signals like req_data_buf_addr_ns, req_periodic_rd_ns, req_size_r_lcl, req_cmd_ns, rd_wr_ns, req_rank_ns, req_bank_ns, req_row_ns, req_col_ns, req_wr_ns, req_priority_ns, rank_hit, bank_hit, rank_bank_hit, rb_hit_busy_ns_lcl, row_hit_ns, col_addr_template, rank_busy_ns. These signals manage state transitions and memory access manipulation.

The code is arranged in several blocks fulfilling different functionalities ranging from setup, bank comparison, command execution, memory operation requests, row control, and rank busyness among other tasks. Each subsection of the code efficiently contributes to the overall module functionality of managing memory operations.
