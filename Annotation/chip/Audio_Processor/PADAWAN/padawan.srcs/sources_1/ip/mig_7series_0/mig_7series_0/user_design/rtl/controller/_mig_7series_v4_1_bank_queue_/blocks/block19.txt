Comment: 
This block of code is a flip-flop that samples the state of `pre_passing_open_bank_ns` at each rising edge of the clock signal `clk` after a delay specified by `#TCQ`. The sampled value is then assigned to `pre_passing_open_bank_r`. This flip-flop is used to synchronize `pre_passing_open_bank_ns` with the system clock, thus helping to prevent metastability and the propagation of glitches. The delay `#TCQ` is used to model the "time required for changes at the control input C to affect the outputs Q."
