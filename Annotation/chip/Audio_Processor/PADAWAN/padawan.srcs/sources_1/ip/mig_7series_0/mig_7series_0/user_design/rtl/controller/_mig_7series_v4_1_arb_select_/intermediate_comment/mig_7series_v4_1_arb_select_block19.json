    "block_comment": "This Verilog logic block is used to assign a specific value to the mc_cs_n[] array based on certain conditions. The array elements from 2*CS_WIDTH*nCS_PER_RANK -1 to CS_WIDTH*nCS_PER_RANK are updated. The implemented logic involves bitwise operations on variables cs_one_hot, nCS_PER_RANK, ra1, and cs_en1. Specifically, cs_one_hot is left shifted by the product of nCS_PER_RANK and ra1, and the negation of this result is used in a bitwise OR operation with the negation of cs_en1 repeated CS_WIDTH*nCS_PER_RANK times. The outcome of this operation becomes the new value for the selected mc_cs_n[] elements."
