This block performs the function of a counter and inverse sample control for a digital logic system. Initially, both 'qcntr_ns' and 'inv_poc_sample_ns' values are assigned to their respective registered versions. When a reset signal 'rstdiv0' is active, the counter 'qcntr_ns' and inverse logic 'inv_poc_sample_ns' are reset to 0. If the reset is not active, but a trigger 'psen' is active, the block checks the counter count. If the 'qcntr_r' is less than a threshold, the counter is incremented. Otherwise, the counter is reset, and the inverse of the previous output sample is produced.
