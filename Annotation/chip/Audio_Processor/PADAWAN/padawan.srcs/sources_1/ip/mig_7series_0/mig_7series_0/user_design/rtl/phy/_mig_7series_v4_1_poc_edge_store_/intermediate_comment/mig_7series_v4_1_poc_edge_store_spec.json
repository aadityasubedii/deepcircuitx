    "spec": "Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_poc_edge_store. \n\nModule specification: The mig_7series_v4_1_poc_edge_store is a module designed for handling edge triggering behavior in synchronous digital systems. Part of a memory interface generator (MIG) feature-set, it works towards generating refined outputs needed for precise operational timings in potentially 7-series FPGA units. The primary functionality of the module circulates generating four outputs viz. fall_lead, fall_trail, rise_lead, rise_trail based on provided inputs after performing internal calculations with a delay of TCQ.\n\nThe module calls for several input ports; clk, run_polarity, run_end, select0, select1, tap, and run. The clk is the clock signal dictating the timings of all operations inside the module. run_polarity determines if the module needs to work on rising edge or falling edge while run_end indicates the end of the \"run\" phase. select0 and select1 are select inputs for an internal mux/demux operation and tap, run are signals related to Delay or Phase-Locked Loops (DLL/PLL) operation and enabling the operational functions respectively.\n\nThe output ports include fall_lead, fall_trail, rise_lead, rise_trail intimating the exact triggering times for other subsequent modules or processes to ensure the proper working of memory interface generators.\n\nThe internal signals include trailing_edge, run_end_this, fall_lead_r, fall_trail_r, rise_lead_r, rise_trail_r, fall_lead_ns, rise_trail_ns, rise_lead_ns, and fall_trail_ns. trailing_edge is employed for calculating the difference between the run and tap input signals and run_end_this, a boolean signal is used as a condition for the logic. The signals xxx_r hold the previous state values of the signals and the signals xxx_ns hold the next state signals computed based on the present state signals.\n\nThe code is appropriately divided into: Initial setup of the parameters and defining inputs/outputs, Calculation portion for trailing_edge and run_end_this signals, Register storage sequence of the xxx_r signals, Next state computation of xxx_ns signals, and Lastly, a section which delegates the clocks edge actions ensuring a delay of TCQ. Each block contributes to the overall operation by refining the inputs and through internal processing to generate the required outputs.",

The main functionality of this module is to generate four outputs fall_lead, fall_trail, rise_lead, rise_trail based on the provided inputs and internal calculations with a delay of TCQ. Given variables like run_polarity, run_end, and the nature of these outputs, it seems to be managing edge triggering behavior in a synchronous digital system. Furthermore, with parameters like TAPCNTRWIDTH and TAPSPERKCLK, it seems to have some relevance to delay-locked loops (DLLs) or phase-locked loops (PLLs) which are used for clock data recovery and synchronization purposes."
