Comment: 
The given block of Verilog code is directing the handling of the digital input (phy_din) based upon two conditional situations. If the PRESENT_DATA_B flag is true, the block performs lane remapping of 80-bit data slices (phy_din_remap[159:80]) onto selected lanes of the digital input (phy_din) based on the values of LANE_REMAP[5:4]. Conversely, if PRESENT_DATA_B is false but the HIGHEST_LANE value is more than 1, 80-bit zero blocks are assigned to the digitally inputted lanes, again, dependent on LANE_REMAP[5:4].
