Comment: 
This block acts as an operational counter ('op_cnt') in a finite state machine controlling a process in a Verilog HDL. The counter, denoted as 'op_cnt_r', is a register with a configurable width of 'OP_WIDTH', ticking down every clock tick while conditions are met. The next state of the operational counter ('op_cnt_ns') is dependent on certain conditions: resetting to zero if there's a passing open bank, operation exit grant, or a reset signal; it sets to a predefined wait state upon an end signal ('end_rtp_lcl'), and otherwise, it decreases by one unless it's already zero.
