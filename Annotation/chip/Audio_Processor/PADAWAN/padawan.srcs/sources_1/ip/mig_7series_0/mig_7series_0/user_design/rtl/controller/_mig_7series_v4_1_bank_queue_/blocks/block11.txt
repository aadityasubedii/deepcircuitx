This block is used to handle the resetting of a system with multiple bank machines in a multi-machine environment. It does this by generating a clear vector that is dependent on the system reset signal and whether each separate bank machine has reached its end phase or not. If the number of bank machines is more than one, the block creates a non-blocking assignment to the next state of "rb_hit_busies", which takes into account whether the current state is idle and thus assigns the incoming new state value or falls back to the registered latch value.
