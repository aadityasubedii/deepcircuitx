    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code dynamically generates the reference clock signal based on the FPGA speed grade and whether the MMCM I/O delay control feature is enabled. If REF_CLK_MMCM_IODELAY_CTRL is set to TRUE, the clock generator conditionally outputs different speeds for the reference clock. Two clock speeds (300 and 400) are obtained from clk_ref_mmcm_300 or clk_ref_mmcm_400, respectively, based on FPGA speed grade (1 or 2/3). The selected clock speed is driven out via clk_ref[1] using a BUFG buffer."
