    "block_comment": "This block of code is a clock-triggered event in the circuit design. It's an active on the positive edge of the clock signal. It uses a delay model to set the signal 'cnt_cmd_done_m7_r' to high when the condition 'cnt_cmd_r' equals 'CNTNEXT_CMD - 7' is met. This signal could be used as a flag to indicate a specific instruction done in the corresponding clock cycle."
