    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for updating three state variables - 'po_stg2_wrcal_cnt', 'wrlvl_byte_done_r', and 'wrcal_sanity_chk_r' - based on the rising edge of the clock signal. The delay is determined by #TCQ time units before updating these variables. The code adopts the so-called posedge triggering method, which is common in digital circuits to synchronize operations and avoid race conditions."
