    "block_comment": "This block of code initiates a generate construct conditionally if nCK_PER_CLK is equal to 4. The conditional generate construct in Verilog, invoked using if-generate, enables a block of code (namely mpr_4to1 in this case) to be instantiated based on the Boolean condition provided (here, whether nCK_PER_CLK equals 4). If the condition evaluates to true, it instantiates the code block within the if-generate construct."
