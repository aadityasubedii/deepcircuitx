    "block_comment": "The block of code is an instantiation of a XADC (Xilinx Analog to Digital Converter) module. The XADC module provides high performance, low power, monolithic, analog to digital conversion and digital to analog conversion as well as other additional auxiliary functions. In this instance, most of the inputs are tied to ground (`'b0`) and only `xadc_do`, `xadc_drdy`, `xadc_clk`, `xadc_den` are connected to actual signals, which make it function as a simple continuous analog to digital converter. The output data (`xadc_do`) is ready to be read when the data ready signal (`xadc_drdy`) is high. Here `xadc_clk` and `xadc_den` are used as the clock and data-enable signal for the conversion process."
