    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for generating delay elements based on the DQS_WIDTH. The generation is done through a loop defined in a generate block that iterates from 0 to DQS_WIDTH-1. On every positive edge of the clock signal, the loop body, tagged as gen_dlyce_dq, is executed, specifying a synchronous operation."
