Specifically, the module is designed to correctly set the timing delays for the Read and Write leveling operations. In the context of DDR memory, Read and Write leveling is the process of synchronizing the DQS (data strobe) signal across all the data lanes to ensure data integrity. The module uses various parameters like DQS Count Width, Clock Period, and the Initial Delay to calculate the Off Delay for Write Leveling and subsequently control the operations. The module also provides multiple output signals including those indicating the completion of the delay calculation and if the physical controller is ready. It also provides control signals for incrementing/ decreasing the second phase output delays and enabling/ disabling them."
