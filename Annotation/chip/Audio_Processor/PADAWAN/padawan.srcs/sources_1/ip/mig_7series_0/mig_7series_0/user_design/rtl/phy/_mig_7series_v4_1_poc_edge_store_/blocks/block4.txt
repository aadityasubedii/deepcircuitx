The block is a sequential logic that captures the falling edge signal. This implementation makes effective use of the non-blocking assignment to adhere to the clock (clk) 'posedge' (positive edge). After a delay specified by TCQ, it assigns the current value of 'fall_lead_ns' to 'fall_lead_r' synchronously with the rising edge of the clock signal.
