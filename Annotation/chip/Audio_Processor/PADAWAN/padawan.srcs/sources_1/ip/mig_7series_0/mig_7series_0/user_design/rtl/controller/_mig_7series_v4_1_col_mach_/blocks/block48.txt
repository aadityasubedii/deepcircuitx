This block of code is handling the offset management in a system. When the reset (rst) signal is activated, it sets the offset state (offset_ns) to zero. Otherwise, it initially sets offset_ns as the previous offset state (offset_r). Then, if a column has been sent (sent_col), the offset_ns is set to one. If the bitwise OR of offset_r is true and offset_r is not equal to col_size concatenated with 1'b1, then offset_ns is increment by 1. In the other cases, offset_ns is set back to zero.
