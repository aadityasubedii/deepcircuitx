This block of code allocates debugging information related to a memory system's physical read level (phy_rdlvl) to specific bit sections of the 'dbg_phy_rdlvl' signal. The implementation uses assign statements to map various system stats such as edge taps, count capture timing, delay checks, pattern data match checks, and multiple read rise and fall indications onto the signal. This layout allows for an efficient method to debug and optimize the memory system's reading procedure, by having key performance indicators easily accessible within the 'dbg_phy_rdlvl' signal.
