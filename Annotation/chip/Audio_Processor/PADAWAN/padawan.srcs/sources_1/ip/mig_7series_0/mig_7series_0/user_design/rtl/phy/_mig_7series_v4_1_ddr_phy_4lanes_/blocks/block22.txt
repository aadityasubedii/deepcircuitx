The block of code is handling data assignments based on the condition of `PRESENT_DATA_B`. If `PRESENT_DATA_B` is true, the assignments for `B_of_data_full`, `B_of_ctl_full`, `B_of_data_a_full`, `B_of_ctl_a_full`, and `B_pre_data_a_full` are set with respective variables, most notably `B_of_full` and `B_of_a_full`. Otherwise, a different set of assignments occur, where these variables are instead set to 0 or tailored to `B_of_full` and `B_of_a_full`. In essence, this block is part of a conditional module that toggles between two settings of system controls based on the `PRESENT_DATA_B` flag.
