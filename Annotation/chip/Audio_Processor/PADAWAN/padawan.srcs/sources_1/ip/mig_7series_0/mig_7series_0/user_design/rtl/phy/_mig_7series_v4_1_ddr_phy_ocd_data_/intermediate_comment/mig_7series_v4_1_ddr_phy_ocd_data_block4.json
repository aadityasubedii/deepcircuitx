    "block_comment": "This block is a register update for the 'second_half_r' on the rising edge of the 'clk'. The operation is implemented using an always block, triggered at the positive (rising) edge of the clock signal ('clk'). When the clock rises, the 'second_half_r' register is updated with the value of 'second_half_ns' after a delay specified by 'TCQ'. This mechanism means the value of 'second_half_r' will always represent a slightly outdated/previous version of 'second_half_ns', updated every clock cycle."
