Comment: 
The block is conditionally generated, and its function is to skip the calibration process. When the 'SKIP_CALIB' parameter has a value of "TRUE", this block is instantiated. The implementation details of this block, however, are not provided in this given portion of the code. It is implied though that within this block, the mechanisms for bypassing the calibration process are defined. Please refer to the entire section labeled 'gen_skip_calib_tap' for comprehensive implementation details.
