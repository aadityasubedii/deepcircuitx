This block of code initiates a conditional check in Verilog. The function of this block is to implement an 'if' condition control structure that verifies two specific conditions: if the number of slots is equal to 1 and the number of ranks is less than 2. This is used for managing memory allocation or process distribution scenarios where the configurations of slots and ranks must meet certain criteria. The execution of the code within this 'if' condition only occurs when both conditions hold true simultaneously. This represents an efficient way of coordinating system resources in a specific hardware design.
