    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for the generation of a write address in the case when Error Checking and Correcting (ECC) functionality is not activated or the Cache Write Latency (CWL) is greater than or equal to zero. The implemented mechanism relies on monitoring changes in the 'wr_data_offset' signal, and then replicating those changes to the 'wr_data_offset_r' signal. This allows the system to convey the latest write address to subsequent logic blocks when ECC is off or when there is a delay in the write phase of the cache operation."
