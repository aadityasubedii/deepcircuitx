Comment: 
This block of code controls a synchronous reset phaser. Once the clock (clk_bufg) or the temporary reset signal (rst_tmp_phaser_ref) is on the rising edge, the synchronous reset phaser (rst_phaser_ref_sync_r) is triggered. If the temporary reset signal (rst_tmp_phaser_ref) is high, the phaser is reset with the division synchronization value (RST_DIV_SYNC_NUM). On the contrary, if the temporary reset signal is not active, the synchronous reset phaser shifts its current state to the right.
