    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code creates an address counter for a data buffer. It does this by generating a register called `data_buf_addr_cnt_ns` with a 4-bit width, allowing it to count from 0 to 15. The `generate` and `begin` keywords are used to create this block, and `data_buf_address_counter` serves as a label for the block's scope. The design of the counter indicates that it might be linked to a data buffer with a size of 16 (2^4), operating to index the buffer cells."
