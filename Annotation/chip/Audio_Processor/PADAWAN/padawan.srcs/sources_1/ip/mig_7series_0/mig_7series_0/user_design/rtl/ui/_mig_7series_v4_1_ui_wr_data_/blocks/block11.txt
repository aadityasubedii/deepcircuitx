Comment: 
The block of code defines a local parameter named `PNTR_RAM_CNT` with a value of 2. This is typically used in Verilog to declare constants, in this case, signaling the number of pointer or control RAM (Random Access Memory) units operating within a system. Its value could influence system operations like computations or flow control, based on its context in the overall code.
