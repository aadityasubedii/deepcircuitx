This block of code is used to assign the value of 'grant_col_r_lcl' to 'grant_col_r'. This operation is performed by the 'assign' statement in Verilog code, which continuously assigns the value of one variable to another. Whenever the value of 'grant_col_r_lcl' changes, 'grant_col_r' will automatically update with the new value. The two variables are expected to be of the same data type, and this assignment operation can be done asynchronously or synchronously depending upon the circuit's configuration it is used in.
