    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for controlling the sample count enable (samples_cnt2_en_r) signal based on various conditions. When the reset (rst) signal is high, samples_cnt2_en_r is disengaged. During normal operation, when the PRBS state machine is in one of various states (PRBS_IDLE, PRBS_DEC_DQS, PRBS_INC_DQS, FINE_PI_INC, PRBS_NEW_DQS_PREWAIT), samples_cnt2_en_r is also disengaged. It is engaged when the number of samples (samples_cnt_r) equals the predefined number (NUM_SAMPLES_CNT1), read valid signal (rd_valid_r1) is high and samples count 1 enable (samples_cnt1_en_r) is active."
