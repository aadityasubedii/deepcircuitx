This block of code implements a two-stage reset synchronization flip-flop circuit in a digital design. The flip-flop circuit synchronizes the asynchronous 'rst' signal to the 'xadc_clk' clock domain, thereby ensuring a glitch-free reset operation and minimizing potential issues that may arise due to metastability.
