    "block_comment": "This block is for assigning the value of 'edge_center_r' to 'edge_center'. This operation is done through the use of the 'assign' keyword in Verilog, which is used for continuous assignment. In this case, it is continuously driving the value of 'edge_center_r' to 'edge_center', which means that any change in 'edge_center_r' will make 'edge_center' reflect the new value immediately."
