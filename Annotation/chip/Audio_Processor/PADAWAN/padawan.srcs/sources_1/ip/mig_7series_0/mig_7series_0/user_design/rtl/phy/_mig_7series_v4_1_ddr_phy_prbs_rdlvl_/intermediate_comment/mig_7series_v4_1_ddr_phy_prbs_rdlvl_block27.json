    "block_comment": "The block of code is meant to generate parallel units based on the DRAM_WIDTH. It employs a generate-construct and \"for\" loop in Verilog code. Implementation-wise, it creates 'pb_r' instances of some digital circuit (not shown in this code) which is determined by the constant DRAM_WIDTH. This is achieved through a for-loop construct where 'pb_r' is simply the iterator starting from 0 and incrementing until DRAM_WIDTH. This block, therefore, produces a replicable hardware structure for the specified width of the DRAM."
