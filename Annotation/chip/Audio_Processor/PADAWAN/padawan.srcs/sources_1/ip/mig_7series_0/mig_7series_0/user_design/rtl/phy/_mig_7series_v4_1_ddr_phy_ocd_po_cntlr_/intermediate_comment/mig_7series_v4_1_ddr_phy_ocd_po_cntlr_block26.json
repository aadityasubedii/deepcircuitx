    "block_comment": "This block is a flip-flop that captures the next state of the `scanning_right` signal at the rising edge of the clock signal, `clk`. It uses non-blocking assignment to ensure correct operation, especially within sequential logic like this. The delay modeling `#TCQ` represents the time at which the assignment will take place. This enables the simulation of the propagation delay and mimics the behaviour of the real flip-flop."
