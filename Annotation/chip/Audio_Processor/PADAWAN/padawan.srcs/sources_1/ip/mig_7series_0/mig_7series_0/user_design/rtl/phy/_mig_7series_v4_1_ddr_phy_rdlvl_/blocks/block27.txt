Comment: 
This block of code generates synchronous resets for a DRAM module based on a clocking frequency specified by the parameter nCK_PER_CLK. If the clocking frequency is set to 4, the code executes a for loop which iterates over the entire width of the DRAM, marked by the variable 'z', incrementing by one with each cycle. At every positive edge of the clock signal, a synchronous reset is generated for the respective bit 'z'.
