Comment: 
The given block of Verilog code creates a wire named 'accept_req_lcl' that becomes high when either 'periodic_rd_ack_r_lcl' is high or both 'accept_r' and 'use_addr' are high. This is achieved through the use of logical OR (||) and logical AND (&&) operators. Specifically, 'accept_req_lcl' will be high if a periodic read acknowledgment is received locally ('periodic_rd_ack_r_lcl' is high), or if an acceptance received 'accept_r' is high and the address is in use ('use_addr' is high).
