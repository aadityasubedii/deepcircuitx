    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling the operation mode of a DDR3 RDIMM module with a single rank. If both the REG_CTRL is set to \"ON\" and the number of ranks (RANKS) is equal to 1, the labeled generate block named DDR3_RDIMM_1rank is activated. This construct facilitates enabling or disabling functionality within the design based on the pre-defined parameters REG_CTRL and RANKS. It makes the code more modular, reusable and allows specific operations conditional upon the register control and rank number."
