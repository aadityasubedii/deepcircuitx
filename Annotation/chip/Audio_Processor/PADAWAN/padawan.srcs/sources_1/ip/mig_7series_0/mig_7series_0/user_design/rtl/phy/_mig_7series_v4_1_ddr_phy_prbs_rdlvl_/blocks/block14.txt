Comment: 
This block of code defines the idle state of a Pseudorandom Binary Sequence (PRBS) generator. In the idle state, the "prbs_last_byte_done" and "prbs_prech_req_r" are set to low signal, waiting for the start signal. If the start signal "prbs_rdlvl_start" is triggered and not recorded, the control flow forks into two branches based on the calibration option. If the calibration option is set to "SKIP_CAL" or "FAST_CAL", the state of PRBS generator transitions to "PRBS_DONE" and the read address is reset. On the contrary, when any other calibration option is set, it enables "new_cnt_dqs_r", and changes the current state to "PRBS_NEW_DQS_WAIT". Also, the "fine_pi_dec_cnt" is updated to the current value of "pi_counter_read_val".
