This block of code manages the control flag 'complex_row1_rd_done' for SRAM read operations. When the system is reset or a pseudorandom binary sequence read level is done, the flag is immediately reset. It also gets reset during the precharge of initial state reads. The flag is set when the previous row read operation is completed and the write-read count reaches 2, indicating the readiness for next row read operation.
