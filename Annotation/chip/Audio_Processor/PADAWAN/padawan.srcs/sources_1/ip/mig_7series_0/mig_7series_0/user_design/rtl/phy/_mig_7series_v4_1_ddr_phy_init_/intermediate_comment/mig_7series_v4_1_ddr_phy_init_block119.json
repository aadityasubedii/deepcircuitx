    "block_comment": "The provided block of code seems to be handling the chip select lines (`phy_int_cs_n`) for physical DDR memory transactions under different initial states and conditions. The block employs combinational logic where the `phy_int_cs_n` state is initially set high or reset at the edge of the clock. If a reset is detected, all chip select lines are driven high. Alternatively, if any of the mentioned initial states are active or if the read-level, write-read and new burst conditions hold without MMCM write, the chip select lines are first driven high, then portion of them is driven low based on `CWL_M` parity. This is done by looping through a certain range of the chip select lines. If none of the earlier conditions are met, the chip select lines stay high."
