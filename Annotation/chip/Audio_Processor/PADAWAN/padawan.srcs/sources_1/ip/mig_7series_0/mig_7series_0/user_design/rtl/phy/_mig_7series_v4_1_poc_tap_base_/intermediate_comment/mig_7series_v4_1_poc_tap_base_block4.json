    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for interconnecting signal lines. It uses the 'assign' keyword to continuously assign the value of 'samps_zero_r' to 'samps_zero'. They are most likely wires; any changes in 'samps_zero_r' will be immediately mapped onto 'samps_zero'. This structure reflects a characteristic feature of Verilog, which allows hardware design mimicking signal propagation."
