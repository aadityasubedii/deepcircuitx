Comment: 
The block is responsible for controlling the state of `first_wrcal_pat_r` based on a reset, clock edge and specific initial states. On a rising edge clock event (`posedge clk`), it sets the `first_wrcal_pat_r` to 1 if a reset is triggered (`rst`), a write calibration is resumed (`wrcal_resume`), or the block is in the Write Calibration Activity Wait state (`init_state_r == INIT_WRCAL_ACT_WAIT`). Alternatively, if a write data enable signal is activated (`phy_wrdata_en`) and the block is in the Write Calibration Write state (`init_state_r == INIT_WRCAL_WRITE`), it sets the `first_wrcal_pat_r` to 0.
