    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for managing maintenance requests in a memory system. It includes the declaration of several registers and wires used to monitor system status and handle requests. The maintenance_busy wire indicates if the system is busy by checking the status of several registers related to maintenance tasks. The maintenance_request wire further takes into account requests from different ranks and types such as self-refresh, zq calibration, and refresh request. In addition, an upd_last_master_ns wire is used to update the last master, when any maintenance request is made while no maintenance tasks are in progress."
