    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for managing a delay-counting state machine for a memory calibration process. The state machine, is triggered on clock positive edge, monitors several conditions, maltreats when thresholds are violated, and when valid, increments the delay tap count if the previous and current Multi-Purpose Register (MPR) and Multiplexer signals match and the stable idle count is less than 2. The block also initiates a reset sequence in certain trigger conditions, making stable idle count 0."
