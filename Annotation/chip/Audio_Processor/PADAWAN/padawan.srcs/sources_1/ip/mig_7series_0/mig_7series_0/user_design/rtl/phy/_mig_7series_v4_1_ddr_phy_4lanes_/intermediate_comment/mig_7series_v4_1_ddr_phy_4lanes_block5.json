    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for resetting values. The module is used when the third bit of `calib_sel` array is high, in such case, all of the variables in the block, such as `A_pi_fine_enable`, `A_pi_fine_inc`, `A_pi_counter_load_en` etc., are set to zero regardless of their initial values, effectively resetting them. This block seems to be a part of a bigger calibration or configuration procedure in a Verilog RTL code and it is implemented as a series of multiplexer-like behaviors, where the selection depends directly upon the bit value of `calib_sel[2]`."
