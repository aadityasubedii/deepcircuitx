    "block_comment": "This line of code is an assignment operation in the hardware description language, Verilog. Specifically, it assigns the value of the variable `stg3_r` to `stg3`, making both signals equal at all times. This operation is used when you want another signal to replicate the behavior of a certain signal. The logic simply reflects the current state of `stg3_r` on `stg3` with zero delay."
