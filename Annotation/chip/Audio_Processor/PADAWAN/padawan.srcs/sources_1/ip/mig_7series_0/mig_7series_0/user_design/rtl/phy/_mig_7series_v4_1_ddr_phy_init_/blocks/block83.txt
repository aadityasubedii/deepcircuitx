Comment: 
This block of code is primarily responsible for sequencing read operations on a complex memory component in a synchronous system. It keeps track of the number of successful read operations performed during a clock cycle. When the system is reset, it initializes `complex_num_reads` to 1. Thereafter, depending on the initialization state and certain other conditions, it adjusts `complex_num_reads` based on threshold counters like `stg1_wr_rd_cnt` while operating in the context of `INIT_RDLVL_COMPLEX_READ_WAIT` and `INIT_RDLVL_STG1_WRITE_READ` states. If these threshold values are crossed or a specific state is reached, it alters `complex_num_reads` in a stepped fashion, reinitializing it to 1 under certain circumstances. It uses `#TCQ` time to control the sequencing schedule, helping manage the inherent complexity in the system.
