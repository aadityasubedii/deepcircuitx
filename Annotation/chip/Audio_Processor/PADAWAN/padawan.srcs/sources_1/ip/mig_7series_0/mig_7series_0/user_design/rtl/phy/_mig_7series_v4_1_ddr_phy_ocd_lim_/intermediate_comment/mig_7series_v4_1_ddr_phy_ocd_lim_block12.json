    "block_comment": "This block serves as a state machine that controls the operation for waiting count enable. It operates synchronously on the rising edge of the 'clk' signal. The block's function is to set the 'wait_cnt_en_r' signal based on the current 'lim_state'. If 'lim_state' is 'WAIT_WR_REQ', 'WAIT_STG3', or 'INIT', 'wait_cnt_en_r' will be set high with delay specified by the time constant TCQ. Otherwise, it will be set low with the same delay."
