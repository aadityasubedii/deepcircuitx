    "module": "Module-level comment: The module 'mig_7series_v4_1_round_robin_arb' implements a round-robin arbitration scheme serving fair request signals. It takes request signals (`req`), offers grants (`grant_ns` and `grant_r`) based on an inhibit signal derived from doubled last_master (`dbl_last_master_ns`) and request (`dbl_req`) signals, ensuring the next request is from a different master. This is established by internal blocks controlled by `clk`, `rst`, and `disable_grant` inputs. The last served master details are updated and stored in `last_master_r`. Assertions validate the one-hot nature of grant signals and last_master signals."
