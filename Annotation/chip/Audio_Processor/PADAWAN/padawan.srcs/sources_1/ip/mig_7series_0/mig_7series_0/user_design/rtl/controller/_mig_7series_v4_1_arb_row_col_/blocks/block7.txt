Comment: 
This block of code in Verilog Objective RTL is used for updating control signals based on the change in 'sent_pre_lcl'. It uses 'always' construct to monitor changes in 'sent_pre_lcl'. When the 'sent_pre_lcl' changes, it triggers the block and consequently the 'cs_en2' and 'send_cmd2_pre' signals get updated with the value of 'sent_pre_lcl'.
