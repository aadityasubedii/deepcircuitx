    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code checks if SIM_CAL_OPTION is set to \"NONE\" or if POC_USE_METASTABLE_SAMP is set to \"TRUE\" to control the initiation of subsequent operations. The `generate-if` construct is used to conditionally generate a named block of code 'no_eXes' during elaboration time. If the condition is true, the block 'no_eXes' will be generated and included in the simulation or synthesis, otherwise, its contents will be omitted, thus providing a means of parametric or conditional compilation in hardware design."
