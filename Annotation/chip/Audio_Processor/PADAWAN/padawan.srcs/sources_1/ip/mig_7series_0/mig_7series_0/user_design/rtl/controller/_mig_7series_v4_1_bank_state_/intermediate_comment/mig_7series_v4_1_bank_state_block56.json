    "block_comment": "The block of code is used to determine if there is a waiting period for a bank operation. It uses logical or operations and boolean values to come to a decision. If a column is being sent, a row-to-page command timer is set, or if a pre-charge wait is set and the row address strobe timer is not zero, or if there is any other general operational wait taking place, the bank operation will be in the wait state. So, `bank_wait_in_progress` is essentially a flag that turns true when there is a bank operation that needs to wait."
