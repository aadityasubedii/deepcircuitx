Comment: 
The block of code is responsible for updating a variable called `passed_ras_timer` based on incoming signals. It performs this task through conditional logic within a loop. Initially, `passed_ras_timer` is set as a RAS_TIMER_WIDTH-sized zero vector. Then a loop is started from an index value of ID+1 to ID+nBANK_MACHS, where the variable `rb_hit_busies_r` is checked for each index 'i'. If `rb_hit_busies_r[i]` is true, `passed_ras_timer` obtains a slice of the `ras_timer_ns_in` vector - precisely at position `i*RAS_TIMER_WIDTH` to position `i*RAS_TIMER_WIDTH + RAS_TIMER_WIDTH`. This operation is conducted whenever either of `ras_timer_ns_in` or `rb_hit_busies_r` undergo a change in their values.
