    "block_comment": "This block of code automates the creation of RAM instances using a Verilog generate loop. The code generates a number of 32-bit RAM instances specified by RAM_CNT. Each instance is interfaced with the data inputs and outputs (fifo_in_data and fifo_out_data_ns) indexed and sliced accordingly. The RAM instances are also controlled by addresses from the \"head_r\" and \"tail_ns\" signals as well as a common write enable signal, '1'b1, indicating that write operation is always enabled when the system clock \"clk\" is active."
