Comment: 
This block of code assigns status flags for the calibration process of an output clock delay. The Verilog 'assign' keyword is used to declare continuous assignments, propagating change in the right operand to the left operand instantly. The variable 'dbg_oclkdelay_calib_done' receives the status of 'oclkdelay_calib_done', indicating the completion of output clock delay calibration. Similarly, 'dbg_oclkdelay_calib_start' reflects the status of 'oclkdelay_calib_start', which signifies the starting of the same calibration process.
