    "block_comment": "The given block controls the enable signal for the read data path in a physical layer interface under certain conditions. Operating under combinatorial logic, the block continuously checks if the module is not undergoing a reset scan. If the module isn't in reset state, then it further inspects the previous stage of the phy_rddata_en_3 signal. If the previous stage is enabled, then it negates the current state of the second read data enable signal, else it retains the current state. This proves useful in designing pipelines for managing read data paths."
