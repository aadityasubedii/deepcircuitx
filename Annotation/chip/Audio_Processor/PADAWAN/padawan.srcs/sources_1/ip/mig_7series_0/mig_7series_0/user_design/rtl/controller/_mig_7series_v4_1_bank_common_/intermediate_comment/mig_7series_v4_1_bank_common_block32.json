    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for driving the `adv_order_q` signal based on the bitwise OR reduction of the `ordered_issued` vector (i.e., `adv_order_q` will be set to true if any bit in `ordered_issued` is true). This is done using the Verilog `assign` keyword for continuous assignment, meaning the value of `adv_order_q` will always reflect the current state of `ordered_issued`. The pipe symbol `|` signifies a bitwise OR operation in Verilog."
