    "block_comment": "This Verilog block of code is defining a coverage property under a macro condition. The coverage property is checked at the positive edge of the clock cycle as long as the reset signal is not active and all the elements of the rtc array are set true. This property monitors the Matrix All-Bank's Machine configuration arbitration process microscopic state machine operation in case of assertions used for formal verification. If the macro MC_SVA is defined, then the cover property inside will be implemented, allowing the user to trace if a particular scenario in the design has occurred or not during simulation for debugging and validation."
