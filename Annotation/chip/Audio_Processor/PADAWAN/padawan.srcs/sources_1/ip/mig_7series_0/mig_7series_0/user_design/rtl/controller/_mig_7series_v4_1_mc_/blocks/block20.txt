This block is used for recognizing a rising edge in a clock cycle and updating the status of memory controller read operation. Specifically, the block waits until a posedge (rising edge) of the 'clk' signal, then it initiates an update for 'mc_read_idle_r' with the delay being equal to 'TCQ', transitioning it to the next state 'mc_read_idle_ns', enabling synchronous system design.
