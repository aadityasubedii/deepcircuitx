Comment: 
This block is essentially a trigger mechanism tied to the 'sent_row_or_maint' signal. When 'sent_row_or_maint' occurs, it activates several actions. Namely, it sets 'cs_en2', 'send_cmd1_row', and 'send_cmd2_row' equal to itself. Thus, through an event-driven procedure, the block synchronizes the mentioned variables with the 'sent_row_or_maint' signal. This behavior is encapsulated within an 'always' statement, implying it's continuously watching for changes in 'sent_row_or_maint'.
