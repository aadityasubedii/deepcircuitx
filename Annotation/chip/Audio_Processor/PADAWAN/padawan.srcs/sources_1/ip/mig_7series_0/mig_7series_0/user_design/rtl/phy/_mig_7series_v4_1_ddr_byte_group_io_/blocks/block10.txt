This block implements a loop-based instantiation of ISERDESE2 and IDELAYE2 modules, both of which serve in receiving and delaying input data. Each ISERDESE2 instance deserializes data from a bit lane that is not output-only. Initial and dynamic setup are specified through module parameters, while certain control signals (such as bit slip) are kept constant for all instances. On each iteration, the ISERDESE2 block generates a 4-bit output. The corresponding IDELAYE2 block, on the other hand, introduces delay to the data based on the "IDELAY_FINEDELAY_USE" flag. It's worth noting that each specific IDELAYE2 configuration (either IDELAYE2_FINEDELAY or just IDELAYE2), is determined based on whether or not a fine delay is required. If the bit lane is output-only or does not exist, zeroes are assigned to the corresponding output bits of "iserdes_dout".
