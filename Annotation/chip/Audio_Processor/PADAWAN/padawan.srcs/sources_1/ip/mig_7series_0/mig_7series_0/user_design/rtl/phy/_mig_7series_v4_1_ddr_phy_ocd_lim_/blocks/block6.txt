Comment: 
This block of Verilog code handles the control logic for a counter named `stg2_tap_cnt` in a state machine. When a positive edge of the clock signal is detected, and if a reset (`rst`) signal is received, the counter `stg2_tap_cnt` is reset to 0. When the state machine is in either the `IDLE` or `INIT` state, the `stg2_tap_cnt` counter is updated with the value of `wl_po_fine_cnt`. In case the `lim_state` signal is `STAGE2_INC`, the counter is incremented by 1, and if the signal is `STAGE2_DEC`, the counter is decremented by 1. These operations are all synchronous with the `clk` signal.
