This block of code is for the generation of a DDR PHY Read Leveling module. The module is instantiated based on whether the SKIP_CALIB is set to "FALSE" or "TRUE". When calibration is not skipped, the module, mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_rdlvl, is instantiated with parameters like TCQ, nCK_PER_CLK, CLK_PERIOD, DQS_CNT_WIDTH etc. and a number of input-output ports saving data, clock and control signals. If SKIP_CALIB is TRUE, instead of using the DDR PHY Read Leveling module instance, all signals are either set to 0 or 1 in ddr_phy_rdlvl_off part, essentially disabling the operation of module.
