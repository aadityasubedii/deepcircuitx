    "block_comment": "The code block primarily functions as a timed event trigger and a bit-wise reduction OR operator. It ensures events are processed at the rising edge of the clock cycle (indicated by \"posedge clk\"). Post clock input, the block introduces a delay specified as 'TCQ' before assigning the value of 'ckesr_timer_ns' to the register 'ckesr_timer_r'. A bitwise reduction OR operator (indicated by the pipe symbol '|') is used to evaluate whether any bit of 'ckesr_timer_r' register is high, which immediately inhibits the reception of 'inhbt_srx' if true."
