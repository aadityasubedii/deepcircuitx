    "module": "Module-level comment: The mig_7series_v4_1_rank_mach module, a part of Xilinx 7-series MIG, manages DDR memory operation by controlling and managing ranks. It receives various inputs such as action control, periodic read, refresh, impedance control requests, clock signal, and others. Based on these, it issues control signals for operations like maintenance, periodic read, operation inhibition, and more. It utilises internal timing signals and collects different requests for processing. This design includes a generate loop to manage each rank and common functionality execution. The module provides efficient and effective DDR memory operation control."
