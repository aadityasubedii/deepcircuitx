    "block_comment": "The block captures positive-edge transitions of the `pos_edge_samp` signal that are latched with a delay specified by `TCQ`. It is implemented using a non-blocking sequential procedural assignment, which ensures that the new value won't be assigned to `pd_out_r` until the current simulation timestamp is done. The assignment happens only at the positive edge of the provided `clk` signal. This mechanism is typically used for synchronization processes or capturing the state of a signal."
