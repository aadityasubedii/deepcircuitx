    "block_comment": "This RTL block performs the function of a flip-flop that captures and holds the data in 'samps_ns' whenever a positive edge of clock 'clk' occurs. The data is held for the delay specified by the parameter 'TCQ' before it is assigned to the signal 'samps_r'. This block leverages the intrinsic property of Verilog's always block with posedge clk, to model sequential digital systems, ensuring synchronized data update with the clock."
