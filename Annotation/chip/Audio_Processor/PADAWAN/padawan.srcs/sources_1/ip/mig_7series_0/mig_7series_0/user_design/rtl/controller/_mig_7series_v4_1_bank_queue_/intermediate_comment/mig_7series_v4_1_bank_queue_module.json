    "module": "Module-level comment: The mig_7series_v4_1_bank_queue module manages queue operations in a Xilinx FPGA memory controller. It manages read/write requests to memory, handles idle states, and passes open bank requests, among other operations. The queue management is achieved using a variety of input and output signals, and internal variables. The module's logic is controlled by several conditional and iterative structures, executing actions based on these signals. A number of parameters are set for bank machines, and clocking controls are in place for various operations. Notably, the module demonstrates readiness for memory operations, accepts operations from the bank machine, and keeps track of idle bank machines."
