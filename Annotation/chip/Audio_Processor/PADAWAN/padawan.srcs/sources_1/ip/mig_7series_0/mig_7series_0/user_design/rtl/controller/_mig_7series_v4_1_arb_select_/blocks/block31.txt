Comment: 
This block of Verilog code serves to initiate an always block if the condition of 'nCK_PER_CLK' being equal to 2 or 4 is met. The always block will be triggered whenever there's a change in any of the 'send_cmd1_row', 'send_cmd1_col', 'row_cmd_ns', 'col_cmd_ns', or 'pre_cmd_ns' signals. This ensures constant monitoring and response to changes in these specific signals, thus facilitating synchronization and coordination within the designed system.
