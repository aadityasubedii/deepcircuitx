This block of code performs data writing operations, specifically for the 'fi_xor_data'. It works in response to a positive edge clock signal. Initially, if the data write enable signal 'wrdata_en' is high, it sets the part of 'fi_xor_data' array, defined by the range of 'i*DQ_PER_DQS' up to 'DQ_PER_DQS', to zero. However, if 'wrdata_en' is not high but 'fi_xor_we[i]' is high, it assigns data from 'fi_xor_wrdata' array to the same range in 'fi_xor_data' array. If neither conditions meet, it retains the previous data in 'fi_xor_data' array. The if-else logic ensures priority and manages data preservation in case of no operation.
