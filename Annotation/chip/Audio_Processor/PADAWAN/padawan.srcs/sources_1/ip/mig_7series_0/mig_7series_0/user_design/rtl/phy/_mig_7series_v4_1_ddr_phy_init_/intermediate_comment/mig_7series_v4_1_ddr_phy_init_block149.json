    "block_comment": "The block of code is a flip-flop logic circuit with reset capabilities. It is activated on the positive edge of the clock, if a reset signal (`rst`) is present, it resets the reference count (`rnk_ref_cnt`) to zero. However, if a write operation (`stg1_wr_done`) is completed while in the initialization refresh state (`init_state_r == INIT_REFRESH_WAIT`) and the command count done signal (`cnt_cmd_done_r`) is on, then it flips the value of the reference count. The delay time constant (`#TCQ`) is respected while taking these actions."
