    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for controlling the assignments of various entities based on the state of \"PRESENT_DATA_A\". If \"PRESENT_DATA_A\" is true, the states A_of_data_full, A_of_data_a_full and A_pre_data_a_full are assigned values derived from corresponding fifo states, while states A_of_ctl_full and A_of_ctl_a_full are explicitly set to zero. Conversely, when \"PRESENT_DATA_A\" is false, control states A_of_ctl_full and A_of_ctl_a_full are derived from their fifo counterparts, while data states A_of_data_full, A_of_data_a_full and A_pre_data_a_full are explicitly zeroed. These assignments consequently control data and control flow within the digital design.\n"
