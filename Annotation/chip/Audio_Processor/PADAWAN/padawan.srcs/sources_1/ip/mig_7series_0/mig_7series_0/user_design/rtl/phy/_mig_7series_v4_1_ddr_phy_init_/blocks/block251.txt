The block of code indicates the completion of memory initialization. When mem_init_done_r signal edge trigger occurs in positive edge, if reset (rst) is not asserted, it prints a time-stamped message "PHY_INIT: Memory Initialization completed at %t" to display, providing a simple debug information mechanism.
