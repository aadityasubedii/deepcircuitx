    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a series of sequential logic elements that sample different input signals and collectively determine an output signal. On each rising edge of the provided clock signal (clk), the logic level of eight distinct signals (each labeled `idel_pat0_match_` followed by \"rise\" or \"fall\" and an index) are captured (with an associated delay indicated by the #TCQ). These signals, assumed to represent pattern matches, are then logically AND'ed together to produce a resulting `idel_pat0_data_match_r` signal. This resulting signal signifies that a certain input pattern has been detected across all stages and will thus contain the most up-to-date status of the detected pattern at every clock edge."
