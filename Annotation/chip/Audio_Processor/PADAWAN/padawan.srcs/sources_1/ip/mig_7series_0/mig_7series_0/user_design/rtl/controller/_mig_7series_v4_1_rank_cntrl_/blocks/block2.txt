Comment: 
The block of code generates a periodic read request signal in a memory controller. A new request is latched on the positive edge of the clock when the countdown queue time elapsed. It further leverages assertion based verification (ifdef MC_SVA) to verify that a read request occurring concurrently with a reset signal will clear the read request. The request is adopted after initial calibration process. If the memory controller is not enabled, then the output signal will remain inactive.
