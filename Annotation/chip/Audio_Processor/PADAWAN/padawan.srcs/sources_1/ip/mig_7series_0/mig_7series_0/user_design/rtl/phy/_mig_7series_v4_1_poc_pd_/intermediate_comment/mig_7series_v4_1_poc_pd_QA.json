It uses the IDDR (Input Double Data Rate) component to handle double data rate inputs. It also provides functionality for sensitivity on both the edges of a clock signal. The module also offers a feature of sampling at positive clock edge with the delay defined by the TCQ parameter. The signal processing logic allows to handle metastable or simulation conditions via 'generate' control flow. The resultant phase detection output is prepared in a register 'pd_out_r' and it is output through 'pd_out'."
