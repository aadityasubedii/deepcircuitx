    "block_comment": "The block of code performs an assignment of one value to another in the Verilog RTL. Specifically, the block is assigning the value of the reg variable 'scan_right_r' to the net variable 'scan_right'. This indicates that the value of 'scan_right_r' is intended to be used elsewhere in the code, and 'scan_right' may hence be thought of as a placeholder or copy of 'scan_right_r' which can be manipulated without affecting its original value. This strategy is often used in sequential type circuits where 'scan_right_r' value might be updated at every clock cycle based on the design requirements."
