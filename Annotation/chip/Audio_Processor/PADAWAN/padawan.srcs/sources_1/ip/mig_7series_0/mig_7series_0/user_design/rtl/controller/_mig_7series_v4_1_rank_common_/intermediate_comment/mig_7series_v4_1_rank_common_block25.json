    "block_comment": "The block of code assigns the value of `maint_rank_r_lcl` to `maint_rank_r`. This is achieved simply by using the `assign` Verilog keyword, which continuously drives the `maint_rank_r` wire with the value of `maint_rank_r_lcl`, meaning it will always copy the current value from `maint_rank_r_lcl` to `maint_rank_r`. The `maint_rank_r` then gets ready to be used further in the code."
