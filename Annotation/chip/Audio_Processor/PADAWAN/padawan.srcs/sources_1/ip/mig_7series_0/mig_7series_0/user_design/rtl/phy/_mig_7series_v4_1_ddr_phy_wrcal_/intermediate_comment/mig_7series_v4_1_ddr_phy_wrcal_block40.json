    "block_comment": "This block of code corresponds to a scenario where the clock division factor is equal to 2 (nCK_PER_CLK == 2). This block controls and generates the frequency division by two behavior, utilizing a naming pattern ('gen_sr_div2') used to identify blocks of synthesis logic depending upon the clocking context. The naming convention and enclosed logic within this block facilitate debugging and analysis of the design under test by narrowing down the points of interest related to clock division equivalence checks."
