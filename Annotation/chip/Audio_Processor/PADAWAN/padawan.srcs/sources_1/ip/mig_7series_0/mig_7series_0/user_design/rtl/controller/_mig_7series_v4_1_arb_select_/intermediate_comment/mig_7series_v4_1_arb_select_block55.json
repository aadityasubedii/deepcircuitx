    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for managing row commands based on various input conditions. It does this by first defining a reset condition, followed by the maintenance command, and finally the original row command. Furthermore, in situations where the grant for a row is received, the row command is updated with rank, bank, row information, and flags for RAS and CAS commands from the corresponding bank machine. Additionally, there is a write flag for the row command, allowing for specific row operations. This design is iterative, given that it processes through all the available bank machines."
