    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a memory element for storing the most recent sample result when it is valid. Utilizing a conditional always block, it checks the validity of the 'samp_valid' signal. When 'samp_valid' is High (true), it stores the 'samp_result' into the 'prev_samp_ns'. If 'samp_valid' is Low (false), it maintains the previous stored sample by assigning 'prev_samp_r' to 'prev_samp_ns'."
