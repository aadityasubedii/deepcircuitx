    "block_comment": "The block of code is a function, specifically, calc_phy_bitlanes_outonly, that generates a 144-bit output calculated from a 216-bit input termed data_mask_in. The implementation involves setting a default return value, then, based on the defined width (DM_WIDTH) of the data mask and a condition check on USE_DM_PORT, it iterates through the data_mask_in. During each iteration, it sets certain positions of the output to 1 according to a calculation involving the current iteration index and the respective sections of the data_mask_in. This suggests it's a way of reformatting and condensing the input data_mask_in into an output that represents certain positional information or states from the input. This function embeds parts of the input data into the output in a unique and compact manner.\n"
