    "block_comment": "This block creates an arithmetic logic unit that computes the target value for a stage 2 control loop. The computation involves the addition of a fine control counter value - `wl_po_fine_cnt_sel`, which has been zero-extended from 6 bits to 9 bits - and another variable `stg2_steps`. The result is then stored in a 9-bit signed register `stg2_target_r` that is retained across clock cycles. This entire operation forms part of a control loop mechanism that calculates a target value for the following stage in the design."
