    "block_comment": "This block maintains a counter `stg1_wr_rd_cnt` for write/read operations in the context of memory read leveling initialization process. On reset or condition (when `init_state_r` equals `INIT_RDLVL_STG1_WRITE_READ` and `rdlvl_stg1_done` is false), the counter is loaded with a specific value (`NUM_STG1_WR_RD`). After certain conditions such as `rdlvl_last_byte_done` being true or `stg1_wr_rd_cnt` equaling 1 among others, the counter is set to either 'd127 or a conditional value ('d30 or 'd22) depending upon the status of `wr_victim_inc` or `complex_row0_wr_done` etc. For certain initial states where new read-write bursts arrive, or after the first stage of read-leveling initialization is done, the counter is decremented."
