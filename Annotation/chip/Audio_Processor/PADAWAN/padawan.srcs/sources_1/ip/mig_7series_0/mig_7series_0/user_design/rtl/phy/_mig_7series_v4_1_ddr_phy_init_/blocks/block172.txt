Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for managing the write calibration process of a memory controller. Implemented in a clocked context, it resets (forces to zero) a "temp_lmr_done" flag either when a reset condition (rst) is received or the write calibration isn't complete. However, if write calibration is registered as complete and the controller is in INIT_LOAD_MR state, it sets the "temp_lmr_done" flag to indicate that the necessary memory register has been successfully loaded.
