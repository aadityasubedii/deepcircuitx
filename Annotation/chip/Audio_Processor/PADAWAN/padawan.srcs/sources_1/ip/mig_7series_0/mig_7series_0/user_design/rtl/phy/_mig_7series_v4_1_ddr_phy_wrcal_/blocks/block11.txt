Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code serves as a digital comparator, comparing rising and falling clock edges of two signals at different timestamps. It accomplishes this by using four 'if' comparisons that checks the equality of two operands inside each 'if-else' block. If two operands are equal, a match is identified and a binary '1' is assigned after a delay determined by #TCQ, otherwise, a binary '0' is assigned. The index for the early2 arrays is modulo 4, suggesting a cyclical reuse of a buffer or a connection to a 4 phase clocking scheme.
