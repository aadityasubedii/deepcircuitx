This block of code is responsible for the updating of the app_ref_r register with the new state app_ref_ns. The indication for update operation happens on the rising edge (posedge) of the clock (clk) signal with a delay specified by 'TCQ'. In essence, this is a synchronous register update with a delay operation which ensures the register value is updated in accordance with the system clock and the given delay.
