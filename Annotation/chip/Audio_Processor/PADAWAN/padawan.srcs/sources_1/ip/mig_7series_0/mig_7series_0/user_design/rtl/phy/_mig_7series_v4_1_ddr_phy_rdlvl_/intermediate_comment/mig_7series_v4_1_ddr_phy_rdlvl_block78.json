    "block_comment": "The block mainly deals with the assignment of delay values for data quality (dq). To ensure that the delay values for data quality are appropriately distributed, it uses nested loops to iterate through 'RANKS' and 'DQ_WIDTH'. The delay value assignment is implemented within positive edge triggered flip-flops, ensuring synchronization with increasing clock pulses. The delay values originating from the registered array, 'dlyval_dq_reg_r', are assigned to the main array 'dlyval_dq' at computed index positions. The delay constraint '#TCQ' is applied to simulate memory latency and secure the data's integrity during the assignment process."
