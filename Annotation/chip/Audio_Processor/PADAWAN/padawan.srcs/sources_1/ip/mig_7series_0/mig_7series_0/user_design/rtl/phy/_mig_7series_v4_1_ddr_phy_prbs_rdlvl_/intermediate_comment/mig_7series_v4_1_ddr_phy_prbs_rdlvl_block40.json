    "block_comment": "This block of code deals with the initialization and updating of two variables, `prbs_dec_tap_calc_plus_3` and `prbs_dec_tap_calc_minus_3`, based on the state of the `rst` and `new_cnt_dqs_r` signals. On the rising edge of the `clk` signal, if `rst` is true, both variables are reset to zero. If `rst` is not true but `new_cnt_dqs_r` is, then the variables are initialized with hardcoded values. If neither `rst` nor `new_cnt_dqs_r` are true, then the variables are assigned values based on certain mathematical operations involving `prbs_dqs_tap_cnt_r` and `rdlvl_cpt_tap_cnt`."
