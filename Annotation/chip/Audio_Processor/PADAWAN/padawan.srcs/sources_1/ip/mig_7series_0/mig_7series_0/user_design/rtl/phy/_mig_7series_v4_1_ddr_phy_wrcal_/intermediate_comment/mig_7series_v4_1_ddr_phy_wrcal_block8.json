    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder. It adds two 4-bit numbers (input1 and input2) together, outputting the sum and a carry-out bit. The Ripple Carry Adder is composed of four full adders, each linked by a carry-out to the next full adder's carry-in. The first full adder has its carry-in hardwired to '0'. Implementation is modular, and it uses 'generate' to create an array of full adder modules, connecting each to the next in a cascading fashion, thus forming the Ripple Carry Adder."
