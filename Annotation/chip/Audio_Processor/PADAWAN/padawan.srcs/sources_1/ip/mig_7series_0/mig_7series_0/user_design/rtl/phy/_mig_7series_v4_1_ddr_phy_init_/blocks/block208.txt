This block of code manages the control signal for internal reference requests during read leveling. The always block is triggered at the positive edge of the clock signal. If a reset signal is detected, or the system is in the INIT_RDLVL_ACT_WAIT state, or the PRBS read leveling is done, the complex_rdlvl_int_ref_req signal is reset, with a delay defined by TCQ. In the case when oclkdelay_ref_cnt equals 1 (in decimal), the same control signal is reset with the same defined delay.
