It appears to be part of a larger memory system where it merges the write and read data. It takes write data, write data mask and read merge data as inputs, and it uses the mask to select which among the write and read data to take. In addition to the data merging, this module also computes the ECC bits based on Hamming code if the raw_not_ecc signal is not asserted. The resultant data is stored in mc_wrdata, ready to be written to memory. This module also generates a write data mask (mc_wrdata_mask), but it is constantly 0 in the design."
