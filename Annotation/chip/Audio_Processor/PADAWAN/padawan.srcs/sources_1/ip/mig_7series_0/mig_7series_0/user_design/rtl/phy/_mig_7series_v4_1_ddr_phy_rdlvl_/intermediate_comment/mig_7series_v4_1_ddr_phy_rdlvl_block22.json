    "block_comment": "The block responds to positive edge clock events and performs reset or sample edge count operations. If a reset signal appears, the sample edge count (`samp_edge_cnt0_r`) is set to zero with a delay corresponding to the technology clock-to-q time (`#TCQ`). If no reset, and the sample edge count enable (`samp_edge_cnt0_en_r`) is not active, the sample edge count is again reset to zero, or, if either shift register valid (`sr_valid_r2`) or multi-port register valid (`mpr_valid_r2`) is active, the sample edge count is incremented."
