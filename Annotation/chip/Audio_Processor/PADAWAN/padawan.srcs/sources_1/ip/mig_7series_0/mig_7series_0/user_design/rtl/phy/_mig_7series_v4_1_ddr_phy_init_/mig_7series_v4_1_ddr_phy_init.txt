Module-level comment: This module initializes and calibrates a DDR memory interface. It sequentially performs power-on, mode register programming, write leveling, read leveling, and calibration for DDR2/DDR3. It uses a state machine to control the initialization process, manages complex timing sequences, generates control signals, and coordinates calibration phases. The module supports multi-rank configurations, handles rank-specific operations, and implements features like output drive strength adjustment and on-die termination.
