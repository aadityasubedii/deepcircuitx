    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block handles the refresh flag for a DDR2 memory module during various initialization states. The flag is managed over positive clock cycles and is manipulated based on the current state of memory initialization. During the idle state, the refresh flag is held low. However, if the memory module is in a refresh mode and not yet fully initialized, the flag is held high. The flag is reset to low when both command and initialization counters have indicated completion, and the DDR2 is in the wait state for mode register loading."
