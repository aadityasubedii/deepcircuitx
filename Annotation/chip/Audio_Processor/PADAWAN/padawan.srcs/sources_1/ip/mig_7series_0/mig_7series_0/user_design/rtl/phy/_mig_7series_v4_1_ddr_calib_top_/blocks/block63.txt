Comment: 
The block assigns the values of two system signals, `pi_phaselock_start` and `pi_dqs_found_start`, to two debug signals, `dbg_pi_phaselock_start` and `dbg_pi_dqsfound_start` respectively. The implementation uses `assign` keyword in Verilog, which indicates a continuous assignment statement. This assignment continuously drives the debug signals with the current values of the system signals, making the debug signals reflective of the system signals' states at all times.
