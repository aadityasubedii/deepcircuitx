Comment: 
This block of Verilog code serves as a positive edge-triggered clocked assignment. It assigns the value of the variable 'end_rcd_ns' to 'end_rcd' whenever there is a rising edge detected on the 'clk' signal. This guarantees synchronization with the rest of the system and is often utilized in digital sequential design.
