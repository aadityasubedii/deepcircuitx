Module-level comment: 
/*
This module generates pseudo-random bit sequences (PRBS) for DDR memory testing and calibration.
It uses a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) for PRBS generation and a memory-based lookup table
for specific test patterns. The module supports VCCO, VCCAUX, and ISI patterns, with victim bit
selection. It formats the output for DDR interfaces, providing separate rise and fall data for
multiple DQ bits. The design includes configurable parameters and debug outputs for flexibility
and troubleshooting.
