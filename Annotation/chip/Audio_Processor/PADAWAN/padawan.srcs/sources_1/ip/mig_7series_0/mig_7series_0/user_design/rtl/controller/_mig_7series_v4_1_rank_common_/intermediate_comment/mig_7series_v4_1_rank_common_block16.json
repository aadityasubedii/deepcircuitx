    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns values to the logic states of two wires, `app_zq_ns` and `app_zq_ack_ns` based on certain conditions. `app_zq_ns` becomes true either when initialization calibration is complete and an `app_zq_req` request is made or if both `app_zq_r` and `zq_request` are true. For `app_zq_ack_ns`, it becomes true if both `app_zq_r` is true and `zq_request` is false, indicating a positive acknowledgement to a previous zq request."
