    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mig_7series_v4_1_ui_rd_data' module functions as the User Interface for a Memory Interface Generators (MIG) 7 series for read data operations. It manages read buffer index, initializes RAM, processes read data, handles Error-Correcting Code (ECC) and manages the read buffer full flag and ordering modes. The module has many input/output ports and internal signals to handle respective operations based on conditional blocks for different situations such as whether ECC is ON/OFF or the ORDERING mode. It also employs RAM32M memory blocks and assert properties to prevent underflow and overflow conditions in the read data buffer."
