Comment: 
This block of verilog code is responsible for detecting pattern boundaries based on the current state of cal1 machine. It does this by assigning a signal, `pb_detect_edge`, a boolean value which indicates whether a pattern-boundary detection event has occurred. The assignment is a logical OR operation of four conditions, each checking if the current state of `cal1_state_r` matches one of the constants: `CAL1_PAT_DETECT`, `CAL1_DETECT_EDGE`, `CAL1_PB_DETECT_EDGE`, or `CAL1_PB_DETECT_EDGE_DQ`. If `cal1_state_r` matches any of these constant values, a pattern-boundary detection event is considered to have occurred, and `pb_detect_edge` is set to true.
