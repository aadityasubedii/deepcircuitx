    "block_comment": "The block of code is designed to implement a set of RAM blocks specified by the constant `RAM_CNT` with each RAM block being initialized to zero. Each RAM block stores `rd_buf_in_data` for different slices of bits and later outputs `rd_buf_out_data` based on the input addresses. It utilizes a for loop structure to repeatedly create RAM blocks with the variant `i` denoting each iteration. The complex connections between inputs and outputs facilitate data storage and retrieval based on different input addresses for each RAM, while maintaining synchronous write operation with the control signal `rd_buf_we` and the clock signal `clk`."
