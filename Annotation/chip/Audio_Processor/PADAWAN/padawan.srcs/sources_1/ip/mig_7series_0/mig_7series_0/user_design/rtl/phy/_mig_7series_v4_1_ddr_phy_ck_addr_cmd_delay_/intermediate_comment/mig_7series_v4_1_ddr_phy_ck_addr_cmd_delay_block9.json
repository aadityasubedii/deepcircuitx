    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for managing a counter, wait_cnt_r, as per different conditions, to implement delay functionality. Inside synchronous clock edge, it resets wait_cnt_r to 8 when either the reset, po_cnt_dec or po_cnt_inc signal is activated. If a delay is initiated (cmd_delay_start is high) and the wait_cnt_r is not zero, it decrements the counter. This counter decrement occurs every clock cycle until it reaches zero, creating a delay effect."
