    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to handle clock-triggered assignments in digital circuit modeling. The function of this block is to update the value of `bm_end_r1` at the rising edge (`posedge`) of a clock cycle (`clk`). The assigned value is the result of propagating the value of `bm_end` through a delay element specified by `#TCQ`, embodying the concept of time-to-live in sequential logic. The implementation is realized by a non-blocking procedural statement (<`=) in Verilog RTL, which ensures an accurate and orderly simulation of sequential operations within a clock cycle."
