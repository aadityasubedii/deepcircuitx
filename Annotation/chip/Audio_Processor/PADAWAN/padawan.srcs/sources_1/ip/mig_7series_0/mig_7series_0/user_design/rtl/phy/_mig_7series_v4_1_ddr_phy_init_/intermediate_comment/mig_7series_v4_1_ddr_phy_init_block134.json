    "block_comment": "This block of code handles the timing of the read calibration process in a digital system. Upon the rising edge of the system clock 'clk', the value of the internal read calibration 'read_calib_int' is stored into the \"read_calib_r\" register after an intended delay specified by TCQ. This ensures that the read calibration data is updated and stored accurately in sync with the system clock."
