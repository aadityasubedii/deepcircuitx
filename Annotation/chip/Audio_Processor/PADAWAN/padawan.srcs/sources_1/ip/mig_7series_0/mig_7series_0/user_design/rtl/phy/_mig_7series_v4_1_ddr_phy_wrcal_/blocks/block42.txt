Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code implements a generation loop depending on the defined CLK frequency. If the clock frequency `nCK_PER_CLK` is set to 4, then a generate-construct with a generate-variable `rd_i` is initiated, that iterates over the width of the DRAM (`DRAM_WIDTH`). The implementation details reveal that for each iteration a new scope `gen_sr` is created. Ideally, inside this loop and scope (which is not shown in the provided code), shift register or other operations would be performed on a per-bit basis for all DRAM data bits.
