This block of code implements a delay pipeline for a signal 'delay_dec_done'. The pipeline is 4 stages deep, each stage being clocked on the rising edge of the 'clk' signal. The delay of each stage is controlled by the attribute '#TCQ', which presumably defines clock to Q delay time. After each clock cycle, the value of 'delay_dec_done' gets transferred to 'delay_done_r1', the value of 'delay_done_r1' gets transferred to 'delay_done_r2', and so on until the value of 'delay_done_r3' gets transferred to 'delay_done_r4'.
