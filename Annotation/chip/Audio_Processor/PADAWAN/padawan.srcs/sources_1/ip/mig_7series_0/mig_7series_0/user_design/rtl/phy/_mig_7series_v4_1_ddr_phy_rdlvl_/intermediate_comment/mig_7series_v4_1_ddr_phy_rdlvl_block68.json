    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code performs a right shift operation when the value of RD_SHIFT_LEN is greater than 1. It does this through a for loop which iterates through the DRAM_WIDTH and for each iteration, a shift operation is executed. The loop counter increment is set at 1 to ensure that the shift operation occurs for all elements within the DRAM_WIDTH. The code block is labeled as 'gen_sr_len_gt1' and 'gen_sr' hinting its function of generating shift right operations when the length is greater than 1."
