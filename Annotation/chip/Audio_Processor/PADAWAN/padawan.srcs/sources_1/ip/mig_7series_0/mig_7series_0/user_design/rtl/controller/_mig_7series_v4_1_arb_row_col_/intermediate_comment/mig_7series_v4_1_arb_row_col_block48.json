    "block_comment": "The provided Verilog block serves as a loop control generator that sequentially advances an index 'i' from 1 up to 'RNK2RNK_DLY_CLKS', incrementing it by 1 after each loop iteration. The 'generate' keyword in Verilog is used to dynamically create hardware structures based on control constructs such as 'for' loop, which has been implemented in this block to generate structural elements repetitively (RNK2RNK_DLY_CLKS times), thereby achieving an efficient design for larger modules. Remember that the actual hardware codes or structures to be generated aren't shown in this snippet."
