    "block_comment": "This block manages the write-to-read count for a specific rank. When there's a reset, the counter is cleared. In normal operations, the counter keeps the previous count, but if a write operation occurs on the rank, the write-to-read delay is deducted from the maximum count. Also, if there are previous counts, it decreases the count by one."
