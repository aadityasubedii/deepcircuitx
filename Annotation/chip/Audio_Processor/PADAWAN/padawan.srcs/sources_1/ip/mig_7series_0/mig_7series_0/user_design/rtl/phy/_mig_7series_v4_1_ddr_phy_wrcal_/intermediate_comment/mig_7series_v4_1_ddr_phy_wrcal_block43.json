    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a write calibration precharge request signal (wrcal_prech_req). Upon a rising clock edge (posedge clk), if a reset signal (rst) is active, wrcal_prech_req is synchronously reset and held low. If the reset signal is inactive, the previous calibration precharge request (cal2_prech_req_r) is assigned to wrcal_prech_req after a delay specified by the value of TCQ."
