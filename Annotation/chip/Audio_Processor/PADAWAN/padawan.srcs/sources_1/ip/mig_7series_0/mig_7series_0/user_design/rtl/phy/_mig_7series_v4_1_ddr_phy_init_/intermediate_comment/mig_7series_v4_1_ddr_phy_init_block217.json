    "block_comment": "The block of code executes a calibration tap sequence in a digital design, either initializing or progressing the sequence. If a reset (`rst`) signal is received or the initial state (`init_state_r`) equals to write calibration (`INIT_WRCAL_WRITE`), the calibration tap interface (`calib_tap_end_if_reset`) resets in the next clock cycle. On the other hand, if the calibration tap increment is complete (`calib_tap_inc_done`) and not done in the previous cycle as indicated by negative increment value (`~calib_tap_inc_done_r1`), then it sets the interface as high indicating a move to the next stage in the calibration process."
