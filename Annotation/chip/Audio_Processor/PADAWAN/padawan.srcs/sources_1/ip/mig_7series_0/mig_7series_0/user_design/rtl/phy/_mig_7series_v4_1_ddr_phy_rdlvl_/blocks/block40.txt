Comment: 
This block is responsible for evaluating whether the data match condition is met for either of the two patterns (idel_pat0 or idel_pat1). The matched data condition is then registered in the 'idel_pat_data_match' register on the positive edge of the clock (clk) signal. The 'sr_valid_r2' signal acts as an enabling condition, and the time constant queue delay, '#TCQ', adds pipeline latency.
