    "block_comment": "This block is used for priority decision based on demand and sending status. It gets the boolean ANDed result of the demand activity priority and the negation of the sending row signal. If the demand activity priority is high, and there's currently no row being sent, this statement will return true, giving a priority signal for the system to execute the pending demand."
