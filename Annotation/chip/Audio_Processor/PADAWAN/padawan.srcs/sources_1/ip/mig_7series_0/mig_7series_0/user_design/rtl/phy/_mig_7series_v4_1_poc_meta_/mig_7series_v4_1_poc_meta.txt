Module-level comment: The mig_7series_v4_1_poc_meta module, part of the Memory Interface Generator (MIG) for Xilinx 7 series FPGA, manages clock phase alignment. It calculates timing parameters using input signals such as clock edges and offsets and outputs timing values and status indicators. Internally, it uses registers and wires for storing states and calculation results, and functions for timing adjustments. The module precisely manages complex timing sequences for efficient data transfer between FPGA interfaces.
