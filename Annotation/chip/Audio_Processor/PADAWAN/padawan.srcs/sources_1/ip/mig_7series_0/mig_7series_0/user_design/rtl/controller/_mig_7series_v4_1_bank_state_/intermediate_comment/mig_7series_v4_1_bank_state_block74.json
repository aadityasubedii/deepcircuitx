    "block_comment": "The provided block of code represents a part of a Sequential Logic Circuit. This particular block works as an edge-triggered flip-flop that updates the state of the 'rmw_rd_done' signal with the value held by 'my_rmw_rd_ns' signal at the positive edge of the clock, given the delay specified by 'TCQ'. It exemplifies a data path element in a Verilog design, using the 'always @(posedge clk)' statement to specify that the assignment should occur at each rising edge of the clock signal. Delays are set using the # operator, followed by the delay value (here 'TCQ'). In sum, each postive clock edge changes the state of 'rmw_rd_done' based on 'my_rmw_rd_ns', with a delay of 'TCQ'."
