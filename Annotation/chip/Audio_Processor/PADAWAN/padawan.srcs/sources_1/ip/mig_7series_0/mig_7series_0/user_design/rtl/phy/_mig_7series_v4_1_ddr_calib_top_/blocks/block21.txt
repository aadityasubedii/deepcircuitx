Comment: 
This block initiates the Memory Interface Generator (MIG) 7 series for DDR PHY OCLKDELAY calibration when write leveling ("WRLVL") and On-Chip Termination ("OCAL_EN") are enabled. Calibration parameter widths and sample counts are set based on the simulation calibration option, and these parameters are then passed to the `mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_oclkdelay_cal` module. This module interfaces with the DDR memory (as defined by `DRAM_WIDTH`), using the declared parameters, for hardware validation and possible re-calibration of DDR PHY OCLKDELAY. The block toggles between complex and simple calibration methods based on the `BYPASS_COMPLEX_OCAL` flag.
