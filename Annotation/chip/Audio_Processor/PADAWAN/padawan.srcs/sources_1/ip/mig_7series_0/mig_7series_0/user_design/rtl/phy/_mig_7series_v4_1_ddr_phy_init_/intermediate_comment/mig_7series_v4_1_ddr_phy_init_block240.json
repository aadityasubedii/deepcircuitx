    "block_comment": "This Verilog RTL code block is used for debugging purposes in which various system parameters are assigned to a debug array `dbg_phy_init`. The block performs bit-level assignments to different sections of `dbg_phy_init`. Fields like `init_state_r`, `complex_row_cnt`, `victim_sel`, `victim_byte_cnt`, `stg1_wr_rd_cnt`, `complex_address`, `phy_address` and a flag `prbs_rdlvl_prech_req` are embedded into this array. Bit slicing is used to specify the particular bits to assign; for example `dbg_phy_init[5:0]`, indicates the (inclusive) bit-range 5 down to 0. Each field Indicates some specific operational state or counter of the system for debugging convenience."
