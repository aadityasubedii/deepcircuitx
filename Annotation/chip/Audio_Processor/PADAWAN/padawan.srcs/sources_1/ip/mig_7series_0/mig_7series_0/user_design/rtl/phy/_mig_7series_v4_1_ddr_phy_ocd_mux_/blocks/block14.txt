This block establishes a Positive Output (PO) setup state, given reset and setup signals. It works by assigning the current PO setup state (po_setup_r) to the next-state variable (po_setup_ns). In the event of reset (rst), it forces the PO setup state to zero. If setup is triggered (setup_po), it places the PO Setup into the fully-set state. Finally, the block decreases the state by one if any bit of the current state (po_setup_r) is high, maintaining the state otherwise.
