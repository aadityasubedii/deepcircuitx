Comment: 
This Verilog block is a counter for a starvation limit. The counter increments when a request to the column ('rts_col_denied') is denied and the counter hasn't yet reached its limit ('STARVE_LIMIT_CNT-1'). The counter is reset to zero when the 'col_wait_r' signal is de-asserted. If neither of these conditions are true, the counter maintains its current state. The arithmetic operation involved increasing the counter is done by adding a single binary bit to the least significant bit of the counter register 'starve_limit_cntr_r'. The conditions and control flow are implemented using hardware concepts of combinational and sequential always statements for synchronous digital logic implementations.
