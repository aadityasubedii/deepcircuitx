    "block_comment": "This is a DDR PHY (Physical layer) output clock delay calibration module which aims to ensure the right timing alignment with the external Memory. This module interfaces with many other modules, evident from the wide variety of input and output signals. It maintains interactions with the PRBS (Pseudorandom Binary Sequence), triggering calibration sequences (as seen from `oclkdelay_calib_start`, `oclkdelay_center_calib_start`), managing calibration count (`oclkdelay_calib_cnt`), indicating calibration completion (`oclkdelay_calib_done`), and so forth. It also behaves responsively to reset (`rst`). The module uses certain data read signals (`phy_rddata`) for carrying out the calibration. Furthermore, debug signals such as `dbg_oclkdelay_rd_data`, `dbg_phy_oclkdelay_cal` are used to trace the calibration processes."
