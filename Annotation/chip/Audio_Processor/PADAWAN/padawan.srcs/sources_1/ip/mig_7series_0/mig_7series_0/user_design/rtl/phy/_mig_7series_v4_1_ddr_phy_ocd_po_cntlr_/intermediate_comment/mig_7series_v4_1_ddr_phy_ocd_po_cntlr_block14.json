    "block_comment": "The block is responsible for generating the output signal 'use_noise_window' depending on the condition of 'ninety_offsets' value. The output signal 'use_noise_window' gets assigned a boolean true or false value based on whether the 'ninety_offsets' is equal to the constant 2'd1. This is a logical operation utilizing a hardware description language feature in which an output is determined by the binary representation of a constant."
