    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code manages a state machine meant for clock/data phase fine adjustment within a digital system. The state machine operates by responding to each clock tick (posedge clk), evaluating conditions that determine next states. If reset is triggered, it initializes all relevant state variables to their initial values. In the absence of reset, the state machine transitions through states like FINE_ADJ_IDLE, RST_WAIT, FINE_INC, RST_POSTWAIT, and others according to certain conditions. Depending on the current state, the machine varies output variables like 'fine_adjust', 'fine_adj_state_r', 'rst_dqs_find', and more. Additionally, there are numerous conditions potentially driving transitions to other states, generally corresponding to system-level signals such as successful DQS line detection."
