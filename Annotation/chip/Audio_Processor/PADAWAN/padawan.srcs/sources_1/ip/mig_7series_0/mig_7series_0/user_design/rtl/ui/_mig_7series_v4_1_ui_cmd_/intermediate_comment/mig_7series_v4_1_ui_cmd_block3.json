    "block_comment": "The code block is used for the assignment of a signal in Verilog. The value of the `use_addr_lcl` signal is assigned to the `use_addr` signal. This means that the value of `use_addr` will be updated every time the value of `use_addr_lcl` changes. This assignment operation is typically done in continuous assignments in hardware design or within an always block for latch or flip-flop usage. These operations are crucial for signal manipulation in the design."
