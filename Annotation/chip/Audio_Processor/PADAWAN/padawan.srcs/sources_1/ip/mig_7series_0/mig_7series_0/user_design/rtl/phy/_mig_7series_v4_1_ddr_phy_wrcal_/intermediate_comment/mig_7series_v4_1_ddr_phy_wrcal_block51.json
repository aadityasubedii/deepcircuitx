    "block_comment": "This block is used for performing a bit slicing operation on two sets of data arrays: wl_po_coarse_cnt and wl_po_fine_cnt. By using a for loop, this block sequentially processes each data bit, where the index 'm' varies from 0 to (DQS_WIDTH - 1). For each iteration, it extracts a 3-bit slice from wl_po_coarse_cnt and a 6-bit slice from wl_po_fine_cnt, both starting from indices calculated based on 'm'. The sliced values are then stored in corresponding arrays: wl_po_coarse_cnt_w and wl_po_fine_cnt_w. This slicing operation helps in organizing or partitioning the data in an application-specific way."
