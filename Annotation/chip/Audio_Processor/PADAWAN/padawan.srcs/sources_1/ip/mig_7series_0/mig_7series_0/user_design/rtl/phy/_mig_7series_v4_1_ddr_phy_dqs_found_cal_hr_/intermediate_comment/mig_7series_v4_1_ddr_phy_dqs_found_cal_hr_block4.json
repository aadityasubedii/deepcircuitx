    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a resettable counter in Verilog language. Upon the rising edge of a clock (clk), if the reset (rst) signal is high, it will reset the counter's ('final_do_index[i]') value to 0 (with delay equal to TCQ), otherwise, it will increment the current value of the counter at every clock cycle (with delay equal to TCQ). The '(i)' denotes that the operation is performed for each element of the final_do_index array."
