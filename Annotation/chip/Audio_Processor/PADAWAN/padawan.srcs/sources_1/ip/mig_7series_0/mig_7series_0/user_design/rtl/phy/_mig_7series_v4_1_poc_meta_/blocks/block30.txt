Comment: 
This block is responsible for controlling a specific variable called `run_ends_ns`. Its operation is driven mainly by the variable `reset_run_ends`. If `reset_run_ends` is true, `run_ends_ns` is reset to zero. Otherwise, `run_ends_ns` value is determined via a switch-statement-like case structure based on the value of `run_ends_r`; if `run_ends_r` is binary `00`, `run_ends_ns` is incremented by the logical AND operation between `run_end_r3` and `run_polarity_held_r`, shifted by 1 bit to the left. For `01` and `10`, only `run_end_r3` affects the result. The block effectively uses sequential logic to update the `run_ends_ns` state.
