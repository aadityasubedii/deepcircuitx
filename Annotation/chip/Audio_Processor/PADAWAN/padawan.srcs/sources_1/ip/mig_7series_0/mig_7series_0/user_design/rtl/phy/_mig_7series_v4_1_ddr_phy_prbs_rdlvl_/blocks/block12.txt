This block of Verilog code manages the states of a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequencer (PRBS). The code handles the state transitioning logic for PRBS counter increament (PRBS_INC_DQS_WAIT), tap calculation (PRBS_CALC_TAPS), and decrement (PRBS_DEC_DQS). When in PRBS_INC_DQS_WAIT state, the code waits for a certain condition (cnt_wait_state) before transitioning to next state. During PRBS_CALC_TAPS state, the code computes the tap count based on conditions related to the PRBS edge detections and current counter status, it then waits for further actions. In PRBS_DEC_DQS state, it control for decrement of the tap counter and transitions to the next state when certain conditions on the counter are met.
