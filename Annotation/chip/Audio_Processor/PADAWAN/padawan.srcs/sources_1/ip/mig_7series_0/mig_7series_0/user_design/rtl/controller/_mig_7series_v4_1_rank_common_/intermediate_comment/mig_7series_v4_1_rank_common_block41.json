    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns a logical reduction (bit-wise OR reduction) of all bits in `ckesr_timer_r` to the `inhbt_srx` signal (wire or reg). This reduction operation will result in a 1 if any bit in `ckesr_timer_r` is 1, and 0 only if all bits are 0. This functionality is often used to check if any bit in a vector is high and propagate that information to a single wire or signal.\n"
