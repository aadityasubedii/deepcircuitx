Comment: 
This block of Verilog code implements a stage-1 calibration reset circuit on the rising edge of a clock signal. The operation of the reset depends on the conditions of 'rst', 'fine_adjust', 'pi_rst_stg1_cal_r', 'pi_dqs_found_any_bank_r', and 'pi_dqs_found_all_bank'. If 'rst' or 'fine_adjust' is high, 'pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1' is reset to 0. If the calibration reset of the previous stage is high, 'pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1' is set to 1. However, if neither any bank nor all banks are found, 'pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1' is reset to 0.
