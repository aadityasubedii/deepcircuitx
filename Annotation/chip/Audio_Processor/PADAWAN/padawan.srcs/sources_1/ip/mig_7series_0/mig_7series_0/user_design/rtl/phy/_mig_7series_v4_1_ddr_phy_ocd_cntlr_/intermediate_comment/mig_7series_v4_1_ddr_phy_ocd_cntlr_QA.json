The main task of this module is to fine-tune the timing characteristics of DDR (Double Data Rate) signals in a FPGA circuit. This is achieved by implementing a state machine that manages the precharge, write level, and calibration cycles. This state machine exerts control over various elements of the DDR PHY layer such as the OCD (On-Chip Debug) precharge requests, calibration processes of the on-chip clock delay lines, latency of read data, etc. The calibration process introduced by this module tests and calibrates the write levelling, the on-chip delay lines and the on-chip debug functionality. It's essential for ensuring optimal DDR bus transactions."
