    "block_comment": "This block is used to update the status of a variable 'granted_col_d_r' upon the detection of a rising edge clock cycle 'clk'. The variable 'granted_col_d_ns' gets assigned a value with delay defined by time constant 'TCQ' after every positive edge of the clock cycle. The effective value of 'granted_col_d_r' can change during the positive half-cycle, based on the variable 'granted_col_d_ns'."
