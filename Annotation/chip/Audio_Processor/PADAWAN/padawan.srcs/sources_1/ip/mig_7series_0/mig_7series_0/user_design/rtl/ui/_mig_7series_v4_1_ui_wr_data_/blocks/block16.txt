This block handles write request count operations in a clocked system. At every positive edge of the clock, the `wr_req_cnt_r` adopts the value of `wr_req_cnt_ns` after a TCQ delay. When `wr_req_cnt_ns` matches hexadecimal 10, the `wr_req_16` is assigned true. Conditional assertion and coverage verification are performed between clock cycles based on various conditions involving system reset, write request volume, read acceptance, and data update index. Assertions also prevent overflow and underflow of the counter by ensuring that `wr_req_cnt_r` and `wr_req_cnt_ns` are within certain bounds.
