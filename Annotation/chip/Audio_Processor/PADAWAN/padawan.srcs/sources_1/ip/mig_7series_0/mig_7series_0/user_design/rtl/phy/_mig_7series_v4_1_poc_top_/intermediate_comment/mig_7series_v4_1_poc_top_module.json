    "module": "Module-level comment: The mig_7series_v4_1_poc_top module, a part of the Memory Interface Generator for 7-series FPGA architecture, manages phase alignment and edge detection for clock synchronization. The module receives various signals and data from input ports and outputs processed alignment details through output ports. It uses internal signals for positioning, sampling, and running statuses. For implementation, it interfaces with sub-modules for phase position adjustment (mig_7series_v4_1_poc_tap_base), synchronization management (mig_7series_v4_1_poc_meta), edge detail storage (mig_7series_v4_1_poc_edge_store), and solid sample threshold calculation (mig_7series_v4_1_poc_cc).\n"
