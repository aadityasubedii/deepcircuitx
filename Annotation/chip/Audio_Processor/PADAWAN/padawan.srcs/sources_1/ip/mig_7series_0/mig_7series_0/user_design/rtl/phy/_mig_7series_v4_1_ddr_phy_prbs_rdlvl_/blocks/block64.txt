Comment: 
The block is responsible for generating multiplexers for reading operations in a DRAM module. Utilizing a for loop and `genvar` keyword for loop iteration, it creates as many multiplexers as the width of the DRAM module, determined by the value of the `DRAM_WIDTH` parameter. This method optimizes memory read operation by distributing pathways across the DRAM width.
