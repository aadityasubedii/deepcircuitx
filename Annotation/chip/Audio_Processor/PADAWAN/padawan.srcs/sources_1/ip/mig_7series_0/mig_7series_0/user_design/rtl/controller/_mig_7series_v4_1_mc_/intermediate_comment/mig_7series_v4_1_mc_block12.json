    "block_comment": "The block of code defines a local parameter named CODE_WIDTH which is essential in the hardware design process. The function of this block is to prepare a parameter to be used in operations or computations that will require the total code width, which is derived from the sum of DATA_WIDTH and ECC_WIDTH. It achieves this by adding the widths of data and Error Correction Code(ECC). The data width(DATA_WIDTH) refers to the bit size of the data signal, whereas the ECC_WIDTH refers to the bit size of error-checking and correction codes. This localparam is intended to be used in contexts where the sum of these two widths is relevant."
