    "block_comment": "This block handles the synchronous update of the 'data_buf_addr_cnt_r' register with the 'data_buf_addr_cnt_ns' value on the positive edge of the clock. The implementation leverages Verilog's non-blocking assignment, ensuring simultaneous updates of all assigned variables at the end of the current time step, while the '#TCQ' time delay models the actual delay caused by the hardware."
