Comment: 
This block of Verilog RTL code is used to assign the value of the signal 'pi_calib_done_r1' to the signal 'pi_calib_done'. This is achieved by using the 'assign' keyword which continuously assigns the value of the right-hand side signal or expression (in this case 'pi_calib_done_r1') to the left-hand side signal ('pi_calib_done'). This means that whenever 'pi_calib_done_r1' changes, 'pi_calib_done' will immediately be updated to reflect this change.
