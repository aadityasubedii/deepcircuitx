The block of code is responsible for managing the write victim selection for memory handling. When there's a reset signal or when the write victim increment signal is high and the complex row count attains its maximum value (byte-level), the write victim selection is reset. However, when the PRBS read level is done and the write victim increment signal is high, the write victim selection is incremented. All these operations are carried out at the rising edge of the clock signal.
