Comment: 
The block of code assigns a constant low signal (0) to the `po_en_stg3` wire (output enable for stage 3). The implementation utilizes 'assign' keyword in Verilog, which is used to drive values onto the wires, this case, a logical '0', and it's applied continuously as this is a combinational logic situation. As such, `po_en_stg3` will always be logically LOW in all instances where this RTL code block is invoked.
