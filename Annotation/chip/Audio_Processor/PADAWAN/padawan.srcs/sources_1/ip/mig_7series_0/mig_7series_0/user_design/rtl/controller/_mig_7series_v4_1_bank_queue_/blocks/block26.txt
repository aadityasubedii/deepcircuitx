The code block is assigning the value of 'pass_open_bank_ns_lcl' to 'pass_open_bank_ns'. It is using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog for continuous assignment which implies that any change in value of 'pass_open_bank_ns_lcl' will get reflected in 'pass_open_bank_ns' immediately. This is a snippet commonly used for making signal assignments in hardware description languages like Verilog.
