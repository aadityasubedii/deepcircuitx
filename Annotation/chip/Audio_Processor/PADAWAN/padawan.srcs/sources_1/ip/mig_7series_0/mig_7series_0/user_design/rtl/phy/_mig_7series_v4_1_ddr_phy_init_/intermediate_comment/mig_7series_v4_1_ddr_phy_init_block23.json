    "block_comment": "The block of code is a conditional statement that is created when only one slot (nSLOTS == 1) is active in the design. The implementation leverages the Verilog 'generate' and 'if' constructs to create a hardware block labeled 'gen_single_slot_odt' only when the condition is true. This means the 'gen_single_slot_odt' block will only be included in the synthesized model if there is a single slot in the design."
