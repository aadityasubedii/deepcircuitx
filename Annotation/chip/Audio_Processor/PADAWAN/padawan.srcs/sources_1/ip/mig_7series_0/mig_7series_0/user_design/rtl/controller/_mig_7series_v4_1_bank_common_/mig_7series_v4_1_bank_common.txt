Module-level comment: The 'mig_7series_v4_1_bank_common' module is a fully configurable memory controller for Mig 7 series FPGA devices, handling operations such as command management, idle states, and timing controls. Internally, it uses multiple signals to orchestrate these operations. Major functionalities are divided into logically distinct sections in the code like operation acceptance, synchronization, acknowledging operations, and handling idle banks. This module also includes a maintenance controller generation section to handle different maintenance operations. Itâ€™s designed to manage the complexity of memory interfaces effectively, providing high performance and scalability.
