Comment: 
This block of Verilog code handles the generation of write request counters. It uses two 5-bit registers, `wr_req_cnt_ns` and `wr_req_cnt_r`, which respectively denote next-state and present-state of the write request count in a potential finite state machine. These counters can be used to manage and track the number of write requests the system is processing or has queued, enhancing its data handling and control capabilities.
