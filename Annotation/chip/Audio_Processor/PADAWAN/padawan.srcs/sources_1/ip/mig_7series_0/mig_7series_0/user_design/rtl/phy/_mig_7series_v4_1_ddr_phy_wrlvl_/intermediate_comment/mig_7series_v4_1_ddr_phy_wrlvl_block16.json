    "block_comment": "This block manages the operations for signal processing in a digital system Synchornized by the raising edge of the clock. Initially, when the reset signal is active, both 'dqs_po_stg2_f_incdec' and 'dqs_po_en_stg2_f' are set to 0. The same operation occurs if none of the conditions are met. However, upon satisfying \"po_cnt_dec\" OR states \"wl_state_r == WL_INIT_FINE_DEC\" OR \"wl_state_r == WL_FINE_DEC\", the incdec value remains 0, but the enable signal 'dqs_po_en_stg2_f' is set to 1. In contrast, for \"wl_state_r == WL_INIT_FINE_INC\" OR \"wl_state_r == WL_FINE_INC\" states, both incdec and enable signals are turned ON. This RVA operation lets it control signals in different states."
