Comment: 
This block of code serves the function of error checking within a digital system. When the clock signal rises, if a reset command is detected, a 'new count' request is detected or the system is in particular PRBS states, all error-related signals are set to '0', clearing out any previous errors. However, if a 'valid read' condition is detected, it triggers a series of comparisons between different pairs of signals related to data transition points. If discrepancies are found, the relevant error signals are set to '1', indicating a mismatch between expected and acquired data. The final 'compare_err' signal aggregates all error signals, raising an error flag if any error signal is active.
