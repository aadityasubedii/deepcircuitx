Comment: 
This block of Verilog code implements a digital logic that sets the value of `add_rrd_inhbt` signal based on any changes to `add_rrd_ns`. This is an always block, meaning that this operation is sensitive to any changes to `add_rrd_ns`. The operation performed in this block uses bitwise reduction OR (`|`) on `add_rrd_ns`. The result of this operation is assigned to `add_rrd_inhbt`.
