Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is used for clock and reset signal assignment based on the value of `RCLK_SELECT_LANE`. Depending on the value of `RCLK_SELECT_LANE`, it assigns a different clock (`rclk_`) and reset (`pi_iserdes_rst`) signals from multiple lanes. If `RCLK_SELECT_LANE` is "A", "B", "C", or "D", `rclk_` and `pi_iserdes_rst` are routed from the respective "A", "B", "C", or "D" lane. If the `RCLK_SELECT_LANE` is neither "A", "B", "C" nor "D", `rclk_` is assigned to "B_rclk".
