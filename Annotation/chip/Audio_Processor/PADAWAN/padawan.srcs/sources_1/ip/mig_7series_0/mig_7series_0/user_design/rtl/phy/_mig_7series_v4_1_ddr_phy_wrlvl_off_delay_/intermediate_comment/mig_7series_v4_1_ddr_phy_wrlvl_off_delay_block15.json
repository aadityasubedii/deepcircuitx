    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for assigning the ready status of the PHY control to the sixth register of the command delay start. The operation is straightforward, using the 'assign' keyword in Verilog to denote continuous assignment statement, implying that the value of 'phy_ctl_rdy_dly' will change whenever 'cmd_delay_start_r6' is updated.\n"
