    "block_comment": "The block is a synchronous digital system used for delay management. It acts on rising edge of the clock (`posedge clk`). If there's a reset (`rst`), or the fine delay is not done (`~pi_fine_dly_dec_done_r`), or the delay counter has reached zero (`delay_cnt_r == 6'd0`), the delay counter is reset to a standard delay value (`TDQSS_DLY`). However, if the 2nd stage of the write data output is enabled (`po_en_stg2_c`) and the delay counter is not zero, the counter is decremented by 1."
