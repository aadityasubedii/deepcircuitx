    "block_comment": "This block of code represents the main controller logic for a system maintenance operation. The task of this block is controlling the idle state of the maintenance function using the local idle signal `maint_idle_lcl`. This function is achieved by negating a set of conditions: it checks if there is a raised maintenance request (`maint_req_r`), if the periodic read counter (`periodic_rd_cntr_r`) isn't asserting (indicated by negation) and if the maintenance work-in-progress (`maint_wip_r_lcl`) hasn't been initiated (indicated by negation). If all these conditions pass, the maintenance operations will be set to an idle state. The next state of the maintenance work-in-progress is introduced as a new signal `maint_wip_ns` but its implementation detail is not included in this block."
