    "block_comment": "This block assigns a new value to the signal `oclck_prech_req` based on the logical OR operation of `ocd_prech_req` and `lim2init_prech_req` boolean signals. The `oclck_prech_req` signal will be activated if either or both of `ocd_prech_req` and `lim2init_prech_req` signals are active, effectively incorporating the requests from two different sources, `ocd_prech_req` and `lim2init_prech_req`."
