    "block_comment": "This block of code defines a register delay line for the 'sent_col_r' circuit signal. The implementation relies on an always block which is a sequential logic driven by the rising edge (posedge) of the clock signal 'clk'. When the clock signal rises, the value of 'sent_col_r1' is stored in 'sent_col_r2' after a delay of 'TCQ' time units."
