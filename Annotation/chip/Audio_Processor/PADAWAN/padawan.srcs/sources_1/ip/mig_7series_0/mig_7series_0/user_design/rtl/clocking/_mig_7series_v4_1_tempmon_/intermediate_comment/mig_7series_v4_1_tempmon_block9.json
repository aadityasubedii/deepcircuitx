    "block_comment": "This block of code manages a timer for sampling in a temperature monitoring process. The code waits for the rising edge of the XADC clock, after which if it's in reset state or waiting for a read, it sets the 'sample_timer_clr' to 0, effectively disabling the timer, otherwise, if the state is 'REQUEST_READ_TEMP', the code sets 'sample_timer_clr' to 1, enabling the timer for sample collection."
