    "block_comment": "This block of code generates clock signals based on user input parameters. If UI_EXTRA_CLOCKS is TRUE, the module generates additional customizable MMCM clocks by specifying their multiply and divide parameters. The generated clocks are then buffered using BUFG modules to distribute across FPGA for use. However, if UI_EXTRA_CLOCKS is FALSE, the MMCM uses fixed divide and multiply parameters for generation of clock signals. The MMCME2_ADV block generates the clock signals and the BUFG gates are used to buffer the output clock signals to ensure they can be properly used across an FPGA design."
