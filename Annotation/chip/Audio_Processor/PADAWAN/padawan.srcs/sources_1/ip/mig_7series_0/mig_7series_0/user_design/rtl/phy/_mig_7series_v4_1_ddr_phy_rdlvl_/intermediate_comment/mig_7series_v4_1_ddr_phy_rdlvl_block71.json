    "block_comment": "This block of code manages data updates in registers when the read multiplexer (mux) signals are valid. On each positive edge of the clock cycle, if mux_rd_valid_r (read mux valid) is true, the block uses delayed assignment (#TCQ) to shift the existing values of eight pairs of rise (sr_rise[k]) and fall (sr_fall[k]) registers, and appends new data from the corresponding mux_rd_rise[k] or mux_rd_fall[k]. The rd_i variable appears to be addressing the particular register pair to be updated."
