    "block_comment": "The block's function is to implement a count down register, `send_cnt_ns`, that indicates the remaining sequences of maintenance tasks in DDR memory. This block uses flip flops and logic gates: It gets reset when the `rst` signal is obtained. Else, it retains the previous value of `send_cnt_r` if none of the maintenance tasks like `maint_zq_r`, `maint_sre_r`, or `maint_srx_r` are occurring. If `start_maint` signal is high and at least one of the maintenance tasks are requested, it loads the `present_count` into the counter. The countdown is decremented if `send_cnt_ns` is not zero."
