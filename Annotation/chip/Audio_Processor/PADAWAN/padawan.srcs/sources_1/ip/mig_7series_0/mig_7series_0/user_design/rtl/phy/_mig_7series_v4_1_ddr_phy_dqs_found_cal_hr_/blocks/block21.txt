Comment: 
The block of code controls the actions of a retry counter in a memory controller. It responds to the rising edge of a clock signal and manipulates the retry count based on various conditions. If the reset signal is high or the rank_done_r flag is set, the retry counter bit slice [10+:10] is cleared. Otherwise, if the read byte data offset for a specific rank is greater than a sum of latency parameters and no data strobe signal has been detected across all memory banks (pi_dqs_found_all_bank[1] is low), the same retry counter bit slice is incremented. If none of this criteria are met, the retry counter remains unchanged.
