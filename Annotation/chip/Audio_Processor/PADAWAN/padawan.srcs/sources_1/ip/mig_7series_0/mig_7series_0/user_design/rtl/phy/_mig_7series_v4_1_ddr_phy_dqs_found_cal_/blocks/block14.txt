Comment: 
This block is a sequential logic implementation that controls the reset signal (`pi_rst_stg1_cal_r[0]`) of stage 1 calibration in a timing control unit for memory systems. When system reset (`rst`), calibration reset (`pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1[0]`), or fine adjustment is requested, the reset signal is set to 0, else it can be set to 1 under two different conditions. The reset signal can be set high either when a start signal is detected by the phase interpolator (`pi_dqs_found_start`) and not by the previous stage (`dqs_found_start_r`), or if a particular memory read offset (`rd_byte_data_offset[rnk_cnt_r][0+:6]`) is smaller than the sum of clock latency (`nCL`) and additional latency (`nAL`) subtracted by one. Another condition is if any bank signal (`pi_dqs_found_any_bank_r[0]`) is set and not all banks (`pi_dqs_found_all_bank[0]`) are enabled.
