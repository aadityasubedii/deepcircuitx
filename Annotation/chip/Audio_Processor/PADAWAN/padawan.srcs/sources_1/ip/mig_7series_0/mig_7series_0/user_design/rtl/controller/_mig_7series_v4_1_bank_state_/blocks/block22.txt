Comment: 
This block of code creates a flip-flop, subsequently used for signal synchronization. This is executed on the rising edge of the clock, effectively updating the value of the `req_bank_rdy_r` register with the next state value held in the `req_bank_rdy_ns` register, specifically after the delay period specified by `TCQ`. The inclusion of the `#TCQ` denotes a delay element, emphasizing the unit's role in timing control.
