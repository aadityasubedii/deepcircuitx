Comment: 
This block of Verilog code controls the behavior of RAS, CAS, and WE signals in a memory interface, during a positive edge of the clock cycle. On the rising edge of the clock signal, it assigns a delay defined by a constant TCQ and sets the upper two bits of phy_ras_n, phy_cas_n, and phy_we_n to binary 11, ensuring a correct command sequence and timing for memory operations.
