    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for assigning data to `fifo_in_data`. If the value of `REMAINDER` is zero, the block does a straight assignment of value from `real_fifo_data` to `fifo_in_data`. However, when `REMAINDER` is non-zero, the block concatenates a number (6-`REMAINDER`) of zeros to `real_fifo_data` and the result is assigned to `fifo_in_data`. This is likely to ensure that `fifo_in_data` always maintains a consistent width."
