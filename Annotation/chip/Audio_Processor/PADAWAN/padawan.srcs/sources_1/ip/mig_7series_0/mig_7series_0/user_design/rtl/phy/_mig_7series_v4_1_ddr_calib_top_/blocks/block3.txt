Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is for initializing all the calibration signals to their default values. The block assigns all the control signals for calibration to '0' which is their default or idle state and it sets the 'skip_cal_po_pi_dec_done' signal to '1' to indicate that the calibration decrement process has been bypassed. The assignment is a continuous assignment which means the values are continuously updated throughout the execution of the program.
