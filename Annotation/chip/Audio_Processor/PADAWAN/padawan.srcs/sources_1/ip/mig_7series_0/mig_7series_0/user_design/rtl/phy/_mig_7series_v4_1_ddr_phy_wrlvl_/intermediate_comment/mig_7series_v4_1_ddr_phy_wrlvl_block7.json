    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the resetting and updating of the 'flag_init' signal in response to specific states. Whenever there is a rising edge on the 'clk', the code will check if the reset signal 'rst' is high, in which case it sets the 'flag_init' to 1 with a delay of 'TCQ'. If 'rst' isn't high but the 'wl_state_r' is 'WL_WAIT' in conjunction with 'wl_state_r1' being either 'WL_INIT_FINE_INC_WAIT' or 'WL_INIT_FINE_DEC_WAIT', 'flag_init' will be set to 0 also with a delay of 'TCQ'."
