    "block_comment": "This block of code conditionally assigns values to the variables phy_ctl_wd_temp, phy_ctl_wr_temp, data_offset_1_temp, and data_offset_2_temp. If the value of nCK_PER_CLK equals to 4, the code block will assign the corresponding *i2 values to these variables, and if not, the *of values are used. These assignments are made using Verilog's conditional (ternary) operator."
