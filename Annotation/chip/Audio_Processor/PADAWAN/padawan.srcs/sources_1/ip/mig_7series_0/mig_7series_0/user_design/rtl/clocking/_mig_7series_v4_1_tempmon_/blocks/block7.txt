Comment: 
This code block manages the data enable signal (den) for a Xilinx XADC temperature monitor. It controls the signal based on the state of a state machine and a reset signal. If the reset signal (rst_r2) is high or if the state machine is in the WAIT_FOR_READ state, the data enable signal (xadc_den) is set to 0, meaning the XADC is not allowed to read data. In contrast, if the state machine is in the REQUEST_READ_TEMP state, xadc_den is set to 1, allowing the XADC to read temperature data. The positive clock edge trigger ensures the system synchronicity. The delay (#TCQ) is applied to hold the signal for a fixed time period for synchronization.
