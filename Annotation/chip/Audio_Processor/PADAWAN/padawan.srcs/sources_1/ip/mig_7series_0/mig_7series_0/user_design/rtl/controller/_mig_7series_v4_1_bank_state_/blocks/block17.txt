Comment: 
This block of logic adjusts the state of the "demanded" signal based on the "demand_priority_in" input. It specifically observes changes to the "BM_SHARED_BV" bit of "demand_priority_in". When there's a change in the value of "demand_priority_in[`BM_SHARED_BV]", the block of code performs a bitwise OR operation on "demand_priority_in[`BM_SHARED_BV]" and assigns the result to "demanded". This means if at least one bit of the "demand_priority_in[`BM_SHARED_BV]" signal is set to '1', "demanded" will be set to '1' as well. If all the bits of "demand_priority_in[`BM_SHARED_BV]" are '0', then "demanded" will also be '0'.
