    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code performs a bit-wise XOR operation on the bus 'wrdata_in' and 'fi_xor_data' over the bit-width defined by the parameter 'DQ_WIDTH'. The result of this operation is then assigned to the output bus 'wrdata_out'. The operator '0+:' helps in selecting the bit range from 0 to 'DQ_WIDTH' for all the three buses involved in the operation. This operation is typically utilized for generation of error checking and correction codes, data scrambling or performing an intermediate arithmetic computation step."
