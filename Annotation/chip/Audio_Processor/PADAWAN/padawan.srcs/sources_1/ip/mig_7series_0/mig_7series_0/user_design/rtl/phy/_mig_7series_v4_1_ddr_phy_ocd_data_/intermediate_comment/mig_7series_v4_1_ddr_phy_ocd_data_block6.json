    "block_comment": "This block conditionally calculates the value of last_byte_ns based on the value of the system's nCK_PER_CLK. If nCK_PER_CLK is 4, it grabs bytes 56 to 63 from the data_bytes array when phy_rddata_en_1 is high; otherwise, it retrieves the value of last_byte_r. If nCK_PER_CLK isn't 4, it behaves similarly but retrieves bytes 24 to 31. This is achieved via the generate-if construct in Verilog, which allows conditional assignments based on static parameters."
