This block of code performs the function of a register for storing the next state address of a read data buffer. This operation is clocked on the rising edge (`posedge`) of the `clk` signal. The next state address, referred to as `rd_data_buf_addr_ns`, is written into the register `rd_data_buf_addr_r_lcl` after a delay specified by the time constant queue (`#TCQ`). This design pattern is common in Verilog for creating sequential logic that responds to a clock signal.
