    "block_comment": "This block of code is used to assign the value of the `diff_r` variable to `diff`. The `assign` statement in Verilog RTL code is used to generate continuous assignments that update the left-hand-side `diff` every time there is a change in the value of the right-hand-side `diff_r`. This reflects a continuous data flow from `diff_r` to `diff`, making `diff` mirror the value of `diff_r` at all times."
