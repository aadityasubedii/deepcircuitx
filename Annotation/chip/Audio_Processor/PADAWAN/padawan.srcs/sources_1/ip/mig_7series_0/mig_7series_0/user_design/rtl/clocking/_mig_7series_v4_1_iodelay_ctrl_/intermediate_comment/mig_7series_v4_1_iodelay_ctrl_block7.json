    "block_comment": "The block of code handles the generation of a reference clock signal in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based system. The block is conditionally configured based on the type of the reference clock signal and the system clock settings. If the reference clock signal is \"DIFFERENTIAL\", \"SINGLE_ENDED\", or a \"USE_SYSTEM_CLOCK\" with buffer, it employs a BUFG (buffer) for clock signal routing, ensuring appropriate signal strength and propagation delay. If the system clock has no buffer or if the reference clock type does not meet the specific conditions, the code directly assigns the input reference clock to the system clock without any buffering, which is typically the case for low-frequency clock signals that do not require buffering to maintain signal integrity."
