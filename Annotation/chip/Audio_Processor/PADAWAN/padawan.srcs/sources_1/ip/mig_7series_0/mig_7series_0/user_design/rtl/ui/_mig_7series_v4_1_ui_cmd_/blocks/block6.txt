Comment: 
This block is implementing a flip-flop in a digital circuit for non-blocking assignment. The operation of this flip-flop is synced to the rising edge of the clock signal 'clk'. The flip-flop samples and updates the state of 'app_rdy_ns' at every positive edge of the 'clk'. The sampled data is held until the next clock pulse rolls in, and the delay "#" indicates the delay caused by the propagation delay of the flip-flop TCQ(Typically Clock-to-Q delay).
