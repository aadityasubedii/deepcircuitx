    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value of the local 'req_row_r_lcl' signal to the 'req_row_r' signal. This is achieved through the 'assign' keyword in Verilog. The 'assign' keyword allows continuous data assignment to the 'req_row_r' signal every time there's a change in the value of the 'req_row_r_lcl' signal. The right side of the equation is monitored continuously and as soon as a change is detected, the same is reflected on the left side."
