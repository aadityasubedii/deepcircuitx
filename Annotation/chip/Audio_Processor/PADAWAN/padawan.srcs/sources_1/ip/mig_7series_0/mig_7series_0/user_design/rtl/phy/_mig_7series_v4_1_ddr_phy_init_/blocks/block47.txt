Comment: 
This Verilog RTL block configures data written to a physical layer depending on calibration done and various state transitions. When calibration is not done, a fixed pattern is written to the physical layer data bus (`phy_wrdata`) at clock rising edge, otherwise, it checks if first stage of read levelling is done, if not a structured pattern is written to `phy_wrdata` based on the value of `wrdata_pat_cnt`. If the first level of read leveling is done and physical data is not full, the block concludes and awaits next clock cycle for new operations.
