Comment: 
This block of Verilog code manages the reset and limits for the 3rd stage in a system. It handles the synchronous reset conditional (`rst`), following which it resets certain variables to 0. Furthermore, it has conditions to handle stage 3 initialization, where it sets the right limits based on a tap counter value (`stg3_tap_cnt`). This depends on whether a calibration operation has been completed (`oclkdelay_calib_done`), upon which it updates the corresponding limits in 'cmplx_stg3_right_lim' or 'simp_stg3_right_lim'. In another case, if a limit start condition (`lim_start`) is met and not repeated (`!lim_start_r`), it resets `stg3_right_lim` to 0.
