    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is responsible for delay calibration for data lanes identified by A, B, C, D. It first initializes all calibrations controls to 0, then under certain conditions, loads calibration parameters such as enable signals, increment signals, counter load and read enables, counter load values, and other related signals. It accepts inputs for fine and coarse delay procedures, controls for counter load and read actions, and selections for calibration methods. The expected result of this block depends on the conditions set by calib_sel[2:0], calib_in_common, calib_zero_lanes[0] and calib_zero_ctrl, and the state of DATA_CTL_N[0], A_mux_ctrl, B_mux_ctrl, C_mux_ctrl, and D_mux_ctrl signals. The 'case' syntax is used to efficiently manage the selection process based on the calib_sel[1:0] signal."
