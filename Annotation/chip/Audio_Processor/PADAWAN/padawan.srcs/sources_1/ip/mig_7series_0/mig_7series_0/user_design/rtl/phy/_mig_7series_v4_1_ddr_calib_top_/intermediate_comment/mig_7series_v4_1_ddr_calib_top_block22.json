    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is responsible for calibration of the oclk (output clock) delay in DDR (Double Data Rate) memory systems. It's designed to activate only when both Write Leveling (WRLVL) and Output Clock Calibration (OCAL) are enabled. Various local parameters are defined including the counter widths, number of samples, and percentages of samples solid. The function mig_7series_v4_1_ddr_phy_oclkdelay_cal is instantiated and fed with inputs including but not limited to DRAM width, DQS count width, DQS width, and Sample count width. In case the calibration process is not enabled, suitable default values are assigned to variables controlling the calibration and debug processes. The module ensures proper functionality of oclk in DDR systems by calibrating it based on the given parameters when required."
