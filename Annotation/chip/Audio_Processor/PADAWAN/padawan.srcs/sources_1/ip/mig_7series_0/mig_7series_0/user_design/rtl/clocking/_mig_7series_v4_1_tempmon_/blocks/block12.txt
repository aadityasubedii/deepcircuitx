This block manages the state transition of a temperature monitor module in synchronous to the 'xadc_clk' clock signal. It does so by always checking at the positive edge of 'xadc_clk'. If 'rst_r2', a reset signal, is true, then the state machine (represented by 'tempmon_state') will transition to an idle initialization stage (INIT_IDLE). Otherwise, it will transition to the next determined state as dictated by 'tempmon_next_state', ensuring the state machine steps logically through each of its constituent states.
