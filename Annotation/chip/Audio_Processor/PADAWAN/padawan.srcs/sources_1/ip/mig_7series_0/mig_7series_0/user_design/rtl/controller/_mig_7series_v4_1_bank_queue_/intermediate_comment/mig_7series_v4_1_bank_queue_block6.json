    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a digital flip-flop circuitry that updates based on the rising edge of input clock signal (clk). On each positive edge of clk, the state variable (q_has_rd_r) is asynchronously updated after specific delay (TCQ) from the next state variable (q_has_rd_ns). If the clk signal transitions from low to high, q_has_rd_r takes the value of q_has_rd_ns only after a delay time (TCQ).\n"
