Comment: 
The block of code you provided is responsible for assign operations between dbg_ocd_lim and different stages of simplification limits (simp_stg3_left_lim and simp_stg3_right_lim). In the assignments, specific fields of dbg_ocd_lim are set to the value of simp_stg3_left_lim and simp_stg3_right_lim by using indexed part selects (":") to select a subset of bits from each operand. Additionally, the block sets a portion of dbg_ocd_lim array elements from 108 to 255 to be zero using the SystemVerilog literal expression ('d0).
