    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mig_7series_v4_1_ecc_dec_fix' module decodes and corrects Error Correction Code (ECC) for DDR4 memory systems using the MIG 7 series. It takes in raw data and a parity check matrix, uses internal logic for syndrome calculation, error detection and correction (if enabled via control signals), and outputs the corrected data alongside error status. The module uses several internal signals and iterative blocks for payload extraction, bit corrections, status computation ensuring efficient ECC operations."
