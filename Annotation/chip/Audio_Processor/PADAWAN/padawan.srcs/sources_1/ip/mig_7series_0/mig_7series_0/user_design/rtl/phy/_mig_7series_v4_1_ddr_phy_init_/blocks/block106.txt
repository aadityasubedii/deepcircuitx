This block is responsible for managing the count of complex rows in a memory operation. It operates synchronously with the rising edge of the clock signal, and its count operation can be reset under several conditions including a reset signal, completion of a write operation, or the end of stage one read leveling. If these reset conditions are not met, the block increments the complex row count based on certain predefined conditions such as the stage one write-read count, initialization state, increment commands, or reset read address commands. On completion of stage one write operation, the complex row count can be set to certain values depending on whether a reset read address command exists, a complex sample increment command and not a victim command exists, or it is still within the defined limit of double the data query per data strobe signal. The delay value (TCQ) is used when assigning new values to the complex row count.
