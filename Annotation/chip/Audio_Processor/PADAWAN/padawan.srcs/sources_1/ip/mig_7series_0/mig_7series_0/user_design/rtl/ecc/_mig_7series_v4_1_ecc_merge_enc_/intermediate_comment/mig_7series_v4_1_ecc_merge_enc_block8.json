    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for merging data from two different data streams: `wr_data` (write data) and `rd_merge_data` (read and merge data), according to a data mask `wr_data_mask`. The block operates on a byte level with a specific payload width. When a boolean value in the `wr_data_mask` is true, a byte from the `rd_merge_data` gets assigned to the corresponding byte in `merged_data`. Conversely, if the boolean value is false, the corresponding byte from `wr_data` gets assigned instead. The sectioning of the data array is controlled by constants `h` and `i`, with `h*PAYLOAD_WIDTH+i*8` indicating the start of the specific byte for operation."
