Comment: 
This block of code functions as an asynchronous clocked reset for a read address. The read address reset activation occurs on the rising edge of the clock signal (`posedge clk`). The operation is done through a non-blocking assignment (`<=`), which ensures that the reset for the read address (`reset_rd_addr`) is set to the next state value (`reset_rd_addr_r1`) without blocking other operations to occur simultaneously. The delay `#TCQ` is included to model the time taken by the clock to affect the reset operation.
