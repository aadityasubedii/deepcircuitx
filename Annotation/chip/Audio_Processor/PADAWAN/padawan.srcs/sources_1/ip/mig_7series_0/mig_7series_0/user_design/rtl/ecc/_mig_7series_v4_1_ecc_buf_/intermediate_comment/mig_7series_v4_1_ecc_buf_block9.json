    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily designed to handle the read and write operations of an address-based buffer. It does this via two operations: a synchronous read address update and a combinatorial write address assignment. The synchronous operation updates the buffer read address 'buf_rd_addr_r' based on the write data address and offset with a clock (clk) triggered at its positive edge. The combinatorial operation assigns a write address 'buf_wr_addr' by concatenating the read data address and offset.\n"
