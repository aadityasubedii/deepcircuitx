    "block_comment": "The block of code is designed to handle rank completion signal (`rank_done_r`). It does this by looking for a positive edge clock signal where, depending on the conditions, 'rank_done_r' is set to either '1' or '0'. Specifically, on reset or when the `init_dqsfound_done_r` and `rnk_cnt_r` meet certain conditions, the 'rank_done_r' is set to '0'. Alternatively, if all phases-in detectors have found DQS in all banks (as indicated by `&pi_dqs_found_all_bank`) and it wasn't true in the previous clock cycle (`~(&pi_dqs_found_all_bank_r)`), the 'rank_done_r' is set to '1' else, it remains '0'."
