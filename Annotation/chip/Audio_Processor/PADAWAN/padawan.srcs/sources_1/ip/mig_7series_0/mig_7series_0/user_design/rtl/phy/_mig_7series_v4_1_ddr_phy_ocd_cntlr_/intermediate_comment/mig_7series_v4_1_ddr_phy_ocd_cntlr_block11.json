    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for a synchronous logic operation based on the rising edge (posedge) of the clock signal (clk). This operation essentially implements a delay flip-flop with a delay represented by #TCQ. When there is a rising edge on the clock, the value of 'phy_rddata_en_r2' gets assigned to 'phy_rddata_en_r3' after a delay of #TCQ units of time. This is part of a synchronization circuit used for aligning data transfer with the system clock."
