Module name: mig_7series_v4_1_poc_meta. 

Module specification: The mig_7series_v4_1_poc_meta module forms part of the Memory Interface Generator (MIG) for the Xilinx 7 series FPGA. It primarily calculates timing parameters and manages clock phase alignment for a Phase Locked Loop (PLL). This involves detecting clock edges, calculating offsets and differences, applying these adjustments for alignment, and generating various flags based on the alignment status. It employs both input and output ports, as well as several internal signals and functions.

Input ports include: `rst` (reset signal), `clk` (system clock), `mmcm_edge_detect_rdy` (MMCM edge detection ready signal), `run_too_small` (indicator of small run size), `run` (clock run), `run_end` (end of clock run flag) and several other specific timing values and flags. Output ports include: `run_ends` (delayed run end signal), `mmcm_edge_detect_done` (signifies edge detection), `edge_center`, `left` and `right` (timing values based on noise window flag), `window_center` (center of the time window), `diff` (difference between right and left center values), `poc_backup` (backup phase alignment flag), and `mmcm_lbclk_edge_aligned` (indicates that edge alignments are complete).

Internally, the module uses various registers and wires to store intermediate calculation results and various state conditions. Functions `offset`, `mod_sub`, and `center` are used to conduct the complex timing calculations. Moreover, the code can be divided into different sections handling clock phase alignment, window center calculation, and edge center calculation, along with different backup procedures and timing adjustments accounting for noise and latency. 

In summary, the mig_7series_v4_1_poc_meta module essentially manages complex clock phase alignment procedures for Xilinx FPGA interfaces, ensuring accurate and efficient transmission and receipt of data signals.
