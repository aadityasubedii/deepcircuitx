The block of code models an exclusive range boundary system with primary functionality in handling edge detection and delineation based on preset conditions. Using multiple conditional checks, it modifies boundary values labeled 'left' and 'right', initially set to 'lim2ocal_stg3_left_lim' and 'lim2ocal_stg3_right_lim' respectively. The checks encompass a total of six conditions (zero, noise, oneeighty, z2f, f2o, f2z) that trigger respective assignment of boundary limits and 'ninety_offsets_final_ns' value. Additionally, it includes a failsafe, assigning 'win_not_found' as '1'b1' if none of the conditions apply. The final statement determines the 'current_edge' value utilizing a ternary operator based on the 'ocd_ktap_left_r' boolean trigger, assigning 'left' or 'right' correspondingly.
