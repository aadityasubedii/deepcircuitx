    "block_comment": "This block of code creates a D-type Flip-Flop, which is used for storing and updating the value of prbs_dqs_cnt_r on the rising edge of the clock (clk). The value is passed to rd_mux_sel_r. It's implemented using the always @(posedge clk) begin-end construct, which makes it sensitive to the rising edge of the clk signal, and only then it update rd_mux_sel_r with the value of prbs_dqs_cnt_r after delaying it by the time specified in #TCQ."
