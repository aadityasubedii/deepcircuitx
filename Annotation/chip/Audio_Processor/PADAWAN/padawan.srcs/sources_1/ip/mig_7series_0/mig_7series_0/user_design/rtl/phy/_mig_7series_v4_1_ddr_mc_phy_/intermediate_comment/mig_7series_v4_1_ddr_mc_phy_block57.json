    "block_comment": "The initial block within this Verilog code is intended for display and warning purposes, specifically used in testing and verification simulations. This block contains multiple display statements, which print out the current state and value of many design parameters, including various BYTE_LANES, DATA_CTRLs, highest lane and bank, and frequency reference periods. It helps evaluate various intrinsic delays, offsets, circular buffer values, and more. Further, a condition checks if PI_STG2_DELAY_CAND exceeds PI_MAX_STG2_DELAY, and if true, it triggers a warning about a potential violation due to timing differences between aux_out and ddr clock lines. This block assists in monitoring and diagnosing potential issues in the design during non-synthesis simulation runs."
