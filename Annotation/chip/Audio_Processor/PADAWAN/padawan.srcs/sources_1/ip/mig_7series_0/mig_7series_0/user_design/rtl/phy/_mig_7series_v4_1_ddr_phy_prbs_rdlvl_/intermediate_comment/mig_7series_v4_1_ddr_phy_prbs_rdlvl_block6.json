    "block_comment": "This block of code is part of a finite state machine (FSM) specific to the phase interpolation (PI) increment portion. It defines the state transitions and the outputs during the 'RD_DONE_WAIT_FOR_PI_INC_INC', 'FINE_PI_INC', and 'FINE_PI_INC_WAIT' states. The 'RD_DONE_WAIT_FOR_PI_INC_INC' state checks if a complex operation started, changes the state accordingly. In the 'FINE_PI_INC' state, depending on various bool flags and tap count values, it updates 'no_err_win_detected_latch', 'right_edge_found', 'largest_left_edge' and 'smallest_right_edge'. It further deals with PRBS TAP increment limitations by enabling/disabling the PRBS TAP. Finally, in the 'FINE_PI_INC_WAIT' state, it defaults a few PRBS tap controls and checks for state counter wait condition, transitioning to the 'FINE_PAT_COMPARE_PER_BIT' state if the condition is met."
