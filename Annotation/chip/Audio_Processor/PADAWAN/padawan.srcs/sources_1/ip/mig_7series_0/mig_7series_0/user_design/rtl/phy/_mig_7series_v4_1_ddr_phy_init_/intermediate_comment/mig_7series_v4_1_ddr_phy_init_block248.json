    "block_comment": "The given Verilog code block provides a notification about the completion of MPR (Mode Register Read) Read Leveling in a physical interface (PHY) initialization sequence. Operating at the rising edge of the MPR RDLVL (Read Leveling) Done signal, the block displays a timestamped message when the signal goes high and the reset ('rst') signal is not active. This involves the usage of system task $display for announcing the completion of the Read Leveling process at the current simulation time using the $time system function."
