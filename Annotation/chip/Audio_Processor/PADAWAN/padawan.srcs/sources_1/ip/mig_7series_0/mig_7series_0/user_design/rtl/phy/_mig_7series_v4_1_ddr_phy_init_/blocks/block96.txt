Comment: 
This block is a synchronous sequential logic primarily responsible for controlling the writing process into a complex_row0 component. Actions within this block are triggered at every positive edge of the clock. If a reset signal is sent, or the pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) read level is completed, or particular write conditions are met, then the 'complex_row0_wr_done' signal is marked false after a delay defined by 'TCQ'. Meanwhile, if first-stage read level is done and read/write count in stage1 is equals to 2, then 'complex_row0_wr_done' signal is flagged true after same 'TCQ' delay.
