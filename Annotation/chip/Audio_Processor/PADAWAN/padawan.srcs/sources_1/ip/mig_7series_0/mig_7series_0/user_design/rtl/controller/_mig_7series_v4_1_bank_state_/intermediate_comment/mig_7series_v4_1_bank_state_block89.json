    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for initializing the `start_rcd` signal. The value of `start_rcd` is assigned to whatever the current value of `start_rcd_lcl` is, meaning it's directly copying the state of `start_rcd_lcl` to `start_rcd`. This is achieved using the `assign` keyword, which continuously assigns the value of the right-hand side expression to the left-hand side net."
