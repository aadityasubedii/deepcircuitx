    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a synchronous logic chain that controls the reset and enable states of the signal 'pi_dqs_found_done_r1'. The chain operates based on rising edge clock signal. On a rise of the clock signal, if the reset signal (rst) is set, the signal 'pi_dqs_found_done_r1' is asynchronously reset to 0 using the clock period defined by #TCQ. Otherwise, the signal 'pi_dqs_found_done_r1' is set equal to the 'pi_dqs_found_done' value at the next rising clock edge, effectively serving as a latch mechanism for the 'pi_dqs_found_done' signal. This control mechanism is crucial for synchronous systems to manage their state transitions accurately."
