    "block_comment": "This block implements a logical OR operation to calculate the output of on-die termination (odt) for memory channel 1 in a memory controller. It uses the third bit of the auxiliary output \"mc_aux_out0\", the first bit of the regulated auxiliary outputs \"mc_aux_out_r\", \"mc_aux_out_r_1\" and \"mc_aux_out_r_2\" as inputs. The odt control bit \"mc_odt[1]\" is assigned a value of 1 if any of these input signals are high (1), otherwise, it is assigned a value of 0."
