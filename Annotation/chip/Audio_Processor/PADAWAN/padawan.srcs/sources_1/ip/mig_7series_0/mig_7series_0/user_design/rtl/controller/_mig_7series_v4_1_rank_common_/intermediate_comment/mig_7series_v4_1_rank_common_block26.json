    "block_comment": "This line of code is used for signal assignment within the Verilog code. In implementation, it assigns the value of the local maintenance request flag (maint_req_r_lcl) to the main maintenance request register (maint_req_r). This implementation can be used to control hardware actions or conditions such as triggering a maintenance action if required, based on the status of maint_req_r_lcl. The use of the assign keyword indicates continuous assignment; hence, the value of maint_req_r will change as soon as the value of maint_req_r_lcl changes."
