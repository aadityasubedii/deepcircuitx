Comment: 
This block is responsible for the dynamic assignment of the `phy_dout` via two loops differentiated based on the value of `CS_MAP[12*m+:4]`. If this value is less than 'hA, it is handled by the first loop. `phy_dout` is assigned from the index calculated using multiple parts of the `CS_MAP` variable and an offset 'n' to the `mux_cs_n` array. Similarly, if the value is not less than 'hA, it is handled by the second loop where the assigning process is similar but with a slightly different formula for calculating the index of `phy_dout`.
