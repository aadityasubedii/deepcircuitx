Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is designed to update register values on every rising edge of the clock signal (Function of the block). It uses non-blocking assignments with delay modeled by TCQ to synchronously update the dqs_po_dec_done, wr_level_done_r1 through wr_level_done_r5, wl_po_coarse_cnt, and wl_po_fine_cnt registers. The code also handles a loop for the bit fields based on DQS_WIDTH, which updates wl_po_coarse_cnt and wl_po_fine_cnt, taking into account the rank and oclkdelay_calib_done conditions (Implementation details of the block).
