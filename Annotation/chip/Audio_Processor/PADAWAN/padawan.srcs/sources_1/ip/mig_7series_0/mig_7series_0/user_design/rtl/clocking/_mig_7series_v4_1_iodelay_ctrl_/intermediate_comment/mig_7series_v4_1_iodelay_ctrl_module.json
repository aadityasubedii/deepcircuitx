    "module": "Module-level comment: This module, mig_7series_v4_1_iodelay_ctrl, primarily manages I/O delay (IODELAY) specifically in the Memory Interface Generator (MIG) for 7-series FPGAs. It handles clock and reset signals, buffering, and delay management. Inputs consist of clock signals and a system reset signal, while outputs are processed clock signals, system reset output, and delay control readiness status. The implementation uses differential or single-end clock inputs, MMCM blocks for clock frequency generation, and internal signals to achieve the desired functionality. The module is structured with several code blocks, each performing crucial functions like clock buffer management, resetting mechanisms, and delaying synchronizations."
