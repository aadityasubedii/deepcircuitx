    "block_comment": "This block of code forms a latch that is updated at each positive edge of the clock signal. In each clock cycle, when the clock signal 'clk' transitions from low to high, the value of 'complex_row1_rd_done' is assigned after a delay of '#TCQ' units, to the variable 'complex_row_id_done_r1'. Note, TCQ represents technology-specific cell delay which factored into the latch operation."
