    "block_comment": "This block is a conditional sequence of counters for a clock cycle. Its function is established based on the rising edge of the clock ('clk') and counters ('tap_cnt_cpt_r') that are updated according to specified conditions. If a reset ('rst') occurs, or new count capture ('new_cnt_cpt_r') is triggered, or both the first level of MPR read level ('mpr_rdlvl_done_r1') is complete and the second level is not yet complete, then the tap counter is reset to zero. If the delay calibration is complete ('cal1_dlyce_cpt_r'), the tap counter is incremented when a delay increment capture ('cal1_dlyinc_cpt_r') happens, and decremented only if it's not already zero. The update operation is modelled with a delay '#TCQ' which implies the real-life delay that might occur in a hardware system. The described design allows the block to perform dynamic calibration actions on the signals."
