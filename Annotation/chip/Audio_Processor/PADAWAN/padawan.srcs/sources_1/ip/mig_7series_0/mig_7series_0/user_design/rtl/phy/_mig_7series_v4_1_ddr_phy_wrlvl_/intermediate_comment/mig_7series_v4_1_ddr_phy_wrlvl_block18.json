    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a loop that iterates over a variable, \"wr_i\", from 0 to \"DQS_WIDTH-1\". Inside each iteration, it executes code in a begin-end block that is executed at every positive edge of the clock signal. Each iteration of the loop effectively creates a new hardware instance, or 'tap', due to the generate statement. The name of each hardware instance is uniquely defined by adding the iterator value to the end of 'gen_final_tap'."
