    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is intended to serve as a configuration switch, specifically for setting up write leveling calibration for a memory system. Depending on two conditions, \"WRLVL\" being \"ON\" and \"BYPASS_COMPLEX_OCAL\" being \"FALSE\", the block assigns four variables with appropriate signals for calibration. When the conditions are not met, default values are assigned instead, effectively bypassing complex calibration procedures."
