    "block_comment": "This block of code implements a register update in always block for the write data offset. Based on the sensitivity list, any change in 'wr_data_offset' triggers the always block, updating the 'wr_data_offset_r' with the changed value of 'wr_data_offset'. This is a classic application of always blocks in Verilog, which can be used to model behavior in response to changes in specific signals."
