Comment: 
This block carries out signal matching on both rising and falling edges of a pattern for a synchronous digital system. At every positive clock edge, eight separate signal match conditions are evaluated, each resolution subjected to a time constraint TCQ, for four seperate rises and falls. The values are concurrently assigned to eight registers. Finally, a single data match is evaluated as the logical AND of all these matches, ensuring every individual condition has been met. The result is stored in 'pat1_data_match_r' register which will be high only if all the conditions are met. This allows triggering actions based on specific combinations of inputs.
