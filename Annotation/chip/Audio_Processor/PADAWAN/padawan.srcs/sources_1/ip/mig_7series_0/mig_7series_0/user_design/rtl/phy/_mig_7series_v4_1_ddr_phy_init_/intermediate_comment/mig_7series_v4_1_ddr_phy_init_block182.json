    "block_comment": "This block of code resets a write leveling rank counter every positive clock cycle. In detail, \"wrlvl_rank_cntr\" is assigned at the positive edge of the clock signal \"clk\". The timing control statement \"#TCQ\" specifies the output to change 3 clock cycles after the input changes, and \"3'd0\" is the decimal representation of \"0\" in 3-bit binary number, indicating the counter is reset to 0."
