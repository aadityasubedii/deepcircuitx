Comment: 
This block is responsible for setting the value of the variable `read_this_rank_r1` on the positive edge of the CLK signal. The delay `#TCQ` indicates that the assignment of the value of `read_this_rank_r` to `read_this_rank_r1` will occur a certain time `TCQ` after the rising edge of CLK signal. The routine is written in always block with a posedge triggered event, making it a classic example of a typical flip-flop implementation in Verilog RTL code.
