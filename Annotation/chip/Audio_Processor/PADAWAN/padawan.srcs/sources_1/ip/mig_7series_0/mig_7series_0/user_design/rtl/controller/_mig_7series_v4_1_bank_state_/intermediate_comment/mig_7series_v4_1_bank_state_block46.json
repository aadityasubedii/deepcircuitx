    "block_comment": "This block of code calculates the number of recovery clocks (nRP_CLKS) required depending on the number of clock periods per clock cycle (nCK_PER_CLK). If nCK_PER_CLK is 1, the number of recovery clocks is equal to the number of precharge commands (nRP). If nCK_PER_CLK is 2, the value of nRP is divided by 2 and rounded up. If nCK_PER_CLK is greater than 2, the number of recovery clocks equals the quartered nRP value, rounded up. Thus, the block dynamically determines the recovery time based on the clock speed."
