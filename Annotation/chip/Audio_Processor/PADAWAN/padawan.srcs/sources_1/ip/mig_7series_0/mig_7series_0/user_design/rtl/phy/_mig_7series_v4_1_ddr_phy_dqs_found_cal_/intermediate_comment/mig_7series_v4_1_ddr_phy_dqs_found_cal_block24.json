    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for resetting a stage 1 calibration process for a memory interface's per-bit deskewing mechanism. This operation is controlled by several inputs like a global reset (rst), a feedback signal (pi_rst_stg1_cal_r1[1]) and an adjustment signal (fine_adjust) indicating that it is another re-calibration round. If any of these signals is high, the calibration process will be reset immediately. However, it also resets the calibration if certain conditions are met: either a start detection is completed just now, or some but not all banks are calibrated, or an offset parameter derived from read databytes falls below a value calculated from CAS latencies. The condition check and following reset operation are triggered at the rising edge of the system clock."
