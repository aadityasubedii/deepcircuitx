    "block_comment": "This block defines a function named `mod_sub` that performs a modulus subtraction between two inputs `a` and `b`. In the implementation, it checks the condition whether `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If so, it subtracts `b` from `a`. If not, it adds the `base` to `a` and then subtracts `b`. The operation is completed under a defined bit-width equal to the `TAPCNTRWIDTH` and over a particular integer `base`. The result of this operation is returned as `mod_sub`."
