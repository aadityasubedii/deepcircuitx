This block manages column addressing during memory access in a DDR3 burst mode operation. The 'generate' and 'if' conditions ensure this module only applies for a specific memory type (DDR3) and burst mode 8, in a clock configuration where nCK_PER_CLK is 1. A 2-bit register 'granted_col_d_r' is used to keep track of the currently granted column address. The next state of this register 'granted_col_d_ns' is determined by 'sent_col' and the most significant bit of the current state of the register.
