This block of code is used to initialize control and status signals if the HIGHEST_BANK is greater than 1. It achieves its function by assigning fixed values to several variables, these variables include zero-assignments to various PHY control data and flag signals and sets few of the enable flags as per requirements. Additionally, it assigns '1' to byte_rd_en_v and 4'b1111 to pi_phase_locked_lanes and pi_dqs_found_lanes which might be indicating some setup for lanes if the bank number is high.
