Comment: 
The block in question governs the generation of periodic read signals in the hardware. The function implemented within the block checks if the divider value for the periodic read timer (PERIODIC_RD_TIMER_DIV) isn't zero. Within this verification, it defines a register (read_this_rank) to control read operations per rank basis, optimising resource usage.
