    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the values of various signals to error monitoring variables within the design. `pi_phase_locked_err` is assigned the value of `phase_locked_err`, `pi_dqsfound_err` is assigned the value of `pi_dqs_found_err` and `wrcal_err` is assigned the value of `wrcal_pat_err`. Moreover, the signal `rst_tg_mc` is forced to a constant low state ('0'). These assignments represent direct mappings between different signals in the circuit, with no computation involved. The error monitoring variables capture the state of certain errors, and `rst_tg_mc` signal is most likely used to reset some part of the design."
