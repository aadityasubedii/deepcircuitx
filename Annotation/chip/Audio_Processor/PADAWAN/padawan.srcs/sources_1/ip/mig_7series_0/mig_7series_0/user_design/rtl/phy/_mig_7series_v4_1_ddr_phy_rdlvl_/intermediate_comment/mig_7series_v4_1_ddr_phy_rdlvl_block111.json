    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for dividing a read data signal into two frequency divisions - by 4 and by 2. The code checks whether the number of clock cycles per clock (nCK_PER_CLK) is equal to 4. If true, it splits the 'rd_data' signal into four parts (rise and fall states each for four cycles), if not, it assumes division by 2 and splits the data into two parts (rise and fall states for two cycles). The division is achieved using bit-wise selection from the 'rd_data' vector which is inherently a parallel process."
