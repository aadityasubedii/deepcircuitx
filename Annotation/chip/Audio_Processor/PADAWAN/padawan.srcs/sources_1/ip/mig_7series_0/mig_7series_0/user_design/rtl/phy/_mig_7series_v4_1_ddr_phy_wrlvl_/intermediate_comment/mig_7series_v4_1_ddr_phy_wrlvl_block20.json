    "block_comment": "The block of code manages read/write levels for a memory array under different conditions. Upon receipt of a reset signal, it sets the smallest and largest tap values for each DQS array to 0. Thereafter, depending on state variables and Boolean flags, this code block adjusts smallest and largest timing taps for DQS or 'Data-strobe' lines. These registers are used for memory operations (write leveling specifically) by tracking the timing taps required for each DQS line. The code handles different conditions such as Read/Write leveling count state, 2 Rank Tap Decrement state, if the memory is in a fast calibration mode, or if write leveling is not completed for one of the ranks. This ensures that the memory operations remain synchronized with the clock, improving the performance and reliability of the memory system."
