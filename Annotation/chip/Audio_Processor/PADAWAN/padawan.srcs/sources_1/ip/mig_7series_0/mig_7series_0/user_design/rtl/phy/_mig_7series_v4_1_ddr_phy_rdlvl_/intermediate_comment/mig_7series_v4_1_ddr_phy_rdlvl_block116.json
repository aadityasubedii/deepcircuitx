    "block_comment": "This block of code is primarily handling stage done and count assignments depending on different DRAM types, OCAL_EN settings and PI_DIV2_INCDEC settings. The first part assigns values from latch variables rdlvl_rank_done_r and mpr_rank_done_r to rdlvl_stg1_rnk_done and mpr_rnk_done. The block further implements a ternary operation to assign mpr_rdlvl_done based on whether DRAM_TYPE is \"DDR3\" and OCAL_EN is \"ON\". The second part of the block assigns pi_stg2_rdlvl_cnt based on a combination of the PI_DIV2_INCDEC flag and the states of the cal1_state_r3 and cal1_state_r registers. The final stage handling rdlvl_stg1_done and rdlvl_last_byte_done assignments are done similarly based on the PI_DIV2_INCDEC setting. This ensures different stages and counts are properly assigned according to different hardware settings and states."
