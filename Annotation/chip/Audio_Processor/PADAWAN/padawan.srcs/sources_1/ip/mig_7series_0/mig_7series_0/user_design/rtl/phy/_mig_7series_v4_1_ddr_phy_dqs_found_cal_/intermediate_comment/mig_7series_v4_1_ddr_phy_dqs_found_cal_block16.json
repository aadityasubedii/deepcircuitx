    "block_comment": "This block generates the offset for read byte data in a DDR system. In the event of a reset, the offset for each rank of memory is set to a constant value based on the CAS latency, additional latency, and a predefined constant. If no reset is present, then the offset is adjusted based on certain conditions. One condition involves a finished rank and the absence of a 'DQS found' initialization signal, or if the current offset is insufficient compared to the minimum required by the CAS latency and additional latency. Another situation adjusts the offset down by one when a 'start DQS found' signal and 'fine adjust' signal are received, but not all banks have a 'DQS found', and a 'DQS found' is detected in the PI. The delay value is defined by the time CAS quantity."
