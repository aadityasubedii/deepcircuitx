    "block_comment": "This block of code is a sequential block used to drive delay control signals in a circuit. When a reset (`rst`) is provided, all delay control signals (`idelay_ce_r1`, `idelay_ce_r2`, `idelay_inc_r1`, `idelay_inc_r2`) are reset synchronously with the clock edge, thus effectively resetting the delay elements of the circuit. In non-reset conditions, these delay control signals are updated with internal signals (`idelay_ce_int`, `idelay_inc_int`) or their previous states (`idelay_ce_r1`, `idelay_inc_r1`) in a pipelined manner. This ensures a staggered response and precise control over delay elements of the circuit."
