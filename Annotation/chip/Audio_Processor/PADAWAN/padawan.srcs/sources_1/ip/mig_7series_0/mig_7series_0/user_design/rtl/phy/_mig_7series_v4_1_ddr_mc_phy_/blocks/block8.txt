Comment: 
This block of Verilog code handles the auxiliary output signal update. It performs this functionality synchronized on either the positive edge of the auxiliary output clock or the positive edge of the auxiliary reset signal. Upon the reset signal, the 9th and 11th elements of the 'aux_out' array are set to zero with a delay of 100 time units. If there is no reset, the values at these indices are updated with the corresponding values from the 'aux_out_' array, again with a 100 time unit delay.
