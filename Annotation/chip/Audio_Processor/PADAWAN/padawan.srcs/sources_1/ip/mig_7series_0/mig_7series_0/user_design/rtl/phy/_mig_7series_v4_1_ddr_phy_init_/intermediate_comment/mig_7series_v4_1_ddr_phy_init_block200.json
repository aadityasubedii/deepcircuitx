    "block_comment": "This block is a sequential circuit controlling the start signals for different stages of a Read Leveling (RDLVL) operation in a memory controller. Upon a positive clock edge and if reset(`rst`) is active, all start signals are set to '0'. If reset is not active, based on certain conditions like `pi_dqs_found_done`, `cnt_cmd_done_r`, `init_state_r` values and `WRLVL` on state, different start signals, including `rdlvl_stg1_start_int`, `rdlvl_start_pre` and `prbs_rdlvl_start`, are set to '1'. The start signal for the first stage of Read Leveling(`rdlvl_stg1_start`) also takes input from a delay line(`rdlvl_start_dly0_r[14]`)."
