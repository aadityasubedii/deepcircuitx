    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is designed to work as a counter control mechanism. It responds to the rising edge of the system clock. If a reset is detected, the counter (incdec_wait_cnt) is reset to zero. Alternatively, if any of the three conditions are met, the counter is incremented by one. If none of these conditions are met during a clock cycle, the counter is reset to zero. The conditions are checking if the system's state is in either WL_FINE_DEC_WAIT1, WL_INIT_FINE_DEC_WAIT1, or WL_CORSE_INC_WAIT_TMP."
