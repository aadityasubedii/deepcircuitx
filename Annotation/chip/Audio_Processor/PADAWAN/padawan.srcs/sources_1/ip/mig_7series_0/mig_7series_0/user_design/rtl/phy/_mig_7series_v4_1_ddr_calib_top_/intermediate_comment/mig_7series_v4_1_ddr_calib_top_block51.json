    "block_comment": "This block generates multiple digital signals required for the control of various stages in a memory hardware design. Using a generate loop, five distinct signals are assigned for each iteration, indexed by the variable 'i'. Signals 'po_sel_stg2stg3[i]', 'po_stg2_c_incdec[i]', 'po_en_stg2_c[i]', 'po_stg2_f_incdec[i]', 'po_en_stg2_f[i]' are conditional assignments, setting the value of the signal based on the outcome of the logical or comparison of multiple other signals. The different conditions in assignments represent different scenario of control signals like calibration done signals, command signals, debug signals, and other miscellaneous control signals."
