Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for resetting the registers ififo_rst and ofifo_rst in a clock cycle. On the rising edge of the physical clock phy_clk, it performs a reset on these two registers. The ififo_rst is reset when either pi_rst_dqs_find is asserted or if_rst signal is activated. Similarly, for ofifo_rst, a reset is performed when pi_rst_dqs_find and PO_DATA_CTL are both TRUE or when the rst signal is set.
