    "block_comment": "The block of code is responsible for updating the value of the signal 'edge_center_r' at the positive edge of the clock 'clk'. The new value for 'edge_center_r' originates from a non-blocking assignment '#TCQ edge_center_ns', where '#TCQ' denotes time delay before assignment. The clocked process ensures the simultaneous update of values to maintain timing behaviour according to the synchronous digital system."
