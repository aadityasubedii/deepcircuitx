Comment: 
This line is a continuous assignment statement that assigns the value of 'po_stg23_sel_r' to the output signal 'po_stg23_sel'. This means that whenever there's a change in the value of 'po_stg23_sel_r', it gets immediately reflected in the 'po_stg23_sel'. It provides a way to propagate the updated value of 'po_stg23_sel_r' ahead into the computation pipeline.
