    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for the calibration of both the Clock-Enable (calib_cke) and On-Die Termination (calib_odt) features considering different scenarios. It displays how the system should react under diverse initialization states and DRAM types. At the positive edge of the clock, if there is a reset, it will set both calib_cke and calib_odt to their baseline values. It then handles different scenarios under various DRAM types, setting the outputs relevantly. There are also conditional checks for nCK_PER_CLK and multiple initialization states to decipher whether to choose from the current calibration or the temporary storage. This decision-making is for fine-tuning calibration details."
