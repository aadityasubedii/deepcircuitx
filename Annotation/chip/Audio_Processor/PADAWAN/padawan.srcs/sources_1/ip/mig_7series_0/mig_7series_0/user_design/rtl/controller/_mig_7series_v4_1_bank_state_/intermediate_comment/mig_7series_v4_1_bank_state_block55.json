    "block_comment": "This block defines a wire `op_active` that indicates whether the operation associated with this wire is active or not. It becomes active when the system is not reset (`~rst`), not passing open bank (`~passing_open_bank`), and either `end_rtp_lcl` is true or `tail_r` is true; this reflects the logic operations (`&&` and `||`). This condition combines multiple key signals, providing a control mechanism for operations within the design."
