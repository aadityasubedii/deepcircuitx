    "block_comment": "The given block of Verilog RTL code functions as an async-reset synchronous set flip-flop. It controls the state of the 'wrcal_done' signal based on the conditions given. If either 'rst' (reset) is high or there's a positive edge detected with 'wrcal_sanity_chk' being true and 'wrcal_sanity_chk_r' being false, it will reset the 'wrcal_done' signal to 0 after some delay (#TCQ). On the other hand, if 'cal2_done_r' becomes true, it will set 'wrcal_done' to 1 after the same delay. This block ensures correct signal sequencing in the module it's a part of."
