    "block_comment": "The block of code is a state machine that is primarily involved in detecting edges and counting eye sizes within a bounded region, namely the 'z' index value. It is implemented using various flip-flops with edge-triggered actions. It's structure is primarily two nested if-else blocks, the outer sensitive to 'pb_detect_edge' and the inner contingent on 'pb_detect_edge_done_r[z]'. Based upon these conditions, various flags are set and updated such as 'pb_found_stable_eye_r[z]' and 'pb_last_tap_jitter_r[z]'. A special condition allows for incrementing of the 'pb_cnt_eye_size_r[z]' counter or setting of special flags. To summarize, this block appears to be involved in some form of signal or communication processing, particularly in edge detection and jitter measurement."
