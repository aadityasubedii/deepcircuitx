    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is used to generate read data values across specified data width and clock phase. It uses nested generate loops to implement this function. Firstly, the outer loop iterates through each data width (DQ_WIDTH), while the inner loop iterates through each clock phase (PHASE_PER_CLK). For every iteration, a specific read data ('rd_data') value is assigned, calculated using a complex combination of pre-defined constants and variables, specifically the 'phy_din' and 'FULL_DATA_MAP' which are combined and multiplied by particular factors to ensure the correct result."
