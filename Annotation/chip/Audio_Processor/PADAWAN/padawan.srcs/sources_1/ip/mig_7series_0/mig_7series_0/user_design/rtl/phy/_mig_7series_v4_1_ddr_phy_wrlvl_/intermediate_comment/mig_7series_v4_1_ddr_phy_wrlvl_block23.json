    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles register assignments within a clock cycle for an RTL design. On the positive edge of the clock, if the reset signal is high, all arrays - add_smallest, add_largest, and final_coarse_tap - are reset to 0. If there's a rising edge for 'wr_level_done', and 'oclkdelay_calib_done' is low, every element in the arrays is updated from 'wl_corse_cnt' and then reset. If 'wl_corse_cnt' readings from two dimensions match, they are assigned to 'final_coarse_tap', and the arrays are reset. Additionally, if the 'wl_corse_cnt' reading from the first dimension is smaller, 'final_coarse_tap' is updated, 'add_largest' is selectively assigned based on the 'wl_corse_cnt', and vice versa."
