    "block_comment": "This block initializes the specific DDR PHY Register Read Leveling (rdlvl) parameters when the rdlvl procedure is not active. Every defined variable is set to its default value; this includes the completion signals for the PRBS stage and last byte of read leveling, any requests to precharge Read Leveling, incrementers for PRBS PI stage and count registers. It also initializes debug parameters (which are data strobe width and rank based) to their default values. Final DQS tap count, first and second edge taps are all reset. Similarly, the flags that check if complex PI increment/decrement is done and if complex PI initial decrement is done are also reset/set respectively. Finally, the flag to check if the required number of samples are done is also reset."
