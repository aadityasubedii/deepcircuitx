Comment: 
This block is a memory write function. Activated by the rising edge of the clock signal, this function writes the input data ("d_in") to memory ("mem") at the designated write pointer ("wr_ptr") location whenever the write enable signal ("wr_en") is asserted. The write operation is performed with a delay specified by the value of TCQ.
