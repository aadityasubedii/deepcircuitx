Comment: 
This block establishes a timer for periodic read operations. It is activated when the 'PERIODIC_RD_TIMER_DIV' parameter is greater than zero. The 'periodic_read_request' block uses multiple registers and wires to handle signals related to periodic reading. A counter, 'periodic_rd_r_cnt', counts the read requests, and 'int_periodic_rd_ack_r' acknowledges these requests when the counter is valid. Another register 'upd_last_master_r' and wire 'periodic_rd_busy' work to indicate if the periodic read operation is currently busy. Wire 'upd_last_master_ns' is an update signal, enabled after calibration is completed ('init_calib_complete') and when there is a read request and the read operation is not busy.
