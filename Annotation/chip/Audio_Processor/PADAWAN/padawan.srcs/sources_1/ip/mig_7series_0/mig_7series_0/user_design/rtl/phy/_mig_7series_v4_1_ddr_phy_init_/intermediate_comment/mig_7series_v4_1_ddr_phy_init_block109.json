    "block_comment": "This block handles the control of a write operation under specific conditions. It's an always block that triggers at the positive edge of the clock signal. If a reset signal ('rst') is detected, the 'wr_victim_inc' is set to 0 after an explicit delay specified by #TCQ. If a complex row write completion and the count of read and write operations equals 2 (indicating a specific state) and no stage 1 write operation is in progress, 'wr_victim_inc' is set to 1 indicating the need for an incremented write operation. In all other cases, 'wr_victim_inc' remains 0."
