Module-level comment: The module "mig_7series_v4_1_poc_cc" is a critical part of a Memory Interface Generator system, dealing with edge alignment, phase offset correction, and error monitoring with debugging support in memory controller generation processes. It utilizes numerous input signals to control and monitor various functionality stages, and it provides outputs indicating the state checks and recorded debug info. The module makes use of state and registered signals to analyze, keep track of and control operations at every clock cycle. It also features a characterization process to transform samples and dedicated debugging section to track progress.
