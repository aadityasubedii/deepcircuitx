    "block_comment": "The block is a state machine that governs the operation of stage-3 tap counter in a digital circuit. Upon a rising edge clock signal, if the system reset state is active or if the limit state is idle or in an initialization phase, the stage-3 tap counter is set to an initial value. Alternatively, if the limit state is in the third stage increment or the third stage decrement, the counter respectively increments or decrements. This block aids in the management of the data flow through the circuit by adjusting the counter value under various operational states."
