    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the selection of read data based on a bypass condition. The wire, 'app_rd_data_ns', is assigned the value of 'rd_data' when the bypass condition is true and retrieves the output data from a buffer 'rd_buf_out_data' when the bypass condition is false. The operation performed by this block is essentially a multiplexer or a switch, which helps to decide the source of data between direct read data ('rd_data') or through a buffer ('rd_buf_out_data')."
