Line number: 
[456, 461]
Comment: 
The block provides a function for ceiling division of two integers. It takes two integers as input parameters, divides the first integer (num) by the second integer (div), and finds the quotient. If there's a remainder (num modulo div is greater than zero), it increases the quotient by one. This essentially rounds up the result, hence achieving the ceiling division.
