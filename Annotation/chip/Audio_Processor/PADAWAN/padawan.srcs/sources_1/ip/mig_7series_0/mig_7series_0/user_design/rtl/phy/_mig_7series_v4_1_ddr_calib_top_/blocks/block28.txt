Comment: 
This block of code declares and initializes a wire named `init_wrcal_complete` to a binary value 0. The `assign` keyword in Verilog is used to continuously drive a variable (in this case, our wire `init_wrcal_complete`) with a value. The implementation of this function is fairly straight-forward and does not involve complex operations. The wire `init_wrcal_complete` will hold the value 0 until it is driven by another value, probably elsewhere in the code.
