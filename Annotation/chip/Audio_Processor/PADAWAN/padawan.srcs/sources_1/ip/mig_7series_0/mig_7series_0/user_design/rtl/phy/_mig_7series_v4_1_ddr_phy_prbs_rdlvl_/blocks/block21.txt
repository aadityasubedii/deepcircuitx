This block is a synchronous sequential circuit that captures the left_edge and right_edge values referenced by the `ref_bit` index at each rising edge of the clock signal. The code uses non-blocking assignment to register the values of `left_edge_pb` and `right_edge_pb`, which are most likely slices of larger arrays. The `#TCQ` in front of the assignments indicates a delay for testability in simulation, which does not affect the functionality of the design in any way but is often used to allow certain events to occur before the assignments. The amount of delay corresponds to `TCQ` (Time Clock to Output).
