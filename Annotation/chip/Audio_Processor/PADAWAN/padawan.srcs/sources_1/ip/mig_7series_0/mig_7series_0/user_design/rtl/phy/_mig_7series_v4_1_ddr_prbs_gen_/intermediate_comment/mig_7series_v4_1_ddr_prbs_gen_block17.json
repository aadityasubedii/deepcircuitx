    "block_comment": "This function calculates the base 2 logarithm of an integer, rounded up to the nearest integer. The function subtracts one from the input size initially. Then it enters a loop, which only concludes when the size is reduced to 1 or less. During each iteration of the loop, it executes a right shift operation on the size, effectively dividing it by 2, and increments the function's return value."
