This block is responsible for initialization of some arrays at the positive edge of a clock cycle. Specifically, the block uses a loop that iterates for the range of DQS_WIDTH. During each iteration, the block sets the 'w'th index of final_coarse_tap array to the corresponding index of wl_corse_cnt array with some delay defined by #TCQ, and initializes the 'w'th index of add_smallest and add_largest arrays to 0. The indexing and iteration of arrays is achieved using loop variable 'w'.
