    "block_comment": "This block of code is designed to sample data at the rising edge of a clock signal (Function). To achieve this, the `always @(posedge clk)` statement is used. This statement ensures that whenever there is a rising edge (or 'positive edge') in the clock signal, the immediate data present on 'q1' is sampled and stored in the 'pos_edge_samp' register after a delay of `#TCQ` (Implementation)."
