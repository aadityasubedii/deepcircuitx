Comment: 
This block is responsible for transferring data, mask, write-enable, and end signal at the rising edge of the clock signal. These are implemented using non-blocking assignments, which ensure that all signals are updated simultaneously at the end of the 'always' block, without any intermediate change. The delay of the operation is defined by the value of TCQ, which acts as the clock-to-Q delay.
