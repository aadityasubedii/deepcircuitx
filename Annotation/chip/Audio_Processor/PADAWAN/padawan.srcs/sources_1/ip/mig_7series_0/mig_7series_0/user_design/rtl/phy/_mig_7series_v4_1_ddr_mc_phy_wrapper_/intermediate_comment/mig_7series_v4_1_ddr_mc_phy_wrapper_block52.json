    "block_comment": "The function `generate_bytelanes_ddr_ck` generates byte lanes for DDR clock signals. It takes a 144-bit wide input value `ck_byte_map` and produces a 72-bit wide output. Using a for-loop, which iterates through the width of the clock signal, it checks the value of `CK_BYTE_MAP` at certain positions and accordingly assigns the bit value to the respective positions in the output vector `generate_bytelanes_ddr_ck`. If `CK_BYTE_MAP` value is 2, the bits are assigned in the position between [48-71], if value is 1, the bits are assigned in position between [24-47] and if neither, they are assigned in position [0-23]."
