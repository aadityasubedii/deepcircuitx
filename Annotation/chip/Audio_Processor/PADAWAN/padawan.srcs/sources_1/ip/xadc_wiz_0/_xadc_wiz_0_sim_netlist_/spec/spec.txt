Module name: xadc_wiz_0 and glbl. 

Module specification: 

The module "xadc_wiz_0" is a hardware definition for the Xilinx Analog-to-Digital Converter (XADC) designed to interpret vibration and voltage data through various input ports such as "daddr_in", "dclk_in" and "di_in". This module outputs data through the "busy_out", "do_out" and alarm signals which indicate that the XADC is converting a sample, data output availability, and violations of temperature and voltage limits respectively. It uses internal signals such as "NLW_inst_JTAGBUSY_UNCONNECTED", which is an unused JTAG busy wire and "NLW_inst_ALM_UNCONNECTED" which is an unconnected alarm wire. 

The module "glbl" is another unit that manages global processes in Xilinx projects. It uses signals like GSR (Global Set/Reset), PRLD (Parallel Load), and GTS (Global Tri-State) which are used to initiate or reset the design, load initial values, and tri-state all the outputs respectively. This module does not have any input ports but uses output ports related to JTAG such as "JTAG_TDO_GLBL", "JTAG_TCK_GLBL", and "JTAG_USER_TDO2_GLBL". The "glbl" module also uses internal signals such as "GSR_int", "PRLD_int", and the JTAG signals for their respective operations in the JTAG state machine.

The "xadc_wiz_0" specifically, has a distinct block in the code where an instance of the XADC is declared and all its parameters and connections are defined thoroughly. The "glbl" module incorporates initial blocks which define the initial conditions for the design and the control signals. Both of these modules together collaborate to execute their respective tasks for maintaining the operability of a Xilinx project.
