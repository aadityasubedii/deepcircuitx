    "module": "Module-level comment: This is the 'xadc_wiz_0' module, a Verilog RTL block serving as an XADC wrapper for simplifying analog-digital conversion tasks. The inputs include data, control signals, and analog values, while outputs report conversion status and output data. Internally, the module uses wires to handle auxiliary inputs and alarm signals. The module's core functionality comes from an XADC instance with pre-set parameters, performing ADC operations in accordance to input signals, and generating accurate output data and conversion status indicators."
