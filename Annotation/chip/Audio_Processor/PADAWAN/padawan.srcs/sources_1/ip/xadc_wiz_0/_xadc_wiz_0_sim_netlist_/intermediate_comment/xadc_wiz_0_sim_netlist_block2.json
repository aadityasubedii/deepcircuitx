    "block_comment": "This block in Verilog is an initialization block which sets the initial states of two internal signals: GSR_int and PRLD_int. It begins by setting both signals GSR_int and PRLD_int to high ('1') and after a delay specified by the parameter ROC_WIDTH, both signals are set back low ('0'). The delay functionality provided by the '#(ROC_WIDTH)' causes a temporal pause before the following two statements are executed in the initial block. These signals could potentially be used as control signals for the operation of the whole design."
