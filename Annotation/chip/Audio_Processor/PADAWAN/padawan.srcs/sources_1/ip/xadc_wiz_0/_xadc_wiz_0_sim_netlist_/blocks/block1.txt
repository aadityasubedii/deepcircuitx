Comment: 
This block of code is an initial block used to set up an internal variable GTS_int. It first initializes GTS_int to be high ('1') as soon as the simulation starts. It then waits for a period defined by the time constant TOC_WIDTH, after which it drives GTS_int to low ('0'), simulating a triggering event.
