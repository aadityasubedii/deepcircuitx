Module-level comment: The "xadc_wiz_0" module is a hardware definition for a Xilinx Analog-to-Digital Converter. It obtains voltage and vibration data using input ports and uses this information to output corresponding signals and alarms. "glbl" is a global control module in Xilinx projects, providing global signals such as GSR (Global Set/Reset) and PRLD (Parallel Load) to manage the system state. It also interfaces with JTAG operations using JTAG-related output ports. The two modules cooperate for overall system functionality, with the "xadc_wiz_0" module encapsulating a particular XADC instance, and "glbl" initializing the system state and controlling global processes.
