The module \"xadc_wiz_0\" appears to be hardware definition for an XADC (Xilinx Analog-to-Digital Converter). This module is designed to read vibrations and voltage values through different pins declared in the module. The XADC primitive (xadc_wiz_0) configurations and interfaces are being defined here. \n\n2. The module \"glbl\" is a global module which is often used in Xilinx projects. It contains a initial block to control signals like GSR (Global Set/Reset), PRLD (Parallel Load) and GTS (Global Tri-State).  GSR is used to initialize or reset the design, PRLD is to load up initial values, and GTS can be used to tri-state all the outputs. This module also works with JTAG interfaces. It seems like a standard module which might be used to facilitate simulation testbenches."
