    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nModule \"xadc_wiz_0\" is an interface to an ADC. It handles data transactions, gated by enable and write enable signals, addresses transmitted through a 7-bit input, and clocked by the data clock input. It accepts primary and auxiliary differential analog inputs. The outputs include a 16-bit data output, a 5-bit active channel identifier, busyness, data readiness, end of conversion and sequence indicators and an alarm signal. Implementation details aren't provided in the given code."
