[15:0]di_in: A 16-bit data input port, probably used for digital data input to the module.\n5. dwe_in: This might be data write enable signal, to control whether the module can write data to a specific location or not.\n6. vauxp3, vauxn3: They could be auxiliary differential analog input ports for the module.\n7. vp_in, vn_in: These might be primary differential analog voltage inputs for the module.\n\nOutput Ports:\n1. busy_out: This can be an output port used to indicate that the module is currently processing and is busy.\n2.
