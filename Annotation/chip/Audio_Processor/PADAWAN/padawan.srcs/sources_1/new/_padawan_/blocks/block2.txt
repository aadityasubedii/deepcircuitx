The block of Verilog RTL code serves as an audio signal processor, implementing several effects like Overdrive, Chorus, Tremolo, and outputting to a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal. It utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) for sequential processing at each clock cycle. In the START state, it loads the audio data into a shift register pipeline that is used for implementing the effects. The OVERDRIVE effect limits the audio signal within a certain threshold and amplifies it. The CHORUS effect uses the delayed signals from the pipeline to create a sense of spatial dispersion. The TREMELO effect modulates the volume of the signal over time to create a vibrating effect. The processed audio signal is then output as a PWM signal in the OUTPUT state. Switch commands for the audio effects are read synchronously with the FSM.
