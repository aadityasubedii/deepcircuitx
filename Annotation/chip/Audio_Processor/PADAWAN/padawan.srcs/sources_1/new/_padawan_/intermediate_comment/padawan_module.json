    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThis padawan module is a digital audio effects processor. It uses a 16-bit switch (sw) to control application of overdrive, chorus, and tremelo effects on incoming audio data. Internally, it uses an XADC module for audio data acquisition and several registers for state-based audio data processing, including computational blocks for each effect. The processed audio is driven out via a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) channel and visualized using LEDs. This module is clock driven and structured to work sequentially for real-time audio processing."
