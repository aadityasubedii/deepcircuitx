Explanation: This module seems to be a digital implementation of an audio effect processor, like those used for guitars or other musical instruments. It accepts digital audio input and applies several processing stages on it, namely an overdrive (which will create a distortion effect when the signal surpasses a threshold), a chorus effect (which simulates several sources of the same signal with slight differences), and a tremelo effect (an oscillating increase and decrease in the signal's amplitude). The effects can be independently activated using switch inputs. Finally, it delivers the processed audio data to an output Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) channel. The processed audio data is also forwarded to LEDs for additional user feedback."
