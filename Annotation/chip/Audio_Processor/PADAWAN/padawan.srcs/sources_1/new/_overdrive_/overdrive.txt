Module-level comment: The 'overdrive' module, which currently has no specific functionality, takes an auxiliary input (aux_in) and audio clock (aud_clk) to potentially perform some operation and produce an output (aux_out). The module has no internal signals presently and is currently awaiting implementation details. The potential role of aud_clk could be to synchronize the operation, while aux_in/aux_out could handle the input/output data, respectively.
