Module name: overdrive. 
Module specification: The overdrive module in its current state does not contain any defined functionality as it is empty (excluding the ports declaration). Based on the defined I/O structure, a potential function could be to manipulate an auxiliary input under a synchronized audio clock signal and produce an auxiliary output. The implicit purpose of the input port aud_clk, could be to routinize the frequency of internal operations, while aux_in[10:0] could be an 11-bit incoming data signal for processing. The output port aux_out[10:0] is presumably used to convey the processed auxiliary data outside the module's scope. The module does not currently incorporate any internal signals, which typically hold temporary data or control flow. At this stage, the module consists of only a declaration block for the name of the module and I/O ports. Its functionality would be realized and better defined with the implementation of logic related to the aud_clk, aux_in, and aux_out in the body of the module.
