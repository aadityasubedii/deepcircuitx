    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code defines and initializes a signal `data_ready`. The signal is set to 0 at the start of any simulation run, indicating that data is not yet ready. It is commonly used in the design to signify when data has been processed and is ready for the next stage or module. The code is executed once at the start because of the 'initial' keyword utilization."
