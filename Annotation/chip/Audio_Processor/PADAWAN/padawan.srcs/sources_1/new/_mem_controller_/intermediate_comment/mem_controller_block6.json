    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the enabling condition for an address line in the hardware design. The address line is enabled whenever either the 'playing' or 'recording' signal is high, thus signifies the system is either in playback mode or record mode. This is achieved through the use of the logical OR operator (||), which outputs a high signal when at least one of its operands (here, 'playing' or 'recording') is high.\n"
