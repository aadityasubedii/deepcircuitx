    "block_comment": "This block of code in Verilog handles a state machine for controlling a memory bank with various operations such as recording, playing, and deleting data. At every rising edge of 100MHz clock, the operations are executed based on the state of reset, current state, pulse delay, and counter values. The state transitions such as from 'WAIT' to 'BANK','BANK_ACK', 'INC_BLOCK', and 'DELETE' are handled based on conditions like presence of data and max blocks. During the state 'BANK_ACK', data readiness and counterEnable are manipulated based on the counter value whereas in 'DELETE_ACK' state, RAM and counterEnable are controlled based on delay. The code also handles incrementing and clearing of addresses while manipulating memory banks, ensuring efficient memory utilization."
