Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is a frequency divider. It works by being clocked with a 100 MHz signal and then generating a pulse at approximately 44 MHz. The divider is enabled and reset with a reset signal (rst). When the reset signal is high, the count is reset to 0 and the output pulse is set low. If the count is less than MHz44cnt (the value that would correspond to a 44 MHz output frequency), the count is incremented and the output pulse is set low. When the count hits MHz44cnt, the output pulse is set high, and the counter resets, ready to start again.
