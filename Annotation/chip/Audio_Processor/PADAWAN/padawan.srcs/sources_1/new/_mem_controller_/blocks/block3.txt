This block of code handles the control signal for write enable (RamWEn) in a RAM module. It uses rising edge clocking scheme in which the write enable control signal assignment takes place at the positive edge of a 100MHz clock. RamWEn is assigned the value of WEn_d1 signal every time when a positive clock edge is detected.
