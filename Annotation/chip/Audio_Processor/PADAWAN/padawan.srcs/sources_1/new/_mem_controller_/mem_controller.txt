Module-level comment: The `mem_ctrl` module is a memory controller for an audio application. It handles recording, playing, and deleting of audio tracks, storing them in distinct memory blocks. The module uses a 100MHz clock for operations timing, multiple signals for operations control, and a state machine for managing varied operational states. The flow of the states is controlled by numerous registers and condition checks within always@ blocks. Memory block addressing, data writing (including zeroing out memory), and data reception and availability are managed through respective I/O ports and internal signals.
