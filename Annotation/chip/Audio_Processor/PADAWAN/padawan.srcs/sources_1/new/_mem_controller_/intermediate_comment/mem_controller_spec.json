    "spec": "Module name: mem_ctrl. \n\nModule specification: The `mem_ctrl` module is a memory control unit designed for audio/music applications. Its primary functionalities include handling playing, recording, and deleting operations on audio stored in a memory block. In specific, it assigns addresses for memory blocks, manages recording and playback across multiple banks, implements deletion for specified banks, and controls increment conditions. Delay, addressing modes contingent on whether audio is being recorded or played, and various modes of operation states are also managed in the module.\n\nThe input ports of the mem_ctrl module are clk_100MHz (system clock for timed operations), rst (reset signal), playing, recording (8-bit ports indicating which track is played/recorded), delete (a deletion operation signal), delete_bank (3-bit port for delete operation's bank), and max_block (23-bit port showing maximum addressable block for storing audio data). Output ports include delete_clear (indication signal for completed deletion operation), RamCEn, RamOEn, RamWEn (control signals for memory chip access), write_zero (indicates when to delete/write zeroes in memory), get_data, data_ready, mix_data (signals for data management), addrblock44khz (23-bit register indicating memory address for a 44kHz audio data block), mem_block_addr (memory block address for read/write operations), and mem_bank (3-bit register showing memory bank for storing audio data).\n\nInternal signals include address_enable (controls when addresses can be updated), count (13-bit register that functions as a counter), pstate and nstate (5-bit and 4-bit registers storing current and next state of the finite state machine controlling the module), delay_done (indicates completion of a delay), counterEnable (enables/disables the counter), increment and pulse (single-bit register used in the operation), max_delete_block and delete_address (23-bit register used in delete operation), and WEn_d1 (one-cycle delay version of RamWEn).\n\nThe module's code includes blocks for assigning and controlling signal logic, with specific always@ blocks for incrementing count, addressing control for audio recording or playback, updating RamWEn signal, performing operations based on reset/rise of clock, and controlling delay. It also includes a finite state machine controlling all the states like BANK, FLAG, BANK_ACK, INC_BLOCK, WAIT, DELETE, DELETE_ACK, DELETE_INC, ONECYCLE, ENTERDELETE, LEAVEDELETE. The module ends with creating a delay, based on counterEnable signal by an always@ block.\n",

It's primarily used for generating a pulse at specific points in time.\n\n3. pstate: An 5-bit register that stores the current state of the finite state machine controlling the module. This impacts the flow of control in the always block, where it's used in a case statement.\n\n4. nstate: A 4-bit register that stores the next state of the finite state machine controlling the module. Used to transition pstate in the case statement during a rising edge of the clk_100MHz clock.\n\n5. delay_done: A single-bit register that indicates when a certain delay (60 cycles of clk_100MHz) has completed. It's used in various conditions throughout the code.\n\n6. counterEnable: Single-bit register that enables/disables the counter.

BANK, FLAG, BANK_ACK, INC_BLOCK, WAIT, DELETE, DELETE_ACK, DELETE_INC, ONECYCLE, ENTERDELETE, LEAVEDELETE: These are parameter signals used to denote various states in the case logic of the Finite State Machine design.

It's used for controlling when addresses can be updated.\n\n2. count: A 13-bit register that functions as a counter. It's primarily used for generating a pulse at specific points in time.\n\n3. pstate: An 5-bit register that stores the current state of the finite state machine controlling the module. This impacts the flow of control in the always block, where it's used in a case statement.\n\n4. nstate: A 4-bit register that stores the next state of the finite state machine controlling the module. Used to transition pstate in the case statement during a rising edge of the clk_100MHz clock.\n\n5. delay_done: A single-bit register that indicates when a certain delay (60 cycles of clk_100MHz) has completed. It's used in various conditions throughout the code.\n\n6. counterEnable: Single-bit register that enables/disables the counter. It's used to control when counting should take place.\n\n7. increment: This is a single-bit register used to increment the block address if certain conditions are met. \n\n8. pulse: This is a single-bit register which is set high when the count reaches MHz44cnt.\n\n9. max_delete_block: 23-bit register used to store the maximum block till which deletion operation is conducted.\n\n10. delete_address: 23-bit register that stores the address of the block to be deleted.\n\n11. WEn_d1: A single-bit register that acts as a one-cycle delay version of RamWEn. It's primarily used to hold the value of RamWEn for one clock cycle before passing the value to the RamWEn output port.\n\n12. mem_bank is a 3-bit internal signal that represents the current bank of the memory.\n   \n13. BANK, FLAG, BANK_ACK, INC_BLOCK, WAIT, DELETE, DELETE_ACK, DELETE_INC, ONECYCLE, ENTERDELETE, LEAVEDELETE: These are parameter signals used to denote various states in the case logic of the Finite State Machine design. They provide case selection for the state machine's process.\n\n14. MHz44cnt: This is a parameter that seems to correlate with a desired clock count frequency. It's used to condition the behaviour of some operations in relation to the system clock.\n\n15. counter: This integer signal is used for creating a delay. The delay is used in various places in the state machine for such as operations of delete, bank accessing etc.\n"

Its primary functionalities include handling playing, recording, and deleting operations on audio stored in a memory block. In specific, it assigns addresses for memory blocks, manages recording and playback across multiple banks, implements deletion for specified banks, and controls increment conditions. Delay, addressing modes contingent on whether audio is being recorded or played, and various modes of operation states are also managed in the module.\n\nThe input ports of the mem_ctrl module are clk_100MHz (system clock for timed operations), rst (reset signal), playing, recording (8-bit ports indicating which track is played/recorded), delete (a deletion operation signal), delete_bank (3-bit port for delete operation's bank), and max_block (23-bit port showing maximum addressable block for storing audio data). Output ports include delete_clear (indication signal for completed deletion operation), RamCEn, RamOEn, RamWEn (control signals for memory chip access), write_zero (indicates when to delete/write zeroes in memory), get_data, data_ready, mix_data (signals for data management), addrblock44khz (23-bit register indicating memory address for a 44kHz audio data block), mem_block_addr (memory block address for read/write operations), and mem_bank (3-bit register showing memory bank for storing audio data).\n\nInternal signals include address_enable (controls when addresses can be updated), count (13-bit register that functions as a counter), pstate and nstate (5-bit and 4-bit registers storing current and next state of the finite state machine controlling the module), delay_done (indicates completion of a delay), counterEnable (enables/disables the counter), increment and pulse (single-bit register used in the operation), max_delete_block and delete_address (23-bit register used in delete operation), and WEn_d1 (one-cycle delay version of RamWEn).\n\nThe module's code includes blocks for assigning and controlling signal logic, with specific always@ blocks for incrementing count, addressing control for audio recording or playback, updating RamWEn signal, performing operations based on reset/rise of clock, and controlling delay. It also includes a finite state machine controlling all the states like BANK, FLAG, BANK_ACK, INC_BLOCK, WAIT, DELETE, DELETE_ACK, DELETE_INC, ONECYCLE, ENTERDELETE, LEAVEDELETE. The module ends with creating a delay, based on counterEnable signal by an always@ block.\n"
