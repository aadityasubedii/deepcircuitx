The block of code initializes the variable `mem_bank` to the value 0. This operation is performed at the beginning of the simulation, establishing a default state for `mem_bank`. The block accomplishes this through the 'initial' keyword in Verilog which sets a specific starting value for a variable, in this case `mem_bank` is being set to 0 and won't be altered until other operations in the code dictate a change.
