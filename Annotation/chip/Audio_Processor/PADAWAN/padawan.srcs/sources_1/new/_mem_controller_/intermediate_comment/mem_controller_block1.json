    "block_comment": "This block functions as a delay counter for a signal or process, implemented in a 100MHz clock domain. It uses two main signals: `counterEnable` and `counter`. When `counterEnable` is de-asserted, the counter is reset, and `delay_done` is set to 0. When `counterEnable` is asserted, the counter increments at each positive clock edge up until it reaches 60, during which `delay_done` remains 0. Once the counter hits 60, it resets and `delay_done` is asserted, indicating the delay has completed."
