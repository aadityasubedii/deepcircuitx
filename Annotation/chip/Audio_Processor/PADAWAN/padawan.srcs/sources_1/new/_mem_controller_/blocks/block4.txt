This block manages the 44kHz block address based on the given conditions. When either a reset is in operation or address enable control is inactive, it resets the addrblock44khz to zero. When an increment signal is active, the address is increased by one, providing it does not exceed the maximum permissible block size. If it reaches max_block, it will be rolled back to zero.
