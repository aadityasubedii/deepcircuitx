It's used for controlling when addresses can be updated.\n\n2. count: A 13-bit register that functions as a counter. It's primarily used for generating a pulse at specific points in time.\n\n3. pstate: An 5-bit register that stores the current state of the finite state machine controlling the module. This impacts the flow of control in the always block, where it's used in a case statement.\n\n4. nstate: A 4-bit register that stores the next state of the finite state machine controlling the module.

BANK, FLAG, BANK_ACK, INC_BLOCK, WAIT, DELETE, DELETE_ACK, DELETE_INC, ONECYCLE, ENTERDELETE, LEAVEDELETE: These are parameter signals used to denote various states in the case logic of the Finite State Machine design.
