Module name: mem_ctrl. 

Module specification: The `mem_ctrl` module is a memory control unit designed for audio/music applications. Its primary functionalities include handling playing, recording, and deleting operations on audio stored in a memory block. In specific, it assigns addresses for memory blocks, manages recording and playback across multiple banks, implements deletion for specified banks, and controls increment conditions. Delay, addressing modes contingent on whether audio is being recorded or played, and various modes of operation states are also managed in the module.

The input ports of the mem_ctrl module are clk_100MHz (system clock for timed operations), rst (reset signal), playing, recording (8-bit ports indicating which track is played/recorded), delete (a deletion operation signal), delete_bank (3-bit port for delete operation's bank), and max_block (23-bit port showing maximum addressable block for storing audio data). Output ports include delete_clear (indication signal for completed deletion operation), RamCEn, RamOEn, RamWEn (control signals for memory chip access), write_zero (indicates when to delete/write zeroes in memory), get_data, data_ready, mix_data (signals for data management), addrblock44khz (23-bit register indicating memory address for a 44kHz audio data block), mem_block_addr (memory block address for read/write operations), and mem_bank (3-bit register showing memory bank for storing audio data).

Internal signals include address_enable (controls when addresses can be updated), count (13-bit register that functions as a counter), pstate and nstate (5-bit and 4-bit registers storing current and next state of the finite state machine controlling the module), delay_done (indicates completion of a delay), counterEnable (enables/disables the counter), increment and pulse (single-bit register used in the operation), max_delete_block and delete_address (23-bit register used in delete operation), and WEn_d1 (one-cycle delay version of RamWEn).

The module's code includes blocks for assigning and controlling signal logic, with specific always@ blocks for incrementing count, addressing control for audio recording or playback, updating RamWEn signal, performing operations based on reset/rise of clock, and controlling delay. It also includes a finite state machine controlling all the states like BANK, FLAG, BANK_ACK, INC_BLOCK, WAIT, DELETE, DELETE_ACK, DELETE_INC, ONECYCLE, ENTERDELETE, LEAVEDELETE. The module ends with creating a delay, based on counterEnable signal by an always@ block.
