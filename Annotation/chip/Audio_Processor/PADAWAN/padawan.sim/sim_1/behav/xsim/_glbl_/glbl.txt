Module-level comment: The 'glbl' module handles global reset and control configurations for a system, including JTAG functionalities. It employs internal signals like GSR, GTS, and PRLD for initializing and controlling global system behavior. The module uses implicits I/Os, and its main functionality is divided into blocks initializing these signals with ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH for resolving metastability. JTAG signals are also arranged for potential testing and debugging needs. A versatile module for efficient control and synchronization across systems.
