This Verilog block serves to initialize and control a global tri-state buffer (GTS_int). The block commences by setting the GTS_int bit high to disable the outputs. The block waits for a certain duration defined by TOC_WIDTH before setting the GTS_int bit low, which enables the outputs again. This pattern helps achieve the controlled toggling of the system's outputs.
