Comment: 
This block of initial value assignment is for the signals `GSR_int` and `PRLD_int` in a digital system. At initialization, the block sets both `GSR_int` and `PRLD_int` to one, hence activating them. After waiting for a duration specified by `ROC_WIDTH`, the block then deactivates these signals by setting their values to zero.
