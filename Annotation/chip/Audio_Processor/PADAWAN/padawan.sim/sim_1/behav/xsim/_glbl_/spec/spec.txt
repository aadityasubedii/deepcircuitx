Module name: glbl. 

Module specification: The 'glbl' module is a global reset and control configuration for a system. It does not have explicit input and output ports defined; instead it uses internal signals (wire or reg), which may be referenced in other modules, their role varies from controlling the global reset(GSR) and global tri-state(GTS) characteristics to JTAG interface operations and handling of PLL signals. 

The functionality includes initialization of global resetting (GSR), global tri-state (GTS), and preload (PRLD) flags. It also includes JTAG specific parameters and initialization. They are initially set to '1', then a delay phase determined by ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH takes place before deactivating these flags.

The internal signals including GSR, GTS, PRLD, JTAG interface signals, and others, aid in controlling the complete system's initialization and reset process. A notable feature of this module encompasses the arrangement of JTAG interface signals, JTAG state machine signals, and JTAG select and output signals, which indicates the use of JTAG functionality presumably for hardware debugging and testing. 

The module is further divided into blocks that handle initialization for GSR, PRLD and GTS signals with defined ROC_WIDTH and TOC_WIDTH time period for handling potential metastability issues during initialization. This module synchronizes and resets the entire system, aids in hardware debugging and controls the global tri-state. 

In summary, the 'glbl' module ensures a high level of control and synchronization across the system it is integrated into, making it a key element in maintaining the predictability and reliability of the system's operations.
