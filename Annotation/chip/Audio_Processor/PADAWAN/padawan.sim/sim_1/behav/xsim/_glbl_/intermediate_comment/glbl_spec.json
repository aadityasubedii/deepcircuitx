However, there are wire and reg declarations inside the module that are used within the same module. Generally, in Verilog, keyword 'input' will be used to define input ports and 'output' for output ports. Since this module does not make use of these keywords for port definitions, we must consider the entire module to only contain internal signals.\n\nHere is the summary:\n\nInternal signals (Which may be used as I/O in other modules referencing 'glbl'):\n- GSR: Global set/reset control line.\n- GTS: Global tri-state control line.\n- GWE: Unconnected in this module, possibly a global write enable signal in larger design.\n- PRLD: Preload signal.\n- p_up_tmp: Temporary variable used to set tri-state control.\n- PLL_LOCKG: PLL Lock signal (weak1, strong0).\n- PROGB_GLBL, CCLKO_GLBL, FCSBO_GLBL, DO_GLBL, DI_GLBL: Unconnected, potentially used in whole design.\n- GSR_int, GTS_int, PRLD_int: Internal registers to control GSR, GTS and PRLD signal states.\n- JTAG_TDO_GLBL, JTAG_TCK_GLBL, JTAG_TDI_GLBL, JTAG_TMS_GLBL, JTAG_TRST_GLBL: JTAG interface signals.\n- JTAG_CAPTURE_GLBL, JTAG_RESET_GLBL, JTAG_SHIFT_GLBL, JTAG_UPDATE_GLBL, JTAG_RUNTEST_GLBL: JTAG state machine signals.\n- JTAG_SEL[1-4]_GLBL: JTAG select signals.\n- JTAG_USER_TDO[1-4]_GLBL: JTAG outputs.\n\nExplanation: These are not traditional input and output ports, they are internal signals(wire or reg) implemented in the module 'glbl'. The roles of these signals vary from controlling the global reset(GSR) and global tri-state(GTS) characteristics, JTAG interface operations to handling PLL signals.
