Module name: clock_Recovery. Module specification: The clock_Recovery module is designed to recover a clock signal and data from an incoming data stream. It takes inputs including a clock, reset, data input (io_DATA_IN), switch inputs (io_SW), and a button input (io_BTN_C). The module outputs include a recovered clock (io_CLK_OUT), recovered data (io_DATA_OUT), debug signals (io_DBUG, io_DBUG1), LED outputs (io_LED), and a data register output (io_DATAREG). Internally, it uses several registers such as lastOne, leds, inBufr, deltaCntr, bitCntr, clkRec, change, dataOut, syncWord, zeroFlipped, syncFlipped, and syncFlipped1 to manage the clock recovery process. The module is structured with several blocks including
