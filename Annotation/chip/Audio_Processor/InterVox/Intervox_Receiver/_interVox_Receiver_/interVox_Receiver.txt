Module-level comment: 
/* This module recovers a clock signal and data from an input stream.
   It uses edge detection and timing analysis to reconstruct the clock,
   employing counters and state flags to track signal transitions.
   The module processes incoming data bits, handles synchronization,
   and outputs recovered clock and data signals along with debug information.
   It also includes memory buffers for data storage and LED outputs for status indication. */
