This block is responsible for handling memory read and write operations in sync with a rising edge clock signal. If a memory write is enabled and the write mask is activated, the data at `mem_rdwrPort_w_data` is written to the memory location specified by `mem_rdwrPort_w_addr`. Additionally, the memory read function is set to be active when no write operation is being performed. If no write operation is detected, then the address pipe space for read operation is reset.
