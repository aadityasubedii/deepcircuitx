As you didn't provide any specific block of code to describe, here is a general approach to how you can transform raw Verilog RTL code into data suitable for training your language model:

1. **Pairing code with comments**: Extract the pieces of RTL code and their corresponding comments. Your input will be the code part and your target output will be the comment associated with it. 

For example, for a simple block like this:
```verilog
// This module generates a clock signal
module clock_gen(input wire rst_n, output wire clk);
assign clk = ~rstn; 
endmodule 
```
The input will be:
```verilog
module clock_gen(input wire rst_n, output wire clk);
assign clk = ~rstn; 
endmodule 
```
And the corresponding target output will be: `This module generates a clock signal`.

2. **Code Tokenization**: Break the Verilog code into smaller units (tokens). You may need to create a custom tokenizer given the unique syntax of Verilog.

3. **Comment Processing**: Clean up comments by removing unnecessary white spaces, punctuation, or other special characters. Treat the filtered comment as a sentence and further split it for sentence level processing, if needed.

4. **Creating the dataset**: Formulate your data into paired instances of input (code) and output (comment). Randomly divide this into training, validation, and testing sets.

For training, remember to do it on a character level for the Verilog code as models trained on a character level often generalize better to unseen code.
