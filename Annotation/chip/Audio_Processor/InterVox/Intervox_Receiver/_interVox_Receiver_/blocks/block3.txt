Comment: 
The block provides functionality to interface and convert data received from INTERVOX interface by using a clock recovery circuit and an I2S transmitter. The clock recovery circuit processes input signals from INTERVOX, and forwards recovered clock and data to assigned outputs and towards the I2S transmitter block. Subsequently, I2S transmitter block receives the data and processed clock to generate I2S outputs including LRCLK and SDATA. Debug, LED output and button-based control functionality are effectively incorporated throughout the flow.
