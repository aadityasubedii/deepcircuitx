    "block_comment": "This block of code provides a facility for random register initialization. It contains the definitions for three 32-bit wide registers named _RAND_0, _RAND_1, and _RAND_2 respectively. The block uses `ifdef construct which means the following codes are conditioned based on the definition of the RANDOMIZE_REG_INIT flag. If that flag is defined, these registers are initialized for possible random values, providing a useful function primarily for testing and debugging scenarios. In its implementation, the block leverages Verilog's preprocessor directives to create conditional compilation of the initialization of registers."
