It has input and output operations and employs an enable signal to control read/write operations.\n\n2. Module name: edgeDetector. Explanation: As the name suggests, this module likely detects rising or falling edges in a binary signal.

Explanation: This is likely a module that recovers a clock signal from some input data stream. It seems to be using aspects of external variables to synchronize an internally maintained clock.\n\n4. Module name: interVox_Receiver. Explanation: This module is likely related to receiving and possibly decoding a data stream (io_INTERVOX_IN). It uses the clock_Recovery module to synchronize an internally maintained clock with the external data signal.\n\n5. Module name: i2s_Transmitter. Explanation: This module is likely a transmitter for interfacing with I2S protocol (Inter-IC Sound), a common protocol for transmitting audio data between devices.\n\n6. Module name: clock_Recovery.
