    "block_comment": "This block of code is an implementation of a state machine that manages the logic of two signal buffers, `inBufr` and `inBufrPrev`, and a state flag `rising` based on input and clock states. At every rising clock edge, the block tests for a reset condition first - if this is true, it initializes `inBufr`, `inBufrPrev`, and `rising` to zeros. If the `reset` is not true and `io_INPUT` is true, it increments `inBufr` and `inBufrPrev` if they are less than 2. Conversely, if `io_INPUT` is false, it decrements `inBufr` and `inBufrPrev` if they are greater than 0. The state flag `rising` gets reset if it is true or under certain conditions dictated by `_T_5` and `inBufrPrev` being 2, otherwise, it is assigned `_GEN_9`."
