    "block_comment": "The block of code represents an I2S (Inter-IC Sound) Transmitter, which is primarily used for transmitting audio data in digital signal processing applications. This module works by taking an input clock signal, reset signal, input clock, 64-bit data, and a signal for the next data set. It returns the left-right clock (LRCLK) which flips per sample and serialized data (SDATA) which is driven by the clock. The I2S interface helps in transferring audio data between ICs in the digital domain. The module employs the standard I2S protocol to modulate the input audio data before sending it to the output."
