    "block_comment": "This Verilog code defines a clock recovery module (`clock_Recovery`) that controls a data-in signal and synchronizes data based on the input clock. The module takes various inputs such as a clock, reset signal, input data, a switch array, and a command button. The module outputs include a debug info signal, output data, output clock, led array, and two debug info signals. It incorporates Random Access Write/Save memory instances and an edge detector. The edge detector registers when the clock signal has a rising or falling edge, used to synchronize actions, while memory instances are used to store and fetch data. Several conditional logic and arithmetic operations are performed using wires and registers to manipulate data and control the flow. Binary logic operations assist in clock recovery and data synchronization."
