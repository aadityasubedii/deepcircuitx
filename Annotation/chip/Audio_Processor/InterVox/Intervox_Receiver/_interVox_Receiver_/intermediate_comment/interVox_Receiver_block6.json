    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code helps in the detection of clock edges and processing of input data. The edgeDetector module CLK1EDGE is used to detect the edges of the clock signal using CLK1EDGE_clock and CLK1EDGE_reset connections. Additionally, the code is manipulating data in 'io_DATA_IN' based on the value of 'bitCntrTrans'. The logic is shifting the input data depending on the value of 'bitCntrTrans' and uses comparison to generate appropriate output io_LRCLK and io_SDATA. Furthermore, counters are used to keep track of bit transactions, implemented using 'bitCntrTrans' and associated arithmetic. Data output is controlled by conditions based on 'bitCntrTrans', demonstrating this block's data processing functionality."
