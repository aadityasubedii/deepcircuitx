    "block_comment": "The block of Verilog RTL code here primarily serves the purpose of data and signal assignments for interfacing between modules or I/O ports. It establishes linkages between the internal clocks, data paths, debugging signals and external interfaces of device given the 'assign' keyword used for signal assignments. Signals like 'clockRec_io_DATA_OUT', 'clockRec_io_DBUG', 'clockRec_io_DBUG1', 'clockRec_io_LED', 'clockRec_io_CLK_OUT', 'i2sTrans_io_LRCLK', 'i2sTrans_io_SDATA', and 'io_INTERVOX_IN' are associated to appropriate output or input pins. Meanwhile, the operations 'assign io_CLK_REC = 1'h0;' and 'assign io_CLK_DBUG = 1'h0;' set respective clock recording and debug clocks to low signal."
