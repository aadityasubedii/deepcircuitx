    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is mainly concerned with initializing elements during simulation. More specifically, it checks several conditions for randomizing simulations, and applies random values to certain system components at the initialization phase. If the `RANDOMIZE` condition is defined, the code block will first check for `INIT_RANDOM`, and if defined, execute it. If not being run with Verilator (`ifndef VERILATOR`), it will introduce a delay before component initialization. Within the delay, it will either follow the delay defined by `RANDOMIZE_DELAY`, if provided, or default to a 0.002-second delay. Then, if `RANDOMIZE_MEM_INIT` is defined, the block will initialize the memory (`mem`) with randomized values. Similarly, if `RANDOMIZE_REG_INIT` is defined, certain registry components will take randomized starting values."
