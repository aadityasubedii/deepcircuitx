    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code serves multiple functions to control specific modules in response to different system states. Primarily, it initializes and updates a counter 'bitCntrTrans', a left-right clock 'lrclk', and output data 'sdataO' based on certain system conditions. For 'bitCntrTrans', it resets the counter to 0 either during system reset or when 'io_NEXT' is active. It updates the counter when 'CLK1EDGE_io_RISE' arises. Moreover, the 'lrclk' is reset to 0 during system reset or if the counter goes beyond 31 when 'CLK1EDGE_io_RISE' comes up. Otherwise, it takes the value of '_GEN_1'. For 'sdataO', it is reset to 0 during system reset. In response to 'CLK1EDGE_io_RISE', 'sdataO' is updated based on the counter value and '_T_3' state, and '_GEN_4' state. This implementation helps in the synchronization of system modules."
