The module takes two inputs: CLK_IN (the input clock reference frequency) and reset (used to revert the module to default state when required). The module has two outputs: CLK_OUT (the processed clock signal) and locked (indicates when the output clock signal is stable and locked to the input signal). \n\nThe internal operation of the module uses several signals including CLK_IN_clk_wiz_0 (buffered input clock signal), reset_high (internal reset signal), locked_int (internal locked signal), clkfbout_clk_wiz_0 (feedback clock output from the PLL block), clkfbout_buf_clk_wiz_0 (buffered feedback clock signal), CLK_OUT_clk_wiz_0 (output clock signal from PLL block), and other unused signals, like do_unused, drdy_unused, psdone_unused which are connected to different outputs of the PLL to satisfy its interface requirements. \n\nThe code mainly comprises of three sections: an input buffer (clkin1_ibufg) that buffers the input clock signal, a Phase Locked Loop block (PLLE2_ADV) that receives the buffered clock signal, manipulates it, and generates the output clock signal along with other control signals, and finally, output buffers (clkf_buf and clkout1_buf) that stabilize the output and feedback clock signals.\n\nOverall, the clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz module serves the purpose of a clock generator and manager, taking in clock signal, processing it, and outputting a stable clock signal while ensuring the validity of the output through the 'locked' signal. It also includes necessary reset provisions for reverting back to its default state.",

There are buffers (IBUF and BUFG) included to isolate and stabilize the input and output clock signals. A reset signal is also provided to reset the clock generator if necessary.
