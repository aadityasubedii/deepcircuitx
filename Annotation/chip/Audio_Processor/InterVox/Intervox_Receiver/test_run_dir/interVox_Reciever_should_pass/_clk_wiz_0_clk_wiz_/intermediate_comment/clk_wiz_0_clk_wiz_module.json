    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz' is a clock generator and manager. It takes an input clock signal 'CLK_IN', processes it via a Phase Locked Loop (PLLE2_ADV) block that is configured with specific parameters for output frequency generation and feeds it through a buffer to produce a stable output clock 'CLK_OUT'. A 'locked' signal indicates when the output is stable. Reset functionality is incorporated into the design to enable the system to revert to a known state when needed. Unused signals are connected to meet the interface requirements of the PLL block."
