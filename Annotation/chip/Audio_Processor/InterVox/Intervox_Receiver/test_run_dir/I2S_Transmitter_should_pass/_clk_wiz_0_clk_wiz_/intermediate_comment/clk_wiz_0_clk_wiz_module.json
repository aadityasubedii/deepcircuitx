    "module": "Module-level comment: This clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz module configures and operates a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) to generate two output clocks MCLK_48K and MCLK_44K at 48KHz and 44KHz respectively, using the input reference clock 'clk_in1'. Through internal sequencing and control signals, the generated clocks are enabled upon locking of the PLL. The module leverages buffered feedback loop (clkfbout_clk_wiz_0) for stability and uses registers seq_reg1 and seq_reg2 for controlling clock outputs upon the positive edge of clock signals when PLL is locked. All signals are presented with detailed naming reflecting their functionality."
