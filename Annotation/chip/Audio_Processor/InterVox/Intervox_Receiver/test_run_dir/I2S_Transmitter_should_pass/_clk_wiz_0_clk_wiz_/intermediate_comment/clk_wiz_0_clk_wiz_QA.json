Here, two output clocks are generated MCLK_48K and MCLK_44K, which are designed to operate at 48KHz and 44KHz respectively. The clock frequencies are generated from an input clock 'clk_in1' which is buffered and fed into a PLL instance derived from the PLLE2_ADV primitive. The clocks correspondingly are enabled when the PLL designates a locked state. The module also exposes a 'locked' output signal that indicates whether the PLL has completed its phase and frequency alignments and is operating under normal conditions, providing a stable clock."
