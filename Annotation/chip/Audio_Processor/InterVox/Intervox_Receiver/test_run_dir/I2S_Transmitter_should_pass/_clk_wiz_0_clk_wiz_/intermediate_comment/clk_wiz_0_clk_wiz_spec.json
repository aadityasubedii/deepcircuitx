    "spec": "Module name: clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz. \n\nModule specification: The clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz module is a Verilog implementation used primarily for the configuration of a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) for generating two clock signals - MCLK_48K and MCLK_44K, which are designed to operate at frequencies of 48KHz and 44KHz respectively. The clocks are generated based on an input clock 'clk_in1'. This input clock is buffered and used as a reference to generate the output frequencies in the PLL block which uses the PLLE2_ADV primitive module. \n\nThe module has only one input port 'clk_in1' which is the reference clock for the PLL. There are three output ports - MCLK_48K and MCLK_44K are the two clock output signals and 'locked' which indicates the locked state of the PLL. The locked signal denotes whether the PLL is providing stable output clock signals.\n\nInternally, the module uses several signals for different tasks. 'clk_in1_clk_wiz_0' is a buffered version of the input clock signal. 'MCLK_48K_clk_wiz_0' and 'MCLK_44K_clk_wiz_0' are internal versions of the 48KHz and 44KHz output clock signals from the PLL. 'locked_int' is an internal version of the locked signal exhibiting the PLL's lock status which is eventually broadcasted outside the module. 'seq_reg1' and 'seq_reg2' are sequence registers tied with the 48KHz and 44KHz output clocks respectively and are updated at every positive edge of these clock signals. 'clkfbout_clk_wiz_0' is a feedback clock from the PLL used for maintaining the stability and accuracy of the output clocks. The 'clkfbout_buf_clk_wiz_0' is simply the buffered version of this feedback clock. \n\nThe code constructs the PLL with specific parameters using the PLLE2_ADV module. A feedback loop is constructed from the output of the PLL going through a buffer and fed back to its input to keep the loop stable. Two buffers (BUFGCE) are then used at the end to generate the two output clock signals - MCLK_48K and MCLK_44K, enabled with their respective sequence registers seq_reg1 and seq_reg2 that get updated at every clock edge when PLL is locked. The locked state is then exposed to the output.",

                    "text": "Module name: clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz. \n\nModule specification: The clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz module is a Verilog implementation used primarily for the configuration of a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) for generating two clock signals - MCLK_48K and MCLK_44K, which are designed to operate at frequencies of 48KHz and 44KHz respectively. The clocks are generated based on an input clock 'clk_in1'. This input clock is buffered and used as a reference to generate the output frequencies in the PLL block which uses the PLLE2_ADV primitive module. \n\nThe module has only one input port 'clk_in1' which is the reference clock for the PLL. There are three output ports - MCLK_48K and MCLK_44K are the two clock output signals and 'locked' which indicates the locked state of the PLL. The locked signal denotes whether the PLL is providing stable output clock signals.\n\nInternally, the module uses several signals for different tasks. 'clk_in1_clk_wiz_0' is a buffered version of the input clock signal. 'MCLK_48K_clk_wiz_0' and 'MCLK_44K_clk_wiz_0' are internal versions of the 48KHz and 44KHz output clock signals from the PLL. 'locked_int' is an internal version of the locked signal exhibiting the PLL's lock status which is eventually broadcasted outside the module. 'seq_reg1' and 'seq_reg2' are sequence registers tied with the 48KHz and 44KHz output clocks respectively and are updated at every positive edge of these clock signals. 'clkfbout_clk_wiz_0' is a feedback clock from the PLL used for maintaining the stability and accuracy of the output clocks. The 'clkfbout_buf_clk_wiz_0' is simply the buffered version of this feedback clock. \n\nThe code constructs the PLL with specific parameters using the PLLE2_ADV module. A feedback loop is constructed from the output of the PLL going through a buffer and fed back to its input to keep the loop stable. Two buffers (BUFGCE) are then used at the end to generate the two output clock signals - MCLK_48K and MCLK_44K, enabled with their respective sequence registers seq_reg1 and seq_reg2 that get updated at every clock edge when PLL is locked. The locked state is then exposed to the output."
