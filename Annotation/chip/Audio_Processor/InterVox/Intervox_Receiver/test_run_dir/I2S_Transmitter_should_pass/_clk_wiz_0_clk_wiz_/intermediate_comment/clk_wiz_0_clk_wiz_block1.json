    "block_comment": "This block of code samples the state of 'locked_int' at the rising edge of 'MCLK_44K_clk_wiz_0_en_clk' signal. It is implemented using an always block to create a 7-bit shift register that will latch the status of 'locked_int' with every positive clock edge, effectively creating a delay or history mechanism, allowing a system to track 'locked_int' changes over eight clock cycles."
