Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is a state and control logic module, managing three main behaviors: input buffer control, buffer change tracking, and event flagging. The buffer control behavior is executed by storing the input in `inBufr` if `reset` is active or if `io_INPUT` is in a certain range. The previous state of `inBufr` is stored in `inBufrPrev` under similar conditions. Event flags for `trailing`, `rising`, and `change` are also controlled based on certain conditions. If these flags are not already active, they are set by derived signals `_GEN_12`, `_GEN_10`, and `_GEN_14`, respectively, otherwise they are reset. The complete operation is synchronized to the rising edge of the clock.
