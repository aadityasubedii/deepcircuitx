Comment: 
This block assigns a series of inputs to the biPhaseEncoder module. The "reset" signal is applied directly to the "biPhaseEncoder_reset", whereas the "BFR1_io_dataOut" is fed into "biPhaseEncoder_io_AUDIOINPUT". Concurrently, it forms a 48-bit zero-padded "dspData" as the input for "biPhaseEncoder_io_DSPINPUT". The signal "biPhaseEna" is assigned to "biPhaseEncoder_io_ENA". Finally, the block assigns "BCLKEDGE_io_CHANGE" to "biPhaseEncoder_io_CLK", capturing a clock edge change in the biPhaseEncoder module.
