Comment: 
This block primarily handles initialization of certain variables at the start of simulation, notably under different conditions. In the process of initialization, several conditional compilation directives (`ifdef, `ifndef) check particular macro definitions, thereby enabling, disabling, or modifying certain behaviors. For instance, RANDOMIZE_DELAY introduces a randomized delay into the initialization process if defined. If RANDOMIZE_REG_INIT is defined, five variables (_RAND_0 to _RAND_4) are initialized with random values to bring randomness to the starting state. The subsequent lines assign specific bits of these generated random values to inBufr, inBufrPrev, trailing, rising, and change variables.
