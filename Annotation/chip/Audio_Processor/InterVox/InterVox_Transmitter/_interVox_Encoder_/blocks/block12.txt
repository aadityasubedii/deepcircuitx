Comment: 
This block of code is responsible for Verilog assign statements which are continuous assignments used to drive output ports and wires. Assign statements here are binding an internal signal state (trailing, rising, change) to a corresponding I/O ports (io_TRAIL, io_RISE, io_CHANGE). The assignments operate continuously, meaning any changes to the right-hand signals (trailing, rising, change) will immediately reflect on the left-hand I/O assignments due to the concurrent nature of hardware. Maintaining up-to-date state information of the design based on internal signal changes is the primary purpose of these assignments.
