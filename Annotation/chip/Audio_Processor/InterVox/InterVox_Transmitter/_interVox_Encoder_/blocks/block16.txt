Comment: 
This block of Verilog code manages both output signal (`outReg`), and internal state registries like `bitCntr_enc`, `dataIndex` and `stereoData`, based on a clock, reset and enable signals. The function is controlled by positive edge of clock and reset, resetting all state registries and output signal; and `io_CLK` and `enabled` signals, defining the behavior inference of output signals and registries based on certain conditions. Internal states also toggle or get updated values based on `bitCntr_enc`'s value. Enabling and disabling the functionality is controlled by `io_ENA` on every clock tick.
