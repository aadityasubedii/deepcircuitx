This code block handles the write operation to a memory block in a synchronous digital system, and also makes provision for a read operation preparation. The write operation occurs at the positive edge of the clock, and only when both the memory write enable signal (mem_rdwrPort_w_en) and write mask are active. If these conditions are met, the data (mem_rdwrPort_w_data) is written to the memory location specified by mem_rdwrPort_w_addr. The code block also prepares for a future memory read by assigning a logic '1' to the mem_rdwrPort_r_en_pipe_0 signal when there's no IO write operation ongoing. This way, while executing a write operation, the system is also preparing for a subsequent read operation.
