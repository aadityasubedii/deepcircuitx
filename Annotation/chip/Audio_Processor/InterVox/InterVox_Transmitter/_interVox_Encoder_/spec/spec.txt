Module name: interVox_Encoder. Module specification: The interVox_Encoder module is an audio encoder for intercom or voice communication systems. It processes input audio data, performs bi-phase encoding, and manages control signals. The module has input ports for clock, reset, audio data (BCLK_IN, LRCLK_IN, SDATA_IN), user controls (SW, BTN_C, BTN_D, BTN_L, BTN_R), and output ports for encoded data (DATA_O), clock signals (MCLK_O, LRCLK_O, BCLK_O), and status indicators (LED, NXT_FRAME). Internal signals include state registers (currentState, syncing, synced), control flags (biPhaseEna), data buffers (left, right, dspData), and counters (bitCn
