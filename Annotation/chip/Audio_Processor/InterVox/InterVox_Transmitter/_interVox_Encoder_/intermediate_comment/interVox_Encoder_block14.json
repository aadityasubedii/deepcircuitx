    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block is for an edge detector module, whose role is to recognize changes (rising and trailing edges) in the input signal. The module has an input signal 'io_INPUT', a clock signal 'clock', a reset signal 'reset', and outputs 'io_TRAIL', 'io_RISE', and 'io_CHANGE'. It uses a buffering strategy with a 2 bit shift register 'inBufr' to assist in edge detection. Randomization capabilities are included under the 'RANDOMIZE_REG_INIT' macro for possible testing scenarios which need random initial values for registers. Each output signal ostensibly detects different conditions like trailing edge, rising edge and any change in the input signal. This is a common design pattern for building digital logic circuits that respond to change in signals."
