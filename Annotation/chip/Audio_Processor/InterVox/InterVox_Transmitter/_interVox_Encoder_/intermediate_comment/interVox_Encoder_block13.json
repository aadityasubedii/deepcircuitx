    "block_comment": "This section of Verilog code is for the declaration of five 32-bit registers, namely _RAND_0, _RAND_1, _RAND_2, _RAND_3, and _RAND_4. Each of these registers is defined as a 32-bit wide register due to the range [31:0]. This is generally used to hold random or temporary values for further processing. The terminal `endif statement indicates the end of a conditional preprocessor directive, suggesting that the declaration of these registers is done conditionally, based on some previously defined condition."
