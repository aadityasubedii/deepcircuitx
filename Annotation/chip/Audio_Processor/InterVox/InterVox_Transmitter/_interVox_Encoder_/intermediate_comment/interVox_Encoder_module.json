    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements an audio encoder for intercom systems. It processes input audio data, performs bi-phase encoding, and manages control signals. The module uses edge detectors for clock signals, buffers for data storage, and a bi-phase encoder for data conversion. It operates in different states, handling synchronization, data buffering, and encoding processes. The module interfaces with external audio components and provides user controls and status indicators."
