    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code is responsible for implementing the write and data input functionality for a buffer (BFR). The buffer's write operation is controlled by the 'BFR_io_write' signal which is asserted when the currentState is not '2'h0'. The '_GEN_69' value then determines the result when the condition is not met. The 'BFR_io_dataIn' signal handles the data input into the buffer, with '_GEN_82' indicating the origin of the input data, specifically the first 64 bits of it."
