    "block_comment": "This block is used for driving local variables with inputs and a system clock. The variable 'LREDGE_clock' is assigned the system clock. The 'LREDGE_reset' is assigned the reset signal. Then, the 'LREDGE_io_INPUT' is driven by the 'io_LRCLK_IN' signal. These assignments ensure corresponding variables match the current states of their respective signals."
