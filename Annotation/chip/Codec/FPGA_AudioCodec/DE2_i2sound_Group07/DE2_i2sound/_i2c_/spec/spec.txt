Module name: i2c. 

Module specification: The "i2c" module is a Verilog implementation of an I2C communication protocol focused on data transmission. It features input ports such as CLOCK (the primary clock signal), I2C_DATA (24-bit data for I2C transmission), GO (initiates the I2C operation), RESET (resets internal states), and W_R (determines the read/write operation). The output ports include I2C_SCLK (I2C clock line), I2C_SDAT (I2C data line), END (indicates completion of communication cycle), ACK (acknowledgment signal), SD_COUNTER (6-bit counter for phase management), and SDO (serial data output). Internal signals such as SDO, SCLK, END, SD, and ACK1, ACK2, ACK3 are crucial for operation handling: SDO controls the data line state, SCLK manages the clock line, and END designates the communication end. ACK1, ACK2, ACK3 capture and relay acknowledgment feedback at various transaction phases. The code is structured around two main always blocks reacting to the CLOCK and RESET signals, controlling the sequencing of states stored in SD_COUNTER and managing data transmission, acknowledgment capturing, and the signaling of operation completion.
