Module-level comment: The "i2c" module implements the I2C communication protocol focusing on data transmission. It utilizes input signals like CLOCK, I2C_DATA, and control flags (GO, RESET, W_R) to manage data flow through output lines I2C_SCLK and I2C_SDAT. Internally, it sequences operations via a state counter (SD_COUNTER) and adjusts I2C bus states through phases, capturing acknowledgments and signaling transaction completion using registers SDO, SCLK, END, and ACK. This module effectively coordinates data bits transmission and timing, responding to start, operate, and reset commands.
