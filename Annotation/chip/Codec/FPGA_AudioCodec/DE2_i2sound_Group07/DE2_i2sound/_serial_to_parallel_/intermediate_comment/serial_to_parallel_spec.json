    "spec": "Module name: serial_to_parallel. Module specification: The `serial_to_parallel` module is designed to convert serial input data into a parallel output format, synchronized with a bit clock and a left-right clock. The module has four input ports: `bclk` (Bit Clock) which triggers state evaluation and shifting on its negative edge; `lrclk` (Left-Right Clock) which indicates transitions or boundaries of data blocks; `reset_n` (Active Low Reset) which resets the system to a known state; and `in_data` (Serial Input Data) which is the actual serial data being converted. The single output port, `data`, is a 16-bit register that holds the resulting parallel data. Internally, the module utilizes delay registers `lrclk_d1` and `lrclk_d2` to detect changes in the `lrclk` state indicating new data word boundaries, and a `bit_counter` that counts down with each bit processed to manage data alignment. The signal `start` detects the rising edge of `lrclk` to initialize data capture for a new word. The design includes three main procedural blocks: one for managing the bit counter, one for shifting data into the output register upon each negative edge of `bclk`, and one for updating the delay registers (`lrclk_d1` and `lrclk_d2`) to assist in the edge detection necessary for capturing data correctly. These functional blocks ensure proper data alignment and synchronization, central to the module's operation of serial-to-parallel data conversion.",

It synchronizes with a bit clock (bclk) and a left-right clock (lrclk) to align and shift incoming serial data bits into a 16-bit register. Upon each negative edge of the bclk, the module checks the state of the lrclk to determine the start of a new data word, indicated by an edge change in lrclk (`start` signal). When a new word starts or the bit counter is not at its terminal count, it decrements the bit counter and shifts the incoming serial data into the 16-bit data register. The operation resets when the reset signal (`reset_n`) is low, setting the bit counter to its initial state and clearing the data register."

Each negative edge of bclk triggers the evaluation and state updation inside the module.\n- **lrclk**: Left-Right Clock (lrclk) helps in determining the boundaries of data blocks or words. Its transitions indicate the start of a new data word, thus triggering certain control operations inside the module.\n- **reset_n**: Active low Reset signal (reset_n) is utilized to bring the module to a known state, specifically resetting the data output and the bit counter. It ensures the system operates from a clean state post-reset.\n- **in_data**: Serial Input Data (in_data) carries the serial data bits that are converted into parallel data format and stored internally within the module.\n\nOutput ports: [data].\nExplanation: \n- **data**: This 16-bit register holds the converted parallel data output.

The use of these delays helps in detecting edge transitions in `lrclk` to determine the start of new data words.\n- **bit_counter**: This 4-bit register counts down the bits as they are shifted in. It is initialized to 15 (4'hf) indicating it can count up to 16 bits (as per the size of the output register `data`). The counter decrements on each negative edge of bclk when a new word starts or as long as all the bits of the current word have not been processed.\n- **start**: This wire signal is used to detect the transition of `lrclk` from low-to-high by examining the delayed `.lrclk` states. It is defined as high (`1`) when `lrclk_d2` is high and `lrclk_d1` is low (rising edge of `lrclk`).
