    "module": "Module-level comment: The `serial_to_parallel` module converts serial input data to a 16-bit parallel output, synced with bit and left-right clocks. It manages data alignment using a bit counter and delay registers (`lrclk_d1`, `lrclk_d2`) for detecting `lrclk` transitions, indicating new data words. On each negative bclk edge, data shifts into the register if conditions of start or uncompleted word count are met, with system reset on a low `reset_n`."
