Module name: serial_to_parallel. Module specification: The `serial_to_parallel` module is designed to convert serial input data into a parallel output format, synchronized with a bit clock and a left-right clock. The module has four input ports: `bclk` (Bit Clock) which triggers state evaluation and shifting on its negative edge; `lrclk` (Left-Right Clock) which indicates transitions or boundaries of data blocks; `reset_n` (Active Low Reset) which resets the system to a known state; and `in_data` (Serial Input Data) which is the actual serial data being converted. The single output port, `data`, is a 16-bit register that holds the resulting parallel data. Internally, the module utilizes delay registers `lrclk_d1` and `lrclk_d2` to detect changes in the `lrclk` state indicating new data word boundaries, and a `bit_counter` that counts down with each bit processed to manage data alignment. The signal `start` detects the rising edge of `lrclk` to initialize data capture for a new word. The design includes three main procedural blocks: one for managing the bit counter, one for shifting data into the output register upon each negative edge of `bclk`, and one for updating the delay registers (`lrclk_d1` and `lrclk_d2`) to assist in the edge detection necessary for capturing data correctly. These functional blocks ensure proper data alignment and synchronization, central to the module's operation of serial-to-parallel data conversion.
