The module includes a mechanism to detect the edge of the lrclk to determine when new data is available and when to start outputting data. It uses a counter to manage the position of the bit being output from the data buffer on each negative edge of the bclk. The data input is loaded into a buffer when new data is detected, and serial data is output bit by bit based on the bit counter, which decrements with each negative bclk edge. This module is typically used in digital audio applications to interface with devices that require serial data input."

Changes in this clock signal are used to detect new data arrivals and to control the reset of the bit counter.\n- reset_n: Active low reset input.

This is used in the detection of new data and the start condition for serializing data.\n- start: A signal that indicates when to reset the bit_counter in preparation for new data serialization.
