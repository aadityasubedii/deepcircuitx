Module name: parallel_to_serial. 
Module specification: The "parallel_to_serial" module is designed to convert a 16-bit parallel input data into a serial output stream, synchronized with bit clock and left-right clock for handling stereo audio signals. The input ports include 'bclk' (bit clock), 'lrclk' (left-right clock), 'reset_n' (active low reset), and 'in_data' (16-bit data input). The output port is 'data', which streams the serial data bit by bit. Internal signals such as 'bit_counter' (4-bit counter), 'data_buffer' (16-bit register), 'lrclk_d1' (delayed lrclk), 'start', and 'new_data' assist in managing data serialization. Specifically, 'bit_counter' helps in determining the bit position from the 'data_buffer' for output, and 'start' controls the reset of 'bit_counter'. 'new_data' signals the arrival of new data. Code blocks handle different aspects: resetting states through 'reset_n', updating 'data_buffer' and shifting 'bit_counter' on 'bclk' edges, updating 'lrclk_d1' to detect edges in 'lrclk', and managing the 'data' output based on 'bit_counter' and the presence of new data. The serial output is generated based on the bit position indicated by the active bit counter, providing precise control over audio data serialization for interfacing with digital audio systems.
