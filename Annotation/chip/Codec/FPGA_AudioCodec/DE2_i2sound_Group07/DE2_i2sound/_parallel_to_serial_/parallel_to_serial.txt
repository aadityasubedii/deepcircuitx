Module-level comment: The "parallel_to_serial" module converts 16-bit parallel data to serial format, synchronized by bit and left-right clocks, primarily for stereo audio. It leverages internal clocks, counters, and registers: handling edge detection of 'lrclk' for data updates, managing bit output sequencing via 'bit_counter', and storing incoming data in 'data_buffer'. This facilitates serialized output suitable for digital audio interfacing.
