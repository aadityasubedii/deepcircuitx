    "module": "Module-level comment: The CLOCK_500 module synchronizes ROM operations, manages address pointers, and produces specific clock signals based on an external CLOCK, END condition, and asynchronous RESET. Key functionalities include generating derived clocks (CLOCK_500, CLOCK_2) from an internal counter, managing ROM data access based on the address which resets with RESET and increments on END's posedge, and outputs data by combining ROM content with constants. This ensures coherent control and timing of connected operations."
