    "spec": "Module name: CLOCK_500. \nModule specification: The CLOCK_500 module is designed to synchronize operations connected with a ROM, manage addresses, and control output signals based on an external CLOCK, an END signal, and an asynchronous RESET condition. The input ports include CLOCK, END, and RESET, where CLOCK is used to drive the main sequential logic, END triggers address increment and ROM operations, and RESET asynchronously resets the ROM address to 0. The output ports are CLOCK_500, derived from the 9th bit of an internal 11-bit counter (COUNTER_500), CLOCK_2 derived from the 1st bit of the same counter, a 24-bit DATA that combines a constant with 16-bit ROM data, and GO, a control signal that gates operations based on address limits and the END signal state. Internal signals include COUNTER_500, which increments upon CLOCK\u2019s rising edge affecting CLOCK_500 and CLOCK_2; ROM, an array storing data values affected by the END signal; DATA_A, holding values from ROM; and \u2018address,\u2019 an address pointer managed by RESET and END. Other sections include logic for updating the ROM and DATA_A on the positive edge of END, decrementing a volume register (vol) on the positive edge of RESET, and updating the counter on CLOCK's rising edge.

Generating a CLOCK_500 and CLOCK_2 signal based on specific bits of a counter (`COUNTER_500`), where CLOCK_500 is driven by the 9th bit and CLOCK_2 by the 1st bit of `COUNTER_500`.\n2. Managing an 'address' pointer within the ROM through asynchronous reset (RESET) and on the positive edge of signal END. The address is reset to 0 on a falling edge of RESET, and incremented until it reaches the defined rom_size when END is asserted.\n3. On the assertion of END, the ROM (Read-Only Memory) is populated with data, and `DATA_A` is set as the ROM's output value at the current 'address'.\n4. The output `DATA` concatenates a constant with `DATA_A` and the `GO` signal is conditionally controlled based on the `address` and `END` state, tied ultimately to the status of the highest bit of `COUNTER_500`.\n5. A counter (`COUNTER_500`) is incremented with each rising edge of CLOCK, influencing the CLOCK_500, CLOCK_2, and `GO` outputs as described.\n6.

It initiates the increment of the ROM address and populates the ROM values when posedge occurs.\n- **RESET**: A signal used for asynchronous resetting. When this signal is negated (logic low), it resets the ROM address to 0, ensuring the module restarts its operations in a defined state.\n\nOutput ports: CLOCK_500, DATA, GO, CLOCK_2.\nExplanation:\n- **CLOCK_500**: Derived from the 9th bit of the `COUNTER_500`. This output provides a derived clock signal which might be used for timing or control purposes in external circuitry or connected modules.\n- **DATA**: A 24-bit wide output that combines a constant value with part of the ROM data (`DATA_A`). This output offers processed data ready for use or further manipulation externally.\n- **GO**: A control signal that determines further action based on the current ROM address and the state of the `END` signal.
