Module name: CLOCK_500. 
Module specification: The CLOCK_500 module is designed to synchronize operations connected with a ROM, manage addresses, and control output signals based on an external CLOCK, an END signal, and an asynchronous RESET condition. The input ports include CLOCK, END, and RESET, where CLOCK is used to drive the main sequential logic, END triggers address increment and ROM operations, and RESET asynchronously resets the ROM address to 0. The output ports are CLOCK_500, derived from the 9th bit of an internal 11-bit counter (COUNTER_500), CLOCK_2 derived from the 1st bit of the same counter, a 24-bit DATA that combines a constant with 16-bit ROM data, and GO, a control signal that gates operations based on address limits and the END signal state. Internal signals include COUNTER_500, which increments upon CLOCK’s rising edge affecting CLOCK_500 and CLOCK_2; ROM, an array storing data values affected by the END signal; DATA_A, holding values from ROM; and ‘address,’ an address pointer managed by RESET and END. Other sections include logic for updating the ROM and DATA_A on the positive edge of END, decrementing a volume register (vol) on the positive edge of RESET, and updating the counter on CLOCK's rising edge. This module fundamentally ensures the management and synchronization of data related to a ROM with respect to the input control signals.
