It takes a digital audio sample (`input_sample`) and applies a feedback loop through a shift register (`shiftregister`). The feedback (`feedbackloop`) is directly taken from the output sample. It manipulates the delayed signal (`divdelay`) by performing a bit shift and masking operation to modify the echo's characteristics. The final output (`output_sample`) is computed by adding the modified delayed signal back to the original input sample on each rising edge of the sample clock (`sample_clock`). This operation likely creates an echo by adding a time-delayed version of the audio back into the original audio signal."

Specific bits of `delay` are manipulated through shifting and masking (the top two bits are replicated, and the rest are shifted), tailoring the echo's character or effect by modifying how the past audio information contributes to the current output.\n- `feedbackloop`: Acts as a tie between the output `output_sample` and the input to the shift register (`shiftin`).
