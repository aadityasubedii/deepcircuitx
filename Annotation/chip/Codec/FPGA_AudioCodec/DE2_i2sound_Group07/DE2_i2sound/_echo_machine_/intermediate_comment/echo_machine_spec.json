    "spec": "Module name: echo_machine.\nModule specification: The `echo_machine` module is designed to process an audio input to create an echo effect in Verilog. It accepts two input ports: `sample_clock`, a clock signal that synchronizes the operations within the module, and `input_sample`, a 16-bit digital representation of the audio sample being processed. The module outputs a single 16-bit signal, `output_sample`, which is the audio signal after the echo effect has been applied. Internally, the module utilizes three significant signals: `delay`, which stores the previously delayed audio sample from a shift register; `divdelay`, a manipulated version of `delay` where specific bits are shifted and masked to modify the echo effect; and `feedbackloop`, which creates a feedback mechanism by linking the output sample back to the shift register's input. The module's core functionality is defined in two primary blocks: the `shiftregister` instantiation that manages the delay of the audio signal based on the feedback loop, and a sequential logic block within an `always @(posedge sample_clock)` block that computes the final `output_sample` by adding the modified delayed signal (`divdelay`) to the original `input_sample`, thus producing the echo effect with each rising edge of the clock. This combination of feedback loop implementation and signal manipulation effectively simulates an echo in the audio output.",
