Module-level comment: The Wrapper module interfaces an FIR filter to process 16-bit inputs (input_sample), synchronizing outputs (output_sample) with a sample_clock. Internally, it uses the myfilter signal to store the FIR filter output and updates output_sample every positive clock edge, ensuring reliable, timed data flow within larger signal processing systems.
