The input and output samples are both 16-bit wide. The module uses a sample_clock for synchronization and has a reset signal. Within the module, the FIR filter processes the input_sample and produces myfilter, which is then assigned to output_sample at every positive edge of sample_clock. This functionality suggests that the module acts as a simple pass-through conduit for the FIR filter, integrating it within a larger digital signal processing system."

It synchronizes the operations within the module, particularly the transfer of the filtered signal to the output.\n- reset: This input is used to reset the internal states of the module or components within it, typically the FIR filter, to a known state when asserted.\n- input_sample: This is a 16-bit wide input port that serves as the data input to the module. It is processed by the FIR filter component connected within the module.\n\nOutput ports: output_sample.\nExplanation: \n- output_sample: This is a 16-bit wide output port.
