Module name: Wrapper. 
Module specification: The Wrapper module acts as an interface for an FIR filter in a digital signal processing system. It synchronizes processing using a `sample_clock` and includes a `reset` signal for resetting the internal state of the FIR filter. The module takes a 16-bit `input_sample` and outputs a corresponding 16-bit `output_sample`. The `input_sample` is processed by the FIR filter, the output of which is stored in the internal signal `myfilter`. This 16-bit wide signal holds the filtered result from the FIR filter and on every positive edge of the `sample_clock`, the value of `myfilter` is assigned to `output_sample`. The code contains two main blocks: the instantiation of the FIR filter, mapped with appropriate inputs and outputs, and the synchronization logic in an always block, responsible for updating the `output_sample` at each positive clock edge based on the filtered data. This structure ensures the Wrapper module effectively integrates and manages the FIR filter's output within the larger system.
