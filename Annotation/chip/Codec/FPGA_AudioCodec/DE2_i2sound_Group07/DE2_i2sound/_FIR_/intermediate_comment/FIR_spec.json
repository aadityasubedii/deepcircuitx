This module is synchronized using a clock signal (`clk`) and can be reset (`rst_n`, active low) to a default state. It processes the input signal `filter_in` (16-bit), which passes through a shift register pipeline (`delay_pipeline`) that stores current and historical signal values. The module calculates weighted sums of these values using predefined coefficients (`coeff0` to `coeff8`), resulting in intermediate products (`product`) which are accumulated into a final sum (`sum`). This sum, after appropriate bit truncation, forms the processed signal output `filter_out` (16-bit). The Verilog implementation is organized into three primary always blocks: one for updating the `delay_pipeline` on each clock edge or resetting it on reset, another for calculating the products of pipeline values and coefficients, and a third for summing these products to compute the final output signal. Each block is designed to react to either the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset signal, ensuring precise timing and control of the digital filtering process.",

The FIR filter receives an input signal `filter_in` and outputs a processed signal `filter_out`.

This array stores the current and past inputs sequentially, providing a memory for past sampled values needed for the FIR computation.\n- `product`: This is an array of 9 registers, each capable of storing a 24-bit value.

This multiplication is the core of the convolution operation performed by the FIR filter.\n- `sum`: A single 27-bit register that stores the accumulated sum of all values in the `product` array.
