The FIR filter receives an input signal `filter_in` and outputs a processed signal `filter_out`. It uses a series of coefficients (coeff0 to coeff8) to apply a linear filter by performing convolution operations on a series of input data stored in a delay pipeline. The output is a weighted sum of the current and previous input values, each weighted by a predefined coefficient. The sum of the products is then truncated to fit the output range before being outputted. This process is controlled by a clock signal `clk` and can be reset with the `rst_n` reset signal."

This array stores the current and past inputs sequentially, providing a memory for past sampled values needed for the FIR computation.\n- `product`: This is an array of 9 registers, each capable of storing a 24-bit value.

This multiplication is the core of the convolution operation performed by the FIR filter.\n- `sum`: A single 27-bit register that stores the accumulated sum of all values in the `product` array.
