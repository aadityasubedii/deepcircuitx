    "module": "Module-level comment: The FIR module implements a finite impulse response filter for digital signals. It utilizes a clock-controlled pipeline (`delay_pipeline`) storing current and past input values, multiplies these with predefined coefficients (`coeff0` to `coeff8`), and sums the products (`product`). The resulting weighted sum (`sum`) is outputted as `filter_out` after truncation, providing a filtered signal synchronized with the `clk` and resettable by `rst_n`."
