Module name: serial_fir_filter. Module specification: The "serial_fir_filter" is a Verilog module designed to implement a serial Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter using digital signal processing techniques, specifically for filtering input data streams with predefined characteristics. The module processes input data 'd' through a series of register-based delays, employing multiplication by predefined coefficients (stored in a lookup table) and subsequent accumulation to produce a filtered output 'q'. The primary input ports of this module include 'clk' (clock signal for synchronization), 'reset_n' (active low reset signal for clearing registers), and 'd' (the incoming data stream to be filtered). The output of the module is 'q', which holds the result of the FIR filtering process. Internally, the module utilizes several signals: 'delay' (an array storing delayed versions of the input 'd'), 'prod' (stores the product of the input and coefficient), 'sum' (accumulates the results to produce the final output), 'lut_rom' (an array holding filter coefficients), and 'coefficient' (temporarily stores current coefficients during processing). The code includes blocks for initializing the lookup table, generating delays using registers, computing product and sum in dedicated submodules (signed_multiply and signed_adder), and efficiently handling data outputs through registers. This arrangement ensures precision in digital filtering matched to the design of the FIR filter.
