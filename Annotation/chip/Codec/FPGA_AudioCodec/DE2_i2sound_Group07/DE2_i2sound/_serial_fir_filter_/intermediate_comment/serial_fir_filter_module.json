    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"serial_fir_filter\" Verilog module implements a serial Finite Impulse Response filter, processing an input data stream through regenerative delays, multiplication by coefficients from a lookup table, and accumulation for output. It uses registers to manage delays, a multiplier for computing term products, an adder for summing terms, and a register array for storing coefficients, ensuring synchronized operations with the 'clk' signal."
