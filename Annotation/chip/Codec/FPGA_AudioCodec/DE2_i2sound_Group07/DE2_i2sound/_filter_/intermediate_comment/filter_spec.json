    "spec": "Module name: filter. Module specification: The 'filter' module is designed to process an input signal 'input_sample1' through digital filtering to produce a less noisy and refined output 'output_sample1'. The module features three input ports: 'sample_clock' (a clock signal that triggers filter operations at rising edges), 'reset' (resets the internal states and outputs of the module), and 'input_sample1' (the signal to be filtered). The single output port 'output_sample1' provides the filtered result. Internally, the module utilizes several signals including 'delayholder' (an array storing delayed input samples for convolution), 'summation' (an array holding products of sample and coefficient pairs), 'finsummations' (an array of intermediate sum results), 'finsummation' (a register accumulating the final sum), 'coeffs' (an array storing filter coefficients), and loop control variables 'x' and 'z'. The code can be conceptualized into three main blocks: coefficient initialization (which sets all coefficient values), a convolution operation (handled by a 'generate' block for multipliers that compute 'summation'), and the core functional block triggered by either 'sample_clock' or 'reset'. This last block handles the stages of sample delay updating, convolution summation, and assignment of result to the output, incorporating necessary conditions for resetting the module. This structure ensures that each input sample is filtered according to the defined coefficients, producing a corresponding output sample after digital filtering operations.",

The module uses a series of coefficients ('coeffs') and maintains an array of delayed values of input samples ('delayholder') for convolution. With every positive edge of the sample clock or reset, it updates the delayed samples, computes a summation of products of each delayed sample with its corresponding coefficient, and outputs the final accumulated sum as the filtered output.
