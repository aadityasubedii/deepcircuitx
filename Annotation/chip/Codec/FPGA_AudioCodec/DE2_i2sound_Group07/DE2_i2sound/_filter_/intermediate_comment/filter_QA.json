The module uses a series of coefficients ('coeffs') and maintains an array of delayed values of input samples ('delayholder') for convolution. With every positive edge of the sample clock or reset, it updates the delayed samples, computes a summation of products of each delayed sample with its corresponding coefficient, and outputs the final accumulated sum as the filtered output. If reset is high, it clears the output and all delayed values. The filter seems to be potentially designed for operations such as noise reduction or signal extraction from an original noisy input signal."

It is used in the convolution process where each past sample is multiplied with a corresponding coefficient.\n- **summation**: This is a wire array of signed 32-bit integers. Each element holds the product of an input sample from `delayholder` and the corresponding coefficient from `coeffs`. The products are accumulated to compute the filtered output.\n- **finsummations**: This register array stores intermediate results during the summing process. Specifically, it holds truncated and re-signed versions of data from `summation`, which are then accumulated to form the final output.\n- **finsummation**: This is a register that keeps the running sum of the elements in `finsummations`. It represents the total convolution result before being outputted as `output_sample1`.\n- **coeffs**: This is a signed 16-bit register array containing the coefficients used for filtering. These coefficients are applied to the samples stored in `delayholder` for the convolution operation that results in the filtered output.\n- **x, z**: These are integer variables used for loop control in the module. `x` is used to initialize the coefficients in a loop, and `z` is employed in loops that manage the delay line updates and summing operations in the data path."
