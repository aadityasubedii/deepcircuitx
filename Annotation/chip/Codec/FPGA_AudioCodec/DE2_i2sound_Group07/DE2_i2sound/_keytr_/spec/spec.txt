Module name: keytr. 

Module specification: The 'keytr' module is designed to monitor and process a key input signal using a synchronized clock to generate two outputs, ON and KEYON, alongside a 10-bit counter output. The functionality revolves around the status of the key input and the value of the counter. The inputs include 'key'—used to determine the ON output and 'clock'—which synchronizes and controls the incrementing of the counter. The outputs are 'ON', which indicates the operational status based on the key input and the 9th bit of the counter, 'KEYON' which is determined based on specific values of the counter to indicate certain ranges of operation, and 'counter' that reflects the counter's current value. Internally, the module utilizes two main signals: 'counter', a 10-bit register that tracks increments and resets based on specific conditions, and 'KEYON', a register to hold the state of the KEYON output. The code consists of several functional blocks: an assignment for the 'ON' output based on the key input and the 9th bit of the counter, a sequential block that handles the resetting or incrementing of the 'counter' on the falling edge of the ON signal or the rising edge of the clock, and another sequential block that updates the 'KEYON' output based on the specific range of the counter’s value during each clock cycle. This design is intended for applications requiring synchronization with input signals, conditional resetting, and step-based logic control.
