    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a Reed-Solomon (RS) encoder using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) structure. It processes input symbols through a configurable Galois Field multiplier network, generating both original data and parity symbols. The module supports variable symbol widths (3-8 bits) and parity symbol counts. It uses parameterized Galois Field multipliers for different field sizes, handles input/output timing with start/end-of-packet signals, and employs a state machine to manage symbol processing and parity calculation across a packet."
