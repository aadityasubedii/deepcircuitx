    "spec": "Module name: rs_encoder.\n\nModule specification: The `rs_encoder` module is designed to perform Reed-Solomon encoding, commonly used in error-correction within data communication systems. It employs a submodule called `rs_lfsr` to handle the encoding process based on the Linear Feedback Shift Register method tailored to the Reed-Solomon algorithm. The module has several input ports including `clk` (a clock input that synchronizes operations within the module), `rst_n` (an active low reset to initialize or reset the module state), `din_val` (signals if the incoming data is valid), `din_sop` (indicates the start of a data packet), and `din` (the actual data input with a symbol width defined by the parameter `SYM_BW`). Corresponding output ports include `dout_val` (indicates if the outgoing data is valid), `dout_sop` (marks the beginning of the output data packet), `dout_eop` (signals the end of the output data packet), and `dout` (carries the encoded output symbols, with the same width as `din`). Inside the module, these ports are directly connected to the `rs_lfsr` submodule, acting as internal signals that facilitate the passing of operational commands and data between the input interface and the `rs_lfsr` encoding logic. The module\u2019s internal design showcases a clear delineation between data initiation, processing through `rs_lfsr`, and the output generation, structured to effectively encode data packets as per the Reed-Solomon encoding standards. The parameters like `SYM_BW`, `N_NUM`, and `R_NUM` allow customization of symbol width, total number of symbols, and redundancy symbols respectively, providing flexibility to adapt to various data encoding requirements.",
