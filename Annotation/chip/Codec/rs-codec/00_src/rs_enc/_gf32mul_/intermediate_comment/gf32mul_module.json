    "module": "Module-level comment: The gf32mul module performs Galois Field multiplication in GF(2^5) using two 5-bit vectors 'a' and 'b'. The output 'z' is computed based on 'b's value through bitwise XOR and shifts directly within an `always` block, which utilizes a `case` statement for specific operations. Unmatched 'b' values default 'z' to zero, fitting cryptographic and error correction applications."
