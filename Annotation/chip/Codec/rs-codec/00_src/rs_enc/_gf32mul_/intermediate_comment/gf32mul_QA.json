Each specific case within the `always` block corresponds to different fixed multipliers (values of `b`), for which the output `z` is calculated through bitwise operations of shifting and XOR on the bits of `a`. If the value of `b` is not specifically handled in the cases, the output `z` is set to all zeros.
