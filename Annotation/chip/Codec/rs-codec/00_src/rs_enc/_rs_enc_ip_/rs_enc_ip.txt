Module-level comment: The 'rs_enc_ip' module is a Reed-Solomon encoder handling variable symbol widths (3-8 bits). It takes 8-bit input data, synchronized with control signals for packet boundaries, and outputs encoded data with similar controls. Implementation employs a set of parameterized LFSRs for each symbol width, selecting and outputting data based on a delayed symbol width signal, ensuring efficiency and flexibility in encoding data with variable RS code configurations.
