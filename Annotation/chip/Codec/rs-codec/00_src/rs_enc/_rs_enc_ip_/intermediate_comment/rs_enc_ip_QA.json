It accepts input data `din` which, based on the symbol width specified by `sym_width`, is processed by one of the multiple internal Reed-Solomon Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) modules (`u_rs_lfsr3` to `u_rs_lfsr8`). Each LFSR submodule corresponds to a different symbol width and is parameterized accordingly; they are responsible for encoding the input data. The encoder also manages signals for data validation (`din_val`), start of packet (`din_sop`), and outputting the encoded data along with control signals (`dout_val`, `dout_sop`, and `dout_eop`). The module operates synchronously with a clock signal (`clk`) and a reset signal (`rst_n`). The encoding process activates selectively based on `sym_width`. The output encoding data width is unified to 8 bits by padding zeros on the left for smaller symbol widths."
