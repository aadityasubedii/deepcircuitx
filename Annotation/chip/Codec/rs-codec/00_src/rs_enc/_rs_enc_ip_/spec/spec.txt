Module name: rs_enc_ip.

Module specification: The 'rs_enc_ip' module is a Reed-Solomon (RS) encoder designed to encode data based on variable symbol widths ranging from 3 to 8 bits. It synchronously operates on a clock signal (`clk`) and involves handling an active low reset signal (`rst_n`). Input data is received through the `din` port, which is an 8-bit wide signal, alongside a 4-bit wide `sym_width` input that defines the symbol width for encoding. Control signals including `din_val` for input validation and `din_sop` for marking the start of a data packet complement the data inputs. The module produces encoded data through the `dout` port, also 8-bit wide, with corresponding control signals `dout_val`, `dout_sop`, and `dout_eop` indicating the validity and packet delimiters of the output.

Internally, the module deploys separate Reed-Solomon Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) blocks (`u_rs_lfsr3` to `u_rs_lfsr8`) tailored for each symbol width from 3 to 8 bits. Each LFSR block outputs corresponding validity, start and end of packet signals, and encoded data (`dout3` to `dout8`). All internal blocks are parameterized with specific RS code properties (total symbols `N_NUM` and redundancy symbols `R_NUM`). A delayed version of the input symbol width (`sym_width_d`) is maintained to synchronize the encoding process with the input settings.

The main control logic, managed within sequential always blocks triggered by the clock or reset events, handles the selection and output process based on the delayed symbol width (`sym_width_d`). Depending on the `sym_width_d` value, appropriate signals from the corresponding LFSR block are activated, and the output `dout` is constructed by zero-padding the LFSR outputs to maintain a uniform 8-bit width. The encoder supports dynamic switching among different symbol widths offering flexibility in data encoding based on varying requirements of the RS codes.
