    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'gf16mul' module performs polynomial basis multiplication in GF(2^4), crucial for cryptographic computations. It accepts two 4-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', where 'a' is multiplied by a constant derived from 'b' through a case statement that defines XOR operations for each potential value of 'b'. The result is stored in the 4-bit output 'z', ensuring correct execution of finite field arithmetic."
