    "spec": "Module name: gf16mul. Module specification: The 'gf16mul' module is designed to perform polynomial basis multiplication in the GF(2^4) field, particularly used in cryptographic calculations. It utilizes two 4-bit input ports: 'a' and 'b'. 'a' is the operand on which multiplication is performed, while 'b' determines the specific constant multiplier according to predefined mappings within the module. The result of the multiplication is outputted through a 4-bit register 'z', which is also an internal signal used to store intermediate values. The Verilog implementation comprises a combinational logic block structured as a case statement that reacts to changes in inputs 'a' and 'b'. Depending on the value of 'b', various bitwise XOR operations between the bits of 'a' are executed to calculate 'z'. Each case in the statement represents different constant multiplications, offering a comprehensive coverage for the constants commonly required in GF(2^4) operations. Default conditions set all bits of 'z' to 0, ensuring defined outputs for unspecified values of 'b'. This setup effectively encapsulates the GF(2^4) multiplication logic within a single module, suited for integration in larger cryptographic systems.",
