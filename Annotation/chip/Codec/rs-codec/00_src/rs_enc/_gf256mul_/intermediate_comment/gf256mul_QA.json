It takes two 8-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', and produces an 8-bit output 'z'. The module uses a case statement to implement different multiplication operations based on the value of 'b'. Each case represents a specific constant multiplier, and the corresponding XOR operations are performed on the bits of 'a' to produce the result 'z'.
