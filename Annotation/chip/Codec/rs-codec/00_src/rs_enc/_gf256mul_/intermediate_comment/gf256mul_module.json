    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/*\nThis module performs Galois Field multiplication in GF(2^8) for specific constant multipliers.\nIt takes 8-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', and produces an 8-bit output 'z'.\nThe multiplication is implemented using a case statement based on 'b',\nwhere each case represents a constant multiplier and applies specific XOR operations\non bits of 'a' to produce 'z'. This approach optimizes the multiplication\nfor predetermined constant values, commonly used in cryptographic applications.\n*/"
