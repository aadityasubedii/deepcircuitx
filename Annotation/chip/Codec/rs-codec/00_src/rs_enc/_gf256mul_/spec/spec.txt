Module name: gf256mul. Module specification: The gf256mul module performs Galois Field (GF) multiplication in GF(2^8) for specific constant multipliers. It takes two 8-bit inputs: 'a' (the value to be multiplied) and 'b' (the constant multiplier selector), and produces an 8-bit output 'z' (the multiplication result). The module does not use any internal signals beyond its input and output ports. The main functionality is implemented within a single always block using a case statement, which directly maps the input values to the output. The case statement covers multiple constant multipliers (represented by different values of 'b'), each implementing a specific set of XOR operations on the bits of 'a' to produce 'z'. For each case, the individual bits of 'z' are calculated using XOR operations on various combinations of bits from 'a'.
