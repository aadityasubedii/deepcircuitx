Module-level comment: 
/*
This module performs Galois Field multiplication in GF(2^8) for specific constant multipliers.
It takes 8-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', and produces an 8-bit output 'z'.
The multiplication is implemented using a case statement based on 'b',
where each case represents a constant multiplier and applies specific XOR operations
on bits of 'a' to produce 'z'. This approach optimizes the multiplication
for predetermined constant values, commonly used in cryptographic applications.
