Module name: gf128mul. Module specification: The gf128mul module implements Galois Field (GF) multiplication for 7-bit inputs in GF(2^7). It takes two 7-bit inputs 'a' and 'b' representing elements in GF(2^7) and produces a 7-bit output 'z' as the multiplication result. The module uses a combinational logic block implemented with a case statement to compute different multiplication results based on the value of input 'b'. Each case corresponds to a specific constant multiplication in the Galois Field, with results precomputed and represented as XOR operations of the bits of input 'a'. The module has no internal signals, as it directly processes inputs to produce the output within the always block. The main functional block is the case statement, which covers various predefined values of 'b' (from 1 to 127) and comp
