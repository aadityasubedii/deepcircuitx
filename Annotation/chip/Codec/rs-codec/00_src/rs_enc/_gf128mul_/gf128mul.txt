Module-level comment: /* This module implements Galois Field multiplication for 7-bit inputs in GF(2^7).
   It uses a case statement to perform constant multiplications based on input 'b'.
   The multiplication results are precomputed and implemented as XOR operations
   of bits from input 'a', allowing for efficient hardware implementation.
   The module is commonly used in cryptographic applications and error correction codes. */
