    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'gf8mul' module performs Galois Field (GF(8)) multiplication, utilizing two 3-bit inputs 'a' and 'b'. The input 'b' selects the transformation applied to 'a' in an always block using case statements. Each case manipulates output 'z' through bitwise operations, representing the product of the multiplication, with a default case to handle unexpected inputs by zeroing 'z'."
