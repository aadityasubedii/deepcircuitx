    "spec": "Module name: gf8mul. \nModule specification: The 'gf8mul' module is meticulously designed for executing multiplication in the Galois Field GF(8), featuring 8 elements, utilizing a complex transformation influenced by its inputs. It consists of two 3-bit input ports: 'a' and 'b'. The input 'a' serves as one operand for the multiplication, while 'b' selects the specific rule set for transforming 'a' during the multiplication operation to determine the outcome. The 3-bit output port 'z' furnishes the result of the Galois Field multiplication. Internally, the module forgoes additional signals, managing all transformations within the always block using special case constructs and direct manipulations of the 'z' output register. This register not only delivers the final result but also acts as the primary carrier of the internal state during processing. The module's core is organized into an `always` block that reacts to any changes in its inputs, encompassing a case statement where each case corresponds to a unique value of 'b', and orchestrates the output through selective XOR operations and assignments to 'z' from 'a'. Additionally, the default case ensures that 'z' is zeroed out when 'b' does not match any predefined transformation rules. Overall, this module is tailored not just for cryptographic and error-correcting applications but also to optimize digital signal processing within restricted finite fields.",

It takes two 3-bit inputs 'a' and 'b' and produces a 3-bit output 'z'. The multiplication result depends on the value of 'b'.

Different components of 'z' (i.e., z[0], z[1], z[2]) are assigned values derived from the bits of the input 'a' through conditional cases.
