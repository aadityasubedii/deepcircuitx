Module-level comment: This Verilog snippet does not encompass a traditional module but defines two crucial macros: `R_BW` at 6 and `SYM_BW_BW` at 4. These macros are potentially used to set bit widths for registers or parameters within a broader Verilog design context, aiding in configuration and standardization across the system. There are no functional blocks, ports, or internal signals involved in this code fragment. It solely provides macro definitions essential for subsequent design implementations.
