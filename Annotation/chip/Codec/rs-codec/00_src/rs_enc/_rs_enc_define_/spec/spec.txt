Module name: Not Specified. 
Module specification: Since the provided Verilog code does not constitute a complete module but solely consists of preprocessor macro definitions, there is no designated module name, input and output ports, internal signals, or distinct code blocks. Specifically, the code defines two macros: `R_BW` set to 6 and `SYM_BW_BW` set to 4. These macros are likely used in the configuration of parameters or settings within a larger Verilog system, potentially defining bit widths for registers or other symbolic bandwidth parameters. The absence of a traditional structural module means there are no ports or internal signals, and there are no functional blocks other than the macro definitions themselves in this particular snippet.
