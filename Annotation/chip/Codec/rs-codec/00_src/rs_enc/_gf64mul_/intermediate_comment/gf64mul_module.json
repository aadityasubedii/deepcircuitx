    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'gf64mul' module performs Galois Field (GF(2^6)) multiplication of two 6-bit operands, 'a' and 'b'. The output 'z' is a 6-bit product determined by switching on 'b', employing various XOR and bit manipulation operations directly mapped in an always block. This efficient implementation is key in cryptographic and error correction applications, with 'b' selectively altering 'a' transformation cases to compute 'z'."
