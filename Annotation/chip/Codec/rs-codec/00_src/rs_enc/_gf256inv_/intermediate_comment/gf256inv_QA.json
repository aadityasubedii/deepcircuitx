Each module takes an input 'a' of the respective field size and outputs the corresponding inverse 'z' using a lookup table implemented as a case statement.

Explanation: These modules do not use any internal signals. They directly map the input 'a' to the output 'z' using combinational logic implemented as a case statement.
