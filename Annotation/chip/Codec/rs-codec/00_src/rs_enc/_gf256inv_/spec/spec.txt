Module name: gf8inv, gf16inv, gf32inv, gf64inv, gf128inv, gf256inv. Module specification: These modules implement inverse calculations for Galois Fields (GF) of sizes 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256, respectively. Each module takes an n-bit input 'a' (where n is the field size in bits) representing an element in the respective Galois Field and outputs an n-bit result 'z' representing the inverse of 'a' in the field. The modules use combinational logic implemented as a case statement to perform a direct lookup of the inverse value for each possible input. There are no internal signals used within the modules. The code consists of a single always block that maps each input value to its corresponding inverse using a comprehensive case statement. This lookup table approach eliminates the need for complex calculations, providing an
