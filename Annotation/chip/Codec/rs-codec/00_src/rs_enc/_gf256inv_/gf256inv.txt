Module-level comment: 
/* This module calculates the inverse of an element in a Galois Field (GF) of size 2^n (n=3,4,5,6,7,8).
   It uses a lookup table implemented as a case statement to directly map each input value to its 
   corresponding inverse. This approach provides efficient and fast inverse calculation without 
   complex arithmetic operations, suitable for hardware implementation in cryptographic systems. */
