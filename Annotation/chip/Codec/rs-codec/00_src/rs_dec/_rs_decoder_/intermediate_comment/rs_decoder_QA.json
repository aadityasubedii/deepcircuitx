The parameters such as symbol width (SYM_BW), number of symbols (N_NUM), and redundancy (R_NUM) are configurable. The module uses sub-modules and a finite state mechanism to correct possible errors in the received data symbols. A sequence involves calculating syndromes, locating and validating errors, and finally correcting these errors to recover the original data. It entails components like syndrome calculation, key equation solver, error locator, and error value computation followed by error correction, which are mapped to various sub-modules within the code. The output consists of corrected data symbols along with control signals indicating data validity and count of symbols output."
