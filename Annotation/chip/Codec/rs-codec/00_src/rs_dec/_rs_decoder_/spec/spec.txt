Module name: rs_decoder. 

Module specification: The rs_decoder is a Reed-Solomon decoder designed for error correction in data transmission and storage. It is highly configurable, with parameters for symbol width (SYM_BW), number of symbols (N_NUM), and redundancy (R_NUM). The module's inputs include a clock signal (clk) to synchronize operations, an active-low reset signal (rst_n) for initializing internal states, and a data interface comprising data input (din) along with its validity (din_val) and packet boundary signals (din_sop and din_eop). The outputs of the module are the corrected data symbol (symb_corrected), a validity signal (symb_out_val), and a count of the output symbols (symb_out_cnt).

Internally, the rs_decoder employs several signals: syndrome_val for the validity of syndrome calculations, kes_ok for completion of the key equation solver process, and err_val_done signaling the error validation conclusion. Additional wires like dec_done indicate overall decoding process completion. Several modules are instantiated within this decoder: syndrome calculation, key equation solver (kes), error locator, and error value computation, each handling specific steps in the error detection and correction pipeline. 

Furthermore, the rs_decoder uses several generate blocks to instantiate a FIFO buffer based on the specified symbol width for intermediate data storage. The correction of errors and management of decoded output are managed through the dec_ctrl and err_correct modules, which synchronize the processing, fetch error details, and adjust outputs accordingly. This structure ensures effective decoding, error correction, and data handling tailored to varied symbol widths and error correction requirements.
