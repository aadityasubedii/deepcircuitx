Module-level comment: The `rs_decoder` module implements a Reed-Solomon error correction system. It utilizes internal modules for syndrome calculation, key equation solving, error location, and correction, managed via finite state mechanisms. Configurable by symbol width, number count, and redundancy parameters, it controls data error correction processes through a sequence of synchronizing signals and component-wise validation, effectively correcting transmitted or stored data symbols.
