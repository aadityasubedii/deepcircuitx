Module name: Not applicable. Module specification: The provided Verilog snippet does not define an actual hardware module but rather sets up macro definitions for use in other parts of a digital system design. Specifically, the code defines two macros: `R_BW` with a value of 6 and `SYM_BW_BW` with a value of 4. These are intended to standardize bit widths across various modules within the system, ensuring consistency in data dimensions. There are no input or output ports, nor are there any internal signals or computational elements, as this code segment purely consists of configuration definitions. The snippet is solely focused on the definition of constants used for configuration purposes and does not encompass any functional blocks or computational structures typical of a complete Verilog module. This setup aids in maintaining clean and manageable code across larger system designs by centralizing bit width specifications.
