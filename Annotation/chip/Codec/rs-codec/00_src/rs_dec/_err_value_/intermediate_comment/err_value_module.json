    "module": "Module-level comment: This module calculates error values for a Reed-Solomon decoder. It processes lambda and omega coefficients along with error locations over multiple clock cycles. Using Galois Field arithmetic (multiplication, inversion) for various symbol widths (3-8 bits), it computes error values and their locations. The module employs a multi-stage pipeline, including input processing, GF operations, error value calculation, and output generation. It supports flexible Reed-Solomon code configurations with parameterizable symbol width and error correction capability."
