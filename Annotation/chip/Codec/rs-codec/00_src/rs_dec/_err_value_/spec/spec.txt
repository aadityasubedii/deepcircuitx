Module name: err_value. Module specification: The err_value module implements error value calculation for a Reed-Solomon decoder. It processes error locations and coefficients (lambda and omega) over multiple clock cycles to generate error values and their corresponding locations. The module's inputs include clk (clock), rst_n (active-low reset), start (initiates calculation), lamda and omega (coefficient inputs), and err_loc (error locations). Outputs are err_val (calculated error values), err_loc_out (corresponding error locations), and done (calculation completion signal). Internal signals include registers for storing lambda, omega, and error locations, as well as intermediate calculation results and counters. The module is divided into several functional blocks: input processing, Galois Field arithmetic operations (multiplication and inversion), error value calculation, and output generation. It supports various symbol bit widths (3 to 8 bits) and different error correction capabilities, making it
