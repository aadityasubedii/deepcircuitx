    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"dec_ctrl\" module manages FIFO reads in a decoding system, controlled by clock (`clk`) and reset (`rst_n`). It starts count on error sync (`err_loc_val_sync`), and utilizes internal counters (`byte_cnt1`, `byte_cnt2`, `byte_cnt3`) for timing control. `byte_cnt1` initiates on error and counts to a set max, affecting `fifo_rd` and symbol processing (`symbol_out`). Counts are delayed for synchronization, directly impacting symbol counts (`symbol_cnt`) output."
