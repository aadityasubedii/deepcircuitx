The module uses a clock signal (clk) and an asynchronous reset signal (rst_n) to control its operation. The primary functionalities include count management using several registers (byte_cnt1, byte_cnt2, byte_cnt3), controlling the read enable signal (fifo_rd) for the FIFO based on the counts, and delaying the count values across cycles to synchronize data handling operations. The module also transfers the output from a FIFO buffer to the output of the module (symbol_out) one clock cycle after it is read, syncing with the count updates. Overall, this module is likely a part of a larger system that processes data symbols for error detection or correction, using the counts to handle timing and data flow effectively."

This can represent the current symbol being processed by the system.\n  \n**Output ports**: fifo_rd, symbol_cnt, symbol_out.\n- **Explanation**:\n  - **fifo_rd (FIFO read)**: This signal is used to control the reading operation from the FIFO.
