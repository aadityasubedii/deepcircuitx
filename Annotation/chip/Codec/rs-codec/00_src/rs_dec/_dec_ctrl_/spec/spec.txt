Module name: dec_ctrl. Module specification: The "dec_ctrl" module is designed to manage the reading and processing of data from a FIFO buffer particularly in a decoding system where error locations are used to control data flow. The module operates under the control of a system clock signal (`clk`) and responds to an asynchronous reset (`rst_n`). It uses the `err_loc_val_sync` signal as a trigger to manage control flow by initializing and maintaining count counters (`byte_cnt1` to `byte_cnt3`). These counts are used to operate the `fifo_rd` signal which controls when the FIFO is read. The module outputs include `fifo_rd` which signals reading from the FIFO, `symbol_cnt` showing the delayed count of processed symbols, and `symbol_out` which outputs the processed symbol. Internally, the module features three registers (`byte_cnt1`, `byte_cnt2`, `byte_cnt3`). `byte_cnt1` is the primary counter which increments based on error location synchronization until a max count (`N_NUM`), `byte_cnt2` and `byte_cnt3` serve as delayed stages to synchronize internal processing. Additionally, the code consists of blocks managing these counters, the FIFO read control based on these counters, and the output of current symbol values, operating synchronously with the input clock and asynchronously resetting as per `rst_n` to maintain proper system operation and timings.
