Module name: err_locate. Module specification: The err_locate module is designed for error location in Reed-Solomon decoding. It implements the Chien search algorithm to find roots of the error locator polynomial in a Galois Field, which correspond to error positions in the received codeword. The module takes inputs clk (clock), rst_n (active-low reset), start (initiation signal), and lamda (error locator polynomial coefficients). It outputs err_loc (calculated error locations) and done (completion signal). Key internal signals include ID_S_32a32f8d_795a5f17_E (Galois Field element lookup table), ID_S_f176c2b_400d4b5a_E (intermediate Galois Field multiplication results), ID_S_71534e04_678b7aad_E (error locator polynomial evaluation result), and ID_S
