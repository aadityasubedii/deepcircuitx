    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements the Chien search algorithm for error location in Reed-Solomon decoding. It evaluates the error locator polynomial over the Galois Field to find its roots, which correspond to error positions. The module uses a lookup table for Galois Field elements, performs iterative polynomial evaluation through Galois Field multiplications and additions, and outputs the error locations when roots are found. It supports configurable symbol widths and Reed-Solomon code parameters."
