    "spec": "Module name: syndrome. \n\nModule specification: The 'syndrome' module is a sophisticated digital component utilized in error-correcting code systems for calculating syndrome values based on received data. This module processes data symbols using Galois Field (GF) multiplications which are parameterized by the symbol bit width (SYM_BW). It can robustly handle symbols of varying bit widths due to configurable blocks for different GF multiplications, making it highly adaptable for various communication systems. The inputs to this module include a clock signal (`clk`) to coordinate operations, an active-low reset (`rst_n`) to manage internal states, data validity signal (`din_val`), start (`din_sop`) and end (`din_eop`) of packet indicators, and the actual data input (`din`). Outputs consist of `syndrome_val`, a validity signal for the calculated syndrome which asserts at the end of a data packet, and the `syndrome` itself, which is the result of the polynomial division performed. Internal signals such as `alpha_c` contain pre-defined coefficients for GF calculations tailored to the symbol bit width, and `sp` holds intermediate computed syndrome values during cycles. The module is structured into several blocks: dynamically assigned coefficients (`alpha_c`) dependent on `SYM_BW` within a `generate` block, multiple instances of GF multipliers for syndrome calculation (`sp` signals), and conditional syndrome accumulation which utilizes the computed `sp` values based on the presence or absence of a valid data signal. This conditional logic for data handling and syndrome calculation ensures accurate error detection necessary for reliable data transmission in communication systems.",

It uses pre-defined alpha coefficients for polynomial multiplication varying by the symbol width. The module processes input data symbol-by-symbol, each clock cycle, updating syndrome values which are used later for error detection and correction in a communication system. The module uses parameterized fields allowing flexibility for different configurations, accommodating various code word lengths and error correction capabilities. Inputs include data symbols and control signals (start of packet, end of packet), and the outputs include syndrome values indicative of data integrity across the communication channel."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports: clk, rst_n, din_val, din_sop, din_eop, din. \nExplanation:\n- **clk**: Clock signal used to synchronize the operation of the module. Each edge of the clock processes new data or updates the data operation.\n- **rst_n**: Active low reset signal that initializes or resets the module's internal states and flip-flops, setting the output syndrome and status signals to their default states.\n- **din_val**: Data valid signal which indicates when the data input (din) is valid and should be processed.\n- **din_sop**: Start of packet signal that marks the beginning of a new data packet, initializing the syndrome calculation for new data.\n- **din_eop**: End of packet signal that indicates the end of the current data packet, the point at which the computed syndrome should be considered complete and related to this specific packet.\n- **din**: Data input port carrying the symbols to be processed for syndrome calculation, typically represents a character or a byte of data depending on the configuration (SYM_BW).\n\nOutput ports: syndrome_val, syndrome.\nExplanation:\n- **syndrome_val**: A signal that becomes valid when the end of a packet (din_eop) is detected. It essentially flags that the syndrome value at the output can be read and signifies that the syndrome computation for a particular packet has been completed.\n- **syndrome**: The calculated syndrome value based on the input data and the predetermined polynomial coefficients. It holds the results of the polynomial division, representing error or alteration in the transmitted data. This output is pivotal for error detection and potentially for correction in error-correction coding systems. The width and the content of this output vary depending on the inputs throughout the processing of the data packet."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: alpha_c, sp.\n\nExplanation:\n- **alpha_c**: An array of constants that represent pre-defined coefficients for the Galois Field (GF) polynomials. These coefficients are used for polynomial multiplication depending on the symbol bit width (SYM_BW). `alpha_c` values are set dynamically based on `SYM_BW` within the `generate` block, providing the necessary coefficients for the Galois Field operations specified by the number of bits per symbol.\n\n- **sp**: An intermediate signal array reflecting partially computed syndrome values for each term in the sequence. These signals are used as intermediate values in the computation of the overall syndrome. Each element of `sp` is computed by multiplying the corresponding `alpha_c` coefficient with the respective portion of the overall `syndrome` value, creating a modular result from the polynomial perspective. These results are then used in the subsequent iterations or cycles to adjust or compute the final syndrome based on the incoming data symbols (`din`)."

The inputs to this module include a clock signal (`clk`) to coordinate operations, an active-low reset (`rst_n`) to manage internal states, data validity signal (`din_val`), start (`din_sop`) and end (`din_eop`) of packet indicators, and the actual data input (`din`). Outputs consist of `syndrome_val`, a validity signal for the calculated syndrome which asserts at the end of a data packet, and the `syndrome` itself, which is the result of the polynomial division performed. Internal signals such as `alpha_c` contain pre-defined coefficients for GF calculations tailored to the symbol bit width, and `sp` holds intermediate computed syndrome values during cycles. The module is structured into several blocks: dynamically assigned coefficients (`alpha_c`) dependent on `SYM_BW` within a `generate` block, multiple instances of GF multipliers for syndrome calculation (`sp` signals), and conditional syndrome accumulation which utilizes the computed `sp` values based on the presence or absence of a valid data signal. This conditional logic for data handling and syndrome calculation ensures accurate error detection necessary for reliable data transmission in communication systems."

It uses pre-defined alpha coefficients for polynomial multiplication varying by the symbol width. The module processes input data symbol-by-symbol, each clock cycle, updating syndrome values which are used later for error detection and correction in a communication system. The module uses parameterized fields allowing flexibility for different configurations, accommodating various code word lengths and error correction capabilities. Inputs include data symbols and control signals (start of packet, end of packet), and the outputs include syndrome values indicative of data integrity across the communication channel."

Each edge of the clock processes new data or updates the data operation.\n- **rst_n**: Active low reset signal that initializes or resets the module's internal states and flip-flops, setting the output syndrome and status signals to their default states.\n- **din_val**: Data valid signal which indicates when the data input (din) is valid and should be processed.\n- **din_sop**: Start of packet signal that marks the beginning of a new data packet, initializing the syndrome calculation for new data.\n- **din_eop**: End of packet signal that indicates the end of the current data packet, the point at which the computed syndrome should be considered complete and related to this specific packet.\n- **din**: Data input port carrying the symbols to be processed for syndrome calculation, typically represents a character or a byte of data depending on the configuration (SYM_BW).\n\nOutput ports: syndrome_val, syndrome.\nExplanation:\n- **syndrome_val**: A signal that becomes valid when the end of a packet (din_eop) is detected. It essentially flags that the syndrome value at the output can be read and signifies that the syndrome computation for a particular packet has been completed.\n- **syndrome**: The calculated syndrome value based on the input data and the predetermined polynomial coefficients. It holds the results of the polynomial division, representing error or alteration in the transmitted data. This output is pivotal for error detection and potentially for correction in error-correction coding systems. The width and the content of this output vary depending on the inputs throughout the processing of the data packet."

These coefficients are used for polynomial multiplication depending on the symbol bit width (SYM_BW). `alpha_c` values are set dynamically based on `SYM_BW` within the `generate` block, providing the necessary coefficients for the Galois Field operations specified by the number of bits per symbol.\n\n- **sp**: An intermediate signal array reflecting partially computed syndrome values for each term in the sequence. These signals are used as intermediate values in the computation of the overall syndrome. Each element of `sp` is computed by multiplying the corresponding `alpha_c` coefficient with the respective portion of the overall `syndrome` value, creating a modular result from the polynomial perspective. These results are then used in the subsequent iterations or cycles to adjust or compute the final syndrome based on the incoming data symbols (`din`)."

This module processes data symbols using Galois Field (GF) multiplications which are parameterized by the symbol bit width (SYM_BW). It can robustly handle symbols of varying bit widths due to configurable blocks for different GF multiplications, making it highly adaptable for various communication systems. The inputs to this module include a clock signal (`clk`) to coordinate operations, an active-low reset (`rst_n`) to manage internal states, data validity signal (`din_val`), start (`din_sop`) and end (`din_eop`) of packet indicators, and the actual data input (`din`). Outputs consist of `syndrome_val`, a validity signal for the calculated syndrome which asserts at the end of a data packet, and the `syndrome` itself, which is the result of the polynomial division performed. Internal signals such as `alpha_c` contain pre-defined coefficients for GF calculations tailored to the symbol bit width, and `sp` holds intermediate computed syndrome values during cycles. The module is structured into several blocks: dynamically assigned coefficients (`alpha_c`) dependent on `SYM_BW` within a `generate` block, multiple instances of GF multipliers for syndrome calculation (`sp` signals), and conditional syndrome accumulation which utilizes the computed `sp` values based on the presence or absence of a valid data signal. This conditional logic for data handling and syndrome calculation ensures accurate error detection necessary for reliable data transmission in communication systems."
