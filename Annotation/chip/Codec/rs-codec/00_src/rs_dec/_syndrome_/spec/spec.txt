Module name: syndrome. 

Module specification: The 'syndrome' module is a sophisticated digital component utilized in error-correcting code systems for calculating syndrome values based on received data. This module processes data symbols using Galois Field (GF) multiplications which are parameterized by the symbol bit width (SYM_BW). It can robustly handle symbols of varying bit widths due to configurable blocks for different GF multiplications, making it highly adaptable for various communication systems. The inputs to this module include a clock signal (`clk`) to coordinate operations, an active-low reset (`rst_n`) to manage internal states, data validity signal (`din_val`), start (`din_sop`) and end (`din_eop`) of packet indicators, and the actual data input (`din`). Outputs consist of `syndrome_val`, a validity signal for the calculated syndrome which asserts at the end of a data packet, and the `syndrome` itself, which is the result of the polynomial division performed. Internal signals such as `alpha_c` contain pre-defined coefficients for GF calculations tailored to the symbol bit width, and `sp` holds intermediate computed syndrome values during cycles. The module is structured into several blocks: dynamically assigned coefficients (`alpha_c`) dependent on `SYM_BW` within a `generate` block, multiple instances of GF multipliers for syndrome calculation (`sp` signals), and conditional syndrome accumulation which utilizes the computed `sp` values based on the presence or absence of a valid data signal. This conditional logic for data handling and syndrome calculation ensures accurate error detection necessary for reliable data transmission in communication systems.
