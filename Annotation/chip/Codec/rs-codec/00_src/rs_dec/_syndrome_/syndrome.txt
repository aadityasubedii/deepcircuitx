Module-level comment: The 'syndrome' module computes the syndrome for error correction in data transmission, using parameterized Galois Field multiplications based on symbol bit width (SYM_BW). It accepts clocked inputs including data, packet markers, and outputs syndrome values. Internally, it employs conditional logic with a set of pre-computed coefficients (`alpha_c`) for GF operations, dynamically managing multiple GF polynomial multipliers and accumulators to process incoming data in synchrony with the clock, optimizing error detection effectiveness.
