    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/* This module performs Galois Field multiplication over GF(2^7) for decryption.\n   It takes two 7-bit inputs 'a' and 'b' and produces a 7-bit output 'z'.\n   The multiplication is implemented using a case statement that selects\n   specific XOR operations based on the value of 'b'. Each case defines\n   the bit-wise XOR operations required to compute the product for that\n   specific value of 'b', covering all 128 possible values (0 to 127). */"
