Module-level comment: 
/* This module performs Galois Field multiplication over GF(2^7) for decryption.
   It takes two 7-bit inputs 'a' and 'b' and produces a 7-bit output 'z'.
   The multiplication is implemented using a case statement that selects
   specific XOR operations based on the value of 'b'. Each case defines
   the bit-wise XOR operations required to compute the product for that
   specific value of 'b', covering all 128 possible values (0 to 127). */
