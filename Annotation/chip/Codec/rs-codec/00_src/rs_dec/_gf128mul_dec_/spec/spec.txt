Module name: gf128mul_dec. Module specification: This module implements Galois Field (GF) multiplication over GF(2^7) for decryption purposes. It takes two 7-bit inputs 'a' and 'b' representing elements in GF(2^7) and produces a 7-bit output 'z' that represents the product of 'a' and 'b' in the finite field. The module uses a large case statement within an always block to perform different XOR operations on the input bits based on the value of 'b', effectively implementing the multiplication operation. There are no explicit internal signals declared in this module; all computations are done using combinational logic directly with the input ports. The module is structured as a single block containing a case statement with 128 cases (0 to 127), each corresponding to a different value of 'b'. Each case defines the specific X
