    "spec": "Module name: gf8mul_dec. Module specification: The gf8mul_dec module is designed to perform multiplication in a Galois Field (GF) of size 8, utilizing a decoder-based approach. It takes two 3-bit inputs, 'a' and 'b', where 'a' is one operand of the multiplication and 'b' acts as the multiplier, determining the specific XOR combinations used in the multiplication process. The module outputs a 3-bit result 'z', which stores the product of 'a' and 'b'. The internal signal 'z' is also a 3-bit register used to hold intermediate values and the final product of the GF multiplication, based on XOR operations defined in the switch-case statement within the module. The 'always' block in the code contains a switch-case statement that evaluates the value of 'b'. Each case from 1 to 7 specifies different XOR manipulations of 'a' to compute 'z', while the default case sets 'z' to zero, handling scenarios where 'b' does not match any predefined multiplier cases. This structure ensures that the module comprehensively covers all possible multiplications of 'a' by values of 'b' from 0 to 7, facilitating efficient GF multiplication in hardware applications.",
