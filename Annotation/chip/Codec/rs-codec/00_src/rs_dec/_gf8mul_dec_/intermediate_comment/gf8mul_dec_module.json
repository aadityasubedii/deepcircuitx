    "module": "Module-level comment: The gf8mul_dec module performs 3-bit Galois Field multiplication using a decoder-based method. The module inputs 'a' and 'b' serve as operands, where 'b' determines XOR operations in a switch-case to compute the output 'z'. Cases 1 to 7 define specific XOR manipulations, while the default case results in 'z' being zero."
