    "module": "Module-level comment: This module converts an 8-bit index to its corresponding value in GF(256). It uses a combinational always block with a comprehensive case statement to map each possible 8-bit input to its GF(256) equivalent. The conversion is performed directly without intermediate signals, providing an efficient lookup-based implementation for Galois Field arithmetic operations."
