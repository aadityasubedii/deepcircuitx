Module name: idx2gf256. Module specification: This module converts an 8-bit index to its corresponding value in GF(256). It takes an 8-bit input 'idx' and produces an 8-bit output 'z'. The module uses a combinational always block with a case statement to perform the conversion. There are no internal signals used; the conversion is done directly from input to output. The case statement covers all 256 possible input values, mapping each to a specific GF(256) value. This module is part of a series of similar modules (idx2gf8, idx2gf16, idx2gf32, idx2gf64, idx2gf128) that perform index-to-Galois Field conversions for different field sizes. The structure is simple and straightforward, consisting of a single always block that handles the entire conversion process. This design allows for efficient lookup-base
