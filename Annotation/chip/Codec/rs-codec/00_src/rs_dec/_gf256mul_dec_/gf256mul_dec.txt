Module-level comment: This module implements Galois Field multiplication over GF(2^8). It takes two 8-bit inputs 'a' and 'b' and produces an 8-bit output 'z'. The multiplication is performed using a large case statement that covers all 256 possible values of 'b'. For each case, specific XOR operations are applied to the bits of 'a' to compute the corresponding output 'z'. This lookup table-based approach efficiently implements GF(2^8) multiplication, commonly used in cryptographic algorithms and error correction codes.
