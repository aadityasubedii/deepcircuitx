Module name: gf256mul_dec. Module specification: This module implements Galois Field multiplication over GF(2^8), taking two 8-bit inputs 'a' and 'b' and producing an 8-bit output 'z'. The module uses a large case statement to perform the multiplication based on the value of input 'b'. For each possible value of 'b' (0 to 255), there is a specific set of XOR operations applied to the bits of input 'a' to produce the output 'z'. The module has two input ports: 'a[7:0]' and 'b[7:0]', representing the operands for the Galois Field multiplication, and one output port: 'z[7:0]', representing the result of the multiplication. There are no internal signals defined in this module as all operations are performed directly on the input ports to
