Module-level comment: The gf16mul_dec module is designed for Galois Field (GF) multiplication with 16 elements, handling 4-bit inputs `a` and `b`. Input `b` selects a multiplication rule that is applied to `a` through an always block using a case statement, which specifies bitwise XOR operations to compute the output `z` combinatorially for each possible value of `b`, ensuring immediate reflection of input changes.
