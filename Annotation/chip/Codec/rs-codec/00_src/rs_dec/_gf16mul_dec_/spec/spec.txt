Module name: gf16mul_dec.  
Module specification: The gf16mul_dec module performs Galois Field (GF) multiplication with 16 elements. It uses 4-bit input vectors `a` and `b` to compute the result. The input vector `a` represents one operand of the multiplication, and `b` functions as a selector that determines the specific multiplication rule to be applied, as dictated by GF(16) rules. The result of the computation is stored in the 4-bit output register `z`. This module does not utilize any additional internal signals beyond `a`, `b`, and `z`. The primary operational block is an always block, driven combinatorially (`always @(*)`), containing a `case` statement that selects different XOR operations on `a` based on the value of `b` to compute and assign values to `z`. Each specific case in the block represents a different GF(16) multiplication operation, from `b=1` through `b=15`, with a default case that sets `z` to 0 if none of the other cases match. This comprehensive structure ensures that the operation and output of the module can immediately reflect any changes in the inputs.
