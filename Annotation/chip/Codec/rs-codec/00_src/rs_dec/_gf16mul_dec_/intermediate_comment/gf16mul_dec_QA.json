Each output bit of `z` is calculated by specific combinations of bitwise XOR operations on the bits of `a` depending on the value of `b`. The different case statements for `b` represent the different multiplication rules required for GF(16). The module utilizes a multiplexer behavior, where the value of `b` selects the rule to apply to compute each bit of `z`. The always block executes combinatorially, ensuring that the output `z` immediately reflects changes in `a` or `b`."

Depending on the value of `b`, different bitwise XOR operations are performed on the bits of `a` which are then assigned to `z`, effectively computing the product in GF(16).
