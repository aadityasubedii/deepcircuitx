It instantiates various Reed-Solomon decoders each configured for different symbol widths (3 to 8 bits). The module takes in data along with control signals like start of packet (sop), end of packet (eop), and valid signal. Depending on the symbol width, it routes the data to the appropriate decoder and outputs the count of symbols, a validity signal, and the corrected symbols. The output is dynamically selected based on the configured symbol width. This enables error correction over varying symbol sizes in digital communications."
