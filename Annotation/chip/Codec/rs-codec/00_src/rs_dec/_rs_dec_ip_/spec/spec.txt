Module name: rs_dec_ip. Module specification: The module rs_dec_ip is designed as a Reed-Solomon decoder interface for handling digital communication with varying symbol sizes, ranging from 3 to 8 bits. It functions to instanciate different Reed-Solomon decoders based on the input symbol width (sym_width) and efficiently routes the incoming data to the appropriate decoder. The input ports of the module include clk (clock signal), rst_n (active low reset), din_val (data validity signal), din_sop (start of packet signal), din_eop (end of packet signal), din (data input), and sym_width (symbol width selector). The output ports consist of symb_out_cnt (count of processed symbols), symb_out_val (validity of the outputs), and symb_corrected (corrected output symbols). Internal signals such as sym_width_d and various symbol-specific counters, validity flags, and corrected symbols (e.g., symb3_out_cnt, symb3_out_val, symb3_corrected for 3-bit width) are implemented to manage data flow between the instantiated decoder modules and output selection logic based on sym_width. The module contains multiple blocks of rs_decoder instances for each symbol width, configured with specific parameters. Additionally, the module includes combinational and sequential logic to manage output selection and state initialization based on the reset status and clock signals, ultimately allowing for dynamic selection and error correction over adjustable symbol sizes within digital communication streams.
