Module-level comment: The rs_dec_ip module serves as a configurable Reed-Solomon decoder interface handling varying symbol widths (3-8 bits) in digital communications. It accepts data with control signals (start, end of packet, and valid) and routes them to the appropriate decoder based on symbol width. Each symbol width has a dedicated decoder instance with outputs dynamically selected and processed for error correction. The module implements internal registers and signal mappings to ensure stable operation and accurate data output.
