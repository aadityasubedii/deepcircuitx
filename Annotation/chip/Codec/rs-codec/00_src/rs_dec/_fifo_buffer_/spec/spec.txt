Module name: fifo_buffer. 
Module specification: The `fifo_buffer` module is designed as a parameterized First In, First Out (FIFO) buffer, using Verilog and is suitable for data synchronization and storage purposes in digital systems. It incorporates parameters for symbol width (`SYM_BW`) and depth (`DEPTH`), controlling the size and scale of the buffer's data handling capabilities. The module includes the following key ports: `clk` (clock input for synchronization), `rst` (reset input that initializes internal states), `rd` and `wr` (read and write control signals respectively), along with `datain` (input data port). Output ports include `dataout` (data output), `empty` (indicates buffer is empty), and `full` (indicates buffer is full). Internal signals such as `read_ptr` and `write_ptr` are used for tracking read and write positions respectively, while `counter` keeps track of stored data elements to help ascertain the full or empty status. The `ram` array serves as the actual storage structure. In the operation block, the module handles data writing and reading, including conditions for simultaneous reads and writes with proper pointer management and counter updates. Pointer wrap-around and counter adjustments are also effectively managed within respective input conditions, while the proper flags are assigned to `empty` and `full` by evaluating the counter in relation to the buffer's depth. This carefully designed FIFO buffer ensures efficient data handling with provision for reset, and simultaneous read/write operations.
