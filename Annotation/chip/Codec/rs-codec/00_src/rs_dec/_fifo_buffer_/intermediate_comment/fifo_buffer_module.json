    "module": "Module-level comment: The `fifo_buffer` module implements a parameterized FIFO buffer using `SYM_BW` for data width and `DEPTH` for storage capacity. It features synchronization via `clk`, initialization through `rst`, and data handling by `rd` and `wr` signals. Internally, it manages data storage in `ram`, tracking positions with `read_ptr` and `write_ptr`, and status with `counter`. It supports concurrent reads and writes, automatic pointer wrapping, and status indication through `empty` and `full` outputs."
