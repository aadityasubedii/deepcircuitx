It utilizes a parameterized data symbol width (`SYM_BW`) and depth (`DEPTH`). The module contains input and output ports for data, control signals for reading (`rd`) and writing (`wr`), and status flags (`empty`, `full`). Internally, it uses a simple memory (`ram`) to store the data, managed by read and write pointers (`read_ptr`, `write_ptr`). The FIFO buffer supports simultaneous read and write operations, handles wrap-around of pointers at the boundary, and keeps track of the number of elements in the buffer (`counter`) to determine if the buffer is full or empty. The operation is synchronized to a clock signal (`clk`) and can be reset (`rst`)."
