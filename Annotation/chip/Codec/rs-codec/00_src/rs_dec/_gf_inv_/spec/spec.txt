Module name: gf256inv. Module specification: The gf256inv module implements a 256-element Galois Field (GF(2^8)) inverter. It takes an 8-bit input 'a' and produces an 8-bit output 'z', which is the multiplicative inverse of 'a' in GF(2^8). The module has one input port, 'a[7:0]', representing the element to be inverted, and one output port, 'z[7:0]', representing the inverse element. There are no internal signals used within the module. The module consists of a single always block containing a large case statement that implements a lookup table for the inverse operation. Each case in the statement maps an input value to its corresponding inverse in the Galois Field. The default case returns 0 for the input value 0, which has no multiplicative inverse. This design
