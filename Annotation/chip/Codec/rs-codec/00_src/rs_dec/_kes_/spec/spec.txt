Module name: kes.

Module specification: The 'kes' module primarily functions as a computational unit for error correction purposes, utilizing syndromes and functions like lambda (λ) and omega (ω) which are typically employed in error detection and correction algorithms such as those used in communications systems. The core input ports include `clk` (clock), which synchronizes internal operations and timing; `rst_n` (reset), which is an active-low signal used to reset the module; `start`, a control signal that initiates the computation; and `syndrome`, which contains input values used in computations. The outputs of the module are `lambda` and `omega`, representing polynomial coefficients relevant for error correction, as well as the `done` signal, which indicates the completion of computations.

Internally, the module uses numerous registers and wires, such as `ID_S_f49cf8f_3369e3c5_E` and `ID_S_106cdefb_6c58346a_E`, which store interim computational values crucial for processing the inputs into outputs. The module uses control signals like `ID_S_354d19ab_1a25e150_E` for marking completion of tasks or processes within the unit. Several block structures such as `always` blocks are used for initializing, calculating, and reassigning these internal signals based upon various conditions, notably influenced by clock edges and reset states.

Additionally, the module employs `generate` blocks incorporating various compute sections depending on the configuration constraints like `SYM_BW` (symbol bit-width), ensuring flexibility and scalability of operations within frameworks using different symbol sizes and arithmetic complexities. These sections handle iterative processes, multiplications in Galois Fields, and assignments needed for the output generation of error-correcting codes. These combined elements are all vital to fulfilling the module's role in error detection and correction within digital communication systems.
