Module-level comment: The 'kes' module is designed for error correction, processing syndromes to calculate polynomial coefficients lambda and omega. It uses parameterizable settings for flexibility across different error-correcting codes. The module operates synchronously with a clock and implements state control via internal registers, employing Galois Field multipliers within generate blocks for polynomial computations. This structure handles iterative calculations crucial for the generation of outputs essential in error-detection systems.
