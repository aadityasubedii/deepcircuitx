Module-level comment: 
// This module implements Galois Field multiplication in GF(64).
// It takes two 6-bit inputs 'a' and 'b' and produces a 6-bit output 'z'.
// The multiplication is performed using a case statement that covers
// all possible values of 'b' (1 to 63). For each case, 'z' is computed
// by XORing specific bits of 'a' based on the value of 'b'. This
// approach efficiently implements finite field arithmetic for GF(64).
