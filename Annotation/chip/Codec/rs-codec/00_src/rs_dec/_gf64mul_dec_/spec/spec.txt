Module name: gf64mul_dec. Module specification: This module implements Galois Field multiplication in GF(64). It takes two 6-bit inputs 'a' and 'b' representing elements in GF(64) and produces a 6-bit output 'z' which is the result of their multiplication. The module uses a large case statement within an always block to perform the multiplication for different values of 'b' (from 1 to 63). Each case calculates the output 'z' by XORing specific bits of 'a' based on the value of 'b'. There are no internal signals used; all calculations are done directly using the input signals and assigned to the output. The module consists of a single combinational logic block with 63 cases, each representing a unique multiplication operation in GF(64). A default case is included to handle the scenario when 'b' is
