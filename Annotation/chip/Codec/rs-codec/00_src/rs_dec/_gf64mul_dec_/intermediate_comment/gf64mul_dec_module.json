    "module": "Module-level comment: \n// This module implements Galois Field multiplication in GF(64).\n// It takes two 6-bit inputs 'a' and 'b' and produces a 6-bit output 'z'.\n// The multiplication is performed using a case statement that covers\n// all possible values of 'b' (1 to 63). For each case, 'z' is computed\n// by XORing specific bits of 'a' based on the value of 'b'. This\n// approach efficiently implements finite field arithmetic for GF(64)."
