Module-level comment: The `err_correct` module performs error correction on symbol data by utilizing XOR operations based on error values and locations. It handles multiple input signals for symbol data and error specifics, processing them through registers and generate blocks suited for varied configurations. The module effectively adjusts to different error correction needs, dictated by parameters, ensuring adaptive and precise symbol correction.
