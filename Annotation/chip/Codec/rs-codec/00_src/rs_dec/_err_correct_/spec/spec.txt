Module name: err_correct. Module specification: The `err_correct` module is designed for error correction in symbols received within data communication or storage systems, using XOR operations based on error values and locations. The module inputs include `clk` (clock signal), `rst_n` (reset, active low), `start` (initiates correction), `symb_cnt` (counter of symbols processed), `symb_with_err` (symbols with errors), `err_val` (error values), and `err_loc` (error locations). The outputs are `symb_out_cnt` (mirrored symbol count), `symb_out_val` (validity of the output count), and `symb_corrected` (corrected symbols). Internal signals such as `err_val_curblk`, `err_loc_curblk`, and their delayed versions (`_1d`, `_2d`), store error information temporally for stable processing across cycles. The module employs generate statements to handle dynamic block configurations based on parameter `T_NUM`, with case structures enabling different corrective actions based on the symbol count. This ensures adaptability and precision in error correction across various configurations determined by parameters such as `SYM_BW`, `N_NUM`, `R_NUM` and dynamically calculating `T_NUM`, showing the module's versatility in different error correction scenarios.
