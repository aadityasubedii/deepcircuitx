Module name: gf32mul_dec. Module specification: The gf32mul_dec module is designed to perform multiplication operations in the Galois Field GF(32), using two 5-bit operands. It accepts 5-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', where 'a' represents polynomial coefficients and 'b' acts as a selector determining polynomial operations via XOR logic across case conditions. The output 'z', also a 5-bit word, delivers the result of these operations. The module lacks internal signals, as all operations occur directly within the always block using controlled case statements. The always block comprises a multiplexer-decoder style series of case statements for values of 'b' from 1 to 31 and a default case, each tailoring the XOR combinations to generate specific polynomial results in 'z'. Each value of 'b' correlates to a unique polynomial operation on 'a', calculated immediately and assigned to 'z', facilitating a compact and efficient modular design for polynomial calculations in finite fields.
