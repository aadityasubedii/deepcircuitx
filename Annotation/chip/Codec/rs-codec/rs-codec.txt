The rs-codec repository implements a comprehensive Reed-Solomon encoding and decoding system, designed to manage and correct data transmission errors in digital communications. This repository is structured into two main directories: encoding and decoding. The encoding section features modules for Galois Field (GF) multiplications across different field sizes (GF(2^3) to GF(2^8)), linear feedback shift register (LFSR) based encoders that handle various symbol widths, and foundational elements like macro definitions for system-wide bit width standardization. Each encoder module leverages related GF multiplication modules for efficient processing of input data into encoded output, synchronized with communication protocols via control signals. Decoding modules extend similar functionalities tailored to error detection and correction, utilizing modules like syndrome computation, error location, and value calculation, coupled with a sequence of state-driven controls and GF arithmetic for accurate data reconstruction. The decoding system also incorporates FIFO buffers for efficient data handling and specific modules for inverse GF calculations to support necessary mathematical operations in decoding error-laden data. With its modular design using Verilog, the repository achieves a robust framework for error correction in storage and transmission systems, optimizing data integrity through meticulous error correction coding tailored across various data rates and error levels.
