Module name: i2cc. Module specification: The 'i2cc' module is designed to control I2C communication, handling various communication states like initialization, data transmission, acknowledgment, and stopping, based on the control signals and internal state machine logic. It accepts input ports: clk (clock input), reset (module reset signal), wr_i2c (control signal triggering the start of I2C communication), and din (24-bit data input vector). The output ports include i2c_idle (indicates the moduleâ€™s idle state), i2c_sclk (serial clock line for I2C communication), and i2c_sdat (bidirectional serial data line). Internal signals such as estat and estat_s manage the current and next states of communication, respectively, while regdin stores data for transmission. Signals like sda and scl control the data and clock lines, and others like resetcq, idl, and ackn manage the reset of the quarter-phase counter, idle state indication, and acknowledgment handling, respectively. The module consists of blocks handling state transitions, output assignments, and data-path logic, structured within always and case blocks to handle various operations based on the state machine's current state. This design ensures smooth execution of I2C master functionalities, leveraging a structured approach to state management and signal control.
