    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"testi2c\" module tests I2C protocols by simulating data transmission and bus control through two I2C controllers (i2cc and i2ccbeta). It uses inputs like clk, reset, and start_i2c to manage test scenarios and data flow on I2C bus lines sclk and sdat, further controlled by the internal mechanism and sdat_reg. Simulation involves initializing conditions, toggling clocks, managing start-stop sequences, and observing bus idle states to ensure protocol integrity and controller responses."
