    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"controlador\" module manages digital audio data interfacing between I2C, ADC, and DAC via FIFO buffers. It handles audio and I2C communication, ensuring synchronized operations through various clock signals and fifo management. Key functionalities include data transfer handling in sub-modules `daccc` for audio processing and `i2cc` for I2C interactions, complemented by FIFO buffers for efficient data queuing and management."
