    "spec": "Module name: controlador. Module specification: The \"controlador\" module serves as a data controller within a system handling audio data interfacing between an I2C module, digital audio interfaces, and FIFO buffers. It ensures synchronization and management of digital audio data through various clock signals and buffer read/write operations. The input ports include `clk` (system clock), `reset` (system reset), `adcdat` (digital audio input), `wr_i2c` (write enable for I2C), `rd_adc_fifo` (control signal to read from ADC FIFO), `wr_dac_fifo` (control signal to write to DAC FIFO), `i2c_packet` (data for I2C communication), and `dac_fifo_in` (data input for DAC FIFO). The output ports consist of various clock signals like `i2c_sclk`, `m_clk`, `b_clk`, `dac_lr_clk`, `adc_lr_clk`, and signals such as `dacdat` (digital audio output), `i2c_idle`, `adc_fifo_empty`, `dac_fifo_full`, `adc_fifo_full`, and `adc_fifo_out` (data output from ADC FIFO). An inout port `i2c_sdat` handles bidirectional data for I2C communication. Internal signals like `dac_data_in`, `adc_data_out`, `dac_done_tick`, and `dac_fifo_empty` manage DAC data processing, ADC data transfer, DAC operation completion, and DAC FIFO status, respectively. The module includes sub-modules: `daccc` for ADC-DAC interfacing and processing, `i2cc` for I2C communication, and two instances of `fifo` for buffering ADC and DAC data, advancing data handling efficiency for audio processing tasks. This setup integrates digital audio processing with I2C device control, facilitating robust and synchronized data flow management.",
