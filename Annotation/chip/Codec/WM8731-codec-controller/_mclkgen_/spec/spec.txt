Module name: mclkgen. Module specification: The 'mclkgen' module in Verilog is designed to generate two types of clock signals: 'mclk' and 'bclk', driven by the input clock 'clk' and a reset signal 'reset'. The input ports include 'clk', the primary clock signal that drives the state transitions within the module, and 'reset', which resets the module's internal registers 'estat' and 'bcont' to their initial states. The output ports are 'mclk', derived from the most significant bit of the 'estat' register indicating a derived clock signal based on its transitions, and 'bclk', derived from the most significant bit of the 'bcont' register, managing a varying clock output. Internally, the module uses a 2-bit register 'estat' for managing 'mclk' state transitions, a temporary 2-bit register 'estat_s' to store the next state of 'estat', and a 3-bit register 'bcont' that counts under specific conditions when 'estat' is zero, impacting the 'bclk' generation. The code incorporates two primary always blocks; the first manages the non-reset logic for incrementing 'estat' stored in 'estat_s' and updating 'bcont’, while the second trigger on the positive edge of 'clk' or 'reset' mainly handles conditions for resetting or updating 'estat' from 'estat_s'. The final assignments directly feed the derived clocks 'mclk' and 'bclk' from 'estat' and 'bcont’, respectively.
