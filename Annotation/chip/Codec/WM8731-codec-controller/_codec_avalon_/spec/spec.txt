Module name: codec_avalon

Module specification: The 'codec_avalon' module serves as an intermediary interface controller designed to facilitate communication and data management between an Avalon system bus and audio codec hardware. It synchronizes audio processing through various data streams and control operations. The input ports include signals like 'clk' (main clock), 'reset' (module reset), 'slave_read/write' (read/write signals from the master), 'slave_address' (destination register address on the bus), 'slave_writedata' (data from the master to the codec), 'slave_chipselect' (module selection signal), 'slave_beginbursttransfer' (initiates a burst data transmission), 'slave_burstcount' (number of transactions in burst), and 'adcdat' (input audio from ADC). The output ports return signals such as 'slave_readdata' (data sent to the master), 'slave_waitrequest' (pause signal for the master), 'slave_irq' (interrupt request to master), along with several clock signals like 'i2c_sclk', 'm_clk', 'b_clk', 'dac_lr_clk', 'adc_lr_clk', 'dacdat' that regulate data and clock distributions amongst the audio, ADC, and DAC components. Internal signals like 'i2c_packet', 'adc_fifo_out', 'dac_fifo_in', 'i2c_idle', 'adc_fifo_full', 'dac_fifo_full', 'adc_fifo_empty', 'wr_i2c', 'rd_adc_fifo', 'wr_dac_fifo' manage data buffering, state conditions, and transmission controls within the interfacing processes. The Verilog code integrates two key blocks: 'codec_slave_interface' handling slave bus operations and response management, and 'controlador' directing real-time audio data and clock management for encoding/decoding processes. This meticulous design ensures efficient data transfer, processing, and synchronization between the FPGA-based system bus and the audio codec components.
