    "spec": "Module name: master_bus_fm. \nModule specification: The \"master_bus_fm\" is a Verilog module designed to function as a master controller on a bus system, managing interactions with various slave devices. It orchestrates both read and write operations, supporting single and burst data transactions, critical for tasks involving data transfer like I2C communication setups and audio data manipulation for DACs and ADCs. The module uses input ports such as **Clk** (system clock), **slave_readdata** (data from the slave), **slave_waitrequest** (indicates if slave device is ready), and **slave_irq** (interrupt request from the slave). Output ports include **slave_read** and **slave_write** (control reads and writes), **slave_address** (address bus for slave), **slave_writedata** (data going to the slave), **slave_chipselect** (selects active slave device), **slave_beginbursttransfer** (initiates burst transfer), and **slave_burstcount** (number of transfers in a burst). It utilizes internal signals such as **readData** (temporarily holds read data), **dataArray** (stores sequential burst read data), **i** (loop counter), **dataToWrite** (holds data to be written to slaves), **full** (tracks ADC FIFO status), and **additionalClockCycle** (manages clock cycles in burst reads). Within the code, tasks like `simpleWrite`, `simpleRead`, `seti2cpacket`, `setDACaudio`, `llegiradcfifoout`, `waitFifoADCNoFull`, and `burstRead` streamline specific operations such as writing and reading data, setting I2C packets, audio management and timing control during burst transfers. The thoughtful segregation of these tasks, coupled with the initialized signals and the logically segmented initial setup, makes the module robust for handling bus communication in varied application scenarios effectively.\n",

If high, it tells the master to wait.\n- **slave_irq**: This is the interrupt request input from the slave device to the master, which can be used for alerting the master about specific events or conditions that require attention.\n\nOutput ports:\n- slave_read\n- slave_write\n- slave_address\n- slave_writedata\n- slave_chipselect\n- slave_beginbursttransfer\n- slave_burstcount\n\nExplanation:\n- **slave_read**: This signal is driven by the master to initiate read operations from the slave device.\n- **slave_write**: This signal is driven by the master to initiate write operations to the slave device.\n- **slave_address**: This bus carries the address information to the slave, specifying where to read from or write to.\n- **slave_writedata**: This output carries data from the master to the slave during write operations.\n- **slave_chipselect**: This output signal from the master is used to activate the selected slave device, enabling communication.\n- **slave_beginbursttransfer**: This signal is used by the master to indicate the start of a burst transfer operation, allowing multiple data items to be transferred in a sequence without the need for addressing each one separately.\n- **slave_burstcount**: This determines the number of transfers in a burst operation, telling the slave how many data items the master intends to read or write during the burst."

It is used within the module to store the data incoming from slave_readdata during read operations before further processing or use within tasks.\n  \n- **dataArray**: This is an array of 8-bit values used to store multiple pieces of data, typically utilized in burst read operations where multiple data bytes are read sequentially from a slave and stored within this module.\n  \n- **i**: This is an integer variable generally used as a loop counter within the module, especially in tasks that involve repetitive or iterative operations such as burst read where a specific action needs to be performed several times.\n  \n- **dataToWrite**: A 32-bit register used temporary in various tasks to hold the data that needs to be written to a slave device. It often holds data manipulated within the module before sending it to the slave via slave_writedata.\n  \n- **full**: A register used in the task `waitFifoADCNoFull` to monitor the full status of an ADC FIFO. It is used to control task execution based on whether the ADC FIFO is full or not.\n  \n- **additionalClockCycle**: Used in burst read tasks to manage additional clock cycles needed during wait states when slave_waitrequest is high.

                    "text": "Module name: master_bus_fm. \nModule specification: The \"master_bus_fm\" is a Verilog module designed to function as a master controller on a bus system, managing interactions with various slave devices. It orchestrates both read and write operations, supporting single and burst data transactions, critical for tasks involving data transfer like I2C communication setups and audio data manipulation for DACs and ADCs. The module uses input ports such as **Clk** (system clock), **slave_readdata** (data from the slave), **slave_waitrequest** (indicates if slave device is ready), and **slave_irq** (interrupt request from the slave). Output ports include **slave_read** and **slave_write** (control reads and writes), **slave_address** (address bus for slave), **slave_writedata** (data going to the slave), **slave_chipselect** (selects active slave device), **slave_beginbursttransfer** (initiates burst transfer), and **slave_burstcount** (number of transfers in a burst). It utilizes internal signals such as **readData** (temporarily holds read data), **dataArray** (stores sequential burst read data), **i** (loop counter), **dataToWrite** (holds data to be written to slaves), **full** (tracks ADC FIFO status), and **additionalClockCycle** (manages clock cycles in burst reads). Within the code, tasks like `simpleWrite`, `simpleRead`, `seti2cpacket`, `setDACaudio`, `llegiradcfifoout`, `waitFifoADCNoFull`, and `burstRead` streamline specific operations such as writing and reading data, setting I2C packets, audio management and timing control during burst transfers. The thoughtful segregation of these tasks, coupled with the initialized signals and the logically segmented initial setup, makes the module robust for handling bus communication in varied application scenarios effectively.\n"
