It manages read and write operations to these slaves, including handling single and burst data transfers. The module includes tasks such as simple write and read operations, setting data for I2C communication, handling audio data for DACs and ADCs, and dynamic checks like waiting until an ADC FIFO is not full. It ensures proper synchronization and timing of the bus signals to avoid conflicts and errors during data transmissions."
