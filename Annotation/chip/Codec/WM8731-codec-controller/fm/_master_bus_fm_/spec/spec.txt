Module name: master_bus_fm. 
Module specification: The "master_bus_fm" is a Verilog module designed to function as a master controller on a bus system, managing interactions with various slave devices. It orchestrates both read and write operations, supporting single and burst data transactions, critical for tasks involving data transfer like I2C communication setups and audio data manipulation for DACs and ADCs. The module uses input ports such as **Clk** (system clock), **slave_readdata** (data from the slave), **slave_waitrequest** (indicates if slave device is ready), and **slave_irq** (interrupt request from the slave). Output ports include **slave_read** and **slave_write** (control reads and writes), **slave_address** (address bus for slave), **slave_writedata** (data going to the slave), **slave_chipselect** (selects active slave device), **slave_beginbursttransfer** (initiates burst transfer), and **slave_burstcount** (number of transfers in a burst). It utilizes internal signals such as **readData** (temporarily holds read data), **dataArray** (stores sequential burst read data), **i** (loop counter), **dataToWrite** (holds data to be written to slaves), **full** (tracks ADC FIFO status), and **additionalClockCycle** (manages clock cycles in burst reads). Within the code, tasks like `simpleWrite`, `simpleRead`, `seti2cpacket`, `setDACaudio`, `llegiradcfifoout`, `waitFifoADCNoFull`, and `burstRead` streamline specific operations such as writing and reading data, setting I2C packets, audio management and timing control during burst transfers. The thoughtful segregation of these tasks, coupled with the initialized signals and the logically segmented initial setup, makes the module robust for handling bus communication in varied application scenarios effectively.
