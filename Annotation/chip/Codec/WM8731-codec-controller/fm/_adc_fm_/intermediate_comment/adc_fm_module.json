    "module": "Module-level comment: The `adc_fm` module interfaces with an ADC by managing clock signals and synchronizing data transmission. It measures frequencies of `m_clk`, `b_clk`, and `adc_lr_clk` using specific tasks and calculates timeout responses. Data transmission is controlled via the `adcwrite` task where data bits are loaded into `adcdat_reg` and output through `adcdat` synchronized with the `b_clk` and `adc_lr_clk`. This setup ensures precise data handling and clock monitoring required for ADC operations."
