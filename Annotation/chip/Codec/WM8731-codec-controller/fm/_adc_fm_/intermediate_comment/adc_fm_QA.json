It measures the frequencies of three input clocks - m_clk, b_clk, and adc_lr_clk - using tasks meant for each clock. It also supports writing data to the ADC using the `adcwrite` task, which sends data synchronously with the adc_lr_clk and b_clk. The measured frequencies of the clocks are displayed, and error handling is incorporated with timeouts to ensure operations halt if expected clock signals are not received timely. The output signal 'adcdat' from this module is controlled using a register 'adcdat_reg', which changes according to the logic defined in the `adcwrite` task."

The data is synchronized with the `adc_lr_clk` and modified on each positive edge of `b_clk` as handled in the `adcwrite` task.

In the `adcwrite` task, this register is sequentially loaded with bits from a 32-bit input `data` array, with each bit being set at the positive edge of the `b_clk`. The bit assignment to `adcdat_reg` is controlled within a loop that cycles through each bit in the `data` array, aligning the transmission with the `adc_lr_clk`. The final output `adcdat` is assigned from this register, thus serving as a buffer that holds the data until it is fully ready to be output, ensuring a controlled and sequential data flow to the ADC."
