    "spec": "Module name: adc_fm. Module specification: The `adc_fm` module is designed to interface with an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter), primarily handling clock signal management and data transmission. It accepts three input ports: `m_clk`, the master clock which influences timing; `b_clk`, used for clock frequency measurement and data synchronization; and `adc_lr_clk`, which also aids in frequency measurement and triggers data bit transmission. The module outputs through `adcdat`, which is the digital data sent to the ADC synchronized with the clock signals. Internally, the module utilizes `adcdat_reg`, a register that stores the data being transmitted to ensure controlled data flow. The module comprises several tasks including `measuresclk` for measuring the frequencies of the input clocks, individual `mesura_*_clk` tasks that calculate the frequency of each clock and handle timeouts, and the `adcwrite` task which sequentially loads data bit by bit for transmission. These tasks ensure accurate frequency monitoring, proper error handling through timeouts, and synchronized data transmission catering to precise ADC interfacing requirements.",

It measures the frequencies of three input clocks - m_clk, b_clk, and adc_lr_clk - using tasks meant for each clock. It also supports writing data to the ADC using the `adcwrite` task, which sends data synchronously with the adc_lr_clk and b_clk. The measured frequencies of the clocks are displayed, and error handling is incorporated with timeouts to ensure operations halt if expected clock signals are not received timely. The output signal 'adcdat' from this module is controlled using a register 'adcdat_reg', which changes according to the logic defined in the `adcwrite` task."
