Module name: adc_fm. Module specification: The `adc_fm` module is designed to interface with an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter), primarily handling clock signal management and data transmission. It accepts three input ports: `m_clk`, the master clock which influences timing; `b_clk`, used for clock frequency measurement and data synchronization; and `adc_lr_clk`, which also aids in frequency measurement and triggers data bit transmission. The module outputs through `adcdat`, which is the digital data sent to the ADC synchronized with the clock signals. Internally, the module utilizes `adcdat_reg`, a register that stores the data being transmitted to ensure controlled data flow. The module comprises several tasks including `measuresclk` for measuring the frequencies of the input clocks, individual `mesura_*_clk` tasks that calculate the frequency of each clock and handle timeouts, and the `adcwrite` task which sequentially loads data bit by bit for transmission. These tasks ensure accurate frequency monitoring, proper error handling through timeouts, and synchronized data transmission catering to precise ADC interfacing requirements.
