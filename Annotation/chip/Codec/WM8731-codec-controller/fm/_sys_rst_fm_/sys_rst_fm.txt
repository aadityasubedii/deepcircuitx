Module-level comment: The 'sys_rst_fm' module controls a system's reset state using an output register 'Rst'. Initially set high (1), 'Rst' can be toggled between high (reset state) and low (normal state) through internal tasks 'rstOn' and 'rstOff'. This design allows for direct manipulation of the reset signal without external inputs, enabling flexible control within system operations.
