    "spec": "Module name: sys_rst_fm. Module specification: The 'sys_rst_fm' is a Verilog module designed to manage the reset state of a system through an output register named 'Rst'. This module does not have any input ports, emphasizing its self-contained functionality based purely on internal logic. It features one output port, 'Rst', which is a register used to indicate the system's reset state. 'Rst' being high (1) reflects the system is in a reset state, and low (0) indicates that the system is no longer in reset. Internally, 'Rst' serves as both the output and a crucial signal controlled by specific tasks within the module to manipulate the reset state. The module includes an initial block setting 'Rst' to high, demonstrating the default reset state upon module initialization. There are two primary defined tasks, 'rstOn' and 'rstOff'. 'rstOn' sets the 'Rst' to high, signaling a reset, whereas 'rstOff' sets it to low, indicating the end of the reset state. These tasks allow for external control over the reset functionality, adapting to various operational requirements within a larger system framework.",
