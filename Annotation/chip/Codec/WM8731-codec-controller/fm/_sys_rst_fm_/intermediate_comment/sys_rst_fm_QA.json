It includes an output register 'Rst' which can be set to either 1 or 0. The initial state of 'Rst' is set to 1 (high). There are two tasks available within the module: 'rstOn' sets the 'Rst' output to 1 (high), effectively signaling a reset state, and 'rstOff' sets the 'Rst' output to 0 (low), signaling the end of the reset state. This allows external controls to toggle the reset state of the system using these tasks."
