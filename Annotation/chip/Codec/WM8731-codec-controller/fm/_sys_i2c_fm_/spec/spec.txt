Module name: sys_i2c_fm. Module specification: The 'sys_i2c_fm' module serves as an interface for I2C communication protocol, particularly focusing on managing frequency modulation system data communication. It employs an inout port 'i2c_sdat' for bi-directional data transfer and an input port 'i2c_sclk' which receives clock signals for synchronizing data transmission. Internally, two signals 'akn' and 'akn_reg' are employed, where 'akn' is a wire signal reflecting whether to acknowledge data transfers by controlling 'i2c_sdat', and 'akn_reg' is a register holding the state for acknowledgment. The code includes initial setup, and tasks like 'waitstart', 'measuresclk', 'listen_acknowledge', and 'waitend' which manage start and end communication signals, sample frequency of the clock, and handle data acknowledgment during transmissions, providing robust handling of communication setup and data integrity checks.
