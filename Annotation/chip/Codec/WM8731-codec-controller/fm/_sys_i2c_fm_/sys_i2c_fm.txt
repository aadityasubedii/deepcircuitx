Module-level comment: The 'sys_i2c_fm' module interfaces with I2C for data communication within a frequency modulation system. It utilizes the inout 'i2c_sdat' for bi-directional data flow and input 'i2c_sclk' for clock-driven event handling. Internal signals 'akn' and 'akn_reg' manage data acknowledgment. Tasks such as 'waitstart', 'measuresclk', 'listen_acknowledge', and 'waitend' orchestrate timing, frequency measurement, data acknowledgment, and signal integrity, ensuring robust I2C communication.
