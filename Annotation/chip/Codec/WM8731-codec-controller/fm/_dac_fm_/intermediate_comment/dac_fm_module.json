    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'dac_fm' module is designed to test frequency measurements of m_clk, b_clk, and dac_lr_clk, and to validate DAC data communication in a digital audio context. It calculates clock frequencies using time differences and simulates data reception by serially receiving DAC data. The module uses tasks like 'mesura_m_clk' for measuring clock frequencies and 'dacread' for checking data integrity against expected values. Each task utilizes timing controls and condition checks to ensure accurate data measurement and reception."
