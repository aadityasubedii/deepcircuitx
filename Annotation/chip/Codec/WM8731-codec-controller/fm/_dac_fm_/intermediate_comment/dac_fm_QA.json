It contains tasks to measure the frequency of the master clock (m_clk), bit clock (b_clk), and DAC left-right clock (dac_lr_clk) using a time-difference method, reporting these frequencies in kilohertz. Moreover, it has a task for simulating the reception of DAC data triggered by the DAC left-right clock and checking it against expected values to confirm data integrity. This is used essentially for testing and verification purposes in a digital audio context."
