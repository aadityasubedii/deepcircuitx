Module name: dac_fm.  
Module specification: The "dac_fm" module in Verilog is designed primarily for testing the frequency measurement of various clocks and validating data communication with a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) in a simulation environment. This module has three input ports: 'm_clk' (master clock), 'b_clk' (bit clock), and 'dac_lr_clk' (DAC left-right clock), all essential for timing and control within the system; additionally, it has a 'dacdat' input for the actual data communication to the DAC. There are no output ports, as the module's purpose is to perform internal checks and display results. The internal signals include 'frequency_m', 'frequency_b', and 'frequency_lr' which store measured frequencies for the respective clocks calculated using time differences between positive clock edges captured by timing variables 't1' and 't2'. The module contains several tasks: 'measuresclk' which concurrently invokes frequency measurement tasks ('mesura_m_clk', 'mesura_b_clk', 'mesura_dac_lr_clk') and displays these frequencies; and 'dacread' which simulates the reception of DAC data, checking if the received data matches the expected values. Each clock frequency measurement task includes a timeout mechanism to handle scenarios where clock signals don't behave as expected. The dacread task sequentially captures bits of DAC data on negative edges of 'b_clk' triggered by positive edges of 'dac_lr_clk', storing the received serial data into a register 'received_dac' for comparison against expected data. This module is tailored for thorough verification and testing of clock signal integrity and data handling in a digital audio context.
