Module-level comment: The AudioDeviceInterface module manages I2C communication for audio devices using predefined addresses. It facilitates data transmission and device status monitoring via addresses for I2C data, DAC, and ADC operations. This modular approach isolates the addressing scheme for easier integration and maintenance in a broader audio processing system.
