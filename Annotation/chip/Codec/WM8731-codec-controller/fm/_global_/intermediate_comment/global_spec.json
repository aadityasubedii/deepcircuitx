    "spec": "Module name: AudioDeviceInterface\nModule specification: The AudioDeviceInterface module is designed to handle I2C communication for audio devices, featuring predefined addresses for crucial audio-related operations. It includes address constants like `ADDR_I2C_DATA_AUDIO` for I2C data transactions, `ADDR_STATUS_AUDIO` for monitoring the device's status, `ADDR_DAC_AUDIO` for Digital-to-Analog Conversion, and `ADDR_ADC_AUDIO` for Analog-to-Digital Conversion. Since the provided code constitutes only address definitions, the actual Verilog module likely contains input and output ports for data communication and status indication, respectively; however, these are not detailed in the snippet provided. The module lacks explicit internal signal definitions in the snippet, implying that signal information would be part of a more inclusive code that integrates these addresses. This module section primary serves as the addressing scheme within a larger system facilitating audio data processing and control operations, enhancing modular design and maintenance by segregating address mapping from functional logic and data handling.\n",
