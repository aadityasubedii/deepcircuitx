    "spec": "Module name: sys_clk50MHz_fm. \n\nModule specification: The sys_clk50MHz_fm is a Verilog module designed to generate a 50 MHz clock signal by toggling the Clk output every 100 ns, which results in a clock period of 200 ns. This module contains no input ports as it operates independently, generating the clock signal internally. The only output port is 'Clk', which outputs the generated 50 MHz clock signal, crucial for synchronization and timing in digital circuits requiring a consistent clock pulse. Internally, 'Clk' is also used as a register that holds the clock signal state and toggles between high and low states to create the clock pulse. The code consists of a few significant sections: an initial block to set the 'Clk' to a known state (low) at the start, another initial block containing a loop that continuously toggles 'Clk' every 100 ns to generate the clock pulse, and a Verilog task 'waitCycles', which pauses the execution for a specified number of clock cycles by waiting for the specified number of positive edge transitions of 'Clk', with a data skew of 1 time unit incorporated after each waiting period, where `DATA_SKEW` is defined as `#1`. This module is solely responsible for clock signal generation and handling specific timing delays, making it a fundamental component for timing-critical digital designs.",
