    "module": "Module-level comment: The sys_clk50MHz_fm module generates a 50 MHz clock signal by toggling the output 'Clk' every 100 ns to achieve a 200 ns period. It uses an initial block to set 'Clk' low at start, and another to continuously toggle 'Clk' for consistent clock pulses. It also provides a 'waitCycles' task for pausing execution based on clock cycles, adding a 1 unit delay after waits."
