It does this by toggling the output 'Clk' every 100 ns (10 ns per tick with a delay of 100 ticks results in a period of 200 ns, equivalent to a 50 MHz frequency). Additionally, there is a task named 'waitCycles' defined within the module that waits for a specified number of positive clock edges, effectively pausing execution for the given number of clock cycles, incorporating a data skew defined as 1 time unit."

This clock is crucial for timing and synchronization in digital circuits that require a consistent clock pulse to operate correctly. The module toggles Clk every 100 ns to achieve the desired frequency."

It is toggled from 0 to 1 and back to 0 every 100 ns, resulting in a clock period of 200 ns (5 MHz frequency). This signal serves as the output as well as the core timing signal within the module, used for synchronization and timing in circuits that rely on this clock module."
