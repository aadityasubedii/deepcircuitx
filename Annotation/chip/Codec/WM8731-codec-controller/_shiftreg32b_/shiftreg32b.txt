Module-level comment: The shiftreg32b module implements a 32-bit shift register, supporting asynchronous reset, data loading, and left shift operations. This functionality is driven by the 'clk' input in an always block where 'reset' clears, 'carrega' loads 32-bit 'in' data, and 'shift' initiates a left shift, populating LSB with '0'. The MSB of 'missatge' is continuously output as 'regout'.
