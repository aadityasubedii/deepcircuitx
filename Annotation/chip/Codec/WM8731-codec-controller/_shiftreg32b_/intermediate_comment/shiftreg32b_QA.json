The shift register operates based on clock signals with the following behaviors: if 'reset' is high, the 32-bit register 'missatge' is cleared to zero; if 'carrega' is high, 'missatge' loads the value from the 'in' input; if 'shift' is high, 'missatge' performs a left shift by one bit, inserting '0' at the least significant bit. The most significant bit of 'missatge' is outputted through 'regout'."
