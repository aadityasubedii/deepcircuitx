    "spec": "Module name: shiftreg32b.\nModule specification: The shiftreg32b is a Verilog module designed to implement a 32-bit shift register with specialized controls for shifting, loading, and resetting operations. The inputs to the module include 'clk' (clock signal), 'reset' (asynchronous reset), 'shift' (shift control), 'carrega' (load control), and 'in' (32-bit data input). The output, 'regout', provides the most significant bit (MSB) of the internal register 'missatge'. The internal 32-bit register 'missatge' serves as the primary storage and data handling element. It is either cleared, loaded with new data, or shifted left based on the control signals. The code consists of an always block triggered on the rising edge of 'clk', where reset has the highest priority that clears the register, followed by load and shift operations. The 'assign' statement outside the always block sets 'regout' to reflect the MSB of 'missatge', ensuring the output is updated continuously with the state of the register. This module effectively manages data manipulation in hardware designs requiring shift register functionality with optional loading and reset capabilities.",
