Module-level comment: The "codec_slave_interface" module interfaces with an audio codec system via I2C, handling data transactions and control. It processes read/write commands based on external inputs, manages I2C commands, status updates, and FIFO buffers for ADCs and DACs. Internally, it uses a state machine for burst operations and logical gates to validate operations and direct data flows, ensuring synchronized data communication and device control within the audio system.
