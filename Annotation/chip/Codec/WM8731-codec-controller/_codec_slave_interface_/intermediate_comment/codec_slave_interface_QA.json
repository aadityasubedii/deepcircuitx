This interface manages read and write commands based on the address and data provided. It interacts with external ADCs and DACs through FIFOs (First In, First Out queues), handles I2C commands, and updates status including FIFO and I2C states. Additionally, the module generates interrupt requests and handles burst transfer operations, ensuring proper synchronization and controlling the flow of data according to the state of the I2C device and FIFO buffers."
