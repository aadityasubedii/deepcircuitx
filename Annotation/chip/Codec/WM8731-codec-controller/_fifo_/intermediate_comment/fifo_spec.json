    "spec": "Module name: fifo. \n\nModule specification: The `fifo` module is designed to implement a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure with parametrizable bit-width (`B`) and depth, defined as `2**W`. It handles data storage and retrieval synchronized to a clock signal (`clk`). The FIFO accepts data (`w_data`) for writing when it is not full, and allows data to be read when it is not empty. Input ports include the clock (`clk`), reset (`reset`), read (`rd`), write (`wr`), and write data (`w_data`). The output ports are the `empty` and `full` status flags, indicating if the FIFO is empty or full, respectively, and `r_data` for the data output during read operations. Internally, `array_reg` stores the FIFO data, while `w_ptr_reg` and `r_ptr_reg` are pointers indicating where to write to or read from. These pointers are managed via next and successor values (`w_ptr_next`, `w_ptr_succ`, `r_ptr_next`, `r_ptr_succ`), updating on each operation according to FIFO rules. Additionally, `full_reg` and `empty_reg` are flags controlled by logic considering both, write and read conditions, and signals like `wr_en` enable write operation based on the `full` status. The module is organized into several always blocks which manage pointer and flag operations based on the clock and reset conditions, along with combinational logic to update the internal state and outputs based on the current inputs and FIFO status.",
