It handles read (`rd`) and write (`wr`) operations based on the state of the FIFO, indicating whether it is full or empty through the `full` and `empty` outputs, respectively. Write operations are allowed only when the FIFO is not full (controlled by `wr_en`), and data is written into an internal array `array_reg`. Reading from the FIFO takes place from this array at the read pointer's location. The internal pointers for reading (`r_ptr_reg`) and writing (`w_ptr_reg`) are updated based on the operation and state of the FIFO (e.g., not full for write, and not empty for read). These operations are synchronized to the rising edge of the `clk` (clock) signal, and the pointers and status flags (`full_reg`, `empty_reg`) are reset upon a reset signal."
