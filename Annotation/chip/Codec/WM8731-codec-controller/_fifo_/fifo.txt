Module-level comment: The `fifo` module implements a parameterizable FIFO queue supporting operations synchronized to a clock. It features input ports for clock, reset, read, write, and data to be written. Output ports indicate if the FIFO is empty or full and provide the data read. Internally, it uses registers for read and write pointers and flags to control data flow, updating these based on FIFO rules during each clock cycle. The operations are governed by combinational and sequential logic within always blocks, ensuring proper data management and pointer updates.
