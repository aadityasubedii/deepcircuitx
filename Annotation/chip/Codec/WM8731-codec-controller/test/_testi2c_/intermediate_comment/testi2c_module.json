    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'testi2c' module simulates I2C transactions to ensure proper interface functionality. It uses input signals like 'clk', 'reset', and 'datain', managing data flow through the 'i2cc' submodule. Outputs include 'sclk' and 'sdat', controlled and tested with varied sequences and state toggles implemented in the simulation block, effectively testing I2C interactions across various operational conditions."
