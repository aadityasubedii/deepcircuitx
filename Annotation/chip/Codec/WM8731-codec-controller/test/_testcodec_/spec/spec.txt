Module name: test_codec_top. 

Module specification: The `test_codec_top` module is a comprehensive testbench designed for the verification of codec system components, focusing on DAC, ADC, and I2C interfaces. It does not require any external input or output ports as it acts as a self-contained unit that generates and manages all the necessary signals internally for simulation purposes. Key internal signals within the module include `error`, an integer to count the number of mismatches during testing; `dades_adc`, an array of 32-bit registers storing ADC data; and `dades_a_enviar`, a 384-bit register aggregating the ADC data for transmission tests. The module initializes by setting up the environment using various tasks like `testdac`, `testadc`, `testi2c`, and manipulates the `error` signal based on the results of these tests to display the final outcome. Tasks such as `ADC_get_ready`, `checkReceivedADC`, `transmitDAC_and_check`, `transmitADC_and_check`, and `transmitI2C_and_check` are employed to execute specific tests on DAC, ADC, and I2C operations, ensuring proper functionality through randomized data simulation and systematic checks for correctness across all tasks. The overall operation is controlled and monitored via macro operations and tasks, ensuring each component is meticulously tested before concluding the simulation.
