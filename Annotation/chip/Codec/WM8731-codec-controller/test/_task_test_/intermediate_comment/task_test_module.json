    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"testi2ctasks\" module simulates I2C communications for testing purposes, principally verifying protocol adherence and behavior under error conditions. It utilizes input signals to control operations and a combination of internal and output signals to manage data flow and synchronization. Key elements include initiating I2C operations, monitoring transactions through `i2cc` and `sys_i2c_fm_i` components, and managing timing and data integrity within a testbench setup."
