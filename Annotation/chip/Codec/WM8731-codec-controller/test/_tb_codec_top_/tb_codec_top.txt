Module-level comment: The `tb_codec_top` module serves as a testbench for simulating a digital audio codec system, integrating ADC and DAC functionalities with I2C communication. It structurally includes a `codec_avalon` component interfaced with I2C, ADC, DAC, and master bus modules, all orchestrated under simulated system clock and reset conditions, facilitating thorough validation and testing of codec operations within a synthesized environment.
