Module name: tb_codec_top. Module specification: The `tb_codec_top` serves as a comprehensive testbench for verifying the functionality of a digital audio codec system, primarily driven by the `codec_avalon` component. It orchestrates various input and output simulations involving a synthetic clock (`clk`), a system reset (`reset`), I2C communication signals (`i2c_sclk` and `i2c_sdat`), and digital audio data signals (`adcdat` for ADC output, `dacdat` for DAC input). Internal signals such as `slave_read`, `slave_write`, and others facilitate the control and data flows between a codec and master bus interfaces, making it pivotal in simulating real-time data transaction scenarios in integrated multimedia systems. Furthermore, the module integrates several helper modules: `sys_clk50MHz_fm` for generating the system clock, `sys_rst_fm` for system reset, `sys_i2c_fm` for I2C interface management, `adc_fm` and `dac_fm` for simulating analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion processes respectively, and `master_bus_fm` that acts as an intermediary handling the bus communications with slave functionalities, emphasizing the moduleâ€™s role in validating complex, interconnected digital systems in a controlled environment. Each component and signal line within the module plays a critical role in reflecting a holistic test environment, aiming to closely mimic and test aspects of practical hardware implementation.
