Module-level comment: The `adcclkgen2` module generates an ADC clock (`adcclk`) by using a 5-bit register (`estat`) that increments on each positive `clk` edge when `tin` is high. The output `adcclk` is driven by the MSB of `estat`. The module resets `estat` to 0 if `reset` is high. This setup enables controlled ADC clock toggling in response to external triggers, ensuring synchronization with system requirements.
