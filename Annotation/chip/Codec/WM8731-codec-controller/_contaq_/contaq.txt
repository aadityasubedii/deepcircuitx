Module-level comment: The "comptadorquarts" module is a counter system responsive to an input clock and reset. It outputs two registers, `quart` and `nbit`, incrementing based on a 7-bit internal state (`estat`) cycling from 0 to 124. When `estat` reaches 124, `quart` increments, and upon rolling over, `nbit` increments unless reset. The module transitions state synchronously on clock edges using an intermediate state (`estat_s`) to ensure stability and correct timing of updates.
