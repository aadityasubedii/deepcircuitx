    "spec": "Module name: comptadorquarts. \n\nModule specification: The \"comptadorquarts\" module is a Verilog-based counter system that primarily functions using an input clock (`clk`) and a reset signal (`reset`). The module manipulates two output registers: `quart`, a 2-bit quarter counter, and `nbit`, a 5-bit higher order bit counter. The `quart` register divides a cycle into four parts and increments upon certain conditions met by the internal state `estat`, which is a 7-bit register incremented from 0 to 124. When `estat` reaches 124 and if `reset` is not active, `quart` is incremented, and when `quart` rolls over from 3 to 0, `nbit` is also incremented. Both `quart` and `nbit` are reset to 0 when the reset signal is active. An additional internal signal, `estat_s` (next state), helps buffer the transition of the state from the current to the next on clock edges, aligning changes with the synchronous system operation. The code is divided into two main blocks: The first block determines the next state (`estat_s`) and updates the output registers (`quart` and `nbit`) based on the current state (`estat`) and the `reset` condition. The second block handles the state transition using `estat_s` upon the positive edge of the clock or reset, managing the main synchronization of the state with external events.",

The primary function is to manage two output registers: `quart` and `nbit`. It uses an internal state `estat` to track the timing or counting state.\n\nThe module increments the `quart` every time `estat` cycles through 125 counts (from 0 to 124). Upon reaching count 124, if the reset is not active, `quart` is incremented, and if `quart` rolls over to 0, `nbit` is also incremented. This suggests that `quart` could be tracking quarters (or quarter-like divisions), and `nbit` could be a higher order count that increments each time `quart` completes a full cycle from 0 to 3 and back to 0.\n\nIf the reset is activated at any point, both `quart` and `nbit` are reset to 0, and the internal state `estat` is set to initiate at count 124, effectively preparing the system to restart counting from 0 on the next clock edge. The operation of state transitioning and output incrementing is synchronous with the positive edge of the clock and the reset signal, ensuring clear and predictable timing behavior."

It drives the sequential logic by controlling when the internal state (`estat`) is updated and when output registers and states transition based on the logic defined within the module.\n- `reset` (Reset Signal): This input port is used to reset the internal state and output registers to their initial values. When activated, it sets `quart` and `nbit` to 0 and initializes `estat` to its predefined starting state so that counting can resume from a known point on the next clock edge.\n\nOutput ports: `quart`, `nbit`.\nExplanation:\n- `quart` (Quarter Counter): This output register tracks sub-units or fractions of a complete cycle, incrementing cyclically in response to the internal state reaching a specific count (124 in this case). It can be interpreted as dividing a complete cycle into four parts (hence \"quarter\").\n- `nbit` (Higher Order Bit Counter): This output register represents a higher-order count that increments when `quart` completes a full cycle (from 0 to 3 and back to 0). It effectively counts the number of complete cycles that `quart` has performed. Each increment of `nbit` signifies that `quart` has cycled through a full sequence."

It increments sequentially from 0 to 124 and then resets to 0, controlling the periodic updating of the `quart` and `nbit` outputs based on specific conditions. Essentially, `estat` determines when to transition between state points and trigger counting actions for the outputs.\n\n- `estat_s` (Next State): This 7-bit register is utilized to hold the next state value of the `estat` register. It helps in managing the transition from the current state to the next state, allowing computation of the next state based on current inputs and logic conditions before triggering the state transition on a clock edge. When a reset occurs or the maximum count is reached (`estat` == 124), `estat_s` is conditionally updated to dictate the appropriate subsequent operation, whether it resets to 0 or increments by one. This buffering helps ensure that state transitions are synchronous and glitch-free."
