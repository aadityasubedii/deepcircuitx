Module name: comptadorquarts. 

Module specification: The "comptadorquarts" module is a Verilog-based counter system that primarily functions using an input clock (`clk`) and a reset signal (`reset`). The module manipulates two output registers: `quart`, a 2-bit quarter counter, and `nbit`, a 5-bit higher order bit counter. The `quart` register divides a cycle into four parts and increments upon certain conditions met by the internal state `estat`, which is a 7-bit register incremented from 0 to 124. When `estat` reaches 124 and if `reset` is not active, `quart` is incremented, and when `quart` rolls over from 3 to 0, `nbit` is also incremented. Both `quart` and `nbit` are reset to 0 when the reset signal is active. An additional internal signal, `estat_s` (next state), helps buffer the transition of the state from the current to the next on clock edges, aligning changes with the synchronous system operation. The code is divided into two main blocks: The first block determines the next state (`estat_s`) and updates the output registers (`quart` and `nbit`) based on the current state (`estat`) and the `reset` condition. The second block handles the state transition using `estat_s` upon the positive edge of the clock or reset, managing the main synchronization of the state with external events.
