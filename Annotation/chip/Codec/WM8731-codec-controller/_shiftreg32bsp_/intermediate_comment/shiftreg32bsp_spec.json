    "spec": "Module name: shiftreg32bsp. \nModule specification: The 'shiftreg32bsp' is a Verilog module that functions as a 32-bit shift register. It utilizes four input ports and one output port: 'clk' which is the clock input and controls the timing of register operation, 'reset' which resets the output 'missatge' to zero when asserted high, 'shift' which enables the shifting operation into the register, and 'in' which is the serial data bit input that gets shifted into the 'missatge' register. The output port 'missatge' is a 32-bit register that holds and outputs the serial data shifted into it in a parallel format. Internally, the module uses a single signal 'missatge', a 32-bit register, to store the data being shifted. The main logic is encapsulated in an always block triggered on the positive edge of 'clk'. Under conditions where 'reset' is high, 'missatge' is cleared to zero. If 'reset' is not asserted and 'shift' is high, the content of 'missatge' is shifted left by one bit with the incoming bit from 'in' fed into the least significant position. This setup allows for a robust serial-to-parallel conversion mechanism to sequentially load bits on each clock cycle when shifting is enabled.",

It takes a clock signal (`clk`), a reset signal (`reset`), a shift control signal (`shift`), and a single-bit input (`in`). The output is a 32-bit vector (`missatge`). The operation inside is triggered by the rising edge of the clock. If the reset signal is high (`reset == 1`), the 32-bit output is cleared to zero. If the reset is not asserted and the shift signal is high, the contents of the register `missatge` are shifted left by one bit, with the new bit entering from the right-most position being the value of `in`. This allows for serial data input to be shifted into the register bit by bit on each clock cycle when shifting is enabled."
