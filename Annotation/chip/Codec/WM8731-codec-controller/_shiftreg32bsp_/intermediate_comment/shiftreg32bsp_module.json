    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'shiftreg32bsp' module is a 32-bit shift register implemented in Verilog, designed to serialize data input bit by bit into a parallel output. It employs 'clk' for synchronization, 'reset' to clear the output register 'missatge', and 'shift' for enabling the left bit shift operation. On each clock's rising edge, based on the input conditions, the register 'missatge' is either reset or updated by shifting its content and appending the bit from the 'in' input at the LSB."
