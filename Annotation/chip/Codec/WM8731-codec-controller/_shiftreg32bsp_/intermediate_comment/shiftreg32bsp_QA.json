It takes a clock signal (`clk`), a reset signal (`reset`), a shift control signal (`shift`), and a single-bit input (`in`). The output is a 32-bit vector (`missatge`). The operation inside is triggered by the rising edge of the clock. If the reset signal is high (`reset == 1`), the 32-bit output is cleared to zero. If the reset is not asserted and the shift signal is high, the contents of the register `missatge` are shifted left by one bit, with the new bit entering from the right-most position being the value of `in`. This allows for serial data input to be shifted into the register bit by bit on each clock cycle when shifting is enabled."

Its primary role is to store the data being shifted in serially through the `in` input. On each positive edge of the clock signal `clk`, if the `reset` input is high (`reset == 1`), the register `missatge` is cleared to zero. Otherwise, if the `shift` input is high, the data in the register is shifted left by one bit position. The rightmost bit (least significant bit) of `missatge` is then replaced by the value of the `in` input. This mechanism allows for serial-to-parallel data conversion, enabling a bit-by-bit serialization of input data into a parallel output format via `missatge`."
