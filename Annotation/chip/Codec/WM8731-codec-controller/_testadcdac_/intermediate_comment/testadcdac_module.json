    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"testadcdac\" module simulates interactions between an ADC and DAC, testing their functionalities. It features input ports for clock, reset, ADC data, and DAC data, with output ports managing their operations. Internal signals connect to the 'daccc' submodule for timing and data handling. Clock events and initial setups in 'always' and 'initial' blocks emulate realistic ADC and DAC behavior, ensuring an exhaustive test environment."
