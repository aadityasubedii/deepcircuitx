    "spec": "Module name: AudioControlModule. Module specification: The AudioControlModule is presumed to manage the interface and control of audio components, such as a DAC and an ADC, via an I2C interface. The module likely includes functionality for sending and receiving data through I2C (indicated by `ADDR_I2C_DATA_AUDIO`), checking the status of audio operations or configurations (`ADDR_STATUS_AUDIO`), controlling a DAC for audio output (`ADDR_DAC_AUDIO`), and managing an ADC for audio input (`ADDR_ADC_AUDIO`). However, the provided code snippet does not contain details of input and output ports, as it focuses solely on address definitions for these functionalities. Therefore, it does not specify any internal signals, module ports, or structural blocks which typically would be used for data handling and control logic within a complete module. The absence of a broader context or additional code makes it impossible to delineate a full module's architecture or operational details based solely on these address definitions. This specification assumes the module serves as a crucial point for audio data control and interfacing in an electronic system needing precise audio component management.",
