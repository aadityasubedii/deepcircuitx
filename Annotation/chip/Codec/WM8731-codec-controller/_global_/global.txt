Module-level comment: The AudioControlModule is designed to handle interface and control for audio components using I2C communication. Although actual ports and signals are not specified in the snippet, the identifications (`ADDR_I2C_DATA_AUDIO`, `ADDR_STATUS_AUDIO`, `ADDR_DAC_AUDIO`, `ADDR_ADC_AUDIO`) imply mapped addresses for I2C data transmission, status monitoring, DAC operation, and ADC management, essential for audio processing control in electronic systems.
