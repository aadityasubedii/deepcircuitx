Module name: adc_dac. Module specification: The 'adc_dac' module interfaces with both an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) and a DAC (Digital to Analog Converter), handling the generation of various clock signals and managing data conversion processes in a digital communication or processing system. It accepts input signals through ports 'clk' (the primary clock), 'reset' (synchronous reset), 'dac_data_in' (32-bit DAC input data), and 'adcdat' (serial ADC data input). The output ports include 'adc_data_out' (32-bit ADC output data), various clock outputs ('m_clk', 'b_clk', 'dac_lr_clk', 'adc_lr_clk'), 'dacdat' (serial DAC output), and 'load_done_tick' (indicates completion of data loading or capturing sequence). Internal signals such as 'm_reg', 'b_reg', 'lr_reg', 'dac_buf_reg', and 'adc_buf_reg' are used for counting, buffering, and data handling based on clock dividers and synchronization mechanisms. The module employs several blocks to handle clock division (for 'm_clk', 'b_clk', 'dac_lr_clk', 'adc_lr_clk'), data buffering and shifting for DAC and ADC, and edge detection for synchronization signals. These operations ensure precise and timed control of data conversion and transfer between digital and analog domains, crucial for maintaining efficient communication or processing within systems dealing with mixed-signal components.
