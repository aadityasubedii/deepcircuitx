It takes three inputs: a clock signal ('clk'), a reset signal ('reset'), and an input signal ('in'). It outputs a signal ('flanc') which goes high when there is a transition from high to low in the 'in' signal synchronized to the rising edge of the clock signal. If 'reset' is asserted, the internal state 'anterior' is set to zero. Otherwise, 'anterior' stores the value of 'in' at each rising edge of 'clk'. The falling edge detection is realized by checking if 'anterior' was high while 'in' is currently low, indicating a falling edge from the previous clock cycle to the current cycle."
