    "spec": "Module name: dflancb. \nModule specification: The 'dflancb' module is designed to detect the falling edge of a digital input signal 'in'. It operates synchronously with a clock signal 'clk' and includes a reset functionality through the signal 'reset'. The module has three input ports: 'clk', 'reset', and 'in'. 'clk' is used to synchronize the detection operations, 'reset' reinitializes internal states, setting them to a defined starting condition, and 'in' is the monitored signal for edge detection. The output port 'flanc' goes high when a falling edge from high to low is detected between two consecutive clock cycles on 'in'. Internally, a registered signal 'anterior' stores the previous state of 'in' and is updated at each rising edge of 'clk', unless 'reset' is asserted, which sets 'anterior' to 0. The detection logic is implemented through an assignment operation, where 'flanc' evaluates to high when 'anterior' was high and 'in' is low. This module effectively contributes to systems requiring precise falling-edge timing responses from an input signal.",

It takes three inputs: a clock signal ('clk'), a reset signal ('reset'), and an input signal ('in'). It outputs a signal ('flanc') which goes high when there is a transition from high to low in the 'in' signal synchronized to the rising edge of the clock signal. If 'reset' is asserted, the internal state 'anterior' is set to zero. Otherwise, 'anterior' stores the value of 'in' at each rising edge of 'clk'.
