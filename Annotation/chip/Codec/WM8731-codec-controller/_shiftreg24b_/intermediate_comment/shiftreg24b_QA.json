It operates on a positive edge of a clock signal (`clk`). The module takes inputs for reset (`reset`), shift (`shift`), load (`carrega`), and a 24-bit data input (`in`). If `reset` is high, the register (`missatge`) is cleared to zero. If `carrega` is high, the register loads the value from `in`. If `shift` is active, the content of the register is shifted left by one bit position, introducing a `0` at the lowest bit. The most significant bit of the register (`missatge[24]`) is continuously outputted to `regout`."
