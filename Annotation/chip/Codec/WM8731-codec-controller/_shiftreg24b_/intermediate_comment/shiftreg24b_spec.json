    "spec": "Module name: shiftreg24b. \n\nModule specification: The shiftreg24b is a Verilog module designed as a 24-bit shift register with the ability to load data and shift bits. The module operates on the positive edge of a clock signal (`clk`). It features several input ports: `clk` which is the clock input triggering operations; `reset` which when high, clears the internal register `missatge` to zero; `shift` that, when asserted, shifts the register bits left by one position; `carrega` which enables data loading from the `in` port when asserted; and `in`, a 24-bit data input that supplies data to the register. The single output port, `regout`, exports the most significant bit (24th bit) of the internal register `missatge`. Internally, the module predominantly uses the register `missatge` to carry out the shift and load operations. The control logic encoded within the `always` block is activated on the rising edge of `clk`, and it evaluates the control signals (`reset`, `carrega`, `shift`) to manipulate `missatge` accordingly: resetting it, loading data from `in`, or shifting its contents leftward, introducing a zero at the least significant position. The value of `missatge[24]` is consistently routed to `regout` to provide external visibility of the most significant bit. This module facilitates controlled data manipulation through specified input actions while preserving critical data visibility through its output.",
