    "module": "Module-level comment: The shiftreg24b module is a 24-bit shift register catered to data manipulation, predominantly loading and shifting operations controlled by the `carrega` and `shift` inputs respectively. Operating on a rising `clk` edge, it evaluates `reset`, `carrega`, and `shift` to update the internal register `missatge`, clearing, loading, or bit-shifting it. The most significant bit of `missatge` is output through `regout`, providing visibility of the shifted or loaded data."
