    "spec": "Module name: dflancp. Module specification: The \"dflancp\" module in Verilog is designed to detect a rising edge (positive flank) on the input signal `in`. It utilizes three input ports: `clk` (the clock signal that synchronizes the module\u2019s operations), `reset` (resets internal states, ensuring a clean start), and `in` (the signal monitored for rising edge detection). The module outputs through the `flanc` port, which goes high to indicate the detection of a rising edge from low-to-high transition in the `in` signal. Internally, the module employs a reg-type signal named `anterior` which acts as a storage for the previous state of `in`. The primary logic is contained within an `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of `clk` or `reset`. If `reset` is high, `anterior` is set to 0; otherwise, it captures and retains the current state of `in`. The detection logic is implemented using an `assign` statement, where `flanc` is set high only if `anterior` was low (`0`) and `in` is high (`1`), effectively capturing the rising edge. This configuration enables `dflancp` to generate control pulses in response to detected rising edges, ideal for timing and control applications in digital systems.",

It uses a D flip-flop to store the previous state of `in` as `anterior` at every positive edge of the clock `clk` or when the `reset` signal is asserted. If `reset` is high, `anterior` is set to 0. If `reset` is low, `anterior` captures the value of `in`. The output `flanc` is set to high only when there is a transition from 0 to 1 in the input `in` (i.e., the previous state was 0 and the current state is 1). This function is used to generate a control pulse when a rising edge is detected on the input signal."

It synchronizes the state update of the internal register `anterior`. \n- `reset` is used to reset the state of the module by clearing the `anterior` register to 0. This ensures the module can start with a known state whenever reset is triggered.\n- `in` is the input signal whose rising edge this module is designed to detect. Changes in this signal are monitored in synchronization with the `clk`.\n\nOutput ports: `flanc`.\nExplanation: \n- `flanc` is the output signal that indicates the detection of a rising edge on the `in` signal. It generates a high level (1) when a rising edge (transition from 0 to 1) is detected, otherwise it remains low (0). This output can be used to trigger subsequent actions in other parts of the digital system following the detection of the rising edge."

Its primary role in the module is to retain the last observed state of `in` so that it can be compared with the current state. This comparison enables the module `dflancp` to determine whether a rising edge has occurred on the input signal `in`. If the current state of `in` is high (`1`) and `anterior` holds a low (`0`), then a rising edge is detected, setting the `flanc` output high.
