Module name: dflancp. Module specification: The "dflancp" module in Verilog is designed to detect a rising edge (positive flank) on the input signal `in`. It utilizes three input ports: `clk` (the clock signal that synchronizes the moduleâ€™s operations), `reset` (resets internal states, ensuring a clean start), and `in` (the signal monitored for rising edge detection). The module outputs through the `flanc` port, which goes high to indicate the detection of a rising edge from low-to-high transition in the `in` signal. Internally, the module employs a reg-type signal named `anterior` which acts as a storage for the previous state of `in`. The primary logic is contained within an `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of `clk` or `reset`. If `reset` is high, `anterior` is set to 0; otherwise, it captures and retains the current state of `in`. The detection logic is implemented using an `assign` statement, where `flanc` is set high only if `anterior` was low (`0`) and `in` is high (`1`), effectively capturing the rising edge. This configuration enables `dflancp` to generate control pulses in response to detected rising edges, ideal for timing and control applications in digital systems.
