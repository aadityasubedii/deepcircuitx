Module name: user_project_wrapper. Module specification: The "user_project_wrapper" is a Verilog module designed as a top-level wrapper which primarily serves to facilitate the interface with the "user_proj_example" submodule. It integrates various types of input and output ports meant for different functionality including power supply inputs like `vccd1`, `vccd2` for digital circuitry and `vdda1`, `vdda2` for analog circuitry, alongside ground references `vssa1`, `vssa2` for analog and `vssd1`, `vssd2` for digital circuitry. The module handles signals for the Wishbone bus interface (`wb_clk_i`, `wb_rst_i`, etc.), digital I/O (`io_in`, `io_out`, `io_oeb`), logic analyzer data interface (`la_data_in`, `la_data_out`, `la_oenb`), and external interrupts (`user_irq`). Moreover, the robust interfacing with the submodule suggests a structured mapping of external signals to corresponding submodule ports without additional internal signal processing â€“ e.g., external signals `wb_clk_i` directly mapping to submodule's `wb_clk_i`. The script organizes and potentially reorders these signals to ensure seamless integration with the embedded `user_proj_example`, allowing signals to either direct external inputs into the submodule or route the submodule's processed signals back out to the system. This structure underscores the module's role as a crucial intermediary that simplifies modular testing and integration of the `user_proj_example` into larger systems, making it central to applications interfacing real-world digital components.
