    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"user_project_wrapper\" is a Verilog module serving as a top-level integration interface for the \"user_proj_example\" submodule. It handles a variety of signals for power, digital I/O, Wishbone bus communication, and logic analysis, directly mapping these between external ports and the submodule. This design allows seamless integration of the submodule into larger systems, with no internal signal processing, ensuring straightforward signal management and modular testing capabilities."
