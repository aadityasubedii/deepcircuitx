    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'io_ports_tb' testbench module simulates the functionality of integrated circuit IO operations, focusing on power and caravel harness scenarios. It includes input ports for synchronization (clock), system reset (RSTB), chip control (CSB), and multiple power scenarios (power1 to power4). The output ports (gpio, mprj_io, mprj_io_0) handle general and project-specific IO tests. Internal signals manage SPI flash memory and power supplies. The test sequence checks robustness against predefined conditions ensuring accurate behavior before full-scale hardware implementation."
