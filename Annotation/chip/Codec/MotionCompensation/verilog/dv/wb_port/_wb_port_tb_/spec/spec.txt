Module name: wb_port_tb. 

Module specification: The `wb_port_tb` module forms a comprehensive testbench designed for simulation and verification of a Wishbone protocol interface within a Mega-Project implementing the Caravel harness, interfaced with an SPI flash memory. It tests various conditions including power-up sequences and reset behaviors using multiple input ports namely `clock`, `RSTB` (reset bar, active low), `CSB` (chip select bar, active low), and power supplies `power1`, `power2`, `power3`, `power4`. The module propagates these input conditions through internal signals such as `VDD3V3` and `VDD1V8` for various power domains, and `checkbits` derived from the `mprj_io` signal which monitors particular test state transitions. Important output ports include `gpio`, which interfaces general IO functionality, and `flash_csb`, `flash_clk`, `flash_io0`, `flash_io1` for controlling and interfacing with the SPI flash memory. Internal test states and progressions are extensively logged using `$display` and are instrumental in determining pass or fail outcomes based on specific conditions in `checkbits`. The module heavily utilizes the `sdf_annotate` function for overlaying timing information, essential for accurate gate-level simulation across multiple components of the Caravel system, organized under various blocks such as the `caravel` for primary system configuration and testing, and `spiflash` for handling the external memory simulation. The synthesis of these components aims to thoroughly validate the system's responsiveness under simulated real-world conditions, emphasizing robust testing and verification mechanisms within a structured Verilog environment.
