    "module": "Module-level comment: The `wb_port_tb` module is a testbench for verifying Wishbone protocol interface operations within a Mega-Project environment, interfacing with Caravel and SPI flash. It simulates various input conditions (clock cycles, resets, chip select, and power levels) using `checkbits` for state monitoring, `sdf_annotate` for timing overlays, and key output ports (`gpio`, `flash_csb`, `flash_clk`, `flash_io0`, `flash_io1`) for interfacing and validation, ensuring rigorous testing across different scenarios."
