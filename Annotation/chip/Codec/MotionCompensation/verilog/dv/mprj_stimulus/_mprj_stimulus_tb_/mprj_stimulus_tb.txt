Module-level comment: The "mprj_stimulus_tb" module serves as a testbench for simulating and verifying IC designs within the Caravel harness framework. It manages test scenarios using input clocks, resets, chip select, and power signals; monitors outputs like GPIOs, multi-project IOs, and manages SPI flash interactions. Internally, it sets up various simulation conditions, utilizes power rails, and leverages conditional compilation for different test cases, organizing complex test sequences and validations efficiently.
