Module-level comment: This code configuration sets global constants and conditions for Verilog projects. It includes preprocessor directives for defining IO, power, and analog pad counts, as well as memory configurations and initial states, used across multiple modules. By setting constants like `MPRJ_IO_PADS` and `MEM_WORDS`, it standardizes parameters, ensuring uniform behavior and simplifying modifications across the project.
