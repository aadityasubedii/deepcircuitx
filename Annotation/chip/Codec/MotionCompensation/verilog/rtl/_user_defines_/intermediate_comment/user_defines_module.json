    "module": "Module-level comment: This Verilog file does not represent a traditional hardware module but is a configuration header for GPIO settings. It defines multiple constants using preprocessor directives for various GPIO modes, including input, output, bidirectional, and analog types, with specifics for pull settings. These constants are used to configure GPIO behavior in larger hardware designs, ensuring consistent and manageable GPIO setups. The directives are guarded with `ifndef` and `endif` to prevent redefinition issues, organizing the GPIO settings for easy reference and application across different modules."
