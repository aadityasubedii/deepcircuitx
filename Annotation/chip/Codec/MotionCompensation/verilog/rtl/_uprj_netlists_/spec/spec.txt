Module name: Not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet.
Module specification: The provided code does not define a Verilog module; rather, it functions as a configuration script using preprocessor directives for conditional compilation of Verilog files. Its primary role is to manage the inclusion of specific files based on the `GL` (possibly standing for "gate-level") compilation flag. The script ensures that appropriate files are included for either simulation or synthesis stages by selecting between normal and gate-level versions of `user_project_wrapper.v` and `user_proj_example.v`. No input or output ports are defined, as the snippet does not encompass a Verilog module. Similarly, no internal signals are discussed since it lacks a functional or structural module definition. The code is divided into two major blocks, gated by the `ifdef GL` directive: one for including gate-level versions of the files and another for including their regular versions. This setup facilitates flexible project management across different stages of digital design flow, highlighting modularization and conditional compilation as key features.
