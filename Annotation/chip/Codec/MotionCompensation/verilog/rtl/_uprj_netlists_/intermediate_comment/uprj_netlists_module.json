    "module": "Module-level comment: This Verilog snippet is not a module but a configuration script that manages file inclusions based on the `GL` compilation flag. It uses `ifdef` directives to conditionally include either gate-level or regular versions of `user_project_wrapper.v` and `user_proj_example.v`. Its purpose is to facilitate different compilation setups for simulation versus synthesis stages, enhancing modular project management and conditional compilation for varied digital design flows."
