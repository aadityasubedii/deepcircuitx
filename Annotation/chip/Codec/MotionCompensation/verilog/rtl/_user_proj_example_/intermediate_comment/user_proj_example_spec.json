    "spec": "Module name: user_proj_example. \n\nModule specification: The \"user_proj_example\" is a Verilog module designed to interface with a Wishbone bus for data processing and control, handling I/O operations tailored to embedded system applications. It utilizes inputs such as the Wishbone clock (`wb_clk_i`), reset (`wb_rst_i`), strobe (`wbs_stb_i`), cycle (`wbs_cyc_i`), write enable (`wbs_we_i`), select signals (`wbs_sel_i`), data input (`wbs_dat_i`), and address input (`wbs_adr_i`). Output ports include the Wishbone acknowledge (`wbs_ack_o`) and data output (`wbs_dat_o`). It also interfaces with a logic analyzer through `la_data_in` and `la_data_out`, controls general purpose I/O through `io_in`, `io_out`, and `io_oeb`, and supports interrupt requests (`irq`). The internal signals such as `clk`, `rst`, `valid`, `wstrb`, `wdata`, `rdata`, and `count` are instrumental in managing the data transfer cycles, write operations, and maintaining the internal logic state and data flow. The module features a \"counter\" submodule which processes inputs and generates output data based on internal logic or configuration. The counter uses the internal `clk` and `rst` for operation, selectively writes data based on `wstrb` and responds with ready signals and read data (`rdata`). Overall, the \"user_proj_example\" ensures systematic data handling, signal processing, and communication within embedded systems, while enabling debugging and detailed control over I/O operations, making it a crucial component for managing complex data interactions efficiently.",

It utilizes inputs such as the Wishbone clock (`wb_clk_i`), reset (`wb_rst_i`), strobe (`wbs_stb_i`), cycle (`wbs_cyc_i`), write enable (`wbs_we_i`), select signals (`wbs_sel_i`), data input (`wbs_dat_i`), and address input (`wbs_adr_i`). Output ports include the Wishbone acknowledge (`wbs_ack_o`) and data output (`wbs_dat_o`). It also interfaces with a logic analyzer through `la_data_in` and `la_data_out`, controls general purpose I/O through `io_in`, `io_out`, and `io_oeb`, and supports interrupt requests (`irq`). The internal signals such as `clk`, `rst`, `valid`, `wstrb`, `wdata`, `rdata`, and `count` are instrumental in managing the data transfer cycles, write operations, and maintaining the internal logic state and data flow. The module features a \"counter\" submodule which processes inputs and generates output data based on internal logic or configuration. The counter uses the internal `clk` and `rst` for operation, selectively writes data based on `wstrb` and responds with ready signals and read data (`rdata`). Overall, the \"user_proj_example\" ensures systematic data handling, signal processing, and communication within embedded systems, while enabling debugging and detailed control over I/O operations, making it a crucial component for managing complex data interactions efficiently."
