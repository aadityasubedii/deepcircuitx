Module name: user_project_wrapper
Module specification: The `user_project_wrapper` module serves as a critical interface layer within digital designs, primarily wrapping around the `user_proj_example` submodule and facilitating communication with a Wishbone bus and other peripheral interfaces. Within this Verilog module, varied inputs such as `wb_clk_i` (Wishbone clock), `wb_rst_i` (reset), `wbs_*` (Wishbone signals for data, address, strobe, cycle, write enable, and select), `la_data_in` (logic analyzer input), `io_in` (general I/O), and `analog_io` (for analog digital mixed-signal interfaces) are channels into the module. Additionally, outputs such as `wbs_ack_o` and `wbs_dat_o` (Wishbone acknowledgment and data output), `la_data_out` (logic analyzer output), and `io_out` ensure external components can receive data and status from the module. Notably, the module also handles power connections like `vdda1`, `vccd1`, etc., when the `USE_POWER_PINS` compilation condition is met. Internally, this module directly maps its inputs to the `user_proj_example` submodule without additional signal processing, thereby acting as a straightforward pass-through entity that also involves pin multiplexing for general and analog I/Os, determined by the external setting `MPRJ_IO_PADS`. The design segments include conditional compilations for power pin handling, detailed mapping of Wishbone and logic analyzer interfaces, multiplexing for general I/O and analog signals, and user interrupts setup ensuring comprehensive interfacing capabilities with system-level hardware components.
