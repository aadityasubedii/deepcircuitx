    "module": "Module-level comment: The `user_project_wrapper` functions as an interface wrapper for `user_proj_example`, facilitating signal routing between external Wishbone and logic analyzer interfaces, general and analog I/Os. It directly passes signals to the submodule, handling power pins conditionally, and manages I/O multiplexing based on `MPRJ_IO_PADS`. This module integrates seamlessly with system hardware, synchronizing data and control flows efficiently."
