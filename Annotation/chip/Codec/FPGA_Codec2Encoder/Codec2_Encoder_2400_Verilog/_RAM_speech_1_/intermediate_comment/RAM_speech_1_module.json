    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"RAM_speech_1\" module serves as a single-port RAM ideal for speech/data storage on Cyclone IV E FPGA. It utilizes an Altera 'altsyncram' configured via a .mif file. Incorporates inputs for address, data, clock, and read/write controls, with an output 'q' for data retrieved. The internal 'sub_wire0' ensures data flow from RAM to output. The setup is tailored for efficient data handling with synchronous operations."
