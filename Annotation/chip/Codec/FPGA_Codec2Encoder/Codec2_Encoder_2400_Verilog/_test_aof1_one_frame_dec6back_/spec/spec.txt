Module name: test_aof1_one_frame_dec6back. Module specification: This module processes a single audio frame through multiple stages of analysis and encoding. It takes inputs start_oneframe, clk, and rst, and outputs processed data including encoded_bits, out_mem_x, out_mem_y, out_prevf0, out_xq0, out_xq1, done_oneframe, and various control signals. Internally, it uses a state machine to control the flow of operations, including reading speech data, performing analysis through the analyse_one_frame submodule, and managing memory operations. The module incorporates several memory components (RAM_speech_0, RAM_c2_sn_test_nlp, RAM_nlp_mem_fir_80, RAM_nlp_sq_80) for storing and retrieving data during processing. Key internal signals include STATE an
