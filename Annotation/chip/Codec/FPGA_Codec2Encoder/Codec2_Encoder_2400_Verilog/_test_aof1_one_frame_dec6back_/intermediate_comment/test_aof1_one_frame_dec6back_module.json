    "module": "Module-level comment: This module processes a single audio frame through multiple stages of analysis and encoding. It uses a state machine to control the flow, reading speech data, performing analysis via the analyse_one_frame submodule, and managing memory operations. The module incorporates several RAM components for data storage and retrieval, and outputs encoded bits and various processed signals. It achieves its functionality by sequentially executing states that handle data reading, processing, and writing, while interfacing with specialized submodules for complex operations like frame analysis."
