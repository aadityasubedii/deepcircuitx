Module-level comment: The 'quantise_test' module quantizes Linear Spectral Pairs (LSP) frequencies for speech coding, converting them into index values. It incorporates a finite-state machine to manage states from initialization through quantization completion. Key operations include converting LSP from radians to Hz, initiating and completing external quantization, and indexing. The module interfaces with a quantization block, a multiplier, and memory for seamless frequency data processing.
