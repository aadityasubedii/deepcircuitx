It uses an input address signal 'addr' to select one of the binary values from a pre-initialized array 'cb8', and outputs the selected value through 'dataout'. The array 'cb8' consists of 8 binary values each of 32 bits width, which are hardcoded within the module. This effectively allows the module to output specific 32-bit patterns corresponding to the 4-bit input address."
