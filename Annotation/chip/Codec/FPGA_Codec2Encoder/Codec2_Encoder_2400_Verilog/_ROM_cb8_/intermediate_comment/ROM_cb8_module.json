    "module": "Module-level comment: The ROM_cb8 module is a 32-bit wide, 8-entry Read-Only Memory (ROM) implemented in Verilog. It uses a 4-bit input 'addr' to index into a pre-initialized array 'cb8', selecting one of the 32-bit pre-stored binary values to output through 'dataout'. This design allows for fast and efficient retrieval of specific data patterns corresponding to the input address, ideal for applications needing fixed, predictable outputs based on varying inputs."
