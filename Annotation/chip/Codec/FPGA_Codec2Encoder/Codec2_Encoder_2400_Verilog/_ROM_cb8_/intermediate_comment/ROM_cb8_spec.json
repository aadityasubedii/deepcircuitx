    "spec": "Module name: ROM_cb8. Module specification: The ROM_cb8 is a Verilog module designed as a Read-Only Memory (ROM) that stores and outputs predefined 32-bit binary values based on a 4-bit input address. It utilizes a single input port, 'addr', which is a 4-bit signal serving as an index to select one of the 8 stored binary values. The output of the module is handled by 'dataout', a 32-bit reg output that delivers the selected binary pattern corresponding to the address specified by 'addr'. Internally, the module uses an array 'cb8' composed of eight 32-bit registers initialized with hardcoded binary values representing the ROM contents. These values are assigned within an always block that triggers on any change of the input signals, ensuring that the output 'dataout' is updated instantaneously with the correct data from the ROM according to the provided 'addr'. This setup allows the ROM_cb8 to efficiently output specific binary configurations based on incoming address signals, making it suitable for applications requiring fixed data retrieval based on an address input.",
