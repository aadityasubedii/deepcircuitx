Module-level comment: The "RAM_speech_120" module implements a single-port RAM using the Altera 'altsyncram' for Cyclone IV GX FPGAs. It supports 8-bit address-based data access with 32-bit data entries, leveraging input signals for read (`rden`) and write (`wren`) enable. Configuration details within 'altsyncram_component' set operational parameters like memory initialization using "RAM_speech_120.mif", bypassing standard clock configurations to enhance data integrity and performance.
