    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'neg_check' module compares the MSBs of two 32-bit inputs, 'psumr' and 'psum1', to indicate sign inequality via the output 'gt1'. It sets 'gt1' to 1 if the signs differ (one positive, one negative), and to 0 if they are the same. This logic is implemented directly within an always block that evaluates the MSBs of both inputs."
