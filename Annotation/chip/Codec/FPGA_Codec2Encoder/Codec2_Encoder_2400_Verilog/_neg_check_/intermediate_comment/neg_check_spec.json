    "spec": "Module name: neg_check. Module specification: The 'neg_check' module is designed primarily to assess the sign inequality between two 32-bit input signals, named 'psumr' and 'psum1'. These inputs represent numbers in two\u2019s complement format, wherein the most significant bit (MSB) indicates the sign\u2014'1' is negative and '0' is positive. The module outputs a single bit signal 'gt1'. This output is set to 1 if the MSBs of 'psumr' and 'psum1' are different, indicating that one number is positive and the other is negative. If the MSBs are the same, 'gt1' is set to 0, signifying that both numbers share the same sign. The module operates without any internal signals apart from 'gt1'; it performs its comparisons directly in an always block. This always block checks and sets the 'gt1' output based purely on the comparison of the MSBs from 'psumr' and 'psum1', which is either set to 1 if there is a sign difference or 0 if there is none.",
