    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'log10_lookup' module calculates the logarithm base 10 of a 4-bit input 'in_x', producing a 4-bit output 'out_x'. The specific logarithmic calculation is intended to be implemented using a case statement within an always block reactive to 'in_x', though the actual logic is not provided in the code snippet. This design suggests direct computation from input to output, pending detailed case branches."
