Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_8 module implements a single-port RAM using the "altsyncram" component, suitable for speech data storage in DSP applications. It features an 8-bit address and a 32-bit data interface, managing read and write operations with signals `rden` and `wren`. The module initializes from a "RAM_speech_8.mif" file and employs settings optimized for Cyclone IV E devices, ensuring efficient data handling without output register clock enable and no reading during writes.
