The RAM is capable of read and write operations governed by the `rden` (read enable) and `wren` (write enable) signals. The module utilizes specific parameters such as the number of words, data width, and operational modes, which are configured for optimal performance on Cyclone IV E devices. The RAM initializes from a memory initialization file \"RAM_speech_8.mif\" and operates under the assumption that it does not require output register clock enable and data will not be read during write operations. This module is likely used for storing and retrieving speech data or parameters in digital signal processing applications related to speech."

When high, data can be read from the RAM at the address specified.\n- `wren` (write enable): A control signal used to enable data writing to RAM. When high, data from the `data` port is written to the RAM at the specified address.\n\nOutput ports: q.\nExplanation:\n- `q`: 32-bit output which holds the data read from the RAM after a successful read operation is triggered by a high `rden` signal.
