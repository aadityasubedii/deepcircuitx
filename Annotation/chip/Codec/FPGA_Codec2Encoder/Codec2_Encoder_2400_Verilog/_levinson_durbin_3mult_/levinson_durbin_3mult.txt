Module-level comment: This module implements the Levinson-Durbin algorithm for LPC analysis, calculating LPC coefficients from input autocorrelation values. It uses a state machine to control the algorithm's execution, performing iterative computations with multiple multipliers and adders. The module processes input data, calculates reflection coefficients and LPC coefficients, and outputs the results along with control signals. The implementation optimizes hardware usage through state-based computations and efficient data flow management.
