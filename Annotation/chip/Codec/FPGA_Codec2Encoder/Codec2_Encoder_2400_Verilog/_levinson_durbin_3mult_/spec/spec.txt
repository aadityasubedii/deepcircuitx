Module name: levinson_durbin_3mult. Module specification: This module implements the Levinson-Durbin algorithm for linear predictive coding (LPC) analysis. It calculates LPC coefficients based on input autocorrelation values (R0 to R10). The module has input ports for start signal (startld), clock (clk), reset (rst), and autocorrelation values (R0-R10). Output ports include a done signal (doneld), LPC coefficients (in_lpc), and an address signal (addr_ld). Internally, it uses a state machine to control the algorithm's execution, with states for initialization, loop control, calculations, and output generation. Key internal signals include STATE and NEXT_STATE for the FSM, counters (i, j1, j2), intermediate values (k, e, sum), and numerous temporary storage registers (a0 to a
