Module-level comment: This module implements a nearest neighbor search for a weighted codebook of 256 entries. It uses a state machine to control the process of comparing input vectors (x0, x1) against codebook entries, calculating weighted distances, and finding the nearest neighbor. The module iterates through all entries, updates the minimum distance and nearest neighbor index, and outputs the result when complete. It utilizes fixed-point arithmetic for distance calculations and employs a case statement for codebook entry selection.
