Module name: find_nearest_weighted. Module specification: This module implements a nearest neighbor search algorithm for a weighted codebook of 256 entries. It takes input vectors x0 and x1 with corresponding weights w0 and w1, and compares them against the codebook entries to find the nearest neighbor. The module uses a 3-bit state machine to control the search process, with states for initialization, loop control, distance calculation, and result output. Input ports include startfnw (starts operation), clk (clock), rst (reset), x0 and x1 (32-bit input vectors), and w0 and w1 (32-bit weights). Output ports are nearest (9-bit index of nearest entry) and donefnw (operation completion flag). Key internal signals include STATE and NEXT_STATE for FSM control, i for loop iterations, in_cb0 and in_cb1
