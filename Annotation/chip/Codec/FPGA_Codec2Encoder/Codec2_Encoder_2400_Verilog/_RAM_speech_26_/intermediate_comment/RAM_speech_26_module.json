    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"RAM_speech_26\" module implements a single-port RAM on Altera Cyclone IV GX FPGAs for speech data handling. It features 8-bit addressing, 32-bit data I/O, synchronized by a clock with read/write controls. Internally, it utilizes an 'altsyncram' component, configured via parameters like memory size and clock management, reading predefined data from \"RAM_speech_26.mif\" for initialization. This setup ensures optimized, device-specific memory operations."
