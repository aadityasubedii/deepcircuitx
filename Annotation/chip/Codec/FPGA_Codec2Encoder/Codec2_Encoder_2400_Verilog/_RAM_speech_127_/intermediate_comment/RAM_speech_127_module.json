    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_127 module implements a single-port 32-bit RAM using an `altsyncram` component for Altera FPGA, configured for non-initialized operation with storage specified by `numwords_a` and `width_a`. It supports synchronous read/write operations based on `address`, `data`, `rden`, and `wren` signals, with internal wiring (`sub_wire0`) connecting the `altsyncram` output to the external `q` output for data retrieval. The initialization file \"RAM_speech_127.mif\" sets initial RAM content."
