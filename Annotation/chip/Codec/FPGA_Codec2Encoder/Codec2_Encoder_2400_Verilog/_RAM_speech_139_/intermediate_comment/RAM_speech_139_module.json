    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'RAM_speech_139' module functions as a single-port RAM, interfacing external commands to internal memory operations using Altera's altsyncram component. It leverages an 8-bit address and 32-bit data inputs, synchronized by a clock signal, along with read and write enable signals, to perform specific memory operations. The internal 'sub_wire0' wire bridges the altsyncram output to the module's 32-bit output. Configurations like device family, operation mode, and initialization are set via parameters in the altsyncram component."
