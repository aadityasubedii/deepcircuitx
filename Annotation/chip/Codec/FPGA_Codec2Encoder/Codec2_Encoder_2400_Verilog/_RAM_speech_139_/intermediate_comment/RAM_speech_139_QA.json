It utilizes an 'altsyncram' component from Altera (now part of Intel) which is configurable for different RAM functionalities based on the parameters set, such as memory initialization file, device family, and operation modes. The module uses the altsyncram component to perform specific memory operations like reading or writing to the memory at specified addresses, controlled by clock signals, and according to the configuration established (such as the number of words, data width, etc.)."
