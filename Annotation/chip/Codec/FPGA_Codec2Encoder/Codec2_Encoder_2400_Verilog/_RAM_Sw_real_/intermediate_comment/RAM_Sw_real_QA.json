Explanation: This module defines a single-port RAM using the `altsyncram` component, primarily for the Cyclone IV E FPGA family. It accepts a 9-bit address and 32-bit data input, and provides a 32-bit data output. The RAM supports read and write operations controlled by separate enable signals. The operation of the RAM does not allow read during write scenarios where old data is read; it always outputs new data. The RAM is initialized from a file \"RAM_Sw_real.mif\" and does not power up uninitialized, ensuring defined behavior on startup."

It acts as the timing pulse for the module.\n- `data`: This is a 32-bit input used to specify the data to be written into the RAM at the memory location specified by the `address` input when write is enabled.\n- `rden`: Read enable signal. When high (1), it allows the RAM to perform a read operation, placing the data from the specified address onto the output port `q`.\n- `wren`: Write enable signal. When high (1), it allows the RAM to perform a write operation, writing the data present on the `data` input to the specified address.\n\nOutput ports: q.\nExplanation: \n- `q`: This is a 32-bit output which holds the data read from the memory location specified by the `address` input, based on the control of `rden`.
