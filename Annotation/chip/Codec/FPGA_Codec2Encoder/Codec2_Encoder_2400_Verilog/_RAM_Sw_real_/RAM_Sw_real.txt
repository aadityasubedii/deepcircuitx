Module-level comment: The RAM_Sw_real module implements a single-port RAM for the Cyclone IV E FPGA, using the `altsyncram` component. It supports synchronized read and write operations via inputs like address, data, and control signals (rden, wren). Outputs are routed through internal wiring ('sub_wire0') to deliver requested data. The module initializes from 'RAM_Sw_real.mif' ensuring defined startup states, configured specifically for non-overlapping read during write scenarios.
