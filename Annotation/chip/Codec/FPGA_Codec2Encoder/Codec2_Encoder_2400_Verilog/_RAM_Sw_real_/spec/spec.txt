Module name: RAM_Sw_real. Module specification: The RAM_Sw_real module implements a single-port RAM specifically tailored for Cyclone IV E FPGA, utilizing the `altsyncram` component for memory operations. The module accepts inputs including an 9-bit width 'address' specifying the RAM location for read or write operations; 'clock' signal ensuring synchronized read/write activities; a 32-bit 'data' input for data writing; and control signals 'rden' and 'wren' for read and write enable functions, respectively. The output, 'q', is a 32-bit signal presenting the data stored at the addressed RAM location. Internal to the module, the 'sub_wire0' signal is crucial, serving as an intermediary by transporting the output from the `altsyncram` component to the 'q' output port. The code is structured around the initialization and configuration of the `altsyncram` component, defining its operational characteristics like memory size, intended device family, and data handling specifics during read/write scenarios. It also sets up initialization from the "RAM_Sw_real.mif" file ensuring defined startup behavior and preventing uninitialized power-up scenarios. The properties and behavior of the `altsyncram` component are meticulously detailed using `defparam` to ensure optimal configuration for the intended single-port, no read during write operations.
