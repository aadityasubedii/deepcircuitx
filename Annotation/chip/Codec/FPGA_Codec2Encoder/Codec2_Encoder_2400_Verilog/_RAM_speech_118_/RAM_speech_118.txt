Module-level comment: The "RAM_speech_118" module serves as single-port RAM, utilizing the Altera-specific 'altsyncram' within Cyclone IV GX devices. It operates on a 32-bit data and 8-bit address input, synchronized by a clock. The RAM supports read (rden) and write (wren) operations, mapping altsyncram's output to the 32-bit output 'q' via internal wire 'sub_wire0'. Memory initialization is handled through "RAM_speech_118.mif", with detailed settings for memory behavior configured explicitly in the code.
