Module name: RAM_speech_118.
Module specification: The "RAM_speech_118" module functions as a single-port RAM leveraging the Altera-specific 'altsyncram' component, tailored for the Cyclone IV GX device family. It is designed to manage digital data storage by accepting an 8-bit `address` and 32-bit `data` input; operations are synchronized using the `clock` input. The module features two primary control signals, `rden` and `wren`, for read and write operations respectively. The output is a 32-bit `q`, which represents the data retrieved from the RAM at the specified address. Internally, the module uses a wire `sub_wire0` for routing the data output from the 'altsyncram' component to the `q` output port, facilitating any intermediate processing. The 'altsyncram' component configuration within the module specifies memory initialization through the "RAM_speech_118.mif" file, setting operational modes such as `SINGLE_PORT` and disabling runtime modifications. Additional parameters like memory size (`numwords_a`), data width (`width_a`), and address width (`widthad_a`) are set in alignment with the moduleâ€™s functional requirements. The module also incorporates default settings for various unused features and conditional compilation blocks to fine-tune hardware synthesis, ensuring optimized FPGA usage.
