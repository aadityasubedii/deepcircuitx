Module name: fpdiv_clk. Module specification: The "fpdiv_clk" module is specifically designed to execute fixed-point division of an input signal "in" using a clock signal "clk." It initiates processing when the "startdiv" signal becomes high and provides the division result in "ans" output, with "donediv" signaling the completion of the process. Inputs include "startdiv" to trigger division, "clk" as the clock signal, "rst" for resetting the module, and "in" as the dividend. Outputs are "ans" for the division result and "donediv" as the process complete flag. Internal signals such as "STATE" and "NEXT_STATE" control the FSM state transitions, while "x0" and "x1" preserve intermediate results, and flags like "neg," "ltflag," and "gtflag" help in determining sign and scaling adjustments of the result. The code includes blocks for initializing conditions, looping for approximation, result scaling and sign setting, and finally setting the output. These sequential blocks manage the setup, computation, and output of the division ensuring proper synchronization with the clock signal, processing of reset conditions, and accuracy of division output with sign considerations.
