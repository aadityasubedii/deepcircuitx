    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"fpdiv_clk\" module performs fixed-point division on an input \"in\" using a sequential process driven by a clock signal \"clk\". Utilizing a FSM managed by \"STATE\" and \"NEXT_STATE\", the module adjusts input based on sign and scales the divisor for convergence for accurate results. Outputs the result in \"ans\" and completion status in \"donediv\". Achieves functionality through stages including initial setup, iterative approximation using shifting, and result adjustment with assertion of result readiness."
