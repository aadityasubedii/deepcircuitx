It operates in a sequential manner driven by a clock signal \"clk\" and is controlled by a start signal \"startdiv\". The module works through various states controlled by a finite state machine (FSM), manipulating the initial divisor and dividend through shifts and additions to converge on an approximation of the quotient. The computed quotient is then adjusted based on the accumulated shifts to yield the correct scale. The output \"ans\" provides the division result, and \"donediv\" indicates when the operation is complete. The process incorporates handling for negative input values and adjusts the result's sign accordingly."

All state transitions and data processing activities are synchronized to the rising edge of this clock.\n- `rst`: A reset signal that, when set to low (`0`), resets the internal state machine to its initial state and prepares the module for a fresh start.\n- `in`: The fixed-point input number that is to be divided. This is the dividend in the division operation.\n\nOutput ports: ans, donediv.\nExplanation:\n- `ans`: The fixed-point output of the division operation.
