It operates with a width of 32 bits and an address width of 8 bits, supporting a total of 160 words. The module handles read and write operations based on the input signals; 'rden' for read enable and 'wren' for write enable. Data flow is managed by the clock signal. Several parameters like the initialization file and operational mode are specified, ensuring tailored behavior for specific needs like speech data handling in RAM. The RAM does not power up uninitialized, and it utilizes specific configurations like bypassing the clock inputs for read/write enablement. Additionally, this module avoids output data clearing during address or clock adjustments."
