Module name: qdiv. 

Module specification: The qdiv module is a Verilog-based design that efficiently performs signed division of two integers using sequential logic. It is parameterized by `Q`, which defines the precision of the quotient, and `N`, determining the width of the input and output integers. The module inputs include `i_dividend` and `i_divisor`, each N-bit wide representing the integers to be divided; `i_start`, a control signal that initiates the division process; and `i_clk`, a clock signal that synchronizes operations. The outputs comprise `o_quotient_out`, an N-bit output providing the quotient including its sign; `o_complete`, a flag indicating the completion of the division; and `o_overflow`, signaling if the quotient has exceeded the representable range. Internally, the module utilizes several registers including `reg_working_quotient` for intermediate quotient values, `reg_quotient` holding the final quotient, `reg_working_dividend` and `reg_working_divisor` for manipulated dividend and divisor values, `reg_count` as a control counter, and `reg_done`, `reg_sign`, `reg_overflow` for operation status flags. The code is structured into initial assignments for setup, combinational logic for output assignments, and a synchronous block controlled by `i_clk` to iteratively compute the division through shifting and subtraction, managing edge cases like operation initiation and completion, as well as checking conditions like adequate subtraction and division completion. Through its structured and parameterizable design, qdiv effectively provides signed integer division with consideration for overflow and operational completeness.
