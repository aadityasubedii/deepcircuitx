It is parameterized by `Q`, which specifies the precision of the quotient shift, and `N`, which determines the width of the input and output integers. The module starts the operation when the `i_start` signal is high and processes the inputs (`i_dividend` and `i_divisor`) based on the clock signal `i_clk`. The results, including the quotient, the operation completion status, and an overflow flag, are provided as output through `o_quotient_out`, `o_complete`, and `o_overflow`. The division handles the sign of the results by XORing the signs of the inputs and adjusts for overflow scenarios when the quotient cannot be represented with the given bit widths."

It is an N-bit wide bus, which includes both quotient value and sign.\n- o_complete: This is a flag output signal. It indicates that the division operation is complete and the result is available on o_quotient_out.\n- o_overflow: This flag output signal indicates if there has been an overflow during the division operation, i.e., when the quotient exceeds the representable range for the specified bit width."
