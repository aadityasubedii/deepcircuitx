Module-level comment: The qdiv module performs signed division on two N-bit integers using sequential logic, controlled by a clock. It initializes with `i_start` and operates bit-wise, shifting and subtracting to form the quotient. Outputs include the quotient with its sign, completion flag, and overflow indicator. The division logic iterates based on the clock signal until the division is complete, handling initialization and iterative comparison within a clock-driven loop.
