Module name: test_aof1_one_frame. Module specification: This module implements a complex state machine for processing and encoding one frame of speech data. It takes inputs start_oneframe, clk, and rst to control the processing, and outputs encoded speech parameters including encoded_bits (48-bit final encoded frame), various intermediate results (out_mem_x, out_mem_y, out_prevf0, out_xq0, out_xq1), and control signals (done_oneframe). Internal signals include counters (i, j, i1, j1), state variables (STATE, NEXT_STATE), address signals (addr_sn, addr_speech, addr_mem_fir, addr_nlp_sq), and various data storage registers. The module operates through multiple stages: initializing memory, analyzing speech frames (AOF1 and AOF2), processing speech samples, encoding parameters (
