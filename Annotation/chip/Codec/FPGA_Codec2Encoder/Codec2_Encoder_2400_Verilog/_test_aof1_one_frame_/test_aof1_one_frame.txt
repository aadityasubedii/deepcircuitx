Module-level comment: This module processes and encodes one frame of speech data. It implements a complex state machine that reads speech samples, performs analysis (AOF1 and AOF2), encodes speech parameters (pitch, LSP, energy), and outputs a 48-bit encoded frame. The module uses multiple sub-modules for specific tasks and manages the overall encoding process through various states, including memory initialization, speech analysis, parameter encoding, and Gray code conversion. It interfaces with external memory and produces intermediate results along with the final encoded output.
