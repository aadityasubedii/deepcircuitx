Module name: RAM_speech_94. Module specification: The RAM_speech_94 is a single-port RAM module designed specifically for handling speech data storage and processing in a Cyclone IV GX FPGA. The module harnesses an `altsyncram` component from the Altera library to create a configurable memory setup. It features input ports such as: `address` (an 8-bit signal determining the memory address for operations), `clock` (synchronizing signal for operations), `data` (a 32-bit input representing data to be written into memory), `rden` (read enable signal), and `wren` (write enable signal). The output port, `q`, is a 32-bit signal that outputs data from the specified memory address if `rden` is high. Internally, the module uses `sub_wire0`, a 32-bit wire that serves as an intermediary connection from the `altsyncram` componentâ€™s output to the `q` output port. The code is structured to set up the `altsyncram` component with parameters specifying memory characteristics (like memory initialization file, output data latching, and operational mode), and it programmatically connects module inputs to internal architecture, manages read and write functionalities adhering to specified configurations such as no read during a write operation to the same address, and adjusts component properties for optimized performance with the intended FPGA platform.
