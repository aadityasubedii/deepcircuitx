    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_94 module implements a single-port RAM designed for speech data storage on a Cyclone IV GX FPGA. Utilizing the `altsyncram` Altera component, it supports synchronized read and write operations via control signals (rden, wren) based on the `address`. Data flow is managed with internal wiring (`sub_wire0`) directly connecting the component\u2019s output to the module\u2019s output port `q`."
