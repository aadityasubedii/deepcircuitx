Module name: RAM_speech_142. Module specification: The RAM_speech_142 is a Verilog module that instantiates a single port RAM using Altera's altsyncram component, tailored for the Cyclone IV GX FPGA family. This RAM has an 8-bit address and a 32-bit data width and is designed to perform read and write operations controlled by the 'rden' (read enable) and 'wren' (write enable) input signals, without allowing reads during writes or data output clearance on resets. Inputs to this module include 'address' [7:0] for specifying the memory address, 'clock' for the operation's timing, 'data' [31:0] for inputting data to write, and control signals 'rden' and 'wren'. The output 'q' [31:0] delivers the data read from the specified memory address. Internally, the module uses 'sub_wire0' [31:0], which connects the output of the altsyncram (q_a) to the module's output port (q), facilitating data movement from the memory component to the interface. The code is structured with definitions for input and output ports, internal signal wiring, the altsyncram component instantiation with essential configurations like operation mode, memory initialization file, and device family, and setting up parameters like addressing mode and output data handling to ensure the module operates efficiently with the given specifications.
