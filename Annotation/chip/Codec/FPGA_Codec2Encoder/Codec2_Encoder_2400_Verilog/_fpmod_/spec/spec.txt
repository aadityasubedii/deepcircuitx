Module name: fpmod. 
Module specification: The `fpmod` module is designed to perform a fixed-point modulus operation between two inputs, `in_1` and `in_2`, using an iterative division and multiplication approach to calculate the remainder of the division. The module toggles through a state machine to sequence operations effectively and interface with dedicated multiplication, addition, and division sub-modules named `qmult`, `qadd`, and `fpdiv_clk`. The input ports include `startfmod` (to trigger the operation), `clk` (the clock signal), `rst` (reset signal), and the operands `in_1` and `in_2`. The output ports consist of `rem`, which outputs the modulus result, and `donefmod`, a flag that indicates the completion of the operation. Internal signals like `STATE`, `NEXT_STATE`, `m1_in1`, `m1_in2`, `a1_in1`, `a1_in2`, `div_in`, `startdiv`, and others manage the calculation sequences and data flow between submodules. The code is segmented into blocks handling state transitions, division initialization, multiplication operations, and result computation to achieve the modulus. Each section is carefully scaffolded to ensure data integrity and correct sequencing, managed under the rhythmic progression of the clock, and structured state transitions.
