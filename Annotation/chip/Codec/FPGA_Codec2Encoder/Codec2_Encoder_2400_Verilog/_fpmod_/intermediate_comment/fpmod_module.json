    "module": "Module-level comment: The `fpmod` module performs a fixed-point modulus operation between two input numbers using an iterative process driven by state machine transitions. Its functionality is accomplished through submodules `qmult` for multiplication, `qadd` for addition, and `fpdiv_clk` for division, controlled by internal state logic and sequential processing determined by clock and reset signals. This structured approach ensures precise initiation, processing, and completion of the modulus calculation, outputting the remainder and completion status."
