These signals hold the results of the multiplication and addition operations respectively and are used in subsequent states for further processing.\n- `div_ans`: Output from the `fpdiv_clk` module, which gives the result of the division operation. This signal is used to update the internal `divisor` register.\n- `donediv`: Status output from the `fpdiv_clk` submodule indicating the completion of the division process.
