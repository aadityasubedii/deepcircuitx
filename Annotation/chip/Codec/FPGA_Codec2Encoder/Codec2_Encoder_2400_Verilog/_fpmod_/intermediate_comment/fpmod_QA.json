The module includes a state machine to manage the sequence of operations, interacting with multiplication, addition, and division sub-modules (`qmult`, `qadd`, and `fpdiv_clk`). The division result is refined to get the exact modulus by using the results of multiplication and addition operations. The output `rem` gives the modulus result, and `donefmod` indicates the completion of the operation. The state machine transitions through several states, initializing and controlling the flow of data between stages until the `DONE` state is achieved, at which point the result is ready and communicated through the `donefmod` signal."
