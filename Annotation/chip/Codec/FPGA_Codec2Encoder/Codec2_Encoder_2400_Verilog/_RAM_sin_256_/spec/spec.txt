Module name: RAM_sin_256. Module specification: The `RAM_sin_256` module serves as a Read-Only Memory (ROM) specifically tailored for FPGA applications, utilizing an `altsyncram` component from the Altera (Intel) device libraries, optimized for the Cyclone IV E family. Designed to store and provide 256 entries of 16-bit data, the module is only capable of read operations, as indicated by its ROM operating mode. The primary input ports include an 8-bit `address` for selecting data entries, a `clock` signal for timing the read operations, and a `rden` (read enable) signal that must be high for data access. The sole output, `q`, is a 16-bit port delivering the data stored at the specified memory address, enabled and driven by the read operations. The internal signal `sub_wire0` is crucial, acting as a conduit between the `altsyncram` output and the `q` output port, ensuring data is correctly transferred. The implementation encapsulates the RAM configuration and initialization using an associated memory initialization file ("RAM_sin_256.mif"), laid out systematically in the parameter settings of the `altsyncram` component, which include specifying the memory width, number of words, operational mode as ROM, and clock management for the inputs and outputs. This architecture ensures that the module effectively operates as a pre-configured ROM, suitable for holding fixed data like sinusoidal wave values, preventing runtime modifications and maintaining precise timing and output data integrity.
