    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_func_fft_real32 module implements a single-port RAM for FPGA Cyclone IV E using the `altsyncram` component. It features input ports for address, clock, data, and read/write enables, with a 32-bit data output `q`. Internally, it uses `sub_wire0` to connect `altsyncram` output to `q`. Settings like memory size, operation mode, and data handling are configured through `defparam` for efficient data storage and retrieval."
