Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_5 module implements a single-port RAM using the Altera-specific `altsyncram` component targeted for Cyclone IV E FPGA. It handles read and write operations using input signals (`address`, `data`, `rden`, `wren`, `clock`) and outputs data through `q`. Internal wiring (`sub_wire0`) forwards the `altsyncram` output to the system interface, ensuring modular data flow and integrity within memory operations. The module is configured for optimal RAM functionality focusing on speech processing applications.
