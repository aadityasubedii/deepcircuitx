    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_119 module implements a single-port RAM designed for speech data storage on Cyclone IV GX FPGAs using the `altsyncram` component. It supports synchronous read and write operations controlled by the `rden` and `wren` signals, with data flow managed via the internal wire `sub_wire0`. Configuration parameters optimize the RAM's behavior and interface requirements for specific application needs."
