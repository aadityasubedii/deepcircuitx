    "module": "Module-level comment: The encode_lsp_scalar_index module quantizes LSP frequencies for voice codecs by converting 10 radian inputs to Hz, then scalar quantizing each via a FSM-controlled process. Frequencies are multiplied by a RADTOHZ constant using 'qmult' components, and quantized in a 'quantise' submodule. Index selection is managed through a series of states, leveraging parameters and internal registers to track and select the optimal quantization indices, outputting the best index based on input selection."
