    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a Non-Linear Pitch (NLP) estimation algorithm for speech processing. It uses notch filtering, FIR filtering, and FFT computation to estimate the pitch of an input signal. The module operates in multiple stages: data initialization, filtering, FFT calculation, and pitch estimation. It employs memory blocks, arithmetic operations, and a state machine to process input data and output the estimated pitch value along with related parameters."
