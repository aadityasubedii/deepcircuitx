Module name: nlp_test. Module specification: The nlp_test module implements a Non-Linear Pitch (NLP) estimation algorithm for speech processing. It performs notch filtering, FIR filtering, FFT computation, and post-processing to estimate the pitch of an input signal. The module has input ports for initiating the algorithm (startnlp), clock (clk), reset (rst), initial memory values (nlp_mem_x, nlp_mem_y), and previous fundamental frequency (prev_f0). Output ports include the best estimated fundamental frequency (best_f0), previous fundamental frequency (out_prev_f0), completion indicator (donenlp), estimated pitch (pitch), and updated memory values (nlp_mem_x_out, nlp_mem_y_out). Internally, it uses various signals for state management, memory addressing, arithmetic operations, and control flags. The module is structure
