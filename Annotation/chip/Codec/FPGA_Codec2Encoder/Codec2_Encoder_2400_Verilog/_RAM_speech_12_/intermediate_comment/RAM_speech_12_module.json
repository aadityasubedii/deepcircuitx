    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_12 module operates as a single-port RAM for speech data storage, using the altsyncram component configured for Cyclone IV GX FPGA. It handles synchronized read and write operations via control inputs (address, clock, data, rden, wren) and outputs read data via the 'q' port. Internal wiring (sub_wire0) and parameter configurations in the altsyncram ensure efficient data transfer and module operation under single-port mode."
