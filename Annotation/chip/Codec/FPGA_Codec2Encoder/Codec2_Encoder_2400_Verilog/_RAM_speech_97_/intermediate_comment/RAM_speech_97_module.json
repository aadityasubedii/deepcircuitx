    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_97 module implements a single-port RAM, utilizing an 8-bit address for specific read and write operations, driven by a clock. It manages data using the `altsyncram` configured for Cyclone IV GX, without read during write, utilizing a memory initialization file. Internal wiring (`sub_wire0`) connects the core RAM component to the output port `q`, enabling synchronized data retrieval and storage as dictated by control signals."
