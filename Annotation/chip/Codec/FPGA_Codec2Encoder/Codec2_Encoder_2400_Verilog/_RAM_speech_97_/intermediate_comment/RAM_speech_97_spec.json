    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_97.\nModule specification: The RAM_speech_97 module is a single-port RAM designed for use with the Cyclone IV GX FPGA family, which interfaces with external systems using 8-bit addressable memory locations. The module takes an 8-bit `address`, a `clock` signal to synchronize operations, a 32-bit `data` input for writing, and read enable (`rden`) and write enable (`wren`) control signals for reading and writing operations, respectively. The output is a 32-bit `q` which carries the data read from the specified memory address. Internally, the module utilizes `sub_wire0`, a 32-bit wire that acts as an intermediary to hold data output from the core `altsyncram` component before it is sent to the `q` output. The module primarily consists of the `altsyncram` component configuration, which operates the memory with specific parameters such as initialization from a `.mif` file, specific RAM and bit widths, and control settings like not allowing read during write operations. This component setup explains the essential configurations of the RAM and governs its operation, effectively handling the data flow based on the input commands and system clock.",
