    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_Sw_fft_real module implements a single-port RAM using an Altera 'altsyncram' component. It manages data operations through inputs such as a 9-bit address, 32-bit data, a clock, and read/write enable signals, with a 32-bit output 'q' for read data. Configured specifically for Cyclone IV E devices, it exemplifies standard RAM operations with parameters like bypassed clock enables and initialized without data, tailored for efficient single-port functionality in applications like data buffering."
