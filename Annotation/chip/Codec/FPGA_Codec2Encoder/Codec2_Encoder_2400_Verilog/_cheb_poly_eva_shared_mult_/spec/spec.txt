Module name: cheb_poly_eva_shared_mult.  
Module specification: The `cheb_poly_eva_shared_mult` module employs a finite state machine (FSM) to evaluate Chebyshev polynomials, a mathematical approach leveraging geometric progression principles computationally effective in hardware usage. The module expects inputs: `clk` (clock signal), `rst` (reset signal), `startcp` (start control signal), `x` (input variable for polynomial calculation), `coeff0` to `coeff5` (Chebyshev polynomial coefficients), and `out_mult` (feedback from an external or internal multiplier module). Outputs include `mult1` and `mult2` (multiplier inputs for subsequent stages), `donecp` (computation completion flag), and the cumulative polynomial result `sum`. Internally, the module manipulates several signals such as `STATE` and `NEXT_STATE` to manage the FSM transitions, temporary storage registers (`t0` to `t5`) each representing x raised to progressive powers, and `x2` used for scaling x by 2. Arithmetic operations make use of additional registers (`add1`, `add2`) for handling operands in preparation for the addition operations processed through an external/internal `adder1` block. The code structure is segmented into an initialization block responsible for setting initial states and configurations, state transition management blocks directing the sequence of operations as per the FSM design, and computational blocks responsible for handling arithmetic operations required to compute the polynomial. At the end of the computation sequence, the module sets the `donecp` signal, indicating that the polynomial evaluation has been successful and the result is available in `sum`.
