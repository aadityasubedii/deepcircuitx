It takes coefficients and a variable `x` as inputs and computes the polynomial value iteratively across multiple FSM (Finite State Machine) states. Each state prepares, calculates, or accumulates results for different orders of the polynomial terms, handling the arithmetic through additional sub-modules for addition (`adder1`) and multiplication (handled by keeping `mult1` and `mult2` registers). At the end of the sequence, the module outputs the computed sum of the polynomial and a signal (`donecp`) to indicate the completion of the computation. This setup effectively decomposes the polynomial evaluation into manageable steps utilizing hardware architecture for potentially increased computation speed and efficiency in a synchronous digital system."
