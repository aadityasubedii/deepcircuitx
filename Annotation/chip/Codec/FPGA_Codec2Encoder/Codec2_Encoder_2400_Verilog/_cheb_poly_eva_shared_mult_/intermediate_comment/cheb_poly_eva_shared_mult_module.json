    "module": "Module-level comment: The `cheb_poly_eva_shared_mult` module evaluates Chebyshev polynomials using an FSM-based approach. It sequentially calculates polynomial terms using inputs `x` and coefficients, employing stateful transitions for handling multiplication and addition through internal registers and an external adder. Outputs include the polynomial result and a computation done signal."
