    "module": "Module-level comment: The ROM_cb6 module functions as a 32-bit read-only memory (ROM), indexed by a 4-bit address (`addr`). It features a predetermined 1D array `cb6` with 16 values. The module outputs a specific 32-bit data stored at the indexed address in `cb6` to the `dataout` port. Data retrieval based on address input is handled in an `always@(*)` block, ensuring immediate and synchronous data output."
