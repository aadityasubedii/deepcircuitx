It receives a 4-bit address input (addr), and outputs a corresponding 32-bit data value (dataout) stored at that address location within an internal memory array named cb6. The array cb6 is initialized with specific 32-bit values for each possible address from 0 to 15. On receiving an address input, the module outputs the respective value stored at that address in the cb6 memory array."
