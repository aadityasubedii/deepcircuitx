Module name: ROM_cb6. 
Module specification: The ROM_cb6 is a Verilog module that serves as a read-only memory (ROM) storing predefined 32-bit binary data patterns, which can be accessed via a 4-bit address input. The module contains one input port `addr` that accepts a 4-bit address to determine which of the 16 possible 32-bit values should be outputted. The output of this module is through the port `dataout`, which provides the 32-bit data associated with the address specified at the input. The internal setup includes a 1-dimensional array `cb6` of 32-bit registers initialized in the module to store these values. This array has 16 possible addresses from 0 to 15, holding predefined values. The `always@(*)` block in the code ensures that upon receiving an address input, the corresponding 32-bit value is directly fetched from the `cb6` array and assigned to `dataout`, which then outputs this data. The initialization of the array and the data output based on the address input are managed within this single `always` block, simplifying the read operation from this memory module.
