    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_90 module implements a single-port RAM tailored for Cyclone IV GX FPGA, managing read and write operations. Utilizing an altsyncram component, it offers a 32-bit data width and an 8-bit address width with memory control via input signals (address, clock, data, rden, wren). Output data is provided on 'q' based on read-enable signal and specific address. Implementation ensures synchronized operations and initializable memory content, dictated by defined parameters and settings within the altsyncram block."
