    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech module implements a single-port RAM using Altera's altsyncram for Cyclone IV E FPGAs. It operates with inputs for address, data, and control signals (read and write enables), and outputs data read from RAM. Internal wiring and parameter configurations in altsyncram ensure synchronicity and correct data handling, setting specific memory size and operational modes for efficient data storage and retrieval."
