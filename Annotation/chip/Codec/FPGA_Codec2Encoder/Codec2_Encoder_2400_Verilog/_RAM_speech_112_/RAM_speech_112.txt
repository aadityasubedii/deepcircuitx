Module-level comment: The `RAM_speech_112` module implements a single-port RAM using Altera's `altsyncram` for data storage and retrieval in Cyclone IV GX FPGAs. It accepts an 8-bit address, 32-bit data, and control signals (rden, wren) to manage read and write operations. Output data is driven through internal signal `sub_wire0` from the `altsyncram` module, configured for optimal speed and operation modes such as preventing data mix-up during simultaneous actions at the same address.
