Module name: ROM_cb5. Module specification: The ROM_cb5 module is a Verilog-based read-only memory (ROM) design meant to store and provide access to 16 predefined 32-bit values. It incorporates a 4-bit input port `addr`, which serves to select one of the 16 memory locations in the ROM, each containing a unique 32-bit value. The value from the selected memory location is then output through a 32-bit output port `dataout`. Internally, the module uses an array `cb5`, consisting of sixteen 32-bit registers that store these predefined values. Implemented through the Verilog construct `reg [N-1:0] cb5[15:0]` with `N` equating to 32, this array acts as the ROM's main storage mechanism. Within the module's 'always' block, predefined data is loaded into each index of the `cb5` array, with the indexed based on `addr`, thus mapping the address input to the correct data output dynamically, ensuring `dataout` provides the correct predetermined value corresponding to the provided input address `addr`. This setup facilitates seamless access to constant configurations or data arrays required for various applications within digital systems.
