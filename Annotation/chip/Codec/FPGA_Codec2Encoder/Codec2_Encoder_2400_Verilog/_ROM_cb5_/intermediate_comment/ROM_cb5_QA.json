It has an input `addr` of 4 bits, which allows the selection of one out of the 16 memory locations, and a 32-bit output `dataout` that corresponds to the value stored at the memory location indexed by `addr`. This setup is commonly used to store fixed data that does not change over time, making it ideal for applications requiring constant values or configurations."

It allows the module to retrieve a specific 32-bit value based on the provided address. This is essential for accessing different preset configurations or data stored within the ROM module.\n\nOutput ports: dataout.  \nExplanation: The output `dataout` is a 32-bit data port that outputs the value stored at the memory location indexed by the input `addr`. Once a specific address is provided to the `addr` input, the corresponding 32-bit value is placed on the `dataout` port. This is critical for utilizing the read data externally, enabling the ROM to serve its function of providing constant preset data to other parts of the digital system."

This memory array is used to store predefined 32-bit values that can be accessed based on the `addr` input.
