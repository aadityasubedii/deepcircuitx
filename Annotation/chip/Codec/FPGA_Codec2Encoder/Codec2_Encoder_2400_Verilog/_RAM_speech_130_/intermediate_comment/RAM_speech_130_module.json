    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_130 module is a single-port RAM optimized for Cyclone IV GX devices, managing data storage and retrieval. It integrates with the `altsyncram_component` for flexible parameterization, handling 8-bit addresses and 32-bit data through defined input ports `address`, `clock`, `data`, `rden`, and `wren`. Output is facilitated through the `q` port, with `sub_wire0` used internally for data buffering. Configurations like memory size and operational modes are tightly controlled via `defparam` settings, ensuring tailored functionality for specific applications."
