Module name: RAM_speech_130. Module specification: The RAM_speech_130 module is designed as a single-port RAM leveraging the `altsyncram_component`, customized for use with Cyclone IV GX device families, and primarily aimed at applications like speech processing. It interfaces through five input ports: `address` (an 8-bit value specifying the target memory address), `clock` (timing signal for operations), `data` (a 32-bit input data for storage), `rden` (enables data reading when high), and `wren` (enables data writing when high). The sole output port, `q`, also 32-bits, outputs the data retrieved from the specified memory address. Internal to the module, the `sub_wire0` signal acts as a buffer or intermediary holding the data fetched from the memory temporarily before output. The code delineates setup for the `altsyncram_component`, establishing parameters such as bit-width, operational mode, initialization file, and other memory configurations ensuring it meets the specific requirements of the intended device family and application needs. This setup also includes defparam statements fine-tuning various operational traits like clock management and data access behaviors of the `altsyncram_component`. This meticulous configuration ensures that the module not only stores and retrieves data efficiently but also aligns with the specific hardware characteristics of the Cyclone IV GX devices.
