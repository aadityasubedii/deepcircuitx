    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_57. \nModule specification: The RAM_speech_57 is a Verilog module that defines a single-port RAM tailored for the Cyclone IV GX FPGA family, utilizing the Altera-specific `altsyncram` component. It connects to an 8-bit address and a 32-bit data bus, and operates with both read and write enable signals through the inputs: `address`, `clock`, `data`, `rden`, and `wren`. The module outputs a 32-bit data `q`, which represents data read from a specific RAM address when `rden` is active. The internal signal `sub_wire0` serves as an intermediary to transfer data from the `altsyncram` component to the output. The code block involving the `altsyncram` component sets up the RAM's operating parameters like its mode, initialization file, and input-output behaviors using `defparam` statements. The other code sections predominantly deal with basic setup and configuration of the RAM\u2019s properties and interface specifics to align with the designated FPGA family's requirements. This module effectively facilitates data storage and retrieval operations synchronized by an input clock signal, without support for asynchronous clear or byte-enable functionalities.",

It accepts an 8-bit address and 32-bit data inputs, with separate read and write enable signals. The RAM is configured to operate in single-port mode with a specific initialization file (RAM_speech_57.mif) and has a capacity of 160 words, each 32 bits wide. The outputs are driven based on the clock input, and the RAM does not support asynchronous clear signals or byte-enable functionalities for simplification. The module typically returns data (from the address specified) on its output `q` when the read enable signal is active.
