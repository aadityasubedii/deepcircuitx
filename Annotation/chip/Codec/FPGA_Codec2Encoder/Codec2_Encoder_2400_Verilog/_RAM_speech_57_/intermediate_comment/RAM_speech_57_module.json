    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_57 module implements a single-port RAM specific to the Cyclone IV GX FPGA using the `altsyncram` component. It allows data storage and retrieval with separate read/write controls and an 8-bit address and 32-bit data interface. The internal `sub_wire0` routes data from the `altsyncram` to the output. Configurations are set via `defparam`, aligning operation modes and initialization specifics to facilitate synchronized RAM operations without asynchronous support."
