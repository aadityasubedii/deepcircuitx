It accepts a 4-bit address input (`addr`) and outputs a 32-bit data (`dataout`) corresponding to the address from an internally defined array `cb1`. The array `cb1` is initialized with 16 different 32-bit constants at different addresses ranging from 0 to 15. Whenever the input address changes, the corresponding 32-bit value from the `cb1` array is output through `dataout`."
