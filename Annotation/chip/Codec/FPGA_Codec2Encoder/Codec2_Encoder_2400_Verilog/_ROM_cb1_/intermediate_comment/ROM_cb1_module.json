    "module": "Module-level comment: The ROM_cb1 module acts as a 16-entry Read-Only Memory, mapping a 4-bit address input (`addr`) to a 32-bit output (`dataout`). Internally, it uses a memory array `cb1`, initialized with predefined 32-bit constants, to output the value at the index specified by `addr`. This structure provides fast, read-only access to stored data values based on the input address."
