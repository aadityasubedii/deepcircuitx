Module name: ROM_cb1. Module specification: The ROM_cb1 is a Verilog module designed as a Read-Only Memory (ROM) that utilizes a 4-bit address input (`addr`) to fetch a corresponding 32-bit data output (`dataout`) from a pre-defined array of binary values. The module has an input port named `addr`, which is a 4-bit binary number that acts as the address to the internal ROM, specifying which of the pre-defined 32-bit values should be retrieved. The output of the module is delivered through the `dataout` port, which is a 32-bit wide bus containing data stored at the address specified by `addr`. Internally, the module utilizes a signal array `cb1[15:0]`, where each element is a 32-bit wide register initialized with specific binary constants. This array is essential for storing the constants and providing the appropriate data output when addressed. The core functionality of the module is encapsulated in the always block, which initializes each element of the `cb1` array with a distinct constant and sets the `dataout` to the value stored at the address indexed by `addr`. This setup ensures that the module outputs the correct data corresponding to the input address, functioning effectively as a 16-entry ROM with each entry being 32-bit wide.
