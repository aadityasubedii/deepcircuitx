Module-level comment: The "estimate_amplitudes" module calculates amplitude values for given complex numbers using a finite state machine. It processes inputs 'Wo', 'L', 'out_real', 'out_imag' based on the 'startea' trigger. The output includes computed amplitude 'write_data_a' and status 'doneea'. Internally, it uses state-driven logic handling arithmetic operations, square root calculations, and iterative loops, transitioning through states to manage each step of the computation and manage control flow robustly.
