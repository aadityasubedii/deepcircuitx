Module name: estimate_amplitudes.
Module specification: The "estimate_amplitudes" module computes the amplitude values from given complex number inputs within specified iterative limits using a state machine. The module operates on a clock signal (clk) and a reset signal (rst) and starts its computation when triggered by the 'startea' input. The inputs include 'Wo' for frequency, 'L' for loop limit, 'out_real' and 'out_imag' for parts of a complex number. The outputs encompass an end-of-process signal 'doneea', addresses 'addr_a', 'addr_real', 'addr_imag', and the computed amplitude 'write_data_a'. Internal signals include STATE and NEXT_STATE to manage the state transitions, various computational inputs like 'a1_in1', 'a1_in2' for additions, 'm1_in1', 'm1_in2' for multiplications, and control signals like 'startsqrt' for square root operations. The module is divided into states initiated in always blocks that dictate the progression from initialization, setting interim values, performing calculations, to storing results, thus covering the entire amplitude estimation process through finite state transitions.
