Module name: RAM_speech_95. Module specification: The RAM_speech_95 module is a Verilog-based single-port RAM optimized for speech applications, leveraging Altera's `altsyncram` component for usage primarily on the Cyclone IV GX device family. The module is interfaced using an 8-bit `address` input for specifying the RAM location, a synchronizing `clock` signal, and a 32-bit `data` input for writing operations. Additionally, it utilizes `rden` and `wren` signals to enable read and write operations respectively. The output is a 32-bit bus `q` that outputs the data read from the specified RAM location. It includes internal signals such as `sub_wire0` which acts as an intermediary node carrying the output data from the `altsyncram` component to the `q` output port. The RAM is defined extensively within an `altsyncram_component` block, which includes specific parameters like no initial power-up initialization, operation mode as single-port, and RAM size configurations. This section also includes a myriad of settings ensuring optimized access and functionality tailored to the intended device family settings and operation specifics like clock management and data handling during read and write operations.
