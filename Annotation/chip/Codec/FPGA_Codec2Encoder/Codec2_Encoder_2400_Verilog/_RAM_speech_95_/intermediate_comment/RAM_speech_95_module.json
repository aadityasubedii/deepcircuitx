    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_95 module implements a single-port RAM optimized for speech applications using the Altera altsyncram component on Cyclone IV GX devices. It features an 8-bit address and 32-bit data buses for read/write operations controlled by rden and wren signals. The output data is obtained from an internal signal 'sub_wire0' which connects to the 32-bit output 'q'. The module is configured with specific parameters for optimized RAM behavior without initialization on power-up."
