It interfaces with the RAM via an 8-bit address bus and a 32-bit data bus. Operations such as read and write are controlled by input signals (`rden` for read enable and `wren` for write enable), and the output data is available on a 32-bit bus `q`. The module operates specifically with an intended device family \"Cyclone IV GX\" and contains several configuration settings such as no power-up initialization and no output data asynchronous reset to optimize its functionality for specific runtime conditions. The memory initialization file is set by \"RAM_speech_95.mif\", identifying the initial contents of the RAM."
