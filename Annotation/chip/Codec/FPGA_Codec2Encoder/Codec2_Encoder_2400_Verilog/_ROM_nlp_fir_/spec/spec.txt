Module name: ROM_nlp_fir. 
Module specification: The module ROM_nlp_fir serves as a read-only memory (ROM) containing predefined coefficient values specifically designed for a finite impulse response (FIR) filter applied in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It accepts a 6-bit address input, `addr`, to select one of the 48 available 80-bit coefficients stored within the ROM-like structure. The selected coefficient is then output through the `dataout` port, which is an 80-bit output signal. The module incorporates an internal signal `nlp_fir`, defined as a register array of 48 elements, each 80 bits wide, for storing these coefficients. In the Verilog code, the `always@(*)` block is used to assign the value from the `nlp_fir` array corresponding to the address specified by `addr` to the `dataout` output. This block essentially represents the data-fetch mechanism of the ROM, translating the input address into the associated output data, crucial for supporting subsequent DSP operations in NLP.
