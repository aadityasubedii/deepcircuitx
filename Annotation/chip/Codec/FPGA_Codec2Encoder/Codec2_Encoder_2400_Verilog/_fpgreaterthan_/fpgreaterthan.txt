Module-level comment: The 'fpgreaterthan' module compares two N-bit fixed-point numbers 'a' and 'b', determining if 'a' is greater than 'b'. It utilizes an always block to check conditions based on sign and magnitude, setting the output 'c' via the internal register 'res'. The output 'c' is '1' if 'a' is greater, and '0' otherwise, ensuring accurate sign-based comparison.
