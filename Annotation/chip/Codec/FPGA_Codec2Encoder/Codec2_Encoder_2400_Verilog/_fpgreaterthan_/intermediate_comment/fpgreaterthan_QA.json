The module outputs a binary signal 'c' which is '1' if 'a' is greater than 'b', and '0' otherwise. The comparison takes into account the sign of the numbers, given that the most significant bit (MSB) represents the sign bit. If both numbers are equal, the output is '0'. For numbers with the same sign, the module compares the absolute values. For numbers with different signs, the module decides based on the sign bit only, assuming the positive number always to be greater."
