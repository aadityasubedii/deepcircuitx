Module name: fpgreaterthan. Module specification: The 'fpgreaterthan' module is designed to compare two fixed-point binary numbers and output if the first number (input 'a') is greater than the second number (input 'b'). The comparison considers the sign bit as the most significant bit (MSB). The inputs 'a' and 'b' are both N-bit fixed-point binary numbers, where the MSB is the sign bit. The output 'c' is a single bit that indicates the result of the comparison; it is '1' if 'a' is greater than 'b', and '0' otherwise. The internal signal 'res' is a register used to store the intermediate comparison result, which is then assigned to the output 'c'. The Verilog code includes an always block triggered by changes in 'a' or 'b'. Within this block, multiple conditions are checked: if both numbers are equal, if they have the same sign, and if their signs are different, with appropriate logic to handle each scenario. The code employs if-else statements to systematically handle comparisons, taking into account both the values and signs of the inputs to determine the final output.
