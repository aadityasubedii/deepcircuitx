Module-level comment: The RAM_Sw_imag module simulates a single-port RAM using an altsyncram component optimized for Altera's Cyclone IV E FPGA devices. It supports synchronous data transactions based on a 9-bit address and 32-bit data inputs through read (rden) and write (wren) enable signals. The module effectively maps input data and control states to outputs using internal wiring and altsyncram parameters detailing operation modes, memory size, and data handling preferences.
