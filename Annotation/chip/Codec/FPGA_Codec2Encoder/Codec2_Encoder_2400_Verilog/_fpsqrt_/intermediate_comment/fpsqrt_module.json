    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'fpsqrt' module computes the square root of a 32-bit floating-point number using an iterative algorithm managed by a finite state machine (FSM). It accepts inputs like a start signal, clock, reset, and the number 'x'. Outputs include the result 'sqrt' and a completion signal 'donesqrt'. Internal operations utilize adders and dividers for calculation updates, controlled through state transitions which include initialization, iterative computations, and completion signaling, synchronized by the clock."
