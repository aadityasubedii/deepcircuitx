This is achieved through an iterative algorithm implemented within a finite state machine (FSM). The FSM manages the different states of the calculation using a state register \"STATE\" and transitions based on certain conditions. The core calculation essentially involves division and addition in a loop until a satisfactory approximation of the square root is found or a certain number of iterations ('i') is exceeded. The result is stored in the output 'sqrt', and a signal 'donesqrt' indicates the completion of the operation. The module handles asynchronous reset and synchronous operation with respect to the provided clock signal 'clk'."

It is used to synchronize the operations of the module, ensuring that the state transitions and calculations are performed in sync with the rising edge of the clock signal.\n- rst: This is the reset signal input.
