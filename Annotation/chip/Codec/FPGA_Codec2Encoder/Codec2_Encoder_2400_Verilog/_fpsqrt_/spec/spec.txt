Module name: fpsqrt. Module specification: The 'fpsqrt' module is designed to perform floating-point square root calculation on a 32-bit input number 'x' using an iterative approach managed by a finite state machine (FSM). The input ports include 'startsqrt', a control signal that initiates the square root process; 'clk', a clock signal that synchronizes the module's operations; 'rst', a reset signal that asynchronously resets the module; and 'x', the 32-bit number for which the square root is to be computed. The outputs are 'sqrt', which holds the calculated square root result, and 'donesqrt', a control signal indicating the completion of the calculation. Internally, the module uses several signals: 'STATE' and 'NEXT_STATE' for managing FSM states, 'a1_in1', 'a1_in2', 'd1_in1', 'd1_in2' for holding operational inputs for addition and division, 'guess' which is the approximation of the root, 'i' a counter for iterations, and 'a1_out', 'd1_out' for the results from addition and division operations. The Verilog code also includes instantiation for an adder and a divider block, which perform respective arithmetic operations as required by the algorithm. The FSM through various states, from initialization, performing calculations, updating the guess, and incrementing iteration count, to completing the operation and signaling readiness for another operation. This structured approach intertwines the control flow with computational logic efficiently to achieve the desired square root computation.
