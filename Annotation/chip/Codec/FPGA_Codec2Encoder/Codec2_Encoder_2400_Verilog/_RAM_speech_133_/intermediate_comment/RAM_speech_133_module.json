    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_133 module implements a single-port RAM on a Cyclone IV GX FPGA, using an `altsyncram` component. It handles memory operations via an 8-bit address, 32-bit data, read and write controls, and a clock. The internal wire `sub_wire0` transfers the data between the `altsyncram_component` and the output `q`. Parameters enforce specific behavior like the memory size, read/write methodologies ensuring optimized data transactions synchronized by the clock."
