    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_93. \n\nModule specification: RAM_speech_93 is a single-port RAM module optimized for Intel's Cyclone IV GX FPGA family, utilizing the `altsyncram` component for memory operations. This module allows users to perform read and write operations based on an 8-bit address input. It features a set of input ports: `address` (8-bit) to specify memory location; `clock` (1-bit) to synchronize operations to this clock's rising edge; `data` (32-bit) representing data to be written into the RAM; `rden` (1-bit) to enable reading from the RAM; and `wren` (1-bit) to enable writing into the RAM. The single output port, `q` (32-bit), holds the data read from the specified memory address. Internally, the module uses an intermediary wire `sub_wire0` to transfer data from the `altsyncram` component output to the `q` port. The `altsyncram` block in the code is responsible for the primary memory functionality and is parameterized for operation optimally within the specified device family. It is configured with initial RAM contents from a memory initialization file \"RAM_speech_93.mif,\" supporting a configuration that bypasses clock synchronization for inputs and outputs for performance efficiency.",
