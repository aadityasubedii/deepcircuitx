    "module": "Module-level comment: RAM_speech_93 is a single-port RAM designed for Cyclone IV GX FPGAs, utilizing the `altsyncram` component for memory operations. It supports 8-bit addressing with 32-bit data inputs/outputs, synchronized to a clock signal. Operations include controlled read and write functionalities using `rden` and `wren` signals. Data flow between the internal `altsyncram` output and the module\u2019s output port `q` is managed through the `sub_wire0` internal signal, facilitating efficient data handling and access. Configuration is initialized from \"RAM_speech_93.mif\"."
