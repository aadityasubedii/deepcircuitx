    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_51 module implements a single-port RAM using Altera's `altsyncram` component, optimized for speech processing data management. It includes an 8-bit address input, a clock signal, and 32-bit data input, with read and write enable controls, outputting the fetched data. The `sub_wire0` connects the component's output to the RAM's output port, facilitated by specific parameter configurations for operational and memory settings."
