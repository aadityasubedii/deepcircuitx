Module-level comment: This module implements a Non-Linear Processor (NLP) for pitch detection in speech/audio signals. It uses a state machine to control operations including filtering, FFT, and post-processing. The module takes input signals, applies notch filtering, FIR filtering, and FFT, then performs post-processing to detect the fundamental frequency (pitch). It utilizes memory components for data storage and retrieval during processing stages.
