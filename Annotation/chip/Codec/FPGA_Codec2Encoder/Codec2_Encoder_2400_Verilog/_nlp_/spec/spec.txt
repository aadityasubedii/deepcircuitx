Module name: nlp. Module specification: The nlp module implements a Non-Linear Processor for pitch detection in speech or audio signals. It takes inputs such as startnlp, clk, rst, out_sn, out_sq, out_mem_fir, nlp_mem_x, nlp_mem_y, and prev_f0, and produces outputs including best_f0, out_prev_f0, pitch, nlp_mem_x_out, nlp_mem_y_out, and various control signals. The module uses a state machine to control its operations, which include filtering, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and post-processing. Internal signals like STATE, NEXT_STATE, i, j, m1_in1, m1_in2, a1_in1, a1_in2, notch, mem_x, mem_y, an
