Module name: fpdiv1. Module specification: The `fpdiv1` module is designed for dividing two N-bit fixed-point numbers, `a` (dividend) and `b` (divisor). It outputs an N-bit fixed-point quotient `c` which includes a sign bit reflecting the correct sign based on the comparison of input signs. In terms of ports, `a` and `b` are input ports receiving the two numbers for division, whereas `c` is the output port delivering the division result. Internally, the module uses a register `res` to temporarily store the result of the division operation. The core of the module's functionality lies in its always block, where it performs the division ignoring the sign of the inputs and shifts the intermediate values to ensure precision. The most significant bit (MSB) of `res` is then explicitly set based on whether the signs of `a` and `b` are matching or not, ensuring that `c` outputs a number with the correct sign. The code uses shift operations to align the significant bits properly during the division, crucial for maintaining accuracy in fixed-point arithmetic.
