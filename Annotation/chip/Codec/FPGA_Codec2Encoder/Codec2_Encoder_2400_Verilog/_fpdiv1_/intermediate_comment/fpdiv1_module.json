    "module": "Module-level comment: The `fpdiv1` module performs division of two N-bit fixed-point numbers, generating a quotient with an appropriately set sign bit. It handles inputs `a` (dividend) and `b` (divisor) to generate output `c` (quotient). Internally, it shifts and divides absolute values of `a` and `b`, adjusts the sign of the result `res` based on their original signs, and assigns this value to `c`. This process ensures the correct sign and precision of the fixed-point result."
