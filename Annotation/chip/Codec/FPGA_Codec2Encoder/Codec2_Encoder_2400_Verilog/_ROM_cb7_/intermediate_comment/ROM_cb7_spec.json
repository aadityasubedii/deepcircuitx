    "spec": "Module name: ROM_cb7. Module specification: The ROM_cb7 is a Verilog module designed to simulate a small static read-only memory (ROM) that stores and retrieves predefined 32-bit data values. The ROM utilizes a 4-bit address input port `addr` to select one of the eight possible data values from a memory array. Upon receiving a specific address value at `addr`, the module outputs the corresponding 32-bit data through the `dataout` output port. Internally, the module contains a register array `cb7`, which stores the fixed 32-bit binary values. This array is accessed based on the address provided to retrieve data efficiently. The module's primary functional block, managed by an `always@(*)` block, initializes the `cb7` array with specific binary values and maps the `addr` to the associated data, setting `dataout` accordingly. This implementation reflects a straightforward yet efficient approach to handling fixed data retrieval through a predefined addressable memory space.",
