It uses a 4-bit address input (`addr`) to retrieve a corresponding 32-bit value from an internally defined memory block (`cb7`) and outputs this value through the `dataout` output port. Each address between 0 to 7 specifies a unique 32-bit value, simulating the behavior of a small static ROM configuration."

Depending on the binary value provided to `addr`, a corresponding data value is accessed and sent to the output.\n\nOutput ports: dataout.\nExplanation: The `dataout` output port is a 32-bit signal that outputs the data stored at the memory location specified by the `addr` input. When a particular address is provided, the module reads the corresponding 32-bit data from the `cb7` memory array and outputs it through `dataout`. This facilitates the retrieval of specific binary configurations stored within the module."

This register array functions as the storage for predefined binary values, serving as the memory for the ROM structure. Each index of the array (`cb7[0]` to `cb7[7]`) holds a specific 32-bit binary value. During the execution of the module, the content at an index specified by the `addr` input is transferred to the `dataout` output register, effectively fetching the required data corresponding to the input address. This implementation forms the backbone of the ROM's operational logic, facilitating the storage and retrieval of fixed binary data configurations."
