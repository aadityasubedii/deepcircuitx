    "module": "Module-level comment: The ROM_cb7 module emulates a small static read-only memory (ROM), storing and retrieving 32-bit values based on a 4-bit address. It uses an internal register array `cb7` pre-initialized with binary values. The module, in its always block, maps the input `addr` to extract and output the corresponding data through `dataout`, achieving efficient and direct data access from predefined addresses."
