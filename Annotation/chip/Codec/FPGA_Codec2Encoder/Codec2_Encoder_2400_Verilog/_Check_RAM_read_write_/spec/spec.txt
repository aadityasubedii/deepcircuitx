Module name: Check_RAM_read_write. 

Module specification: The "Check_RAM_read_write" module is responsible for handling read and write operations to and from two specific RAMs during a single frame operation, as triggered by the `start_oneframe` input signal. The module operates under the control of a finite state machine (FSM), involving various states to manage these operations. Input ports include `start_oneframe`, a control signal to initiate operations; `clk`, a clock signal to synchronize activities; and `rst`, a reset signal for initializing the system to its start state. Output ports comprise `check_sn_data`, which outputs data read from `RAM_c2_sn_test_nlp` for verification, and `done_oneframe`, a flag signal indicating the completion of operations within a frame. Internally, the module uses several signals such as `addr_speech` and `addr_sn` for addressing in the RAMs, `out_speech`, `read_c2_sn_out` for data handling, `re_c2_sn`, `we_c2_sn` for read and write enables, and `sn_data` as a buffer for data modifications. State-specific behaviors manipulate these signals to perform read and modify operations on the speech data from `RAM_speech_0`, followed by writing adjusted data to `RAM_c2_sn_test_nlp`. The code structure is segmented into blocks handling state transitions, operational logic for each state, and output signal handling based on the active state within the FSM, guiding the module through a sequence from initialization to data handling to completion within one frame.
