Module-level comment: The "Check_RAM_read_write" module orchestrates read and write operations to 'RAM_speech_0' and 'RAM_c2_sn_test_nlp' during a single frame, triggered by `start_oneframe`. Utilizing a finite state machine (FSM), it manages sequential data access and processing. Key internal signals like `addr_speech`, `we_c2_sn`, and `sn_data` facilitate addressing and data transfers. Outputs `check_sn_data` and `done_oneframe` signal data integrity and operation completion, respectively.
