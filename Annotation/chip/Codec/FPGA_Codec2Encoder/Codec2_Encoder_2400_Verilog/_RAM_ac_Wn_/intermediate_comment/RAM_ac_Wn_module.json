    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_ac_Wn module interfaces with single-port synchronous RAM using Altera's Cyclone IV E FPGA family. It supports read (rden) and write (wren) operations synchronized by a clock. Data is managed via a 32-bit address and data inputs, with output through port 'q'. Internal signal sub_wire0 connects the altsyncram component's output to 'q', ensuring stable data flow. Configurations are set via defparam for optimal memory performance."
