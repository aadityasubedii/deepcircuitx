Module-level comment: This module implements a Model-Based Estimator (MBE) for voice activity detection in speech analysis. It processes input signals through multiple stages, including FFT calculations, energy ratio computations, and SNR estimation. The module uses a finite state machine to control the processing flow, performing operations such as amplitude analysis, spectral weight calculations, and voicing decision based on various thresholds. It outputs a voicing decision and SNR for each processed audio frame.
