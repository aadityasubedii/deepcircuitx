Module name: estimate_voicing_mbe. Module specification: This module implements a Model-Based Estimator (MBE) for voice activity detection in speech analysis. It processes input signals to determine whether a given audio frame is voiced or unvoiced. The module takes inputs including startevmbe (start signal), clk (clock), rst (reset), L_in (10-bit model order), Wo_in (32-bit fundamental frequency), out_am (32-bit amplitude), and out_sw_real/imag (32-bit spectral weights). It outputs snr (32-bit signal-to-noise ratio), voiced (1-bit voicing decision), addr_am/sw_real/imag (10-bit memory addresses), and doneevmbe (completion signal). Internally, it uses numerous signals for calculations and control, such as STATE and NEXT_STATE for FSM control,
