    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_c2_sn module implements a single-port RAM for Cyclone IV E FPGA, using an `altsyncram` component. It supports 9-bit addressing for 512 locations and 32-bit data operations with read and write capabilities synchronized by a clock signal. Control is managed through `rden` and `wren` signals, with internal connections (`sub_wire0`) facilitating data routing between the altsyncram output and the module output `q`. The functionality is encapsulated within the altsyncram component with specific settings for operation mode and device compatibility."
