Module-level comment: The "fpdiv" module performs floating-point division on N-bit inputs 'a' and 'b', outputting the result in 'c'. It scales inputs by 256 for precision, then adjusts the output's MSB based on the sign of the inputs. The division and sign handling are managed inside an always block, ensuring accurate and sign-aware output calculations.
