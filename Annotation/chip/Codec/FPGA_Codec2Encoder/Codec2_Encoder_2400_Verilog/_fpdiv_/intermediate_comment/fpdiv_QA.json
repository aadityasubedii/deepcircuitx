The computation scales both input numbers by a factor of 256 (left shifts by 8 bits) before division to retain precision, and then scales the division result back. The most significant bit (MSB) of the result 'res' is set based on the sign of the inputs: it is set to 0 if both inputs have the same sign (indicating a positive result) and to 1 if the signs differ (indicating a negative result)."
