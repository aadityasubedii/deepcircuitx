    "spec": "Module name: fpdiv. Module specification: The \"fpdiv\" module in Verilog is designed for performing floating-point division on two input numbers, 'a' and 'b', outputting the result in 'c'. The inputs and output are N-bit wide, with N being a parameter that can be set for different bit-widths as required. Specifically, the module scales the input values 'a' and 'b' by a factor of 256 (left shifts by 8 bits) to preserve precision during the division process, and then scales the division result back. The internal signal 'res' is crucial as it temporarily holds the division results and manages the most significant bit (MSB). The MSB of 'res' is set based on the sign comparison of the inputs; it is set to '0' if both inputs share the same sign, indicating a positive result, and set to '1' if the signs differ, indicating a negative result. The assignment of 'res' to the output port 'c' and sign management are handled within an 'always' block, which responds to any changes in inputs 'a' and 'b'. This module facilitates precise and sign-aware floating-point division in digital circuits.",
