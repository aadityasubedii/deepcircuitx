Module-level comment: This module implements a CODEC2 single-frame encoder, processing speech samples through analysis, parameter extraction, and compression. It operates in stages: analyzing two frame parts, converting speech to LSP coefficients, encoding model parameters, and quantizing LSP values. The module uses sub-modules for specific tasks and employs a state machine to control the encoding process, ultimately producing a 48-bit encoded frame representation including voicing, energy, and quantized LSP coefficients.
