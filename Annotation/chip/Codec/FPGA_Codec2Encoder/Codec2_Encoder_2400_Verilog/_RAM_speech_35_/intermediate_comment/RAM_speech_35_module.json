    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"RAM_speech_35\" module implements a single-port RAM using Altera's `altsyncram` designed for a Cyclone IV GX device, configured via \"RAM_speech_35.mif\". With inputs like `address`, `clock`, `data`, `rden`, and `wren`, it performs synchronized read/write operations. The output `q` delivers 32-bit data read based on the address input. Internal `sub_wire0` facilitates data transfer within the module. Parameters define the memory size, width, and operational mode."
