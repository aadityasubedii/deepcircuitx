    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_48 module is designed for speech data handling using a single-port RAM interface. It manages data storage and retrieval operations through an `altsyncram` instantiation, configured with parameters including an initialization file, operation mode, and device-specific settings. Input signals control read/write actions, while the internal wire `sub_wire0` facilitates data transfer to the output. This setup ensures efficient data processing in speech-related applications."
