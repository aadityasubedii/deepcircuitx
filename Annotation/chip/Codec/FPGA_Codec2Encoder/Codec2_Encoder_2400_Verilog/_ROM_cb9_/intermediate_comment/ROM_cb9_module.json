    "module": "Module-level comment: The ROM_cb9 module is a Read-Only Memory designed with a 4-bit address input ('addr') and a 32-bit data output ('dataout'). It utilizes an internal 32-bit array 'cb9' with 4 predefined values. On receiving an address, the module outputs the corresponding value from 'cb9' to 'dataout', implementing basic ROM functionality where data is selected and output based on the provided address index."
