Module name: ROM_cb9. Module specification: The ROM_cb9 module serves as a Read-Only Memory (ROM) that outputs a predefined 32-bit data value based on a 4-bit address input. The module has a single input port 'addr', which is a 4-bit signal used to select one of the stored values from the internal memory array. The output port 'dataout' is a 32-bit register that displays the data selected by the 'addr' input. Internally, the module utilizes a register array 'cb9' consisting of four 32-bit elements that store the predefined values. The elements of this array are set to specified 32-bit binary values within an always block that triggers on any change of the inputs. This always block assigns the value from one of the 'cb9' array positions, indexed by 'addr', to the 'dataout' port, facilitating the ROM's functionality of outputting data based on the given address. This setup effectively simulates a basic ROM behavior where the address input selects and outputs corresponding stored data values.
