Module name: RAM_Sw_in_imag. Module specification: The RAM_Sw_in_imag module is a single-port RAM specifically designed to operate on Cyclone IV E FPGA devices, utilizing the `altsyncram` component for memory read and write operations. The module features input ports that include an address (`address`) which is a 9-bit input specifying the memory address, a synchronization clock signal (`clock`), a 32-bit data input (`data`) for writing into the RAM, and control signals for reading (`rden`) and writing (`wren`) operations. The output port `q` outputs 32-bit data from the specified memory location when reading is enabled. An internal signal, `sub_wire0`, serves as a 32-bit intermediary connection, holding the output data from the `altsyncram` component before passing it to the output port `q`. The Verilog code defines the instantiation and parameters for the `altsyncram` component, setting up its operational mode, memory size, and data paths, matching the specifications needed for the target FPGA family, ensuring optimized performance for read and write operations without extra configuration at runtime. This setup supports the straightforward utilization of RAM in FPGA-based applications requiring efficient and rapid memory storage and retrieval controlled directly via simple input signals.
