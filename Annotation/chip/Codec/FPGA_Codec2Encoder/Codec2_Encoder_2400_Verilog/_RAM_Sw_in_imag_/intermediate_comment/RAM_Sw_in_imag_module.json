    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_Sw_in_imag module is a single-port RAM for Cyclone IV E FPGA devices, handling memory operations through synchronized read/write signals. Utilizing the `altsyncram` component, it supports 512 words of 32-bit width with input ports for address, data, and control signals (rden, wren), and an output port `q`. This structure enables efficient memory access for FPGA-based systems, driven by a simple interface and internal wiring (`sub_wire0`) to transfer data outputs effectively."
