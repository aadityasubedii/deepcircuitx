Module-level comment: The `fp_log10` module calculates the base-10 logarithm of a fixed-point input `in_x`. Utilizing a state machine, this module handles input through a start signal `startlog`, processes the computation, and outputs the result in `out_y` along with a completion signal `donelog`. Internal computation employs shifting, comparison, and arithmetic operations, transitioning between states based on the control logic to progressively derive the logarithmic value.
