    "spec": "Module name: fp_log10. Module specification: The `fp_log10` module is designed to compute the base-10 logarithm of a fixed-point input number, utilizing a state machine driven by a clock signal. Inputs include `startlog` to initiate the computation, `clk` for clock pulses, `rst` for resetting the state machine, and `in_x` as the fixed-point number whose logarithm is to be calculated. Outputs include `out_y`, the calculated logarithmic value, and `donelog` which signals the completion of the computation. Internal signals such as `STATE` and `NEXT_STATE` control the state machine transitions, while `x`, `y`, and `b` are used for intermediate computations. Various comparator and arithmetic modules like `fplessthan`, `fpgreaterthan`, `qadd`, and `qmult` contribute to the conditions and operations necessary within the state transitions. Key states in the module handle initialization, iterative processing loops, conditional checks, and setting final output after calculations. The state machine ensures that the module handles different computational scenarios based on comparisons and controlled adjustments of values during the logarithm calculations, effectively moving through stages of setup, processing, and completion notification.",

                    "text": "Module name: fp_log10. Module specification: The `fp_log10` module is designed to compute the base-10 logarithm of a fixed-point input number, utilizing a state machine driven by a clock signal. Inputs include `startlog` to initiate the computation, `clk` for clock pulses, `rst` for resetting the state machine, and `in_x` as the fixed-point number whose logarithm is to be calculated. Outputs include `out_y`, the calculated logarithmic value, and `donelog` which signals the completion of the computation. Internal signals such as `STATE` and `NEXT_STATE` control the state machine transitions, while `x`, `y`, and `b` are used for intermediate computations. Various comparator and arithmetic modules like `fplessthan`, `fpgreaterthan`, `qadd`, and `qmult` contribute to the conditions and operations necessary within the state transitions. Key states in the module handle initialization, iterative processing loops, conditional checks, and setting final output after calculations. The state machine ensures that the module handles different computational scenarios based on comparisons and controlled adjustments of values during the logarithm calculations, effectively moving through stages of setup, processing, and completion notification."
