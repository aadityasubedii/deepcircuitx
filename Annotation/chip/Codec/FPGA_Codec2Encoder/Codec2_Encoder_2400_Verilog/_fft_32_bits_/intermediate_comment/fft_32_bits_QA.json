The module processes complex input data (real and imaginary parts) using cosine and sine lookup tables to compute the FFT. The process is controlled by a state machine that progresses through initialization, computation, and final output stages. The inputs to the module include start signals, clock signals, and reset signals, while it provides outputs such as the FFT result (real and imaginary), a 'done' signal indicating completion, and a clock count used for monitoring or diagnostic purposes. The state machine handles various tasks such as bit-reversal entries, multiplication and addition of FFT data points, data addressing, and incremental adjustments, culminating in delivering the transformed data upon completion."

It acts as the initial control input to begin the FFT operation cycle.\n- **clk**: This is the clock signal input. It synchronizes the internal operations of the FFT module, ensuring that the data processing and state transitions occur at controlled time intervals.\n- **rst**: This is the reset signal input, active low. When set low, it resets the internal state of the module, typically bringing it back to an initial state or standby mode.\n\nOutput ports: donefft, out_real, out_imag, clk_count_fft.\nExplanation:\n- **donefft**: This is an output signal that indicates the completion of the FFT process. When high, it signifies that the FFT results are available on the output ports `out_real` and `out_imag`.\n- **out_real**: This is the real part of the FFT output. It holds the real component of the computed FFT, representing half of the overall transformed data.\n- **out_imag**: This is the imaginary part of the FFT output. It holds the imaginary component of the FFT result, completing the complex number representation of the transformed data.\n- **clk_count_fft**: This is a diagnostic or monitoring output that indicates the number of clock cycles used since the start of the FFT operation or since the last reset.
