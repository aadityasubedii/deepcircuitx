    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'fft_32_bits' module performs a 32-bit Fast Fourier Transform, crucial for converting time-domain signals to frequency-domain. It starts processing with signals 'startfft', 'clk', and 'rst'. The FFT process is managed by a state machine coordinating various computational states, using arithmetic modules like multipliers and adders, alongside memory blocks for data handling. Outputs include the real and imaginary components of the FFT, the completion signal, and clock cycle count, encapsulating its DSP capabilities efficiently."
