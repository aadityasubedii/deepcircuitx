Module name: fft_32_bits. Module specification: The 'fft_32_bits' module performs a 32-bit Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) ideal for digital signal processing, particularly for converting time-domain data into frequency-domain data. It accepts three primary inputs: `startfft`, a start signal that initiates the FFT computation; `clk`, a clock signal that regulates the timing of data processing and state transitions; and `rst`, an active-low reset signal that sets the module to a predefined initial state. The outputs include `donefft`, indicating completion of the FFT process; `out_real` and `out_imag`, representing the real and imaginary components of the FFT result respectively; and `clk_count_fft`, a diagnostic output reflecting the number of clock cycles consumed during the operation.

Internally, the module utilizes multiple signals for state management (`STATE`, `NEXT_STATE`), loop indices (`i`, `j`, `k`, `i1`), computation parameters (`size`, `halfsize`, `tablestep`), and data storage and manipulation (`temp_real`, `temp_imag`). It employs additional signals for addressing and interfacing with data (`addr_sin`, `addr_cos`, `addr_fft_imag`, `addr_fft_real`, `addr_func_fft_imag`, `addr_func_fft_real`) and for reading from or writing to modules (`rden`, `wren`).

The code structure is segmented into various blocks primarily managed by a finite state machine (FSM). The major sections include initialization, data loading, computation states where FFT is actually performed using butterfly and twiddle factor calculations, and a final stage where the results are outputted. Key components such as multipliers (`qmult`) and adders (`qadd`) are instantiated for performing complex arithmetic required by the FFT algorithm. Memory modules (`RAM_sin_256`, `RAM_cos_256`, and others for real and imaginary components of FFT) are used for storing intermediate calculations and sine-cosine values necessary for FFT computations.
