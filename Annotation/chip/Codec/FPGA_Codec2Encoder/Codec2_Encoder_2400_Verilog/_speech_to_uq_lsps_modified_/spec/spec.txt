Module name: speech_to_uq_lsps_modified. Module specification: This module implements a speech processing pipeline that converts speech input to Line Spectral Pairs (LSPs). It takes inputs startspeech, clk, rst, and out_sn (32-bit speech samples), and outputs E (energy), lsp0 to lsp9 (LSP coefficients), addr_sn (speech sample address), and donespeech (processing completion signal). The module utilizes various internal signals and state machines to control the processing flow. Key internal components include counters, accumulators, and registers for storing intermediate results. The module's functionality is divided into several main blocks: initialization, windowing and energy calculation, autocorrelation, Levinson-Durbin algorithm implementation, LPC coefficient calculation, and LPC to LSP conversion. The process involves reading speech samples, applying windowing, performing autoc
