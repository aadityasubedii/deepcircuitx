Module-level comment: 

/**
 * This module converts speech input to Line Spectral Pairs (LSPs).
 * It implements a pipeline including windowing, autocorrelation,
 * Levinson-Durbin algorithm, and LPC to LSP conversion.
 * The process involves reading speech samples, applying windowing,
 * calculating autocorrelation coefficients, deriving LPC coefficients,
 * and finally converting them to LSPs. The module uses a state machine
 * to control the processing flow and various computational units for
 * arithmetic operations.
