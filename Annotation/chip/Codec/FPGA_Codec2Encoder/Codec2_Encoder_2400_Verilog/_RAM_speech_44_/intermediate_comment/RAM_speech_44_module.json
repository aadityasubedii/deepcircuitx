    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_44 is a single-port RAM module in Verilog, leveraging the Altera's altsyncram component for the Cyclone IV GX FPGA. It interfaces with 8-bit address and 32-bit data ports, controlled by clock, read enable (rden), and write enable (wren) signals. Internally, it uses sub_wire0 to transfer data from the altsyncram component to the output 'q', facilitating synchronous read/write operations."
