Module name: encode_WoE. Module specification: The encode_WoE module implements an encoding algorithm, likely for data compression or transformation in a machine learning context. It takes inputs including startewoe (start signal), clk (clock), rst (reset), model_wo (model weight), in_e (input value), xq0 and xq1 (quantized inputs). Outputs are out_xq0 and out_xq1 (encoded outputs), out_n1 (nearest value index), and doneewoe (completion signal). The module uses internal signals such as STATE and NEXT_STATE for FSM control, w0 and w1 for computed weights, x0 and x1 for intermediate values, and various signals for arithmetic operations and sub-module control. The module is structured with several key blocks: a finite state machine for control flow, arithmetic units for fixed-point operations,
