    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_83 module implements a single-port RAM using Altera's `altsyncram` component targeting Cyclone IV GX FPGA. It preloads data from a MIF and allows 32-bit data access at specified 8-bit addresses, controlled by read (`rden`) and write (`wren`) enable signals. The module operates with synchronized read and write operations managed under a single clock and parameters configured through `defparam` for specific behavioral settings."
