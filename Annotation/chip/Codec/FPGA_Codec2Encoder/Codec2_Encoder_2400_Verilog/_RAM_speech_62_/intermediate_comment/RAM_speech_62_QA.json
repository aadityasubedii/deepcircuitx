It uses the 'altsyncram' component from the Altera library tailored for the Cyclone IV GX device family. The RAM allows data input and output operations based on an 8-bit address and supports 32-bit data widths. Operations such as read and write are controlled via the 'rden' (read enable) and 'wren' (write enable) signals, respectively. The RAM is initialized from a memory initialization file (\"RAM_speech_62.mif\"), ensuring specific data setup at start-up. The component's configuration prohibits runtime modifications and defines the behavior during write operations where old data is preserved if no new data is written."
