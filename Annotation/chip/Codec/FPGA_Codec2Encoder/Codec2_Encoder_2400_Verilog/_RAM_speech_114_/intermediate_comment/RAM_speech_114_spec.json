    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_114.\n\nModule specification: The RAM_speech_114 module is designed as a single-port RAM specifically for Altera FPGA devices using the altsyncram primitive with targeted application in the Cyclone IV GX family. This module maps an 8-bit address input to a 32-bit output data (q). It supports read and write operations controlled by the 'rden' (read enable) and 'wren' (write enable) signals. Inputs include: 'address' which selects the RAM location, 'clock' which synchronizes data operations, 'data' which is the input data for writing operations, 'rden' to read from the RAM, and 'wren' to write to the RAM. The output 'q' holds the data read from the RAM at the specified address. Internally, the module uses a signal named 'sub_wire0' as an intermediate connector which routes data from the altsyncram_component's output to the module\u2019s output port. In terms of code structure, the module incorporates the 'altsyncram' component to handle the low-level data storage and retrieval operations. This is configured to no output register clearing on address change and is initialized with the \"RAM_speech_114.mif\" file indicating a setup optimized for speech data storage. Additional configurations include settings related to clock and data handling reflecting optimizations for specific device capabilities and operational modes.",
