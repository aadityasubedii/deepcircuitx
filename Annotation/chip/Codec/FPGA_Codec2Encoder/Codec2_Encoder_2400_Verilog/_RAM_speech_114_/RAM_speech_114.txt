Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_114 is a single-port RAM for Altera FPGA, Cyclone IV GX, utilizing the 'altsyncram' primitive. It maps 8-bit addresses to 32-bit data outputs supporting both read ('rden') and write ('wren') operations. Data flow is managed with the internal 'sub_wire0', directing outputs from the altsyncram component to the output port 'q'. Configurations include initialization with "RAM_speech_114.mif" and optimized clock settings for speech data applications.
