The main tasks include initializing the division process, running the division, retrieving the result, and setting a done flag when complete. The module utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) with states START, START_DIV, RUN_DIV, GET_DIV, and DONE to manage the division process. Transition between states is managed by clock cycles and a reset signal, driving the main operations and setting outputs based on the current state."
