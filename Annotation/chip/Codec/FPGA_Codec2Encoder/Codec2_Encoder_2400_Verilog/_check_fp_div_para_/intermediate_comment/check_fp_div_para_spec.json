Module specification: The \"check_fp_div_para\" Verilog module orchestrates a floating-point division with the aid of a controlled sub-module named \"fpdiv_clk_parameter\". Utilizing a finite state machine (FSM) with five distinct states (START, START_DIV, RUN_DIV, GET_DIV, and DONE), this module manages the entire division process from initiation to completion. Inputs include `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `rst` (asynchronous reset to revert FSM to START state), `startcheck` (initiation signal for division process), and `in` (input data operand for division). Outputs consist of `donecheck` (indicates the completion of the division operation) and `ans` (outputs the calculated quotient). Internal signals encompass `STATE` (stores the current state of the FSM), `NEXT_STATE` (determines the forthcoming state), `startdiv` (a trigger to start division in the sub-module), and `div_in` (stores data to be divided). The code includes blocks handling clock-edge operations to transition states and execute conditional actions, and a combinational block to define state transitions based on current conditions. These operations ensure precise and reliable floating-point division management within a synchronous digital system.",
