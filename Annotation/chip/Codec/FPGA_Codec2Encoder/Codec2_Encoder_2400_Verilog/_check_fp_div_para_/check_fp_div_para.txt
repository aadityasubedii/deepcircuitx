Module-level comment: The "check_fp_div_para" module executes floating-point division using an FSM-driven approach. It controls the "fpdiv_clk_parameter" sub-module for division, using state transitions (START to DONE) to handle operations like initializing, running, and result retrieval based on clock and reset signals. Inputs manage control flow and operand data, while outputs indicate completion and present the division result.
