    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_125. \nModule specification: The RAM_speech_125 module is designed for use in a Cyclone IV GX FPGA, functioning as a single-port RAM utilizing the altsyncram component. The module is specified to handle 8-bit addresses and 32-bit data inputs using input ports: `address`, `clock`, `data`, `rden` (read enable), and `wren` (write enable). Respectively, these ports are used to specify the memory access location, provide the required timing for operations, data to be written into memory, enable memory reading, and enable memory writing. The module outputs data through a 32-bit `q` port, which delivers data content from the specified memory address when reading is enabled. Internally, a wire `sub_wire0` connects to the `altsyncram_component`\u2019s output and routes it to the output port `q`. This wire serves to buffer data before output.\n\nSections in the code include initial declarations of I/O ports and internal signals required for functionality. The primary operational block, `altsyncram_component`, configures the specifics of the RAM operation such as the addressing mode, memory initialization, data handling, and clock management based on specified parameters like `init_file` and `intended_device_family`. The component's parameters negating runtime modifications and setting proper modes for clock usage and read-during-write operations emphasize the robustness and reliability in data handling. Lastly, the module employs predefined settings (`defparam`) to fine-tune the behavior of the RAM such as specifying the operation mode, initial conditions, and response behaviors, ensuring accurate adherence to the design specifications required for its deployment within the designated FPGA environment.",

The module receives an 8-bit address and a 32-bit data input. It operates with signals for read enable (rden), write enable (wren), and a clock signal. The output (q) produces 32-bit data based on the read operation from the specified address.
