Module name: qmult.
Module specification: The 'qmult' module performs fixed-point multiplication of two input fixed-point numbers using Verilog. This multiplication discards the sign bit of the inputs and considers only the N-1 least significant bits. The module receives two inputs, named `i_multiplicand` and `i_multiplier`, each of which has a bit-width of N. The result of their multiplication is output through the `o_result` port, which also has a bit-width of N. Internally, the `qmult` module utilizes two significant registers: `r_result` and `r_RetVal`. The `r_result` register is a temporary, double bit-width (2*N) register that stores the full-precision product from the multiplication of the two input values' least significant bits (N-1). The `r_RetVal` register, which shares the same bit-width as the inputs and output, computes the final result. The sign of this result is determined by the XOR of the sign bits of the inputs and stored in `r_RetVal`'s most significant bit. The remaining bits of `r_RetVal` capture the appropriately Q-parameter adjusted portion of `r_result`. This module consists of two main always blocks: one calculates the product and stores it in `r_result`, and another determines the final output value stored in `r_RetVal`, ensuring proper sign and scale referencing the 'Q' parameter. The operations and flow within ‘qmult’ ensure that it generates a correctly scaled and signed product as per fixed-point arithmetic rules, suitable for varied applications requiring fixed-point operations.
