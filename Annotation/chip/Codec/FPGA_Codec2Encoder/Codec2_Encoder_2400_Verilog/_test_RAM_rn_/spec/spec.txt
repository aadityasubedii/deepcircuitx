Module name: test_RAM_rn. 
Module specification: The `test_RAM_rn` module is designed to manage RAM operations focused on autocorrelation functions within a digital system RAM named `RAM_autocorrelate_Rn`. It operates through a systematic state machine to handle the initial setting of RAM address, writing data, checking data, and maintaining a 'done' status. The input ports include `clk` (clock) for timing the operations in response to rising edge triggers, and `rst` (reset) for initializing the state machine to a starting state on a negative edge. There are no external output ports, but the module interacts with an integrated RAM using internal signals. Key internal signals include `STATE` and `NEXT_STATE` for managing state transitions; `rn_addr` for RAM addressing; `rn_clk`, a registered version of `clk`; `rn_write_data` for data to be written to RAM; and `ram_out` capturing data output from RAM for verification purposes. The Verilog code comprises blocks handling state transitions based on clock and reset conditions, state-specific operations including address setting and data writing, and overall module initialization.
