    "module": "Module-level comment: The `test_RAM_rn` module manages RAM processes for autocorrelation via a state machine, using `clk` and `rst` for timing and control. It cycles through states for setting RAM addresses, writing data, and verification. Internal signals like `rn_addr`, `rn_clk`, and `rn_write_data` direct operations synchronized to the clock, with no external outputs, interfacing with embedded RAM `RAM_autocorrelate_Rn`."
