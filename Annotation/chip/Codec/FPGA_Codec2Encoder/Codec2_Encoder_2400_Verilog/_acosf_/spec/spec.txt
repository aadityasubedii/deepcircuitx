Module name: acosf.
Module specification: The 'acosf' module is designed to compute the arc cosine (acos) of a given fixed-point input 'value'. This computation is fundamental for digital signal processing and similar applications requiring trigonometric operations. The module employs a variety of inputs: 'startacosf' to begin the computation, 'clk' (clock) for timing the sequential processes, 'rst' (reset) to initialize the system, and 'value' which is the fixed-point input between -1 and 1. The outputs include 'theta', the computed acos in a fixed-point format, and 'doneacosf', a flag that indicates the completion of the computation. Internally, the module utilizes signals like STATE and NEXT_STATE for managing the state machine's transitions, counters (i and j) for iterative computations, and various arithmetic operation inputs like 'a1_in1', 'a1_in2' for managing data within the arithmetic blocks such as adders and multipliers. The implementation includes multiple always blocks to manage state transitions, compute intermediate values, update the theta output, and indicate when the computation has finished. The module is structured to systematically iterate through computations using a state machine to handle various arithmetic and logical conditions, culminating in the acquisition of the arc cosine result.
