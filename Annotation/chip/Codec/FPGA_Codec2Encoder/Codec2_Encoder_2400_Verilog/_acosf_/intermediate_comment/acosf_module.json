    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'acosf' module computes the arc cosine of a fixed-point input 'value'. It utilizes a state machine guided by input clocks, resets, and a start signal to choreographically process through iterative computations and conditional checks. Outputs include the angle 'theta' and completion flag 'doneacosf'. Key internal components involve arithmetic units like adders and multipliers, alongside multiple always blocks for state transitions and calculations, ensuring accurate trigonometric results."
