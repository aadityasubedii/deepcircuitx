    "spec": "Module name: RAM_ak. Module specification: The RAM_ak module is a single-port RAM designed for the Cyclone IV E FPGA family, utilizing the `altsyncram` component for memory operations. This module manages reading and writing data to memory locations based on the input signals. It features input ports including a 4-bit `address` for specifying memory locations, a `clock` signal for timing synchronization, a 32-bit `data` input for write operations, and `rden` and `wren` signals to enable read and write operations respectively. The module provides a 32-bit output port `q`, which outputs the data from the specified memory address when a read operation is enabled. Internally, the module uses a signal `sub_wire0` as a 32-bit connection between the `altsyncram` output and the `q` output port, transferring the read data outside the module. The code includes an `altsyncram` component configured with parameters for memory size, data width, and operational behavior, specifically set to use a bypass option for the clock and to be initialized with a `.mif` file on power-up to avoid uninitialized states. Essential parameters like the device family, operation mode, and clock behavior are distinctly specified to optimize the module's functionality according to the system's requirements.",
