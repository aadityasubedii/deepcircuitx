    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_Sw_fft_imag module implements a single-port RAM for FFT operations on imaginary data, using the altsyncram component optimized for Intel Cyclone IV E FPGAs. It supports synchronized read/write operations based on control signals and a specified address, with data interfacing managed through `sub_wire0` for modular internal routing. Key RAM attributes are configured to fit specific hardware performance and integration requirements."
