Module name: RAM_Sw_fft_imag. 
Module specification: The RAM_Sw_fft_imag module is designed to implement a single-port RAM tailored for handling imaginary components in FFT operations, suitable for hardware implementation on Intel's Cyclone IV E FPGA using an `altsyncram` component. Functionally, the module synchronizes data request operations using input `clock`, and performs either read or write operations based on `rden` (read enable) and `wren` (write enable) control signals respectively, targeting memory locations specified by the `address`. The data to be written is supplied via the `data` input port during write operations, while the output data from a read operation is presented on the output port `q`. Internally, the module leverages the `sub_wire0` signal as an intermediate connecting wire between the `altsyncram` component's output and the module's `q` output port, ensuring modular and clear routing within the architecture. The Verilog implementation utilizes a configuration block for the `altsyncram` defining key parameters such as memory words, address width, and operational mode to maintain optimal functionality and integration with Cyclone IV E family devices. The code employs `defparam` directive to explicitly specify attributes related to the synthesizable RAM's behavior, including data handling during simultaneous read-write operations and initialization settings to best fit the intended device's capabilities.
