Module name: RAM_ac_Wn_48. Module specification: The RAM_ac_Wn_48 is a Verilog module designed for use with the Altera Cyclone IV E FPGA family, implementing a single-port RAM functionality utilizing the `altsyncram` component. This module's operation is synchronized by an input clock signal, managing data with a 48-bit width through 320 addressable words, mapped through a 9-bit address input. It supports read and write operations, enabled through specific 'rden' and 'wren' input signals. The input ports include 'address' for specifying the byte address, 'clock' for synchronizing operations, 'data' for input data to be written, and the control signals 'rden' and 'wren' which respectively enable reading from and writing to the memory. The sole output port 'q' delivers the data output, delivering data stored at the specified address upon read-enable activation. Internally, the module uses 'sub_wire0', a 48-bit wire that acts as an intermediate conduit, taking data from the `altsyncram` component's output and pushing it to the external 'q' output port. The `altsyncram_component` instantiation within the module is configured with several parameters tailored specifically to the FPGA family, such as enabling synchronous RAM operation, configuring the bypass of clock enables, and handling the read-during-write operations, indicating a well-defined and purpose-built memory management system.
