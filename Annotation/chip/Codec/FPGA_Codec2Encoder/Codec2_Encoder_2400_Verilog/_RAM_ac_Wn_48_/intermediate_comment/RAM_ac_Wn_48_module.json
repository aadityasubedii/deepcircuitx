    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_ac_Wn_48 module implements a single-port RAM tailored for Altera Cyclone IV E FPGAs, enabling synchronous data management with a 9-bit address and 48-bit data interface. It uses the `altsyncram` component, configured to handle synchronous reads/writes, manage input and output operations seamlessly, and address potential read-during-write scenarios without data corruption. Internal wiring and parameter settings reflect a design optimized for efficient and reliable memory access within specified FPGA constraints."
