Module name: RAM_speech_63. Module specification: The RAM_speech_63 is designed as a single-port RAM on an FPGA, specifically suitable for Altera (Intel) Cyclone IV GX devices, implementing storage and retrieval of 32-bit data with an 8-bit address bus. It supports operations at rising clock edges; data is written using the ‘wren’ signal and read using the ‘rden’ signal. Input ports include: `address` (8-bit for memory addressing), `clock` (synchronizing signal), `data` (32-bit, data to be written), `rden` (read enable signal), and `wren` (write enable signal). The sole output port, `q`, outputs the 32-bit data read from the specific memory address. The internal signal `sub_wire0` is used to transfer the output from the `altsyncram_component` to the module's output port `q`. The code encompasses configuration settings for the `altsyncram` component such as the initial setup from “RAM_speech_63.mif” file, designated device family, memory size, and operational modes, ensuring the RAM's functionality is optimized for specific applications without runtime modifications.
