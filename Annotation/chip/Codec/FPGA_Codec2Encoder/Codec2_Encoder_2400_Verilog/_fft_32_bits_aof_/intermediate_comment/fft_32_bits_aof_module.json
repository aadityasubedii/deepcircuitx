    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/*\nThis module performs a 32-bit Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using a state machine-based approach.\nIt reads input data, performs bit-reversal, and executes the FFT algorithm using multiple stages.\nThe module utilizes RAM for data storage, lookup tables for trigonometric functions, and dedicated\narithmetic units for complex multiplication and addition. The FFT computation is done in-place,\nwith results stored and retrieved from internal memory before final output.\n*/"
