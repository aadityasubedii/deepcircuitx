Module-level comment: 
/*
This module performs a 32-bit Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using a state machine-based approach.
It reads input data, performs bit-reversal, and executes the FFT algorithm using multiple stages.
The module utilizes RAM for data storage, lookup tables for trigonometric functions, and dedicated
arithmetic units for complex multiplication and addition. The FFT computation is done in-place,
with results stored and retrieved from internal memory before final output.
