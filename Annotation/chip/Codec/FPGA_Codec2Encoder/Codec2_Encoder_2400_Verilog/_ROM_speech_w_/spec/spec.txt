Module name: ROM_speech_w. Module specification: This module implements a Read-Only Memory (ROM) for speech data, containing 320 entries of 32-bit values representing a waveform pattern. It has a 10-bit input port 'addr' for addressing the ROM, and a 32-bit output port 'dataout' for retrieving the data. The internal signal 'w' is a 320-element array of 32-bit registers, storing the ROM contents. The module is structured with a parameter 'N' set to 32 for data width, and an always block that initializes the ROM contents and handles data retrieval. The waveform pattern stored in the ROM starts with zeros, gradually increases to a peak, and then decreases back to zero, likely representing a speech-related audio pattern. When an address is provided via the 'addr' input, the corresponding 32-bit value
