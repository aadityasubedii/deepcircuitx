Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements a 320-entry, 32-bit Read-Only Memory (ROM) for speech data.
It uses a 10-bit address input to access a waveform pattern stored in an internal
array. The pattern represents a speech-related audio curve, starting from zero,
increasing to a peak, and decreasing back to zero. The module outputs the 32-bit
value corresponding to the input address, facilitating speech data retrieval for
audio processing applications.
