Module-level comment: The `encode_lsp_scalar_index` module processes linear spectral pairs (LSPs) for scalar quantization in speech coding. It converts LSPs from radians to Hertz using the `qmult` module for fixed-point multiplication, and selects the optimal quantization index for each LSP through the `quantise` module within a finite state machine that handles sequencing. It uses multiple FSM states to organize the conversion, quantization, and output index determination, handling inputs and outputs efficiently for real-time processing requirements.
