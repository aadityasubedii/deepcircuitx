Module name: encode_lsp_scalar_index. 

Module specification: The encode_lsp_scalar_index module is designed for processing linear spectral pairs (LSPs) and determining appropriate scalar quantization indices for speech coding systems. Its primary functionality is to convert input LSP values from radians to Hz, through a fixed-point multiplication, and quantize them to determine the best fitting scalar quantization index for each LSP. These indices are essential in telecommunications and audio processing for efficient and precise speech encoding. The module has several input ports including `start_elsp` to initiate the encoding process, `clk` for clock signal, `rst` for the asynchronous reset, `index` to possibly select output LSP indices, and ten `in_lsp` signals (`in_lsp0` to `in_lsp9`) for receiving the LSP values. The outputs are `done_elsp`, which indicates the completion of encoding, and `out_index`, a 4-bit output representing the quantization index. Internally, the module uses signals like `lsp_hz0` to `lsp_hz9` for storing LSP values in Hz, and `besti0` to `besti9` for holding the best indices during processing. The FSM (Finite State Machine) control logic, with states such as `START`, `INITVALUES`, and `CALC_LSPHZ`, orchestrates the operations like initializing parameters, quantizing LSPs, and recording the best indices. Specialized operations for converting LSP values and quantization are handled by instantiated modules `qmult` for multiplication and `quantise` for determining the best indices.
