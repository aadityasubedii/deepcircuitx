    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_32 is a single-port RAM specifically designed for speech data storage and retrieval on Cyclone IV GX FPGAs. It integrates an `altsyncram` module for memory operations, controlled via 8-bit address, 32-bit data inputs, and synchronized by a clock. Data writing and reading are managed by `wren` and `rden` signals, respectively, with output provided on the `q` port. Internal handling uses `sub_wire0` for temporary data alignment before output. Configuration parameters set in `defparam` optimize its functionality and integration within targeted FPGA architectures."
