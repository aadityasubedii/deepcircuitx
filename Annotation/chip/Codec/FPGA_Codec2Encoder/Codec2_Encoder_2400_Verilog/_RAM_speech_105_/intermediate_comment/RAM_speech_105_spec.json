    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_105. Module specification: The RAM_speech_105 module is designed to implement a single-port RAM on Altera FPGA devices, specifically for the Cyclone IV GX family, utilizing the altsyncram primitive for efficient memory management. It accommodates an 8-bit address input for selecting the RAM location, and a 32-bit data input for data that can be written to or read from the RAM. The module operates synchronized by a clock input and responds to two control signals: read enable (rden) and write enable (wren). These controls enable data to be written into or read from the memory location specified by the address. The output, q, is a 32-bit signal that outputs the data from the specified memory location when rden is high. Internally, the module uses a wire named sub_wire0 which temporarily holds data output from the altsyncram component before it gets routed to the output port q. The altsyncram component is the main memory element configured with parameters for operation mode, memory size, data and addressing configuration, along with other performance and efficiency settings indicated in the defparam section. This configuration ensures optimized functionality for targeted FPGA implementations, enhancing both performance and resource utilization dedicated to specific operational needs determined by the provided module configurations.",
