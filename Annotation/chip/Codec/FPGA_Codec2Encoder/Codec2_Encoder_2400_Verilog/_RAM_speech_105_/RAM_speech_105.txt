Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_105 module implements a single-port RAM on Cyclone IV GX Altera FPGA utilizing the altsyncram primitive, operating with an 8-bit address and 32-bit data inputs. Controlled by read (rden) and write (wren) enables, it synchronizes operations with a clock input. Internally, it employs a wire, sub_wire0, to intermediate data before outputting through q. Memory configurations and optimizations are defined via parameter settings in the altsyncram component.
