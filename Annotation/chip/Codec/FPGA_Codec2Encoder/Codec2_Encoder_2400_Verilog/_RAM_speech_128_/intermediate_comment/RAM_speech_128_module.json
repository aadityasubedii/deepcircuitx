    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_128 module implements a single-port RAM using the Altera's altsyncram component. It supports read and write operations, controlled by input signals including an 8-bit address, 32-bit data, a clock, and read/write enable signals. Internal signal 'sub_wire0' bridges the altsyncram output to the module's output, 'q'. Configuration parameters set behaviors like clock operation and data management specific to Cyclone IV GX FPGA devices."
