The RAM is parameterized using an altsyncram component, a memory block provided by Altera (now part of Intel), primarily intended for use in their FPGA devices. It facilitates basic memory operations such as read and write. The user can specify the clock, address, data inputs, and control signals like read enable (rden) and write enable (wren) to interact with the memory. The memory outputs a 32-bit data associated with the provided address input on the read operation when read enable (rden) is active. The module uses the altsyncram component from Altera's library configured to operate in a single-port mode with specific settings like no output data register clear and read-during-write behavior set to output new data.

Each unique value of the address corresponds to a unique memory location that can be read from or written to.\n- `clock` (1-bit): The primary timing element for the module; data is written to or read from the RAM on the edges of the clock signal, synchronizing the module's operations.\n- `data` (32-bit): The data input port is used to input data into the RAM. When a write operation is enabled, the data on this port is written into the memory location specified by the address input.\n- `rden` (1-bit): Read Enable signal; when set to '1', it allows the data from the specified memory location (by the address) to be placed on the output port `q`.\n- `wren` (1-bit): Write Enable signal; when set to '1' and coincident with a clock edge, it allows writing the data present on the `data` input to the memory at the location specified by the `address`.\n\nOutput ports: [q].\nExplanation: \n- `q` (32-bit): This is the data output port.
