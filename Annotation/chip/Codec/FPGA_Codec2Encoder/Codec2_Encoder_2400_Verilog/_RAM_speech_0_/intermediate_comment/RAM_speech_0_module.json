    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_0 module implements a single-port RAM on Cyclone IV E FPGA using the altsyncram component, configured for specific non-volatile memory operations. It supports 160 words of 32-bit data, with memory addresses given via an 8-bit input. Read and write operations are managed by enabling signals (rden, wren), synchronized by a clock. Data flow from the altsyncram's output to the module's output is handled by an internal signal, sub_wire0. This setup supports fast data storage and retrieval for applications such as digital speech processing."
