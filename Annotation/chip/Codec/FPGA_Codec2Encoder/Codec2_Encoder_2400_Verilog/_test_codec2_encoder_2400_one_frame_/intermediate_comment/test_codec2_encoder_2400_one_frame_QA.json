It takes input speech samples, performs analysis and encoding operations, and outputs encoded bits representing the compressed speech frame. The module includes several sub-processes such as analyzing one frame, speech-to-LSP conversion, encoding pitch and energy, and quantizing LSP parameters. It uses a state machine to control the flow of operations and interfaces with various memory components for data storage and retrieval during the encoding process."
