    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a codec2 speech encoder for one frame of audio at 2400 bps. It uses a finite state machine to control the encoding process, which includes frame analysis, speech-to-LSP conversion, pitch and energy encoding, and LSP quantization. The module interfaces with memory components for data storage and retrieval, processes input samples, and outputs encoded bits representing the compressed speech frame. It utilizes several sub-modules for specific encoding tasks and incorporates Gray coding for efficient bit representation."
