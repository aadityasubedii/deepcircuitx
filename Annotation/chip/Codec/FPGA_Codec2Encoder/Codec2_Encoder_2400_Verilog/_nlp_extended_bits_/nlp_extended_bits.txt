Module-level comment: This module implements a Non-Linear Pitch (NLP) detection algorithm for speech processing. It processes input speech samples through notch filtering, FFT, and peak detection to estimate pitch. The module uses finite state machines to control data flow through preprocessing, FFT computation, and post-processing stages. It interfaces with memory for data storage and retrieval, and outputs the estimated pitch and best fundamental frequency.
