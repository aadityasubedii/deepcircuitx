Module name: nlp_extended_bits. Module specification: This module implements a Non-Linear Pitch (NLP) detection algorithm for speech processing. It processes input speech samples through various stages including initialization, notch filtering, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), peak detection, and post-processing to estimate the pitch. The module has input ports for control signals (startnlp, clk, rst), data inputs (out_sn, out_sq, out_mem_fir, nlp_mem_x, nlp_mem_y, prev_f0), and output ports for results (donenlp, best_f0, pitch) and memory interface signals. Internal signals include state variables, counters, and temporary storage for calculations. The module is structured into several main blocks: data preprocessing, notch filtering, FFT computation, peak detection, and post-processing. It uses multiple finite state machines to control the flow
