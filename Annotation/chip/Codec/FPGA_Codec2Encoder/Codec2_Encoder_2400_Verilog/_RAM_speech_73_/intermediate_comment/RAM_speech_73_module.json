    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_73 module implements a single-port RAM using the altsyncram component tailored for Cyclone IV GX FPGA devices. It features inputs for address, data, clock, and control signals (rden, wren), and an output port 'q' for data retrieval. Internally, it utilizes 'sub_wire0' to connect the altsyncram output to the q output, ensuring structured data flow and synchronization driven by input clock signals and read/write operations as configured in the altsyncram component parameters."
