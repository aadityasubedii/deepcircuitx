    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_73. \nModule specification: \nThe RAM_speech_73 is a single-port RAM module utilizing the altsyncram component designed for use in Intel's Cyclone IV GX FPGA devices. This module has input ports for an 8-bit address which specifies the memory location for data operations, a clock signal that synchronizes RAM operations, a 32-bit data input for writing data, a read enable (rden) signal, and a write enable (wren) signal. Output is provided through a 32-bit port 'q', which outputs data read from the specified address when rden is active. An internal wire, sub_wire0, is used to transfer data from the altsyncram component\u2019s output to the q port, ensuring modularity and clarity in the design. The code comprises declarations of inputs and outputs, internal wiring, and an instance of the altsyncram component with specific configurations such as the memory size, device family, and behavior settings like clocking requirements. These settings outline the operational characteristics such as clock input bypass and data output handling during read and write operations, ensuring tailored functionality suitable for applications that could involve speech processing, as the name suggests.",
