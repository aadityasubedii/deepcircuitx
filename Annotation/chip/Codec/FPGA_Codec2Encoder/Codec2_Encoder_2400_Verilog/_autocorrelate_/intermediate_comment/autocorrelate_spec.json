    "spec": "Module name: autocorrelate. Module specification: The \"autocorrelate\" module is designed to compute the autocorrelation of a sequence in a hardware-efficient manner by sequentially processing input data through multiplier and adder units, controlled via a state machine implementation. The module accepts three input ports: 'startac', the control signal to commence operations; 'clk', the clock signal which synchronizes the state transitions and data processing; and 'rst', which is used for initializing or resetting the internal state machine. There is one output port, 'doneac', which indicates completion of the autocorrelation process. Internal signals such as 'STATE', 'NEXT_STATE', loop counters 'i', 'j', and data handling signals 'rn_read', 'rn_write', facilitate the complex control flow required for processing. The Verilog code enforces sequential state transitions to manage operations such as initialization, memory address setting, data processing, and control signal updates. Blocks of the code implementing the state machine handle different tasks like initializing indices, performing autocorrelation calculations, incrementally updating indices, checking continuation conditions, and establishing the readiness of the processed data upon execution conclusion. Memory interfaces represented by RAM modules and arithmetic units (multipliers and adders) directly operate on the data sequence to compute the results, which are then stored back into the memory.",

                    "text": "Module name: autocorrelate. Module specification: The \"autocorrelate\" module is designed to compute the autocorrelation of a sequence in a hardware-efficient manner by sequentially processing input data through multiplier and adder units, controlled via a state machine implementation. The module accepts three input ports: 'startac', the control signal to commence operations; 'clk', the clock signal which synchronizes the state transitions and data processing; and 'rst', which is used for initializing or resetting the internal state machine. There is one output port, 'doneac', which indicates completion of the autocorrelation process. Internal signals such as 'STATE', 'NEXT_STATE', loop counters 'i', 'j', and data handling signals 'rn_read', 'rn_write', facilitate the complex control flow required for processing. The Verilog code enforces sequential state transitions to manage operations such as initialization, memory address setting, data processing, and control signal updates. Blocks of the code implementing the state machine handle different tasks like initializing indices, performing autocorrelation calculations, incrementally updating indices, checking continuation conditions, and establishing the readiness of the processed data upon execution conclusion. Memory interfaces represented by RAM modules and arithmetic units (multipliers and adders) directly operate on the data sequence to compute the results, which are then stored back into the memory."
