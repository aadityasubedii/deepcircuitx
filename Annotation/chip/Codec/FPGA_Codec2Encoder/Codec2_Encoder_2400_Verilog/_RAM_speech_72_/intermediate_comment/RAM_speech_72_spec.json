    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_72. Module specification: The `RAM_speech_72` module operates as a single-port RAM, specifically designed using the `altsyncram` component targeted for the Cyclone IV GX FPGA family that stores and facilitates the management of data through basic read and write operations. It interfaces via three principal input ports and one output port: an 8-bit `address` input for selecting the memory address, a `clock` signal that synchronizes data transactions, a 32-bit `data` input for data to be written to the selected address. Control signals include `rden` which enables the data to be read from the address when high, and `wren` which enables writing data to the address when high. The module outputs through a single 32-bit port `q`, which outputs the data read from the specified memory location. Internally, the module uses a wire `sub_wire0` to transfer the output data from the `altsyncram` component to the `q` port. This module is extensively parameterized with specific attributes to optimize the performance and utilization within the FPGA, with set parameters like operation mode, clock management, and initialization properties outlined in `defparam`. The code cleanly delineates port declarations, signal declarations, instantiation of the `altsyncram` component with its configuration, and assignment of internal wires linking to output ports to ensure clarity and modularity in design.",

The operations are controlled by read enable (rden) and write enable (wren) signals along with a clock signal.
