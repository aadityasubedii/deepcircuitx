    "module": "Module-level comment: The `RAM_speech_72` is a single-port RAM using the `altsyncram` component, tailored for Cyclone IV GX FPGA. It supports 8-bit address and 32-bit data inputs for read/write operations, synchronized by a clock signal. Control is managed via `rden` and `wren` signals, with internal wiring (`sub_wire0`) linking the `altsyncram` output to the `q` output port. Configuration parameters optimize FPGA resource use and performance."
