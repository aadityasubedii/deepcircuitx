    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_27 is a single-port RAM module using Altera\u2019s altsyncram for data storage and retrieval specific to speech signals on Cyclone IV GX FPGA. It interacts through ports `address`, `clock`, `data`, `rden`, and `wren`, handling synchronization and data flow. The internal `sub_wire0` connects `altsyncram` output to the `q` output port, enabling efficient data access. Configurations are tailored via parameters defined in a `.mif` file."
