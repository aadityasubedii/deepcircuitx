Module name: fft. 
Module specification: The 'fft' module in Verilog implements the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), a fundamental algorithm in digital signal processing for transforming a sequence into its frequency components. The module has three primary input ports: `startfft`, `clk`, and `rst`. The `startfft` initiates the FFT computation when set high, `clk` serves as the clock signal essential for sequential logic operations, and `rst` resets the internal states and outputs when set low. The sole output port, `donefft`, indicates the completion of the FFT computation. Key internal signals within the module include loop counters (`k` and `t`), angle calculation registers (`angle`, `beta`), intermediate computational registers (`m1_in1`, `m1_in2`, etc.), as well as control signals like `startcossin` and `startdiv` which manage operations in sub-modules such as multipliers and the CORDIC algorithm for trigonometric calculations. The module architecture includes a state machine controlling the computation's flow through multiple stages from initialization, angle setting, cosine and sine computation, data retrieval and storage, to the final output stages. Integral sub-modules include fixed-point multipliers (`qmult`), adders (`qadd`), a divider (`fpdiv_clk`), and RAM modules for input and output data management. The design facilitates efficient and precise FFT computations, adhering to parameterizable precision and size requirements dictated by input parameters `N` and `Q`.
