    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'fft' module is a Verilog implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), crucial for frequency domain analysis. It utilizes a state machine to manage sequential FFT computations, starting upon `startfft`. The design includes arithmetic sub-modules for fixed-point operations and CORDIC for trigonometric calculations, handling data via internal RAM modules. Operational flow progresses through initialization, computation, and output stages, driven by the clock signal `clk` and controlled via `rst`."
