The module uses a fixed-point arithmetic approach with several sub-modules for multiplication ('qmult'), addition ('qadd'), and division ('fpdiv_clk'), as well as dedicated hardware for the computation of cosine and sine functions using a CORDIC algorithm ('cossin_cordic'). The FFT process is controlled through a state machine which sequences through initialization, looping over FFT calculations, and final output stages, controlled by the input `startfft` and operating synchronously with the clock `clk`. The result of the FFT computation is made available at the outputs `donefft`, which indicates completion, along with internal registers and RAM that hold the real and imaginary parts of the transformed data.
