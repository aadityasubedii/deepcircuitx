    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"encode_lsps_scalar\" module quantizes LSP frequencies into index values for encoding transmissions. It employs a FSM to synchronize these processes, handling input LSP data, converting frequencies from radians to hertz, and executing scalar quantization via instantiated \"quantise\" modules. Outputs include completion indicators and quantized index values for each LSP. The module is driven by a clock and managed by state transitions ensuring orderly processing of LSP data."
