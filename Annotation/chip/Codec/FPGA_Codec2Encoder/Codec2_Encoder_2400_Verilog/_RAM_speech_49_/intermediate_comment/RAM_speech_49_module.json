    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_49 module implements a single-port RAM using Altera's 'altsyncram' component. It supports synchronized read and write operations controlled by input signals 'address', 'clock', 'data', 'rden', and 'wren'. Output data from operations is presented on port 'q'. The internal signal 'sub_wire0' links altsyncram output to the module's external interface, and configuration parameters define device-specific settings and operational modes."
