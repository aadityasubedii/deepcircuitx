    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_107 module is a single-port RAM using Altera's `altsyncram` for the Cyclone IV GX FPGA family. It manages memory via a synchronous interface, accepting an 8-bit address, 32-bit data, and control signals (clock, rden, wren) to facilitate read and write operations. Outputs data at the address when read is enabled. Configured with operational characteristics like memory size and interface behaviors defined through parameters."
