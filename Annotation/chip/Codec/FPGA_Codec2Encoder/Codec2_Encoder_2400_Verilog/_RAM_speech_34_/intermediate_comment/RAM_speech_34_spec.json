    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_34. \n\nModule specification: The RAM_speech_34 module functions as a single-port RAM customized to store and retrieve 32-bit data using an 8-bit address. Input ports include an 8-bit `address` for location specification in RAM, a `clock` signal for synchronization, a 32-bit `data` input for storing in RAM, and control signals `rden` (read enable) and `wren` (write enable) to manage read and write operations respectively. The sole output port, `q`, offers a 32-bit output showing data retrieved from RAM when reading is enabled. Internally, the module employs a `sub_wire0` signal, a 32-bit wide intermediary wire connecting the output from the `altsyncram` component to the module's `q` output. This setup ensures proper data transfer from internal RAM to the module\u2019s external interface. The main internal component is `altsyncram`, an Altera-specific RAM component configured for single-port operation which preloads data using \"RAM_speech_34.mif\", optimized for the Cyclone IV GX FPGA device family. The `altsyncram_component` defines parameters like capacity, operational mode, power management, and data management specifics tailored to meet the module's requirements, ensuring efficient, stable, and correct functionality.",
