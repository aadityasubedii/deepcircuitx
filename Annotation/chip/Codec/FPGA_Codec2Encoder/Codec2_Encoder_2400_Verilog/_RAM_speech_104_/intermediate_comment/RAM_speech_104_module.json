    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'RAM_speech_104' module is a single-port RAM using Altera's 'altsyncram' tailored for 'Cyclone IV GX' FPGA, operating with a memory initialization file. It interfaces through an 8-bit address, a clock, 32-bit data inputs, and read/write enable signals, outputting 32-bit data 'q'. Internally, it utilizes 'sub_wire0' for handling data flow from the RAM element to the output. Configuration parameters set operational behaviors like clock bypass and read/write protocols."
