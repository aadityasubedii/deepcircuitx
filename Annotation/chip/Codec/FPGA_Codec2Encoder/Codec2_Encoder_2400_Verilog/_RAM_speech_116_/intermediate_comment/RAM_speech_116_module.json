    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_116 module is a single-port RAM using Altera's 'altsyncram' for data storage and retrieval. It handles 32-bit data with 8-bit addressing, controlled by separate read (rden) and write (wren) enables. Internally, it uses 'sub_wire0' to transfer data from the altsyncram component to the output 'q', following specified configuration parameters aimed at fixed, non-runtime modifiable operations within FPGA applications."
