    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_116. Module specification: The module RAM_speech_116 is designed as a single-port RAM using the Altera 'altsyncram' component, tailored specifically for use with the Cyclone IV GX FPGA family. This module operates with a straightforward functionality where it utilizes an 8-bit address (input port \"address\") to select memory locations and a 32-bit data input (input port \"data\") for writing operations. Control over these read and write operations is managed through the \"rden\" (read enable) and \"wren\" (write enable) inputs respectively. The result of a read operation is outputted through the 32-bit output port \"q\". Internally, the module uses a wire \"sub_wire0\" which connects the output of the 'altsyncram_component' to the \"q\" output port, ensuring the data flow is managed correctly within the RAM. The Verilog code for this module is divided into sections that define input and output ports setup, internal signal declaration, the instantiation of the 'altsyncram_component', and parameter configurations for the RAM, such as not allowing runtime modifications and setting the initial content file. These configurations and structured code blocks underline a RAM module optimized for specific audio processing or similar applications, relying on stable and synchronized data handling.",

It is configured to operate with an 8-bit address input and a 32-bit data width. The module allows for data writing and reading through control signals. Data writing is controlled by the 'wren' (write enable) input, and data reading is facilitated by the 'rden' (read enable) input, with the data output available on 'q'. The RAM does not reset or clear its contents on power-up (indicated by `power_up_uninitialized` set to \"FALSE\"). The module is intended for use with the Cyclone IV GX FPGA family and is specifically configured to not allow modifications at runtime (`ENABLE_RUNTIME_MOD=NO`). The configuration parameters and operational mode suggest the RAM is tailored for specific requirements such as possibly storing speech data (as the file name 'RAM_speech_116.mif' for initialization might suggest), supporting applications in audio processing or similar fields."
