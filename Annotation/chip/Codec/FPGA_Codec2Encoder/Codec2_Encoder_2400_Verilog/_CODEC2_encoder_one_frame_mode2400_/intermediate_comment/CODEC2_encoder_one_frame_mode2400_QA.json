It processes one frame of speech input at a time. The module takes various input parameters including speech samples, previous frame data, and configuration values. It then performs several encoding steps such as pitch analysis, LSP (Line Spectral Pair) computation, and quantization. The module outputs encoded bits representing the compressed speech frame, along with updated state information for the next frame. The encoding process involves multiple stages including speech analysis, parameter extraction, and bit packing, implemented through a state machine with numerous states for different processing steps."
