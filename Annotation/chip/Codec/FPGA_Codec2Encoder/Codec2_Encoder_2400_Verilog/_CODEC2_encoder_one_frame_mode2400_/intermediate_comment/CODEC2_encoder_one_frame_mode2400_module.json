    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a CODEC2 speech encoder for 2400 bps mode, processing one frame of speech input at a time. It performs speech analysis, parameter extraction, and bit packing through a state machine. The encoder uses multiple sub-modules for tasks like pitch analysis, LSP computation, and quantization. It handles input/output operations with memory interfaces and generates encoded bits representing the compressed speech frame along with updated state information for the next frame."
