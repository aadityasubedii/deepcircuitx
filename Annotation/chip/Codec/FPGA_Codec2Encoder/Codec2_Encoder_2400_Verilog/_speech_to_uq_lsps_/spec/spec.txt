Module name: speech_to_uq_lsps. Module specification: This module implements a speech processing algorithm that converts speech input into Line Spectral Pair (LSP) parameters. It takes inputs startspeech (to initiate processing), clk (clock signal), and rst (reset signal). The module outputs include E (error/energy parameter), lsp0 to lsp9 (LSP parameters), donespeech (processing completion indicator), and debug signals (check_corr, check_ak0_lev, check_ak1_lev). Internally, it uses various signals for state management, counters, memory addressing, and intermediate calculations. The module employs a state machine to control the processing flow, which includes initialization, autocorrelation calculation, Levinson-Durbin algorithm for Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) analysis, and conversion of LPC coefficients to LSP
