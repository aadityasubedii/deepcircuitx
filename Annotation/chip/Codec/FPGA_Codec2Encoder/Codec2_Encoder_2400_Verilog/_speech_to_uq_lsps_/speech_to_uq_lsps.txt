Module-level comment: This module converts speech input to Line Spectral Pair (LSP) parameters. It implements a state machine-controlled process including autocorrelation, Levinson-Durbin algorithm for LPC analysis, and LPC to LSP conversion. The module uses various memory units and sub-modules to perform calculations, storing intermediate results and managing data flow throughout the speech processing algorithm.
