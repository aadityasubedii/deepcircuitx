Module-level comment: The RAM_func_fft_imag80 module implements a single-port RAM on Cyclone IV E FPGA, storing and retrieving 80-bit data words using a 9-bit address. Utilizing the `altsyncram` component from Intel's library, it manages data with input triggers for reading (`rden`) and writing (`wren`). Internal signal `sub_wire0` facilitates data transfer from `altsyncram` to the output `q`. Ideal for quick data processing tasks like FFT in image applications.
