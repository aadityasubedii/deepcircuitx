Module name: RAM_func_fft_imag80. 

Module specification: The RAM_func_fft_imag80 is a Verilog module designed for use in a Cyclone IV E FPGA, facilitating single-port RAM operations specifically tailored to handle 80-bit wide data words. The module includes input ports: `address` (9-bit input for specifying the target memory location), `clock` (synchronizes operations), `data` (80-bit data for writing), `rden` (enables reading data), and `wren` (enables writing data). The sole output port, `q`, outputs the 80-bit data read from the specified memory address. Internal to the module, the `sub_wire0` signal acts as an intermediary, connecting the output from the instantiated `altsyncram` component to the `q` output port. The `altsyncram_component` itself is configured with several device-specific parameters to optimize its functionality within the intended FPGA family, handling operations such as data addressing and access controls. This module provides efficient read/write capabilities to the specified FPGA memory, crucial for applications requiring rapid data storage and retrieval like FFT processing in image computations.
