Module name: cossin_cordic.  
Module specification: The `cossin_cordic` module calculates the sine and cosine values of an angle represented by `beta` using the CORDIC algorithm in a hardware context. It operates synchronously with a clock input (`clk`) and can be reset via the `rst` input. This module starts its calculation when `startcossin` is set high. The module has outputs for the sine (`sin`) and cosine (`cos`) of the provided angle, a completion signal (`donecossin`), current angle position (`theta`), a correction of the angle (`c_theta`), and a debug signal (`sig_check`). Internally, `STATE` and `NEXT_STATE` manage state transitions central to the CORDIC algorithm's iteration process while leveraging various arithmetic and comparison operations using signals like `m1_out`, `a1_out`, `lt1`, and others. The internal flow includes states for initialization, looping through CORDIC iterations (`CHECK_J` and loop control), setting angles and corrections, and final adjustments to output the sine and cosine values accurately. Arithmetic operations are managed through instantiated modules like `qmult` and `qadd` for multiplication and addition, while `fplessthan` and `fpmod` handle comparisons and modulus operations respectively. The final output values of sine and cosine are scaled and signed corrected in the `CALC_C_S_FINAL` state before signaling computation completion in the `DONE` state. This module is constructed using multiple states to handle various computational steps required for the CORDIC algorithm, ensuring accurate computation of trigonometric functions using a fixed-point representation.
