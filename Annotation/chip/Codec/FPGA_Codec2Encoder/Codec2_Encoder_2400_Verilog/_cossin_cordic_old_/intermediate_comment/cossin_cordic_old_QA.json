It takes an angle (`beta`) as input and produces the sine (`sin`) and cosine (`cos`) of the angle as outputs. The module operates synchronously with a clock (`clk`) and can be reset (`rst`). It also has a start signal (`startcossin`) to initiate the computation. The algorithm involves various state transitions to compute the results iteratively, updating coefficients in a series of calculations across different states, and signals when the computation is done (`donecossin`). Various other outputs like `donecossin`, `theta`, `c_theta`, and `sig_check` indicate completion states and check values for debugging or verification purposes."
