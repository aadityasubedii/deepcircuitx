    "module": "Module-level comment: The `cossin_cordic` module computes the sine and cosine of an input angle using the CORDIC algorithm. Structured around a state machine managed by `STATE` and `NEXT_STATE`, it processes iterations synchronized by a clock (`clk`). Inputs include the `startcossin` trigger and angle `beta`. Outputs are `sin`, `cos`, `donecossin`, `theta`, `c_theta`, and `sig_check`. Operations within states handle angle adjustments, iterative computations, and output scaling, leveraging arithmetic units like `qmult` (multiplier) and `qadd` (adder)."
