    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"RAM_speech_96\" module implements a single-port RAM on a Cyclone IV GX FPGA, utilizing the `altsyncram` component for memory operations. It supports 32-bit data transactions via an 8-bit address input, synchronized by a clock signal, with dedicated `rden` and `wren` signals for controlling read and write operations respectively. Initialized with \"RAM_speech_96.mif\", it is optimized for speech data applications."
