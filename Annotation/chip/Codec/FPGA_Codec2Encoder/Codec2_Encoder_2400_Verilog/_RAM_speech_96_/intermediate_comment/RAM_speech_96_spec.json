    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_96. \nModule specification: The \"RAM_speech_96\" is a Verilog module designed for FPGA implementation using a Cyclone IV GX device, specifically employing an FPGA-dedicated memory component, `altsyncram`. This module facilitates the realization of single-port RAM with a capability of handling 32-bit data inputs and outputs through a 8-bit address space. The functionalities predominantly covered are reading and writing data based on the control signals; `rden` for read enablement and `wren` for write operations, synchronized with an input signal `clock`. The input ports include: `[address]` (8-bit selection), `[clock]` (timing synchronization), `[data]` (32-bit data carriage), `[rden]` (read command), and `[wren]` (write command). The sole output port `[q]` (32-bit) delivers data retrieved from the memory when a read operation is engaged. Internally, `sub_wire0` (32-bit) serves as an intermediary to relay output from the `altsyncram` component to the output port `q`. The code structurally encompasses declarations of inputs and outputs, instantiation of `altsyncram` with associated parameters such as operating modes, memory initialization from \"RAM_speech_96.mif\", and specific device configurations. This setup underpins functionalities suitable for applications like speech data storage or processing within an embedded systems context.",
