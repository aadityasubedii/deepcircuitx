Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_56 module is a single-port RAM storage designed for the Cyclone IV GX FPGA, using the Altera-specific `altsyncram` for synchronous operations. It supports read and write functionalities controlled via `rden` and `wren` signals with a 32-bit data interface and an 8-bit address. Internal data routing is managed through `sub_wire0`, connecting RAM output to the moduleâ€™s output port `q`.
