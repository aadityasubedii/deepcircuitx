Module name: nlp_extended_bits. Module specification: The nlp_extended_bits module implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm with extended bit precision for pitch detection. It processes input signals through multiple stages, including initialization, notch filtering, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and post-processing. The module has input ports for starting the process (startnlp), clock (clk), reset (rst), input memory values (nlp_mem_x, nlp_mem_y), and previous fundamental frequency (prev_f0). Output ports include the best fundamental frequency (best_f0), previous fundamental frequency (out_prev_f0), completion signal (donenlp), pitch value (pitch), and several debug outputs. Internally, it uses numerous signals for memory addressing, data processing, and state management. The module operates using a state machine with multiple stages: initialization, data processing loops, FFT calculation,
