Module-level comment: This module implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm for pitch detection using extended bit precision. It processes input signals through multiple stages including initialization, notch filtering, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and post-processing. The module uses a state machine to control its operation, performing data processing loops, FFT calculations, and peak detection to determine the best fundamental frequency and pitch. It utilizes various memory components and mathematical operations for signal processing and analysis.
