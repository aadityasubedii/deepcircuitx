    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mem1' module implements a single-port RAM using Altera's altsyncram component tailored for Cyclone IV E FPGA, handling 4-bit address inputs and 32-bit data inputs. It operates synchronized with a clock, allowing data writing via the 'wren' signal and outputs fetched data through the 'q' port. Configuration parameters, set via `defparam`, optimize memory operations like access modes and initial conditions."
