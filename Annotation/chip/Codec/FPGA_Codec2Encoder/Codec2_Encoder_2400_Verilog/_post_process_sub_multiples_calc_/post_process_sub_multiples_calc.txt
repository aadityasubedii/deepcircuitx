Module-level comment: The `post_process_sub_multiples_calc` module evaluates spectral data to determine the optimal fundamental frequency (`best_f0`). It processes inputs like spectral magnitudes and previous frequency estimates through a finite state machine (FSM) that manages arithmetic operations with multipliers, dividers, and comparators to refine frequency analysis. This module accomplishes its goal by dynamically adjusting frequency bin calculations, thresholds, and implementing checks within its state-driven logic to produce precise frequency outputs upon completion.
