    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'RAM_speech_137' module acts as a single-port RAM using an `altsyncram` from Altera, designed for Cyclone IV GX FPGA. It leverages an 8-bit address and a 32-bit data interface, controlled by `rden` and `wren` signals for reading and writing operations. Internal wiring through `sub_wire0` links `altsyncram` output to the `q` output port, with specific configurations set for operational characteristics and memory behavior."
