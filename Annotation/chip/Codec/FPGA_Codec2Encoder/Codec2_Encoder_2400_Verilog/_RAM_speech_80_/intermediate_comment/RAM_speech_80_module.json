    "module": "Module-level comment: RAM_speech_80 module implements a single-port RAM on Altera FPGA Cyclone IV GX, using altsyncram component for memory operations. It interfaces with 8-bit address, 32-bit data I/O, clock, and read/write enable signals. Internal wiring includes sub_wire0 for data staging, and configurations via altsyncram set memory behavior and initialization using \"RAM_speech_80.mif\", ensuring no runtime modifications and stable read/write operations under a synchronized clock environment."
