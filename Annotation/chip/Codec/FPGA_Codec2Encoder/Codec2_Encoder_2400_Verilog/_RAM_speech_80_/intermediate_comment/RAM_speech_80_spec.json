    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_80. Module specification: The RAM_speech_80 module is a single-port RAM designed to operate on Altera FPGA platforms, specifically optimized for the Cyclone IV GX family. It utilizes the altsyncram component to manage memory operations, controlled by input and output ports. The input ports include an 8-bit address for selecting the memory location, a clock signal for timing, a 32-bit data port for the input data, and read enable (rden) and write enable (wren) signals for triggering read and write operations. The output of the module is a 32-bit data line (q), which outputs the data read from the specific memory location. Internally, the module uses a wire named sub_wire0, which serves as an intermediary connection that temporarily holds the data being transferred from the altsyncram component to the output port. The code primarily configures the altsyncram component, setting parameters such as the initialization file, device family, operation mode, and memory size, among others. It also specifies the behavior of various signals within the block, such as clock signals and clear settings, ensuring that the RAM performs read and write operations efficiently and following the single-port RAM behavior without asynchronous clear or runtime configuration changes.",

The RAM is initialized from a Memory Initialization File (MIF) named \"RAM_speech_80.mif\" and is configured not to allow runtime modifications to block settings.
