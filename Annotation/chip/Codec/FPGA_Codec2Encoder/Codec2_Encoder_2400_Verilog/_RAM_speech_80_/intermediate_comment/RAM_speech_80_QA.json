It interfaces through address, data inputs, and outputs, supporting read and write operations controlled via separate enable signals. The RAM is initialized from a Memory Initialization File (MIF) named \"RAM_speech_80.mif\" and is configured not to allow runtime modifications to block settings. The RAM operates without asynchronous clear signals and does not output data on the clock edge by default, aligning with typical single-port RAM behavior where new data is accessed following a read or write operation."
