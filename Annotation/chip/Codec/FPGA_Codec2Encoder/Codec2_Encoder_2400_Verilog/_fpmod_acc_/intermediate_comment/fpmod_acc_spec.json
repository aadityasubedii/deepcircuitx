    "spec": "Module name: fpmod_acc. Module specification: The 'fpmod_acc' module is designed to perform floating-point modulus operations by computing the remainder of division between two input values, 'in_1' and 'in_2'. The module operates synchonously with a system clock 'clk' and features a reset 'rst', which initializes the state machine on a negative edge. The operation starts when 'startfmod' is asserted. It has input ports including 'clk' (clock signal), 'rst' (reset signal, active low), 'startfmod' (initiates modulus computation), 'in_1' (dividend), and 'in_2' (divisor). The outputs are 'rem' (the computed remainder) and 'donefmod' (signals completion of operation). Internally, the module uses several signals: 'STATE' (current state of the state machine), 'NEXT_STATE' (expected next state), 'm1_in1' and 'm1_in2' (inputs to a multiplier), 'a1_in1' and 'a1_in2' (inputs to an adder), 'div_in' (input to a divider), 'startdiv' (triggers the start of division), and 'divisor' (stores result of division). The module integrates a multiplier ('qmult'), an adder ('qadd'), and a divider ('fpdiv_clk_acc'). The state machine manages the flow between these components, cycling through states that include initializing, starting division, fetching division result, executing two multiplication phases, computing the remainder, setting the final remainder output, and signaling completion.",
