It uses a state machine to manage the sequence of operations including multiplication, division, and addition, facilitated by custom modules 'qmult' for multiplier, 'adder1' for addition, and 'fpdiv_clk_acc' for division. The module starts the division operation upon receiving the 'startfmod' signal and signals completion through 'donefmod'. It processes asynchronously with the system clock 'clk' and can be reset by the 'rst' signal."

It is used to initialize or reset the state machine and other registers to their default states.\n- startfmod: Start signal for the modulus operation.
