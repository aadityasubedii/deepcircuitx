    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'fpmod_acc' module performs a floating-point modulus operation to compute the remainder of 'in_1' divided by 'in_2'. It synchronizes operations via a system clock ('clk') and features a reset ('rst'). Utilizing a state machine, the module sequences interactions with internal multiplier ('qmult'), adder ('qadd'), and divider ('fpdiv_clk_acc') components. The state machine transitions manage initialization, division, multiplication of operands, remainder calculation, and result delivery signaled by 'donefmod'."
