It uses a 4-bit address input (`addr`) to select one of 16 possible 32-bit values stored in an internal memory array (`cb3`). The selected value is then output through the `dataout` register. This module effectively serves as a lookup table where the address input determines which of the 16 pre-configured binary values is output."

This array serves as the storage component of the ROM, containing the predefined 32-bit binary values that can be accessed through the module. Each element of the array corresponds to a unique 32-bit data value, indexed from 0 to 15. When an address (`addr`) is provided to the module, the corresponding data from the `cb3` array is fetched and assigned to the output `dataout`. The role of `cb3` is essential for holding the data values that the module outputs based on the input address, functioning as the core storage structure of the ROM-like behavior exhibited by the module."
