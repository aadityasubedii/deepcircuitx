    "module": "Module-level comment: The ROM_cb3 module serves as a ROM, using a 4-bit input `addr` to select from 16 predefined 32-bit values stored in the `cb3` array, and outputs the selected value through `dataout`. The internal `always` block initializes the `cb3` with binary data and facilitates real-time data fetch based on the input address. This structure enables it to function efficiently as a lookup table."
