Module name: ROM_cb3. Module specification: The ROM_cb3 module emulates a Read-Only Memory (ROM) storage, providing a lookup table functionality by selecting from a set of pre-defined 32-bit binary values stored internally. It contains one 4-bit input port, `addr`, which is used to select one of 16 possible addresses, and one 32-bit output port, `dataout`, which outputs the data value corresponding to the provided address. Internally, the module utilizes a memory array, `cb3`, consisting of 16 elements each 32 bits wide. This array stores all predefined binary values and outputs a selected value based upon the address received on `addr`. The Verilog code includes an `always` block visible at all times (`always@(*)`), which initializes the `cb3` array with hard-coded binary values and assigns the value specified by `addr` to `dataout`. Overall, the module has a well-defined task of fetching and outputting data based on an input address, and its simple architecture ensures efficient data retrieval from its ROM-like structure.
