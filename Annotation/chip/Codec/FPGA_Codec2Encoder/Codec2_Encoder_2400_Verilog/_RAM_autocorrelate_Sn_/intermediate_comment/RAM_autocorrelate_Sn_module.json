    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_autocorrelate_Sn is a single-port RAM module designed for signal processing, specifically autocorrelation functions. It uses an altsyncram component synchronized by a clock input, handling data through a 9-bit address and 32-bit data ports along with read (rden) and write (wren) enable signals. The output data ('q') is coupled from the internal wire 'sub_wire0', which directly interfaces with the altsyncram's output. The altsyncram is configured for single-port operation with parameters defining its size, behavior, and initialization, ensuring tailored functionality for specific processing needs."
