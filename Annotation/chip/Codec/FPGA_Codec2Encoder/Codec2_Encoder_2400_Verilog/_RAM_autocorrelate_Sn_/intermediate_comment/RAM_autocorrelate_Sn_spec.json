    "spec": "Module name: RAM_autocorrelate_Sn. Module specification: The RAM_autocorrelate_Sn module encapsulates a single-port RAM using an altsyncram component tailored for autocorrelation function applications in signal processing. The module operates synchronously with an input clock, accepting inputs such as a 9-bit address for data access, a 32-bit data input for write operations, and control signals (rden and wren) that enable reading and writing respectively. It outputs a 32-bit data through the output port 'q', which is the data retrieved from the specified RAM address. Internally, the module utilizes a wire 'sub_wire0' which connects the output 'q_a' from the altsyncram component to the main output 'q', essentially holding the data temporarily during read operations. This setup is powered by a series of parameters that define the behavior and specifications of the altsyncram component, such as the operational mode, word size, and memory initialization, cementing its specialized role for single-port operation within a signal processing context.",
