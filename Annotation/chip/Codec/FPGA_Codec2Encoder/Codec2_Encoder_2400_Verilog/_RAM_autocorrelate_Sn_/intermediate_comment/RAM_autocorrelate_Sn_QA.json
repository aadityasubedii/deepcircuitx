The input signals include an address, data, and control signals for reading and writing. The altsyncram component is configured with parameters such as mode of operation, data width, and word count, specifying its behavior and storage capacity. The module handles data input and output operations based on the clock and control signals, facilitating data storage and retrieval for the autocorrelation process."
