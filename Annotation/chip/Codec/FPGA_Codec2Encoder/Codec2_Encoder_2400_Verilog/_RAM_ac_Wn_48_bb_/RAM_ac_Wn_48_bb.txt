Module-level comment: The RAM_ac_Wn_48 module handles read and write operations to RAM, synchronized by a clock signal. It uses a 9-bit address for memory location selection and transfers data through a 48-bit interface. Inputs include address, clock, data (for writing), rden (read enable), and wren (write enable), with a 48-bit output 'q' for read data. The implementation details are not fully visible in the code snippet, but active-high signals are suggested by the use of `tri1` for 'clock' and 'rden'.
