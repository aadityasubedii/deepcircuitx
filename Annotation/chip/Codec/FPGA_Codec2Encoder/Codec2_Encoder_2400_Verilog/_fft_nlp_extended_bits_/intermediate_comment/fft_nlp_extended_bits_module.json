    "module": "Module-level comment: The `fft_nlp_extended_bits` module performs high-precision FFT on complex data, featuring inputs for real and imaginary parts, and outputs transformed data. It employs a state machine to manage computation across multiple steps involving trigonometric operations, loop control, and data multiplication/addition. States in the machine initiate operations, handle synchronization of cosine/sine calculations, and manage data input/output addressing, ensuring robust execution of the FFT algorithm."
