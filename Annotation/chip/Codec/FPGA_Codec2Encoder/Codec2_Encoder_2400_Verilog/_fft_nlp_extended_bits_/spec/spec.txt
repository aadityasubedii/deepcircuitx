Module name: fft_nlp_extended_bits. 
Module specification: The `fft_nlp_extended_bits` module is designed for high-precision Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) computations, capable of handling both real and imaginary components of input data. The module features input ports for starting the FFT (`startfft`), a clock signal (`clk`), reset signal (`rst`), and the real (`in_real_data`) and imaginary (`in_imag_data`) parts of complex input data. Output ports include the FFT completion signal (`donefft`), addresses for input and output data (`addr_in_imag`, `addr_in_real`, `addr_out_real`, `addr_out_imag`), resulting real and imaginary data (`write_fft_real`, `write_fft_imag`), and diagnostic outputs for sine, cosine, and signal checking (`check_sin`, `check_cos`, `check_sig`).

Internally, the module utilizes several signals and state machines to manage the FFT computation process. Key signals include state registers `STATE` and `NEXT_STATE` which govern the execution flow across different FFT computation stages. Counters like `k` and `t` manage loops within the FFT computation, while `angle`, `startcossin`, `donecossin`, `beta`, and `startdiv`, `donediv`, `div_in`, `div_ans` handle trigonometric calculations, division operations involved in FFT processing, and looping conditions.

The module is structured into several distinct sections driven by a state machine with states for initializing, looping through, executing mathematical operations, setting input-output addresses, performing multiplication and addition of data sets, and finally providing the computed FFT output. Each section is meticulously designed to contribute specifically to portions of the FFT computation, ensuring accurate results and efficient processing. This structured approach leverages both combinational and sequential logic to perform FFT algorithmic steps in a synchronized manner, driven by the clock input.
