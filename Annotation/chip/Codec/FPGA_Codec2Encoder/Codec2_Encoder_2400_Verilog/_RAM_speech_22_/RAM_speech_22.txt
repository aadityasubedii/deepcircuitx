Module-level comment: The "RAM_speech_22" module simulates a single-port RAM using Altera's `altsyncram` on Cyclone IV GX devices. It handles 8-bit addresses and 32-bit data I/O driven by signals for read and write enable. Internally, connects `altsyncram` outputs through `sub_wire0` to provide seamless data transfer, and is configured to restrict runtime changes and async clears, ensuring stable operation.
