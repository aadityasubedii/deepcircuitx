It takes an 8-bit address and 32-bit data input and provides a 32-bit data output. The RAM can be accessed for read or write operations based on the read enable (rden) and write enable (wren) signals. This module is configured primarily for use with Cyclone IV GX devices, optimized for single-port operations with a specific memory initialization file (\"RAM_speech_22.mif\"), and does not support output data asynchronous clear or enable runtime modification. The module maps these functionalities through specific parameters setup to the altsyncram component."

It drives the internal timing of reads and writes.\n- `data` (32-bit): This port provides the data that is to be written into the RAM at the location specified by the `address` input when writing is enabled.\n- `rden` (1-bit): Read enable signal, which when activated, allows data at the specified memory location to be read and output through the `q` port.\n- `wren` (1-bit): Write enable signal, which when activated, allows the data on the `data` input to be written into the memory location specified by the `address` input.\n\nOutput ports: [q].\nExplanation: \n- `q` (32-bit): This port outputs the data from the location specified by the `address` input, provided the read operation is enabled through the `rden` signal.
