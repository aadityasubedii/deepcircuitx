Module name: lpc_to_lsp. Module specification: This module implements a Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) to Line Spectral Pairs (LSP) conversion algorithm. It takes LPC coefficients as input and converts them to LSP frequencies. The module has input ports for start signal (startltl), clock (clk), reset (rst), LPC coefficients (ak_out, ak_0 to ak_10), and output ports for LSP frequencies (freq0 to freq9), done signal (doneltl), address for accessing LPC coefficients (ak_addr), and intermediate calculation results (c_psum, c_sig). Internally, it uses various signals for state management, counters, polynomial coefficients, and intermediate calculations. The module is structured with a finite state machine controlling the conversion process, which includes initializing variables, calculating polynomial coefficients, finding roots of polynomials,
