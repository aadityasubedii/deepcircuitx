It uses the 'altsyncram' component from Altera to handle the storage and retrieval of data, configured for a specific device family and a defined memory initialization file. The RAM is configured with an 8-bit address width and a 32-bit data width, allowing storage of 160 words, namely in 'SINGLE_PORT' operation mode which allows only one port for read and write operations. This setup is ideal for applications where data throughput and access time are critical, and configuration specifics like clock behavior and power settings are optimized for performance and reliability in an FPGA environment."
