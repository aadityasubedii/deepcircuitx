The RAM supports read and write operations controlled by the input signals 'rden' and 'wren' respectively. The RAM's operation, including the address and data management, is synchronized by the 'clock' signal. This module is also set up with an initialization file (\"RAM_speech_103.mif\") which could be used to preload data into the RAM. The RAM is configured to have a width of 32 bits and is addressable with an 8-bit address, providing a total of 160 words. It doesn't allow data to be read during a write operation at the same address, as specified by the 'read_during_write_mode_port_a' parameter."
