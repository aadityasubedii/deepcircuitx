    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_103. \nModule specification: The RAM_speech_103 module is a single-port RAM designed for the Cyclone IV GX FPGA, using Verilog. It facilitates read and write operations synchronized by an input 'clock' signal, acting on a 32-bit 'data' input to an 8-bit 'address'. The module asserts read operations through the 'rden' input and writes via the 'wren' input. The output 'q' gives the 32-bit data read from the memory. Internally, the module uses a signal, 'sub_wire0', serving as a bridge to transfer data from the altsyncram component to the output port 'q'. The 'altsyncram_component' defined within the code directly handles the synchronism and data movement, parameterized by several settings including operational mode, memory size, and initial data content through a .mif file. These settings ensure that the RAM operates correctly in its intended FPGA environment, setting up data width, addressing specifications, and safety against data corruption during simultaneous read-write operations. The code structure includes parameter definitions for the 'altsyncram' block, ensuring specific hardware configuration and operation aligned with the Cyclone IV GX FPGA requirements.",
