    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_140. \nModule specification: The RAM_speech_140 module is designated for storing and managing speech data, employing a single-port synchronous RAM component to facilitate storage operations. It supports 160 words, each 32 bits wide, using a 8-bit address for access. Input ports include an 8-bit 'address' for selecting memory locations, a 'clock' signal to synchronize operations, a 32-bit 'data' port to input data, alongside 'rden' (read enable) and 'wren' (write enable) controls to manage reading and writing functions respectively. The output is delivered via a 32-bit 'q' port, which outputs data read from the specified memory address. Internally, a wire 'sub_wire0' acts as a connector, transferring data from the internal 'altsyncram_component' to the 'q' output. The 'altsyncram_component' utilizes parameters and configurations ideally suited for the Cyclone IV GX device family, enhancing functionality such as operation modes, initial conditions, and runtime capabilities. The module predominantly orchestrates data storage and retrieval through meticulous control of read and write operations conditioned by the input signals, thereby aligning with the targeted RAM functionalities for speech data handling within digital systems.",

It utilizes a single-port synchronous RAM component named 'altsyncram' for storing and retrieving data. The module interfaces with external systems via inputs for address, clock, data, read enable (rden), and write enable (wren), and outputs the data through the 'q' output. The configuration parameters of the altsyncram suggest that the memory is organized with 160 words, each 32 bits wide, accessible with an 8-bit wide address. The module supports functionalities like write and read controlled by the 'wren' and 'rden' signals respectively, with specific configurations meant to optimize for runtime operations and device compatibility (targeted for Cyclone IV GX family). The RAM does not initiate with preloaded data and does not allow reading while writing, as indicated by its 'NEW_DATA_NO_NBE_READ' mode setting. This module is likely part of a larger system dealing with speech data, possibly in processing or communication applications."
