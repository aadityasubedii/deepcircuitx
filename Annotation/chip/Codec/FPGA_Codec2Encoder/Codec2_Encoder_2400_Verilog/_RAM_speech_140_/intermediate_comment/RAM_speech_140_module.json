    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_140 module implements a single-port synchronous RAM specifically for speech data storage, utilizing 160x32-bit memory cells addressed by an 8-bit input. It manages data with input ports for address, data, clock, read enable, and write enable, and outputs data through the 'q' port. Internally, the 'sub_wire0' connects the altsyncram component output to the module's output, facilitating smooth data retrieval. The module is optimized for Cyclone IV GX devices and is configured to ensure efficient runtime operations."
