Module name: RAM_speech_140. 
Module specification: The RAM_speech_140 module is designated for storing and managing speech data, employing a single-port synchronous RAM component to facilitate storage operations. It supports 160 words, each 32 bits wide, using a 8-bit address for access. Input ports include an 8-bit 'address' for selecting memory locations, a 'clock' signal to synchronize operations, a 32-bit 'data' port to input data, alongside 'rden' (read enable) and 'wren' (write enable) controls to manage reading and writing functions respectively. The output is delivered via a 32-bit 'q' port, which outputs data read from the specified memory address. Internally, a wire 'sub_wire0' acts as a connector, transferring data from the internal 'altsyncram_component' to the 'q' output. The 'altsyncram_component' utilizes parameters and configurations ideally suited for the Cyclone IV GX device family, enhancing functionality such as operation modes, initial conditions, and runtime capabilities. The module predominantly orchestrates data storage and retrieval through meticulous control of read and write operations conditioned by the input signals, thereby aligning with the targeted RAM functionalities for speech data handling within digital systems.
