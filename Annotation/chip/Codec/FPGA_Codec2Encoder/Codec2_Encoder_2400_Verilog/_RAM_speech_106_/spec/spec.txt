Module name: RAM_speech_106. Module specification: The RAM_speech_106 module is a single-port RAM designed specifically for storing speech data on Altera FPGA devices, utilizing the 'altsyncram' component tailored for Cyclone IV GX devices. It accepts an 8-bit 'address' input for choosing the memory location, a 32-bit 'data' input for writing content, and individual 'rden' (read enable) and 'wren' (write enable) control signals to manage read and write operations, respectively. The module uses a 'clock' input for synchronization of data operations. The output of the module, 'q', is a 32-bit signal that presents the data read from the specified address. Internally, the module employs a wire signal 'sub_wire0', a 32-bit buffer that temporarily stores the data fetched from the memory before being output to 'q'. The code includes the instantiation of the 'altsyncram' component which handles the actual memory storage and data retrieval functionalities. The component is set with specific parameters like disabling runtime modifications, initializing data through a predefined file, and settings optimized for the intended FPGA family. This setup ensures efficient data storage and retrieval suitable for applications involving speech data processing without memory retention post power-reset unless initialized from the memory initialization file (MIF).
