Module name: quantise. Module specification: The quantise module implements a vector quantization process using a state machine approach. It takes input signals clk (clock), rst (reset), startq (start quantization), m (5-bit number of codebook entries), orderi (4-bit codebook order), and vec (N-bit input vector, default 32 bits). The module outputs besti (5-bit index of best matching codebook entry) and doneq (1-bit completion signal). Internally, it uses registers for state management (STATE, NEXT_STATE), error calculation (e, beste), codebook entries (cb0-cb15), and various intermediate values. The module operates through several states, including initialization, error calculation, comparison, and result determination. It utilizes fixed-point arithmetic for calculations and supports different codebook orders and sizes. The quantization process involves comparing the input vector against codebook entries, calculating
