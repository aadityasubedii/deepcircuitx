It takes an input vector and compares it against a set of codebook values to find the best matching entry. The module uses a state machine to control the quantization process, including initializing values, calculating errors between the input and codebook entries, finding the minimum error, and determining the best matching index. The module supports different codebook orders and sizes, and uses fixed-point arithmetic for calculations. The output includes the best matching index and a done signal when the quantization is complete."
