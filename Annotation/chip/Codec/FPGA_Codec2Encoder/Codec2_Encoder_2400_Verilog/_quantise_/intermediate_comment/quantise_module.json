    "module": "Module-level comment: // This module performs vector quantization using a state machine approach.\n// It compares an input vector against a codebook, finds the best matching entry,\n// and outputs the corresponding index. The module uses fixed-point arithmetic,\n// supports various codebook orders and sizes, and implements error calculation\n// and comparison logic to determine the optimal match."
