Module-level comment: // This module performs vector quantization using a state machine approach.
// It compares an input vector against a codebook, finds the best matching entry,
// and outputs the corresponding index. The module uses fixed-point arithmetic,
// supports various codebook orders and sizes, and implements error calculation
// and comparison logic to determine the optimal match.
