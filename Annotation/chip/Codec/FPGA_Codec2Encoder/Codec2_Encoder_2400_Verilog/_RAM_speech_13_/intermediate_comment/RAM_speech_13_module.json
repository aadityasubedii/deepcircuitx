    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_13 module functions as a single-port RAM tailored for speech data storage, using an `altsyncram` component from Intel FPGA. It supports input signals for addressing, writing, and reading operations synchronized by a clock, and outputs the data from the specified address when read is enabled. Internal configurations define memory aspects like size, type, and behavior during read/write, ensuring optimized performance for targeted applications."
