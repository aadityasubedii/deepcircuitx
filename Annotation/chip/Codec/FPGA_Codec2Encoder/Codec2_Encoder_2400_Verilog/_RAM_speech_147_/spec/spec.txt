Module name: RAM_speech_147. 
Module specification: RAM_speech_147 is a Verilog module designed to function as a configurable single-port RAM tailored for speech processing applications, utilizing an Altera-specific altsyncram component for flexibility in configuration. The module accepts five input ports: an 8-bit 'address' to specify memory location, a 'clock' signal for synchronization, a 32-bit 'data' input for writing operations, and control signals 'rden' and 'wren' to enable reading and writing, respectively. The output is a 32-bit 'q' which holds data read from the specified RAM location. Internally, the module uses a wire signal 'sub_wire0' which acts as a data conduit from the altsyncram component to the 'q' output following read operations. The module harnesses the altsyncram component's functionalities by setting up parameters such as the device family, memory initialization, and operational modes. This setup supports specific configurations like clock management and data handling characteristics essential for handling and accessing speech data efficiently in systems using the Cyclone IV GX device family.
