Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_147 module implements a single-port RAM for speech processing, using an Altera-specific altsyncram component. It handles 8-bit addresses and 32-bit data inputs with read/write control via 'rden' and 'wren'. The output 'q' delivers data from the selected address. Configuration for the Cyclone IV GX family ensures optimal memory operation, leveraging parameters like operation mode and initialization files to manage data efficiently.
