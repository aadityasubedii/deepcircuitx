Module name: codec2_encoder_mode2400. Module specification: This module implements a CODEC2 speech encoder operating in 2400 bps mode. It processes 150 frames of speech data, encoding 10 frames (140-149) into bit streams. The module has three input ports: clk (clock), rst (active-low reset), and start_codec2 (trigger to start encoding). Output ports include encoded_bits_0[47:0] (encoded bits for the first frame), clk_count[69:0] (70-bit counter for timing), and done_codec2 (completion signal). Internally, it uses numerous signals for state management, data storage, and memory access, including encoded_bits_1 to encoded_bits_9 for storing encoded bits of frames 1-9, sp0 to sp9 for speech samples, and various address and control signals for RAM
