Module-level comment: This module implements the Levinson-Durbin algorithm for LPC analysis, calculating LPC coefficients from autocorrelation values. It uses a state machine to control the algorithm's steps, including initialization, coefficient calculation, error estimation, and final LPC coefficient computation. The module processes input autocorrelation values (R0-R10) and outputs the resulting LPC coefficients. It employs fixed-point arithmetic and multiple multiplication/addition units for efficient calculations.
