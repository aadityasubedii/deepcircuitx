    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_50 module is a single-port RAM designed for the Cyclone IV GX FPGA, featuring an embedded `altsyncram` for efficient storage and retrieval tasks. It supports reading and writing via `rden` and `wren` signals, with a synchronized `clock` and 8-bit `address` input directing access to 32-bit `data` embodied in the output port `q`. The internal `sub_wire0` facilitates data flow from the `altsyncram` component to the output."
