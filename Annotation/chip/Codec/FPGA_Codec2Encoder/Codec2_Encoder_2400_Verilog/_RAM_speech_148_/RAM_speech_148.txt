Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_148 module simulates a single-port synchronous RAM optimized for Cyclone IV GX FPGAs. It supports data writing and reading at specific addresses controlled via input signals: address, clock, data, rden, and wren. Internally, it utilizes an 'altsyncram' component with configuration settings from 'RAM_speech_148.mif', managing memory operations effectively, ensuring data integrity during read/write activities.
