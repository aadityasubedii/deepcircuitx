Module-level comment: This module implements a speech/audio signal processing unit with notch filtering, FFT, and post-processing. It takes input signals, performs calculations through multiple stages controlled by a state machine, and outputs processed results including pitch. The module uses memory components, arithmetic operations, and a pipeline architecture to process input data, applying notch filtering, FFT, and spectral analysis techniques to estimate fundamental frequency and pitch.
