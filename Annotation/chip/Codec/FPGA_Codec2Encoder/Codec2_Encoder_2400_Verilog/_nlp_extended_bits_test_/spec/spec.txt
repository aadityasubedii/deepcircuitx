Module name: nlp_extended_bits_test. Module specification: This module implements a complex signal processing unit for speech or audio processing, including notch filtering, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and post-processing operations. It takes input signals (startnlp, clk, rst, nlp_mem_x, nlp_mem_y, prev_f0) and produces output signals (best_f0, out_prev_f0, donenlp, pitch, nlp_mem_x_out, nlp_mem_y_out). The module uses various internal signals for addressing, state control, and arithmetic operations, such as i1, i, j, addr_sn, STATE, NEXT_STATE, ms1_in1, ms1_in2, notch, mem_x, mem_y, startfft, and gmax. The code is organized into several main sections
