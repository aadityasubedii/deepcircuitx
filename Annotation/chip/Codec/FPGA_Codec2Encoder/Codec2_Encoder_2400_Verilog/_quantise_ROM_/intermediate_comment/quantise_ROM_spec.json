    "spec": "Module name: quantise_ROM. \nModule specification: The 'quantise_ROM' module is designed to perform vector quantization by comparing an input vector 'vec' against a set of vectors from a codebook and identifying the vector that has the minimum difference from 'vec'. It utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) to manage its operations across numerous states. Input ports include 'clk' (clock signal for timing), 'rst' (reset signal to initialize module states), 'm' (number of vectors in the codebook to compare), 'orderi' (selector for different sets of codebook vectors), and 'vec' (input vector to be quantized). The output ports consist of 'besti' (index of the codebook vector that matches the input vector best) and 'doneq' (signal to indicate completion of the quantization process). Internal signals such as 'e' (current error calculated by subtraction), 'beste' (best or minimal error encountered), 'cb' (selected codebook vector), among others, facilitate internal computations. The FSM in the code moves through several states like initializing, setting the codebook vector, calculating error, and finally indicating the completion of quantization process through state transitions that handle the computation and update of the aforementioned internal signals efficiently. Each state in the FSM is tailored to progress through essential steps of vector quantization, right from initialization to the completion of the process.",

This quantization task involves several operations including initialization, iterative error calculation (subtraction and absolute value), checking and updating the minimum error, and iterating over all potential vectors in a predetermined set, referred to by 'cb_dataout'.

This module uses a finite state machine to handle the sequence of operations, driven by a clock 'clk' and reset 'rst'.

It is used to initialize or re-initialize the module\u2019s internal state to a defined start state, typically when this signal is at a low (0).\n  - `m`: Represents the total number of codebook vectors to be compared against the input vector `vec`.

It utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) to manage its operations across numerous states. Input ports include 'clk' (clock signal for timing), 'rst' (reset signal to initialize module states), 'm' (number of vectors in the codebook to compare), 'orderi' (selector for different sets of codebook vectors), and 'vec' (input vector to be quantized). The output ports consist of 'besti' (index of the codebook vector that matches the input vector best) and 'doneq' (signal to indicate completion of the quantization process). Internal signals such as 'e' (current error calculated by subtraction), 'beste' (best or minimal error encountered), 'cb' (selected codebook vector), among others, facilitate internal computations. The FSM in the code moves through several states like initializing, setting the codebook vector, calculating error, and finally indicating the completion of quantization process through state transitions that handle the computation and update of the aforementioned internal signals efficiently. Each state in the FSM is tailored to progress through essential steps of vector quantization, right from initialization to the completion of the process."
