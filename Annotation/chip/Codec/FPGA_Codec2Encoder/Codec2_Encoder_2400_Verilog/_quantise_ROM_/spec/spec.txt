Module name: quantise_ROM. 
Module specification: The 'quantise_ROM' module is designed to perform vector quantization by comparing an input vector 'vec' against a set of vectors from a codebook and identifying the vector that has the minimum difference from 'vec'. It utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) to manage its operations across numerous states. Input ports include 'clk' (clock signal for timing), 'rst' (reset signal to initialize module states), 'm' (number of vectors in the codebook to compare), 'orderi' (selector for different sets of codebook vectors), and 'vec' (input vector to be quantized). The output ports consist of 'besti' (index of the codebook vector that matches the input vector best) and 'doneq' (signal to indicate completion of the quantization process). Internal signals such as 'e' (current error calculated by subtraction), 'beste' (best or minimal error encountered), 'cb' (selected codebook vector), among others, facilitate internal computations. The FSM in the code moves through several states like initializing, setting the codebook vector, calculating error, and finally indicating the completion of quantization process through state transitions that handle the computation and update of the aforementioned internal signals efficiently. Each state in the FSM is tailored to progress through essential steps of vector quantization, right from initialization to the completion of the process.
