Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_111 module is a single-port RAM specifically optimized for Altera Cyclone IV GX FPGA, supporting a fixed 160-word memory with 32-bit wide data. It interfaces via ports: 8-bit address, 32-bit data, a clock, and read/write enable signals. Internally, it uses the `altsyncram` component configured for non-clearing synchronous data output, no runtime modifications, and maintaining new data on read-during-write scenarios.
