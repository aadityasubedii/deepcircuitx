It is configured to interface with an 8-bit address and a 32-bit data bus. The RAM allows for read and write operations controlled by separate read enable (rden) and write enable (wren) signals. The RAM is initialized from a memory initialization file (\"RAM_speech_111.mif\") and does not allow runtime modification of the content. The RAM does not clear its output data on any internal signal resets (outdata_aclr_a set to \"NONE\"), and it outputs data synchronous to clock0. The RAM has a defined number of words set to 160, and the read-during-write behavior is configured to output new data without considering the byte enable (NEW_DATA_NO_NBE_READ)."
