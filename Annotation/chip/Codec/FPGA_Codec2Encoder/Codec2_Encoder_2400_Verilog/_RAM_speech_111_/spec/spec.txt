Module name: RAM_speech_111. Module specification: The RAM_speech_111 module is designed for use in Altera Cyclone IV GX FPGA family, and it implements a single-port RAM with specific configurations. It interacts through input ports which include an 8-bit 'address' to select RAM location, a 'clock' signal for synchronization, a 32-bit 'data' port for input data, and 'rden' and 'wren' signals for enabling read and write operations, respectively. The output port 'q' delivers a 32-bit data read from the specified address. Internally, the module uses 'sub_wire0', a 32-bit wire that connects the output of the 'altsyncram' component to 'q', ensuring data flows seamlessly within the module during read operations. The core functionality of the module is encapsulated within the 'altsyncram_component', a pre-defined FPGA component configured here to facilitate operations like writing from an initialization file, blocking runtime modifications, and supporting settings like non-clearing output on resets. Specific parameters like the number of words, data width, and the behaviour during a read-during-write operation are precisely defined, emphasizing the module's customization for reliable RAM management in targeted FPGA applications.
