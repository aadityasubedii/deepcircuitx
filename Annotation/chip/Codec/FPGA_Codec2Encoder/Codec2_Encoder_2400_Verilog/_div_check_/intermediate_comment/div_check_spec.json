    "spec": "Module name: div_check.  \nModule specification: The `div_check` module is specifically designed to handle floating-point division operations. This module does not have external input ports and relies on internally defined constants `d1_in1` and `d1_in2` for division operands. The result of the division is held in an output port named `d_out`, which has a size defined by the parameter `N` (32 bits in this case). Within the module, the division operation is carried out by an instance of the floating-point divider (`fpdiv`) named `divider1`. This IP core is parameterized with constants `Q` (16 bits of precision) and `N` (total bit width). The result of the division from `divider1` is temporarily stored in an internal wire `d1_out` of size `N-1:0`. This wire serves as the intermediary storage for the division result `d1_in1` / `d1_in2` before it gets transferred to `d_out` in the procedural block defined by an `always@(*)` construct, which ensures that `d_out` is continuously updated with the value of `d1_out`. This setup forms a simple yet effective floating-point division module with no external dependencies apart from its internal parameterization and instantiation of the `fpdiv` block.",
