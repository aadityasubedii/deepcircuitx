Module-level comment: The `div_check` module performs floating-point division of internally defined constants `d1_in1` and `d1_in2` using a parameterized floating-point divider IP (`fpdiv`). The module, devoid of external inputs, directly outputs the division result at `d_out` after capturing it within an internal wire `d1_out`. This setup uses an `always@(*)` block to update `d_out` based on `d1_out`, efficiently reflecting the division's outcome.
