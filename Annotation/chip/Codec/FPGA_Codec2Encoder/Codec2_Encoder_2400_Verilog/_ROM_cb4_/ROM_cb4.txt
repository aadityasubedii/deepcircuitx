Module-level comment: The ROM_cb4 module simulates a 32-bit read-only memory where a 4-bit address 'addr' selects one of 16 pre-loaded values from an internal array 'cb4'. The selected value is output through 'dataout'. Operation is handled within a combinational always block, which promptly assigns values based on address changes, effectively demonstrating ROM functionality in digital circuits.
