Module name: ROM_cb4. 
Module specification: The ROM_cb4 is a Verilog module designed to simulate a read-only memory (ROM) function, storing and retrieving predefined 32-bit data values based on a 4-bit address input. The module has one input port 'addr', which is a 4-bit signal used to select one of the sixteen 32-bit values from the internal ROM storage. The output port 'dataout' is a 32-bit signal that outputs the value retrieved from the ROM storage at the address specified by 'addr'. Internally, the module defines a signal 'cb4', an array of sixteen 32-bit registers initialized with specified binary-encoded values. This array serves as the ROM storage, holding the data values that can be accessed via the address input. The combinational logic in the module, encapsulated within an always block triggered by any changes to input signals, assigns the data from the specified address of the 'cb4' array to the 'dataout' output port. This module primarily serves to demonstrate simple ROM operations in digital designs, containing both data storage and retrieval mechanisms governed by input address lines.
