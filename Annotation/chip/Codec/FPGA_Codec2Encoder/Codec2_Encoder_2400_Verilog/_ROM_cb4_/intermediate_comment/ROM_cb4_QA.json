The module consists of an input 'addr' which selects one of the data elements from the ROM storage array named 'cb4'. The value from the selected address is then outputted through 'dataout'. This module uses a combinational logic block to perform the data retrieval, as the output is updated instantly in response to changes in the input address. The data stored in 'cb4' seems binary-encoded and is indexed from 0 to 15, accessible through a 4-bit address line."

This array serves as the storage unit within the ROM_cb4 module, where 'N' is a parameter set to 32, meaning each element of the array holds 32-bit data.

Each position in the array is loaded with a distinct 32-bit binary-encoded value, designated to be output through 'dataout' depending on the address pointed by 'addr'. The 'cb4' array is central in maintaining the read-only data that the module outputs, making it the primary memory component of this ROM structure."
