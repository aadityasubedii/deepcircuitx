    "spec": "Module name: test_speech_to_uq_lsps.\nModule specification: The 'test_speech_to_uq_lsps' module serves as a controller for converting speech data into Linear Spectral Pair (LSP) values using a state machine approach. It starts its operation when the 'start_tspeech' input signal is received. The module operates synchronously with a clock signal 'clk' and can be reset using the 'rst' signal. The end of the process is signaled by 'done_tspeech', which indicates the completion of the speech processing. The module also outputs 'check_E', which represents the energy of the processed speech. Internally, the module includes several registers such as 'STATE' for tracking the current state of the state machine, and 'addr_sn' for addressing in RAM. There is also a 'startspeech' signal that triggers the speech processing in a submodule. The module manages data flow through RAM operations controlled by signals such as 're_c2_sn' (read enable) and 'we_c2_sn' (write enable), and handles transitions between various states like START, START_SPEECH, RUN_SPEECH, GET_SPEECH, and DONE to manage the overall process. The associated submodule 'speech_to_uq_lsps' further decomposes the speech to LSP and calculates the energy and LSP values, which are made available through the 'E_speech' signal and other related outputs. This structured approach ensures efficient and orderly processing of speech data to LSP values, suited for tasks requiring uniform quantization of speech spectral characteristics.",
