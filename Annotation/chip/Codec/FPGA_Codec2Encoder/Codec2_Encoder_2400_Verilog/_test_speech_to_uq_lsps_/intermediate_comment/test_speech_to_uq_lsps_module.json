    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test_speech_to_uq_lsps' module manages the conversion of speech data to LSP values using a state machine. It initiates with 'start_tspeech' and transitions through states to process speech via the 'speech_to_uq_lsps' submodule and RAM operations. Completion is signaled by 'done_tspeech', and speech energy is output as 'check_E'. This implementation ensures synchronized, efficient processing tailored for uniform quantization of spectral characteristics."
