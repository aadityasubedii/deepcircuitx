    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_113 module functions as a single-port RAM, interfacing with an 8-bit address and 32-bit data bus, synchronized by a clock. It supports read and write operations controlled by 'rden' and 'wren' signals. Data is temporarily held in an internal wire 'sub_wire0' from 'altsyncram' component before outputting to 'q'. Settings in 'altsyncram' define memory specifics and operational mode, ensuring effective data handling within FPGA environments."
