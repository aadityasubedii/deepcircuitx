Module name: RAM_speech_113. Module specification: The RAM_speech_113 module is designed as a single-port RAM utilizing the 'altsyncram' component with an initialized memory file for a digital system, likely utilized within FPGA-based applications. It interfaces with input ports including an 8-bit 'address' for targeting specific memory addresses, a 'clock' signal to synchronize operations, a 32-bit 'data' bus for input data, and control signals 'rden' and 'wren' for read and write operations respectively. The output is given through a 32-bit 'q' port which provides the data read from the specified memory address. Internally, the module includes a 32-bit wire 'sub_wire0' that temporarily holds data output from the 'altsyncram' component before being output to 'q'. The main blocks in the code comprise input and output port definitions, internal signal declarations, and configuration of the embedded 'altsyncram' component. This component is deeply configured with parameters such as the device family, operational mode, memory specifics, and others, ensuring correct operation as a single-port RAM. The module's functionality, well-defined port roles, and internal mechanics are conducive for tasks related to data storage or buffering, potentially for applications handling speech data as its name suggests.
