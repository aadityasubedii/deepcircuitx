It uses an instance of \"altsyncram,\" a parameterizable single-port or dual-port RAM component from Altera (now part of Intel). The module interfaces include an 8-bit address input, a 32-bit data input/output, and control signals for read, write, and clock operations. Configuration parameters for the RAM such as operation mode, memory initialization file, and device family specifics are set using the `defparam` syntax, suggesting that the RAM functionality can be customized at compilation time to cater to specific run-time modifications and device family optimizations."
