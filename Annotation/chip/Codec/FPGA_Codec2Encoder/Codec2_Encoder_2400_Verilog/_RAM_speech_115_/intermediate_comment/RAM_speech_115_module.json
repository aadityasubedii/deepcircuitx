    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_115 module functions as a single-port RAM, primarily using Altera's `altsyncram` component. It handles 32-bit data and 8-bit address inputs, with separate signals for read and write operations implemented on a Cyclone IV GX FPGA. The module incorporates an intermediate wire, `sub_wire0`, for reliable data handling before outputting via the `q` port. Configuration settings prevent runtime modifications, ensuring stable operation according to predefined specifications."
