Module name: compute_weights.
Module specification: The "compute_weights" module is responsible for calculating two output weights, `w0` and `w1`, based on several input signals (`x0`, `x1`, `xp0`, and `xp1`) using a combination of fixed-point arithmetic operations within a Finite State Machine (FSM). The module synchronizes its operations using a clock signal `clk` and can be reset using an active-low reset signal `rst`. The module employs intermediate signals like `w0_s1` to `w1_s7` for results of fixed-point multiplications and `add1` to `add3` for additions, which are crucial in computing the output weights during different states of the FSM. The FSM transitions through various states (`START`, `S1` to `S7`, and `DONE`) based on the results of fixed-point comparisons (`lt1` to `lt5`, `gt1`) to handle different computational paths and finally sets the `done_cw` flag when the computation is complete. The module's functionality is divided into three key sections: handling reset conditions and state transition on clock edges, determining the next state based on logic and comparisons, and computing the outputs in each state. The module integrates these operations to ensure accurate computation and synchronization within a digital system where operations are tied to specific clock cycles.
