    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"compute_weights\" module calculates weights `w0` and `w1` using fixed-point arithmetic based on inputs `x0`, `x1`, `xp0`, and `xp1`. It operates under a clock and reset signals and uses an FSM for control flow, progressing through states that determine the computational path using multiplications (`qmult`), additions (`qadd`), and comparisons (`fplessthan`, `fpgreaterthan`). Outputs and transitions are dependent on state evaluations, ensuring precise and synchronized computations."
