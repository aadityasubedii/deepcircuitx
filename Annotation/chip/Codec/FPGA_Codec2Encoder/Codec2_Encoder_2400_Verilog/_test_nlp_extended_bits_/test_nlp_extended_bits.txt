Module-level comment: This module implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm for speech/audio processing, featuring extended bit precision. It performs signal processing, FFT, and pitch estimation using a finite state machine. The module processes input data through multiple stages including initialization, data reading, FFT computation, and post-processing. It utilizes external memory components and custom arithmetic units for complex calculations, ultimately producing outputs such as best fundamental frequency and pitch.
