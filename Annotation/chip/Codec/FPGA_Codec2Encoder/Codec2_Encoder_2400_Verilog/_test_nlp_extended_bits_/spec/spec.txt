Module name: test_nlp_extended_bits. Module specification: This module implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm with extended bit precision for speech or audio processing. It performs signal processing, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and pitch estimation. The module has input ports for initiating NLP processing (startnlp), clock (clk), reset (rst), and previous fundamental frequency (prev_f0). Output ports include the estimated best fundamental frequency (best_f0), output of previous fundamental frequency (out_prev_f0), calculated pitch (pitch), memory outputs for x and y values (nlp_mem_x_out, nlp_mem_y_out), completion signal (donenlp), and a debug signal (check_sig1). Internally, it uses various signals for state management (STATE, NEXT_STATE), loop counters (i, j, i1), memory addressing (addr_
