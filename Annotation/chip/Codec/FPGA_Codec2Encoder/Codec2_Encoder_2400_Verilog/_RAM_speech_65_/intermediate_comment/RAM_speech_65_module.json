    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_65 module implements a single-port RAM using an `altsyncram` component from Altera for speech data handling. It supports basic RAM operations with inputs for address, data, and clock signals, managed through read and write enable flags. Outputs reflect read data. Configurations like data width, device family, and operational modes are customized directly within the `altsyncram` component's parameters, optimized for concurrent read/write without data initialization on power-up."
