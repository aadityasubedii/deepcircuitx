    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_79. \n\nModule specification: The RAM_speech_79 is a single-port RAM module designed using Altera-specific primitives to address memory storage tasks, particularly utilizing the `altsyncram` component for effective memory management tailored for Cyclone IV GX devices. The module interfaces via input ports - an 8-bit `address` for specifying memory locations, a `clock` signal for synchronization, a 32-bit `data` bus for writing data, plus `rden` and `wren` signals for enabling read and write operations respectively. The output is facilitated through a 32-bit `q` port, which delivers the data read from memory based on the address provided. Internally, the module employs a 32-bit wire `sub_wire0` which serves as an intermediary to transfer data from the `altsyncram` component's output to the `q` output port, ensuring data read operations are executed accurately. The code features sections including module declaration, port definitions, internal signal declarations, instantiation of the `altsyncram` component with detailed parameter configurations which define characteristics like device family, memory size, operation mode, among others, and finally, mapping the component ports to internal and module ports. This design effectively encapsulates a memory solution optimized for specific hardware configurations and operational needs.",
