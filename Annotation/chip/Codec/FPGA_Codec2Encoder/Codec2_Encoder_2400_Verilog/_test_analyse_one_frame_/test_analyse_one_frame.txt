Module-level comment: This module performs speech analysis on a single frame, implementing a state machine to coordinate multiple processing stages including windowing, FFT, NLP estimation, TSPR, amplitude estimation, and voicing estimation. It uses various sub-modules and memory units to process input data through these stages, outputting parameters such as pitch estimates, frequency content, and voicing information. The module operates in a sequential manner, progressing through different states to complete each processing step before moving to the next, ultimately providing a comprehensive analysis of the input speech frame.
