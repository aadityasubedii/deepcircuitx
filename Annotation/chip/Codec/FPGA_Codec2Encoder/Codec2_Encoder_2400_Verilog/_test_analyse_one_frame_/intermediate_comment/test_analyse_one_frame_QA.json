Implements Two-Stage Pitch Refinement (TSPR)\n5. Estimates amplitudes of frequency components\n6. Estimates voicing for Model-Based Enhancement (MBE)\n\nThe module coordinates these operations in a state machine, processing input data through multiple stages to analyze speech characteristics like pitch, frequency content, and voicing. It uses various sub-modules and memory units to carry out these tasks, and outputs several parameters related to the analyzed speech frame."
