Module-level comment: The "square" module performs a left bitwise shift on a predefined 32-bit value 'in', effectively doubling it. This module directly assigns the shifted result to a 32-bit output port 'sq', with no additional input ports or internal signals used, demonstrating a compact and direct implementation of the functionality.
