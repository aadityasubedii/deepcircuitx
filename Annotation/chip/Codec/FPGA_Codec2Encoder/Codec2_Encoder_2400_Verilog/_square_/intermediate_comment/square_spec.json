    "spec": "Module name: square. Module specification: The \"square\" module is designed in Verilog to perform a bitwise left shift operation on a hard-coded 32-bit parameter named 'in'. This operation multiplies the value of 'in' by 2. The module does not feature any input ports since it directly utilizes the predefined parameter 'in' for its computation. The result of this operation is then output through a single 32-bit output port named 'sq', where the left-shifted value is made available. Internally, the module does not employ any additional signals; it directly assigns the shifted result to the output port 'sq'. The code is straightforward as it comprises mainly the declaration and initialization of the parameter and the output port, coupled with the assignment statement that performs the left shift operation. This concise design efficiently encapsulates the functionality of doubling a predetermined number without the need for external inputs or additional internal computation structures.",
