    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_146 module implements a single-port RAM with an 8-bit address and 32-bit data interface, using Altera's `altsyncram` component tailored for Cyclone IV GX FPGAs. It supports synchronized read/write operations controlled by the `rden` and `wren` signals. The RAM behavior, size, and other settings are specified via `defparams`, ensuring specific FPGA functionality, including an initialization from a memory file."
