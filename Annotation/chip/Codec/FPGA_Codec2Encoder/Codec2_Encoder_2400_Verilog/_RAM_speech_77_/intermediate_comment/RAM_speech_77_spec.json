    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_77. \n\nModule specification: The RAM_speech_77 module is a single-port RAM designed for use with Cyclone IV GX FPGA devices, utilizing Verilog for its implementation. The module functions by taking a 8-bit address and 32-bit data input, along with control signals for read and write operations, and provides a 32-bit data output corresponding to the read operation. The input ports include `address` which specifies the RAM access location, `clock` to synchronize operations, `data` holding the write data, `rden` for read enabling, and `wren` for write enabling. The sole output port, `q`, corresponds to the data retrieved from the given address when read is enabled. Internally, the module uses a signal `sub_wire0` which transfers data from the `altsyncram` block's output to the module\u2019s output `q`. The architecture is centered around the `altsyncram` component which manages RAM operations such as data reading based on address and control inputs, and writing when enabled. Parameters like initialization from an MIF file, and specific behaviors like read-during-write, are configured within this block. This module encapsulates a reliable RAM structure providing data storage and retrieval specifically optimized for speech or similar applications where specific configuration and stable performance are critical.",
