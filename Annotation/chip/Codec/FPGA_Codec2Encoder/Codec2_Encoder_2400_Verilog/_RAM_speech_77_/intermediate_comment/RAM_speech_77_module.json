    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_77 module serves as a single-port RAM on Cyclone IV GX FPGA, handling 8-bit addresses and 32-bit data I/O. It uses `altsyncram` for synchronization and data management, supporting specific configurations via parameters such as initialization files and read-during-write behaviors. Internal signal `sub_wire0` connects `altsyncram` output to the module's output, facilitating data read operations enhanced for speech-related applications."
