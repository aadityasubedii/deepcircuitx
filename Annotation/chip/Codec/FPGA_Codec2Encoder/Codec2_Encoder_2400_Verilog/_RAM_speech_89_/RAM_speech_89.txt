Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_89 module is a single-port RAM designed for the Cyclone IV GX, performing read and write operations on 32-bit speech data. It utilizes an `altsyncram` component with parameters for memory initialization and operational modes, handling data through input/output ports (address, data, q) and control signals (rden, wren), synchronized by a clock. Internal wiring uses `sub_wire0` for transitioning data to the output `q`.
