It is used for storing and retrieving data, configured via parameters such as memory initialization file (\"RAM_speech_89.mif\") and operational modes. The RAM accepts an 8-bit address and a 32-bit data input, and it outputs a 32-bit data corresponding to the input address. The module operates with control signals for read and write operations, and is particularly designed to handle speech data as suggested by its name."
