Module name: cossin_cordic. 

Module specification: The "cossin_cordic" module implements the COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm to calculate the sine and cosine of an input angle (beta). This calculation is accurate and executed in a pipelined fashion suitable for hardware implementations. The module operates based on input signals, startcossin (to begin computation), clk (clock signal for synchronization), rst (reset signal), and beta (the input angle in radians). It outputs values through the ports cos (cosine of input angle), sin (sine of input angle), donecossin (indicates completion of computation), theta, and several diagnostic and intermediate signals such as c_theta, sig_check, c_fmod, and c_in_1. Internally, the module leverages various registers and wires such as STATE, NEXT_STATE (to handle state transitions), multiple arithmetic operators inputs like m1_in1, m1_in2 (multipliers input), and several control signals like startfmod for the modulo operation. The moduleâ€™s behavior is characterized based on a state machine with numerous states like START, INIT, CHECK_IF, various ANGLE_SHIFT states, and DONE for managing computations across stages and making transitional decisions based on the intermediate results. The design includes arithmetic units (multipliers and adders), comparators, and a modulo operator to facilitate angle adjustments, iterations, and normalization required by the CORDIC algorithm. These functionalities ensure high computational accuracy and efficiency appropriate for digital signal processing applications.
