It takes the input angle and processes it through various stages and conditions dictated by a state machine to produce the cosine (cos) and sine (sin) values as output. The signals and various steps within the module suggest it adjusts the input angle under certain conditions, uses mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication, and modulo to compute iterations according to the CORDIC algorithm in specified states, and ultimately outputs the cosine and sine after normalizing the results. Additionally, the module tracks the progress and completion of computations through a 'donecossin' signal, indicating when the cosine and sine values are ready."
