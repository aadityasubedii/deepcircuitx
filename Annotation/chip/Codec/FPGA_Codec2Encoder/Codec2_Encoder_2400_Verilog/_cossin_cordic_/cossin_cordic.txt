Module-level comment: The "cossin_cordic" module computes the sine and cosine of an input angle using the CORDIC algorithm. It utilizes a state machine to manage the computational stages dictated by angle adjustments and normalization across iterations. The module relies on arithmetic units, comparators, and a modulo operator, controlled by synchronized inputs such as startcossin, clk, and rst, to output cos and sin values efficiently after computations conclude as signaled by donecossin.
