    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"RAM_speech_47\" module implements a single-port RAM specific to Cyclone IV GX FPGA, using an 8-bit address for data location, and 32-bit interfaces for data input/output. It utilizes the altsyncram component for memory operations configured for non-volatile loading from \"RAM_speech_47.mif\". Key controls include separate read and write enables, and no clear on reset, achieving reliable data integrity and straightforward interfacing."
