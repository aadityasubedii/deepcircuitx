Module name: levinson_durbin. Module specification: The levinson_durbin module implements the Levinson-Durbin algorithm for linear predictive coding (LPC) analysis. It takes 11 48-bit autocorrelation coefficients (R0-R10) as inputs, along with control signals (startld, clk, rst), and produces 32-bit LPC coefficients as outputs. The module uses a state machine to control the algorithmic flow, performing iterative calculations to determine the LPC coefficients. Key internal signals include STATE and NEXT_STATE for state machine control, loop counters (i, j1, j), intermediate values (k, e, sum), and numerous registers (a0-a120) for storing coefficients. The module incorporates fixed-point arithmetic operations using custom multipliers (m1-m9), adders (a1-a9), and a divider. The
