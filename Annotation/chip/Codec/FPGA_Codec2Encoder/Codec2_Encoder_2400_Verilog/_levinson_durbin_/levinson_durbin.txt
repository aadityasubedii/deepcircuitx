Module-level comment: This module implements the Levinson-Durbin algorithm for LPC analysis. It uses a state machine to control the iterative process, taking autocorrelation coefficients as inputs and producing LPC coefficients as outputs. The module employs fixed-point arithmetic with custom multipliers, adders, and a divider to perform the necessary calculations. It processes the data in stages, including initialization, coefficient calculation, and output generation, storing intermediate results in registers.
