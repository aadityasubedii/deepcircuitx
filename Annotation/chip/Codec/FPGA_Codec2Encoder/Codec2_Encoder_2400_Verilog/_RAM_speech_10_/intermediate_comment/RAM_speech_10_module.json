    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_10 module implements a single-port RAM on Cyclone IV GX FPGA using the Altera altsyncram component. It handles data storage and retrieval synchronized by an external clock with input ports for address, data, read, and write controls. The 10-bit output `q` delivers data based on the address provided when read is enabled. Internal wiring and parameter settings within `altsyncram` configure its size, behavior, and clock management."
