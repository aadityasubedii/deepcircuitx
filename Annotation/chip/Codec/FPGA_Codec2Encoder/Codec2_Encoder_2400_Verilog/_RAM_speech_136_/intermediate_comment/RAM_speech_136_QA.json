It interfaces with external components through signals that include an 8-bit address, a 32-bit data input, and a 32-bit data output. The RAM is managed through a clock signal and control signals for reading (rden), writing (wren), and outputs the retrieved data (q). The altsyncram component is configured to bypass clock enables, use a specific initialization file \"RAM_speech_136.mif\", and does not allow for runtime modifications. The size of the RAM is set with a width of 32 bits and an address width of 8 bits, supporting a total of 160 words. The designed module does not support data write during a read operation on the same address."
