    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'RAM_speech_136' module functions as a single-port RAM tailored for Cyclone IV GX family, using a configured altsyncram block. It manages memory with 8-bit address, 32-bit data paths, and controls for read/write operations. Implementation details include initiation from \"RAM_speech_136.mif\", disabling runtime modifications, and directly mapping altsyncram output to the module's output port using internal wiring for data retrieval."
