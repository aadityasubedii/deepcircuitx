Module name: post_process_sub_multiples_extended_bits_dec10_bk. Module specification: This Verilog module is designed for post-processing spectral data to determine the optimal fundamental frequency, `best_f0`, from given inputs such as previous frequency data and gain values. The inputs include `startppsm` (trigger for the state machine operation), `clk` (clock signal), `rst` (reset signal), `gmax_bin` (index of maximum gain), `gmax` (maximum gain value), and `prev_f0` (previous fundamental frequency). The output ports are `best_f0` (determined best fundamental frequency), `doneppsm` (processing complete flag), `addr_fw_real` (address for real frequency-weighted values), and `check_sig` (a debugging signal to check the operation internally tied to `cmax_bin`). Internal signals such as `STATE`, `NEXT_STATE`, `m1_in1`, `m1_in2`, `a1_in1`, `a1_in2`, `lt1_in1`, `b`, `bmax`, and others facilitate data and state management, control arithmetic operations, and assist in sequenced comparisons and calculations. The code is primarily structured around a state machine with states defined for initializing, processing, comparison, and post-processing tasks, such as calculating indices (`CALC_PREV_F0`), checking thresholds (`CHECK_WHILE`), and determining the final output frequency (`SET_BEST_F0`). Each state leads to an operational block handling specific mathematical manipulations or decision-making logic critical for determining the precise fundamental frequency based on peak bin values and gain metrics within the spectral data provided.
