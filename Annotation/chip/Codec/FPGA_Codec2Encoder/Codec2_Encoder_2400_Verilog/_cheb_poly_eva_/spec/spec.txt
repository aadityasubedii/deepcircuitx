Module name: cheb_poly_eva. 
Module specification: The 'cheb_poly_eva' module evaluates Chebyshev polynomials using supplied coefficients and an input value 'x'. The module processes through a Finite State Machine (FSM) in several defined states to perform multiplication and addition operations, essential for evaluating the polynomial. The input ports include 'clk' (clock), 'rst' (reset), 'startcp' (start compute), 'x' (input variable), and 'coeff0' to 'coeff5' (coefficients of the polynomial). The output ports are 'donecp' (indicates completion of computation) and 'sum' (holds the result of the polynomial evaluation). Internal signals such as 'STATE', 'NEXT_STATE', 't0' to 't5' (temporary storage for polynomial terms), 'mult1', 'mult2', 'add1', 'add2' (operands for multiplier and adder units), 'x2' (shifted version of 'x'), 'out_mult', and 'out_add' (outputs from multiplier and adder units) are crucial for handling temporary data and transitioning between computational states. The verilog code is structured into blocks handling state transitions, computational preparation, multiplication, addition, and output assignments, each enclosed within 'always' blocks triggered by the clock or reset operations. These blocks orchestrate the step-by-step computation and accumulation of polynomial terms, progressing through various stages from initial setup to final result calculation, signaled by 'donecp'.
