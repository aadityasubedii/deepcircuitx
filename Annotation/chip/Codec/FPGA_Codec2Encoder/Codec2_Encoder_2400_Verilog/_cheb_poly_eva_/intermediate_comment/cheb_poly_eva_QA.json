It operates as a finite state machine (FSM) that advances through several calculation stages, each represented by different states such as PRE_CALC, CALC, and DONE. Each state is responsible for specific arithmetic operations (multiplication and addition) that compute the terms of the polynomial progressively. The polynomial evaluation accumulates the results in the variable 'sum', and when all stages are completed, the module signals completion via the 'donecp' output. This design is typically used in digital signal processing or similar computational tasks where polynomial evaluation is needed."
