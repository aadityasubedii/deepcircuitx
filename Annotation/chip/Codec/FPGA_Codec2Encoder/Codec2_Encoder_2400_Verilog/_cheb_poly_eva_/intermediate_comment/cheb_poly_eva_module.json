    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'cheb_poly_eva' module evaluates Chebyshev polynomials given coefficients and an input 'x'. It utilizes a Finite State Machine (FSM) with states dedicated to sequential calculations, including multiplications and additions of polynomial terms. The process starts upon 'startcp' activation, transitions through states for calculations, and outputs the final result in 'sum' when 'donecp' signals completion. This module effectively handles polynomial evaluation in a stepwise and systematic manner driven by state transitions, controlled by clock and reset signals."
