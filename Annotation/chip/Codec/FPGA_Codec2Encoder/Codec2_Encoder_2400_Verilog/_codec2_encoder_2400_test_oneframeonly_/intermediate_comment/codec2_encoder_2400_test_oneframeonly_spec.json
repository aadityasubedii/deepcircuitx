    "spec": "Module name: codec2_encoder_2400_test_oneframeonly.\nModule specification: The 'codec2_encoder_2400_test_oneframeonly' is a Verilog module dedicated to encoding a single frame of audio data at a bit rate of 2400 bits per second using the Codec2 algorithm. Input ports include `start_codec2` which begins the encoding process when high, `clk` which is the clock signal for timing, and `rst` for resetting the module. Output ports consist of `encoded_bits_0` that holds the result of the encoded audio, `done_codec2` signaling the end of encoding, `check_sig` and `clk_count` for debugging and performance monitoring. Internal signals like `STATE`, `NEXT_STATE`, and `start_oneframe` manage state transitions and process initiation respectively. Address and data handling signals (`addr_speech_0`, `in_mem_fir` etc.) interface with memory components such as RAM blocks to store and retrieve audio data. The code is organized into blocks corresponding to state transitions in the machine, initialization and reset conditions, encoding process steps, and memory management. The module efficiently handles the encoding of audio through designated state transitions, ensuring proper data flow and synchronization as dictated by the Codec2 processing requirements.",

It processes one frame of audio at a time. The module initiates the encoding process when signaled by `start_codec2`. It then transitions through various states: starting the codec for one frame, running the codec to process the data, retrieving the encoded frame, and finally signaling completion with `done_codec2`. The module interfaces with various custom memory components (RAM_speech_0, RAM_c2_speech_sn, RAM_nlp_mem_fir_80, and RAM_nlp_sq_80) to handle speech and noise data, filter memories, and other necessary parameters. The results of the encoding process are made available in `encoded_bits_0`, and it utilizes a clock signal `clk` and reset `rst` for synchronous operation. The internal counters and state machinery ensure the data flows correctly through the encoding process."

Input ports include `start_codec2` which begins the encoding process when high, `clk` which is the clock signal for timing, and `rst` for resetting the module. Output ports consist of `encoded_bits_0` that holds the result of the encoded audio, `done_codec2` signaling the end of encoding, `check_sig` and `clk_count` for debugging and performance monitoring. Internal signals like `STATE`, `NEXT_STATE`, and `start_oneframe` manage state transitions and process initiation respectively. Address and data handling signals (`addr_speech_0`, `in_mem_fir` etc.) interface with memory components such as RAM blocks to store and retrieve audio data. The code is organized into blocks corresponding to state transitions in the machine, initialization and reset conditions, encoding process steps, and memory management. The module efficiently handles the encoding of audio through designated state transitions, ensuring proper data flow and synchronization as dictated by the Codec2 processing requirements."
