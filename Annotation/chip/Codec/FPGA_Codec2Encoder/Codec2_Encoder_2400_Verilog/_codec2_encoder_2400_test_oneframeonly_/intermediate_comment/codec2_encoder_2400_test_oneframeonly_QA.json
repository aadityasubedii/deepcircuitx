It processes one frame of audio at a time. The module initiates the encoding process when signaled by `start_codec2`. It then transitions through various states: starting the codec for one frame, running the codec to process the data, retrieving the encoded frame, and finally signaling completion with `done_codec2`. The module interfaces with various custom memory components (RAM_speech_0, RAM_c2_speech_sn, RAM_nlp_mem_fir_80, and RAM_nlp_sq_80) to handle speech and noise data, filter memories, and other necessary parameters. The results of the encoding process are made available in `encoded_bits_0`, and it utilizes a clock signal `clk` and reset `rst` for synchronous operation. The internal counters and state machinery ensure the data flows correctly through the encoding process."

It is the start trigger for the codec to encode one frame of audio.\n- `clk`: This is the clock signal used to synchronize all operations within the module, ensuring that data processing happens in a timely and orderly fashion.\n- `rst`: This is the reset signal, used to initialize or reset the module\u2019s internal state to a known configuration when set low.\n\nOutput ports: `encoded_bits_0`, `done_codec2`, `check_sig`, `clk_count`.\nExplanation: \n- `encoded_bits_0`: This bus holds the compressed audio data encoded by the codec2 algorithm. The size is defined by the `BITS_WIDTH` parameter, allowing the stored result to be extracted by external systems.\n- `done_codec2`: This signal indicates the completion of the encoding process for one frame. It is set high once the module has finished processing the current audio frame.\n- `check_sig`: This output provides a signal or data used likely for checking or debugging purposes, demonstrating internal data flow or state during operation, specifically related to memory operations.\n- `clk_count`: This output register likely serves as a diagnostic or operational check by maintaining a count of the clock cycles for the duration of one encoding frame or for other performance tracking purposes within the module."
