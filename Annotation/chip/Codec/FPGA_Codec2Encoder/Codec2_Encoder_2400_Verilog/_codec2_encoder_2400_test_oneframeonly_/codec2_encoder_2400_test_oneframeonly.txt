Module-level comment: The 'codec2_encoder_2400_test_oneframeonly' module encodes a single audio frame using Codec2 at 2400 bps. It utilizes internal state management via a FSM, interfacing with custom RAM units for data handling, and processes through sequential states triggered by `start_codec2`. Outputs include the encoded data, a completion signal, and debugging information. Synchronization is maintained by the `clk` signal, with `rst` handling module resets.
