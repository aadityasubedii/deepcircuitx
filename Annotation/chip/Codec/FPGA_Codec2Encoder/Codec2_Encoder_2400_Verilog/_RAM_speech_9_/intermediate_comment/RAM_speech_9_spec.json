    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_9. Module specification: The RAM_speech_9 module implements a single-port RAM designed for storing and accessing speech-related data, specifically tailored for use with Cyclone IV E devices. It utilizes inputs such as `address` [7:0] for locating data within the RAM, `clock` for synchronizing data operations, `data` [31:0] for the data written to RAM, `rden` for enabling read operations, and `wren` for enabling write operations. The output `q` [31:0] delivers data read from the specified RAM address. Internally, the module employs the `sub_wire0` [31:0] as an intermediary wire, which connects the output `q_a` from the `altsyncram` component\u2014a specialized RAM block configured through parameters for the RAM's properties\u2014to the module's output `q`. The code is structured around configuring and instantiating the `altsyncram_component` with specific parameters such as operation mode, data width, RAM size, and behavior during read-write operations. These configurations define the RAM's structural properties and operational characteristics, ensuring it behaves as a non-volatile storage specific for speech data applications without runtime configurability. The module encapsulates all these aspects within well-defined ports and internal connections, facilitated by the use of default parameters and specific signal control, tailored for reliable data storage and retrieval in digital speech processing environments.",
