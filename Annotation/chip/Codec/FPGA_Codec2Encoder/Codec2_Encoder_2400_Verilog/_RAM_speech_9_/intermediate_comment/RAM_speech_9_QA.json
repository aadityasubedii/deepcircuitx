The RAM is addressable via an 8-bit address and interfaces with 32-bit data. Write and read operations are controlled by the signals `wren` (write enable) and `rden` (read enable), respectively, synchronously with respect to the `clock` signal. Various parameters for the RAM are set, including size (160 words), data width (32 bits), and operation mode (single-port with specific behavior on read during write operations). The module does not initialize with pre-loaded data on power up and does not allow runtime configurability as indicated by the defparam settings."
