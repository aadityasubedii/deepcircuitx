    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_98. \nModule specification: The RAM_speech_98 module defines a single-port RAM designed for use with Altera (now Intel) FPGAs, specifically configured for the Cyclone IV GX device family. This module utilizes an 'altsyncram' component to facilitate data storage and retrieval operations. Data operations are synchronized with a clock signal and managed via 8-bit address, 32-bit data, read enable (rden), and write enable (wren) inputs. The 32-bit data to be stored or retrieved consumes the input 'data' and addresses through the 'address' input. The 'rden' and 'wren' signals enable reading data from and writing data to the RAM. The output from the RAM is given by the 'q' port, which offers a 32-bit output displaying data from the specified memory location. Internally, the module uses 'sub_wire0' as a temporary holder for the data read from the altsyncram component before forwarding it to the 'q' output. The `altsyncram` block in the code is parametrized for specific RAM configuration including initialization from a \".mif\" file, read-during-write behavior, and the intended FPGA family. It establishes the operational characteristics of the RAM module such as memory size, data width, and address width. This robust design allows for efficient memory management suited for FPGA-based applications requiring stable and regulated data handling.",
