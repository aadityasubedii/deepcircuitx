Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_98 module implements a single-port RAM for Altera FPGAs, using an 'altsyncram' component. It supports 32-bit data width and 8-bit address width, synchronized by a clock. Data operations are controlled by read (rden) and write (wren) enables, with configuration specified for Cyclone IV GX family, handling module outputs and internal connectivity for robust memory operations.
