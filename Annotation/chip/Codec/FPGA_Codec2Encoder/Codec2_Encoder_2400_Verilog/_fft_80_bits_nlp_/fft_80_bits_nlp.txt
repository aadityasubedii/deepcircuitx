Module-level comment: The fft_80_bits_nlp module implements an 80-bit Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm for DSP applications, converting time domain data to frequency domain and vice versa. Functionality is achieved through a state machine controlling the data flow, bit-reversal, trigonometric calculations, and complex arithmetic managed by adders and multipliers. Multiple states in the machine handle data address initialization, computation, and output signaling, ensuring seamless FFT processing.
