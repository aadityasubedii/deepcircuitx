Module name: fft_80_bits_nlp. Module specification: The fft_80_bits_nlp is a Verilog module implementing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, specifically tailored to handle 80-bit complex numbers for digital signal processing (DSP). It converts data from the time domain to the frequency domain and vice versa. The input ports include `startfft` to trigger the FFT computation, `clk` as the clock signal, `rst` as the reset signal, and `out_fft_real` and `out_fft_imag` for the input real and imaginary parts of the complex data. The output ports consist of `donefft` signaling the end of the FFT process, address outputs `addr_fft_imag`, `addr_fft_real`, `addr_func_fft_real_out`, `addr_func_fft_imag_out`, and data outputs `in_func_fft_real_out`, `in_func_fft_imag_out`, `out_real`, `out_imag`. Internal control and data handling are managed through various status and data signals like `STATE`, `NEXT_STATE`, and `clk_count_fft`. The multiple blocks of code define the processing stages of the FFT, including bit-reversal addressing, computation of the FFT via complex multiplication and addition, state machine transitions, and final data storage. These stages ensure accurate computation and storage of FFT results in sequential order guided by an explicit state machine.
