It utilizes an embedded `altsyncram` module from Altera (now part of Intel), which provides configurable memory functionality. The parameters of `altsyncram` are set to work with a Cyclone IV E FPGA, indicating the target hardware for the module. The RAM enables reading and writing operations based on the provided signals for read enable (rden) and write enable (wren), facilitated by the address provided through the `address` input. The data read from or written to the RAM is managed by the `data` input and `q` output respectively."
