It utilizes a memory initialization file (`RAM_cos_256.mif`) to preload the ROM with data, making it useful for storing constant values such as a cosine lookup table with 256 entries. The ROM can be accessed via an 8-bit address and provides a 16-bit output. The module fully uses the synchronous read feature, driven by a clock and read enable signal."

Explanation: The 'address' is an 8-bit input used to specify the location within the ROM from which data is to be read. The 'clock' input acts as a timing signal for the ROM, ensuring that the operations are synchronized with the system clock. The 'rden' (read enable) is a control signal used to enable the reading process from the ROM. When 'rden' is asserted (high), the data from the specified address is made available on the output port.\n\nOutput ports: [q]. Explanation: 'q' is a 16-bit output representing the data accessed from the ROM at the memory address specified by the 'address' input. This output is valid and stable on the rising edge of the 'clock' signal, provided that 'rden' is asserted."

It captures the output data from the `altsyncram` component corresponding to the address specified by the 'address' input. Once the 'rden' signal is high and the 'clock' signal triggers a read operation, 'q_a' output of the `altsyncram` component is fed into 'sub_wire0'. Then, 'sub_wire0' is directly mapped to the module\u2019s output 'q'. This wiring ensures that the data fetched from the ROM is correctly passed to the output port."
