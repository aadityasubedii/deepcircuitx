Module name: RAM_cos_256. 
Module specification: The RAM_cos_256 module is designed as a Read-Only Memory (ROM) on Cyclone IV E FPGA devices, utilizing an `altsyncram` component. Its primary function is to store and provide access to a preloaded cosine lookup table with 256 entries, ideal for applications demanding quick retrieval of cosine values. The module has three input ports: 'address', an 8-bit input selecting data location in ROM; 'clock', a clock signal ensuring synchronous data operations; and 'rden', a read enable signal that, when high, allows data at the specified address to be outputted. The sole output port, 'q', delivers the 16-bit data fetched from the specified address. Internally, the module uses 'sub_wire0', a 16-bit wire that temporarily holds the data fetched from the 'altsyncram' component until passed to the 'q' output on appropriate clock and enable signals. The code primarily sets up and configures the `altsyncram` component to operate as ROM, specifying parameters like device family, memory size, and initialization file, ensuring the appropriate setup for the cosine lookup function, and making the data accessible and correct as per the read requests triggered by the input ports.
