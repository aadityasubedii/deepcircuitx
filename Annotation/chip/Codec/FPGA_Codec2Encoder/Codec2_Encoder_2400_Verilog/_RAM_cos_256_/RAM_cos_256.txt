Module-level comment: The RAM_cos_256 module serves as a ROM on Cyclone IV E FPGA, using an `altsyncram` component to store a 256-entry cosine lookup table. It accepts an 8-bit address and a read enable signal to output 16-bit data synchronously with the clock signal. The module configures `altsyncram` for ROM operation, specifying initialization from `RAM_cos_256.mif` and setting operational parameters to ensure correct data fetching and output.
