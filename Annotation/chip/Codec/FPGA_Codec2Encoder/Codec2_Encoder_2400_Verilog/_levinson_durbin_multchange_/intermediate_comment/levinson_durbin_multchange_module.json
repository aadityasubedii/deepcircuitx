    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements the Levinson-Durbin algorithm for LPC analysis. It uses a state machine to control the algorithm's steps, including initialization, recursive calculations of reflection coefficients and prediction error, and updates of LPC coefficients. The module takes autocorrelation coefficients as inputs and outputs LPC coefficients sequentially. It employs fixed-point arithmetic and parallel computations for efficient hardware implementation."
