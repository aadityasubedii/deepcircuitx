    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'post_process_sub_multiples_extended_bits' module identifies the best fundamental frequency (`best_f0`) from subtone frequency data for applications like pitch detection. It leverages a state machine to manage processing steps that involve arithmetic operations on digital signal processing components and utilizes methods like maximum amplitude checks and frequency bin calculations. Sequential states guide the module through initialization, data processing loops, and determination of final results. Key inputs include maximum amplitude data and prior frequency values, with outputs consisting of the `best_f0`, procedural status, and debugging signals."
