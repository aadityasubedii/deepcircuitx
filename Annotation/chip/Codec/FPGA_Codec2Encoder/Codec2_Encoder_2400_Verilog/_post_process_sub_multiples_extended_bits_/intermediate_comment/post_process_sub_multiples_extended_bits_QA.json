The module operates in a sequential manner driven by a state machine that starts upon the `startppsm` signal. It cycles through states to perform various calculations like multiplication, addition, and division with custom parameter settings on digital signal processing (DSP) components such as multipliers and dividers. The process involves checking thresholds, updating frequency bins, and managing temporary results to ultimately compute and output the best fundamental frequency based on criteria like maximum amplitude within specified bounds. The process concludes by signaling completion through `doneppsm`."
