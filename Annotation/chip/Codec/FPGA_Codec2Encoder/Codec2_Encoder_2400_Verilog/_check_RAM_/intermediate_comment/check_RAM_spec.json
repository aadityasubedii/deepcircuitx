    "spec": "Module name: check_RAM.\nModule specification: The `check_RAM` module interfaces with a RAM module named `RAM_autocorrelate_Rn` to perform a sequence of data processing operations orchestrated by an internal state machine. The module utilizes two input ports: `clk` (clock signal for synchronization of state transitions and data operations) and `rst` (active-low reset signal for initializing the system state). The output ports include `j` (a 4-bit index used to address RAM and track the processing sequence), `data` (a 32-bit register holding data retrieved from the RAM), and `doneq` (a signal indicating the completion of the operation when high). Internal signals include `STATE` (a 4-bit register tracking the current state of the state machine), `NEXT_STATE` (a 4-bit register determining the next state in the upcoming cycle), `addr_rn` (used as the RAM address input), and `out_rn` (holding the data fetched from RAM). The code is structured into different blocks that handle state progression (`always@(posedge clk or negedge rst)` for state switching and initialization), state logic definition (`always@(*)` for deciding next states based on current conditions), and operations associated with states (`always@(posedge clk or negedge rst)` for performing operations such as setting RAM addresses, retrieving data, and incrementing index `j`). The module progresses through defined states including initialization, address setting, data fetching, and output setting, until a termination condition (`j >= 12`) is met, at which point `doneq` is set high to signal completion.",
