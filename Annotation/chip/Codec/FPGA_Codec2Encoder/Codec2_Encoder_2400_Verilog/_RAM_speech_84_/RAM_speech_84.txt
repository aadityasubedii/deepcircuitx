Module-level comment: The 'RAM_speech_84' module serves as a single-port RAM unit with a 32-bit data bus and 8-bit address, allowing access to 256 memory locations. Utilizing the 'altsyncram' component aligned for Cyclone IV GX FPGAs, it supports distinct read and write operations through 'rden' and 'wren' control signals. The module efficiently handles data integrity and operational synchronization with internal wiring and parameterized configurations specific to non-runtime-modifiable implementations.
