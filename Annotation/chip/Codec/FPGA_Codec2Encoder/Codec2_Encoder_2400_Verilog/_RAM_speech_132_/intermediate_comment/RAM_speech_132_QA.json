The RAM's memory initialization file is specified as \"RAM_speech_132.mif,\" which likely contains predefined data or configuration. The RAM has an 8-bit address input allowing access to 160 words, each 32 bits wide. It supports both read and write operations, controlled by read enable (`rden`) and write enable (`wren`) signals. The module operates on a single clock (`clock`) and does not utilize any asynchronous clear signals. The configuration explicitly prevents reading during a write operation where new data is not being written. This setup is typical for scenarios requiring quick, predictable access to stored data, such as in digital signal processing or speech processing applications as the naming might suggest."

It selects one of the 160 words in the memory.\n- **clock**: Clock input that synchronizes the operations in the RAM, including reading and writing activities.\n- **data [31:0]**: 32-bit input that holds the data to be written into the RAM at the location specified by the address input when a write operation is enabled.\n- **rden**: Read enable signal; when asserted (high), it enables reading data from the RAM.
