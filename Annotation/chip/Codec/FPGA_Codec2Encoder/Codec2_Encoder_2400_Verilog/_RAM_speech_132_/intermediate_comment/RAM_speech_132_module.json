    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_132 module implements a single-port RAM using Altera's `altsyncram` component, designed for Cyclone IV GX FPGAs. It supports 160-word storage, each 32 bits wide, accessible via 8-bit addressing. The module provides read and write operations, coordinated by synchronized clocks and enable signals, and uses an internal `sub_wire0` for routing data outputs. The setup maximizes efficiency for tasks requiring rapid, reliable data access."
