Module-level comment: The fpdiv_clk_parameter module performs fixed-point division through an iterative, state-controlled process under a clocked environment. It inputs a number and, upon `startdiv` trigger, processes it using binary shifts and multiplications managed via a finite state machine. The output indicates completion (`donediv`) and provides the division result (`ans`). The module uses internal arithmetic submodules and comparison units to handle calculations and flow conditions, achieving precise division based on parameter settings Q and N.
