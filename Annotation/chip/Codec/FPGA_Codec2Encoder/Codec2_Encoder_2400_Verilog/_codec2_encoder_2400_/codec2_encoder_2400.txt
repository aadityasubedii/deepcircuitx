Module-level comment: This module implements a CODEC2 speech encoder for 2400 bps mode. It processes speech samples in two frames, encoding them into compressed bits. The module uses a state machine to control the encoding process, interfacing with multiple RAM blocks for speech samples and intermediate data. It performs initialization, runs the encoding for each frame, and collects results, outputting encoded bits, quantized LSP coefficients, and other speech parameters. The design employs multiple sub-modules and memory interfaces to achieve efficient speech encoding.
