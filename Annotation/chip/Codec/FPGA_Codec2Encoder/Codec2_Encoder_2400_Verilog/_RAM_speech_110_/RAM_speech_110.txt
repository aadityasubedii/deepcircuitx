Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_110 module uses the `altsyncram` to implement a single-port RAM, preloaded with speech data in "RAM_speech_110.mif" for the Cyclone IV GX FPGA. It manages memory with inputs for address, data, clock, and read/write controls, outputting through `q`. Internally, `sub_wire0` buffers data from `altsyncram` to `q`, ensuring synchronous, reliable operations without concurrent read-write conflicts.
