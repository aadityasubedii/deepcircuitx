    "spec": "Module name: autocorrelate_rn. \n\nModule specification: The 'autocorrelate_rn' module performs the autocorrelation of a series of input data samples, processing and outputting results synchronized to a clock signal. The input ports include 'clk' (clock), 'rst' (reset), and 'startac' (start autocorrelation), where 'clk' is used for internal operation synchronization, 'rst' initiates an asynchronous reset, and 'startac' triggers the start of autocorrelation processing. The outputs of the module comprise 'doneac' (indicating completion of processing), and 'rn0' to 'rn10', denoting the results of autocorrelation at various lags. Internal signals like 'STATE' and 'NEXT_STATE' manage the state machine workflow, 'i' and 'j' serve as loop counters, and 'out_rn_final' among others like 'in_sn', 'in_sn1', and 'in_sn2' store intermediate computational values. Key components in the code include multiplication and addition operations managed by instances of 'qmult' and 'qadd'. State machine controls mode transitions and processing across multiple states such as initialization, processing, and output stages, with storage and retrieval performed via RAM modules 'RAM_autocorrelate_Sn'. This structured approach allows handling of multiple data sets efficiently, culminating in the generation of the autocorrelation sequence across set lags.",

It takes in a series of discrete data points (rn0 to rn10) and processes them through a state machine controlled by various states (e.g., INIT_VALUES, INIT_LOOP, CALC_SN, etc.) to calculate the autocorrelation output for these data points. The computation involves multiplication and addition operations, managed by instantiating 'qmult' for multiplication and 'qadd' for addition. The autocorrelation results are stored back into rn0 to rn10. The module operates synchronously with a clock signal 'clk' and supports asynchronous reset with the 'rst' signal. The operation starts when the 'startac' input is high, and it signals completion through the 'doneac' output. Memory elements (RAM_autocorrelate_Sn) are accessed for storing interim values and for delayed operations as part of the autocorrelation computations. The control flow and state transitions ensure the sequential processing of data points and accumulation of results across multiple cycles."

It is used to initialize or restart the module's operation.\n- 'startac' (start autocorrelation): A control signal used to initiate the autocorrelation process. When this signal is high, the module starts processing the input data.\n\nOutput ports: doneac, rn0, rn1, rn2, rn3, rn4, rn5, rn6, rn7, rn8, rn9, rn10.\nExplanation: \n- 'doneac' (done autocorrelating): A signal that indicates the completion of the autocorrelation process. It becomes high when the module has finished processing all input data samples and the autocorrelated results are available at the output.\n- 'rn0' to 'rn10': These are the output ports where the autocorrelated results are stored. Each port corresponds to a specific lag in the autocorrelation series. The values in these ports represent the autocorrelation of the input data at different lags, starting from 0 up to 10."

The input ports include 'clk' (clock), 'rst' (reset), and 'startac' (start autocorrelation), where 'clk' is used for internal operation synchronization, 'rst' initiates an asynchronous reset, and 'startac' triggers the start of autocorrelation processing. The outputs of the module comprise 'doneac' (indicating completion of processing), and 'rn0' to 'rn10', denoting the results of autocorrelation at various lags. Internal signals like 'STATE' and 'NEXT_STATE' manage the state machine workflow, 'i' and 'j' serve as loop counters, and 'out_rn_final' among others like 'in_sn', 'in_sn1', and 'in_sn2' store intermediate computational values. Key components in the code include multiplication and addition operations managed by instances of 'qmult' and 'qadd'. State machine controls mode transitions and processing across multiple states such as initialization, processing, and output stages, with storage and retrieval performed via RAM modules 'RAM_autocorrelate_Sn'. This structured approach allows handling of multiple data sets efficiently, culminating in the generation of the autocorrelation sequence across set lags."
