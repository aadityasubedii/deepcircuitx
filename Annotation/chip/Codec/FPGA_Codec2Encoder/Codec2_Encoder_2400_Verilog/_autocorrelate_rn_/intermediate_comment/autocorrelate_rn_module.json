    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'autocorrelate_rn' module conducts autocorrelation on input data samples, providing results across multiple time lags. It synchronizes computations with a clock signal, utilizing a state machine for sequential operations and internal registers for result handling. The module employs multiplication and addition blocks ('qmult' and 'qadd'), operates through specified states (e.g., INIT_VALUES, SET_SN, CALC_SN), and uses RAM units for data storage, ensuring efficient data processing and outcome management across cycles."
