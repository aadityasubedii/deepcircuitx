    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_31 module functions as a single-port RAM for storing and retrieving speech data, suitable for Cyclone IV GX FPGA hardware. It utilizes Altera's `altsyncram` component configured for optimal performance, supporting straightforward read and write operations via an 8-bit address and a 32-bit data interface, controlled by read and write enable signals. Data integrity is maintained through special read-during-write settings and initialization from an external .mif file."
