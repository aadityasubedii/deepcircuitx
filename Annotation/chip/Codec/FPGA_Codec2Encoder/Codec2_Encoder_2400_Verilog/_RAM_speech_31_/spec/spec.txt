Module name: RAM_speech_31. Module specification: The RAM_speech_31 module serves as a single-port RAM designed specifically for speech data storage and retrieval in Cyclone IV GX FPGA devices. It utilizes an 8-bit `address` input to select one of 160 possible memory locations, a `clock` signal for synchronization, and a 32-bit `data` input for writing data. The `rden` and `wren` inputs control whether the module performs a read or a write operation. The 32-bit `q` output port outputs the data read from the specified memory location when read is enabled. Internally, the module employs a `sub_wire0`, a 32-bit wire that serves as an intermediate conduit for relaying data from the `altsyncram` component to the `q` output. The `altsyncram_component` is configured for single-port operation with a predefined initialization file "RAM_speech_31.mif", and it ensures data integrity during read and write operations by utilizing the "NEW_DATA_NO_NBE_READ" mode. This setup avoids read-during-write conflicts and is optimized with several parameters to suit the intended FPGA device and application needs, providing reliable and efficient data handling for speech-related applications.
