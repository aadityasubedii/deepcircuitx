    "spec": "Module name: RAM_AM_evmbe. Module specification: The RAM_AM_evmbe is a Verilog module designed to implement single-port RAM using Altera's `altsyncram` component, specifically tailored for Cyclone IV E FPGA devices. The module is synchronized with a clock input and interfaces through a 9-bit address input and a 32-bit data input/output. Input ports include `address` for specifying the memory location, `clock` for timing signals, `data` for the input data written into the memory, `rden` (read enable) for enabling data reading, and `wren` (write enable) for enabling data writing. The sole output port, `q`, outputs the data read from the specified memory address. Internally, the module utilizes a signal `sub_wire0`, a 32-bit wire that acts as the conduit for transferring data from the `altsyncram` component's output `q_a` to the module\u2019s output `q`, effectively isolating and buffering the RAM's data output. The code is structured with declarations at the top, followed by instantiation and parameter settings for the `altsyncram` component, which handles the low-level RAM operations per the configuration parameters like storage capacity (`numwords_a = 512`) and operational specifics such as whether the memory initializes with predefined values from the \"RAM_estimate_voicing_mbe.mif\" file. Configuration settings also include disabling alterations during reads and writes (`read_during_write_mode_port_a = \"NEW_DATA_NO_NBE_READ\"`) and the manner in which clocks and signals are configured for optimal RAM operation.",
