    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_AM_evmbe module implements a single-port RAM using Altera's `altsyncram` configured for a Cyclone IV E FPGA. It supports synchronous read/write operations via a 9-bit address and a 32-bit data interface with enable signals. Internally, it uses `sub_wire0` for data transfer from the `altsyncram` output to the module's output. Preloaded data from \"RAM_estimate_voicing_mbe.mif\" and specific behavioral settings like NEW_DATA_NO_NBE_READ ensure tailored functionality for specialized applications."
