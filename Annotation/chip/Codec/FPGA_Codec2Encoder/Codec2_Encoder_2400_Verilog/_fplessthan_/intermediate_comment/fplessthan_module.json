    "module": "Module-level comment: The `fplessthan` module compares two fixed-point numbers `a` and `b` using signed logic, determining if `a` is less than `b`. Implemented using an internal register `res` that captures comparison results based on equal values, sign matches, and magnitude comparisons. The outcome is assigned to single-bit output `c`, effectively indicating the less-than relationship between the signed inputs."
