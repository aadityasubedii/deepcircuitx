    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_126 module implements a single-port RAM utilizing the `altsyncram` component for synchronous memory operations. It supports precise read and write actions to memory locations specified via an 8-bit `address`, controlled by `rden` and `wren` signals. The `clock` synchronizes these operations, and the 32-bit `data` input and `q` output manage the data flow. Internal configurations set memory characteristics and operational modes suitable for Altera Cyclone IV GX FPGAs."
