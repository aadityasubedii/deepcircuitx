Module name: RAM_speech_100. Module specification: The RAM_speech_100 module encapsulates a single-port RAM designed for use in speech processing applications or buffering purposes. This module operates on a 32-bit data width and can address a total of 160 words through an 8-bit address input. It employs an `altsyncram` component, particularly set for the Cyclone IV GX FPGA family, leveraging the component's capabilities for synchronous read and write operations. The essential inputs to this module include `address`, specifying the RAM location for data access; `clock`, which synchronizes the read/write actions; `data`, serving as the data input during write operations enabled by the `wren` signal; and `rden`, which when high, allows for reading data through the output port `q`. The internal signal `sub_wire0` facilitates the holding of the temporary data fetched from the `altsyncram` component, which is then linked directly to the output `q` through a direct wire assignment. This module is defined in a structured way with key definitions established for the `altsyncram_component` to specify operational configurations such as initialization from a ".mif" file, lack of output data reset on clock events, and read-during-write behavior, thereby outlining a clear and purpose-built component for memory operations in specified digital applications.
