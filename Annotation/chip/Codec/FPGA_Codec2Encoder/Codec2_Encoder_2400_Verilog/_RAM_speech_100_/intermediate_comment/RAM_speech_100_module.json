    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_100 module implements a single-port, 32-bit wide, and 160-word RAM using an `altsyncram` component tailored for Cyclone IV GX FPGA. It orchestrates synchronous data interfacing at specific RAM addresses, enabled by input signals for addressing, clocking, data writing, and reading. The module utilizes internal wiring to connect the outcoming data from `altsyncram` to its output, supporting stable data read and write operations without resetting during clock events."
