It uses an `altsyncram` component, configured for a specific FPGA device family (Cyclone IV GX). The RAM can be accessed at a specified address, and data interactions are controlled by read and write enable signals. The RAM has a width of 32 bits and supports 160 words. It is initialized using the contents from a \"RAM_speech_100.mif\" file and does not reset its output data on clock events, as specified by various parameters in the component declaration. This allows the RAM module to store and retrieve data, which is crucial in applications requiring temporarily held data, such as speech processing or buffering purposes."
