Module specification: The 'cbselect' module is designed to select and read data from one of ten read-only memory blocks (ROMs), based on a 4-bit input 'select' value ranging from 0 to 9. The module contains two input ports: 'select', which determines the active ROM, and 'addr', a 4-bit value specifying the data address within the selected ROM. The output port 'dataout' delivers the data read from the specified address of the active ROM; its width is configurable through the parameter N. Internally, the module utilizes signals like 'cb_addr_X' (X ranging from 0 to 9) serving as address lines for each ROM, and 'cb_data_out_X' carrying the output data from each ROM. The functional parts of the code include instantiation of the ten ROM blocks, an always block with a case statement for routing \u2018addr\u2019 to the corresponding 'cb_addr_X' based on 'select', and binding the output from the selected ROM to 'dataout'. The module defaults to the 9th ROM if 'select' is outside the 0-9 range.",
