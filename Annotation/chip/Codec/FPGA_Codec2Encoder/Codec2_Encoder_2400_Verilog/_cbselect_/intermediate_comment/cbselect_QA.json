The selected ROM output is then assigned to 'dataout'. The 'addr' input determines the address from which data is read in the selected ROM. Each ROM is instantiated and connected via data buses 'cb_data_out_X', and the corresponding address for each ROM is maintained by 'cb_addr_X'. The module maps the input 'select' value (ranging from 0 to 9) to the specific ROM, dynamically assigning the 'addr' to the relevant ROM's address and fetching the output data from that ROM into 'dataout'. If 'select' is outside the range 0 to 9, the 9th ROM output is used as default."

If the 'select' value is outside this range, the last ROM is chosen by default. The 'addr' input is also a 4-bit value which specifies the address within the selected ROM from which data should be read. This address mapping is crucial for retrieving the correct data from the ROMs.\n\nOutput ports: dataout.\nExplanation: 'dataout' is the data output of the module, which is the value read from the address specified by 'addr' in the ROM selected by 'select'. The width of 'dataout' is determined by the parameter N, making it a configurable data bus that matches the ROMs' output width. This ensures that the data output aligns with the ROM architecture's data width, allowing for versatile applications of the module depending on the size of data stored in the ROMs."
