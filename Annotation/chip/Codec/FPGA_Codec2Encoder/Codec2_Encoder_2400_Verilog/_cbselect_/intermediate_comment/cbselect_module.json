    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'cbselect' module selects and reads data from one of ten ROMs based on a 4-bit 'select' input. It maps 'addr' to the chosen ROM, outputs the data from the relevant ROM address to 'dataout'. ROM instantiations and a case statement dynamically assign addresses and route outputs based on the 'select' value, utilizing internal address and data buses ('cb_addr_X', 'cb_data_out_X'). Default to the 9th ROM when 'select' is out of range."
