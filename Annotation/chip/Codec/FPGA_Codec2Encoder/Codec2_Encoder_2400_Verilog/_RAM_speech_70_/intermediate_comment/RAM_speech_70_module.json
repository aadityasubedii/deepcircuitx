    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_70 module is a single-port RAM tailored for the Cyclone IV GX FPGA, designed to store and retrieve 32-bit data using an 8-bit address. It synchronizes read and write operations via a clock signal, enabling data handling with `rden` and `wren`. The module utilizes an `altsyncram` component with specified parameters for memory management and operational configurations, connecting outputs through internal wiring (`sub_wire0`) to ensure seamless data flow."
