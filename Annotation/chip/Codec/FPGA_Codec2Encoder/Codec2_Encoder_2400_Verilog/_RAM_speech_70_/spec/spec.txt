Module name: RAM_speech_70. Module specification: The RAM_speech_70 module is a configurable single-port RAM developed for the Cyclone IV GX FPGA, designed primarily to store and retrieve 32-bit data entries using an 8-bit address line. The module's input ports include `address` to select the memory location, `clock` to synchronize operations, `data` for inputting data on writes, `rden` to enable reading, and `wren` to enable writing. The output port `q` outputs the data from the specified memory location when read is enabled. Internally, the module utilizes `sub_wire0`, a 32-bit wire that connects the output of the `altsyncram` component to the moduleâ€™s output port `q`, facilitating the transfer of read data. The code comprises declarations of inputs/outputs, internal wiring, and an instance of `altsyncram` configured with specific parameters such as number of words, data width, and operational modes to handle memory operations. Additional configurations like clock management and data handling behaviors during read/write operations are specified through parameters to optimize the module's functionality and performance.
