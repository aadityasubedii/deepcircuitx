    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_108 module implements a single-port RAM designed for the Cyclone IV GX FPGA family, using an `altsyncram` component. It manages 32-bit data read and write operations to memory specified by an 8-bit address. Read and write operations are controlled by respective enable signals. Memory specifics such as size and initialization are defined within the `altsyncram` settings, emphasizing no runtime modifications and data behavior controlled by the clock signals."
