Module name: RAM_speech_108. Module specification: The RAM_speech_108 module defines a single-port RAM tailored for FPGA usage, specifically aimed at the Cyclone IV GX family, utilizing the `altsyncram` component from Altera. This module principally handles data read and write operations. It accepts a 32-bit data input through the `data` port to be written at an address specified by the 8-bit `address` input when the write enable signal (`wren`) is high. Data at a specified address can be read out when the read enable signal (`rden`) is high, with the output presented at the 32-bit output port `q`. The module uses internal signals, including `sub_wire0`, a 32-bit wire which serves as a connection from the `altsyncram` component's output to the module's output port, `q`. The `altsyncram` block configures the physical RAM, setting parameters like memory size, clock management, and data behavior, with specifics such as disabling runtime modifications and initializing memory content from "RAM_speech_108.mif". These settings assure optimal coordination with the module's functionality and the FPGA's architecture.
