    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_25. \nModule specification: The RAM_speech_25 is a Verilog-based single-port RAM module that utilizes an Altera-specific component, altsyncram, designed to operate on Cyclone IV GX devices. It's configured as a 31x8 memory (with an 8-bit address and a 32-bit data width), and supports basic read and write functionalities. Input ports include an 8-bit 'address' for selecting memory locations, a 'clock' signal that synchronizes operations, a 32-bit 'data' input for writing, and control signals 'rden' and 'wren' for read and write operations, respectively. The output of the module is a 32-bit 'q', which reflects data read from the specified memory address when 'rden' is active. Internally, the module utilizes 'sub_wire0', a 32-bit wire which connects the 'q_a' output of the altsyncram component to the 'q' output of the module, facilitating data transfers. The altsyncram component is parameterized to specify memory initialization, intended device family, operation mode, and other attributes that define its behavior. This module efficiently manages memory storage and retrieval in applications requiring stable and reliable RAM functionality under specified operational parameters.",

It interfaces with a 31x8 memory (addressed by an 8-bit address and a 32-bit data width). The RAM module has inputs for the address, data, read enable (rden), write enable (wren), and clock. It outputs a 32-bit data signal 'q'. The RAM operates on the positive edge of the clock and supports write and read operations based on the control signals (wren and rden).
