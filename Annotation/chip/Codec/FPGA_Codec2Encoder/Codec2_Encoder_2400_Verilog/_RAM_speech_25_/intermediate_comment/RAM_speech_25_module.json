    "module": "Module-level comment: RAM_speech_25 is a single-port RAM module using an Altera-specific altsyncram component for Cyclone IV GX devices. It features 8-bit addressable 32-bit wide memory with inputs for address, data, read and write controls, and outputs read data. The module's operation is synchronized by a clock signal, and an internal wire, sub_wire0, transfers data from altsyncram to the output. The configuration is managed via parameters like memory init file and operation mode."
