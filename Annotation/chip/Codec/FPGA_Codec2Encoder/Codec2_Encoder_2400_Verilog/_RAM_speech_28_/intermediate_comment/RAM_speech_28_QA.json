The input signals include an 8-bit address and 32-bit data bus, along with read and write enable signals. The RAM outputs a 32-bit data based on the address. Internally, it utilizes an `altsyncram` component, a form of FPGA-based RAM from Altera's library tailored to fit the Cyclone IV GX family. This RAM does not initialize upon power-up and has its configuration set via a .mif file. The module is configured to operate in a single-port mode with specific settings for clock and data handling that ensure the data integrity and synchronization facilitated by the clock signal."
