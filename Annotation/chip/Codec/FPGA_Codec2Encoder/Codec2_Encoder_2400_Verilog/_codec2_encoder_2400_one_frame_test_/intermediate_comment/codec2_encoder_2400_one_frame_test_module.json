    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'codec2_encoder_2400_one_frame_test' module encodes a single frame of speech data based on input parameters and speech samples. It operates through a finite state machine with START and DONE states, managed by input control signals and clock. Outputs include encoded data and control flags, facilitated by both combinational and sequential logic to manage state transitions and signal outputs, ensuring timely and accurate frame processing."
