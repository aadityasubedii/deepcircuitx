    "spec": "Module name: codec2_encoder_2400_one_frame_test. \n\nModule specification: The 'codec2_encoder_2400_one_frame_test' module is designed to handle the encoding of one frame of audio or speech data. It operates based on a clock ('clk') and is initialized or reset ('rst') using corresponding signals. This module processes input data such as speech frames and control parameters ('in_mex_x', 'in_mem_y', 'in_prevf0', 'in_xq0', 'in_xq1', 'out_speech', 'read_c2_sn_out', 'out_mem_fir', 'out_sq') and generates encoded bits ('encoded_bits'). The output ports include not only these encoded bits but also several memory addresses, data paths for interfacing with other modules or memory components ('out_mem_x', 'out_mem_y','out_prevf0', 'out_xq0', 'out_xq1', 'addr_speech', 'addr_sn', 'addr_mem_fir', 'addr_nlp_sq', 'in_mem_fir', 'in_sq'), flags to indicate a frame has been processed ('done_oneframe'), and control signals for managing reads and writes to external components or memories ('write_c2_sn', 're_c2_sn', 'we_c2_sn', 'read_fir', 'write_fir', 'read_sq', 'write_sq').\n\nInternal signals like 'c_w0_1', 'c_w0_2', 'c_w0', 'c_w1', 'c_lsp_check', 'clsp0' to 'clsp9', 'check_pitch1', 'check_best_fo1', 'check_pitch2', 'check_best_fo2'', 'c_e', 'c_sn', 'ch_lsp', and 'c_lsp' are utilized for processing data within the module. These variables handle intermediary computations and internal states reflecting the encoding process's progress.\n\nThe code composes several key blocks: the parameter definitions for dimensioning data and constants, state machine blocks handling the primary control flow of the module, and combinational logic for managing state transitions and output signals. The process is controlled by a finite state machine, toggling between START and DONE states to indicate when encoding of a frame begins and completes. Upon reset, the module initializes all outputs and internal states to ensure consistent operation starting from a known state.",

It accepts inputs like speech-related data, and control signals (like 'start_oneframe'), and outputs encoded bits and several state/control outputs for further processing or interfacing. The module primarily increases its 'STATE' on the rising edge of 'start_oneframe', transitioning from the START state to the DONE state, indicating that a frame has been processed. When processing is done, it flags 'done_oneframe' and sets the 'encoded_bits'. The exact nature of the encoding operation isn't detailed in the code, but we see various placeholders and structures prepared to handle computational tasks related to speech encoding."

It operates based on a clock ('clk') and is initialized or reset ('rst') using corresponding signals. This module processes input data such as speech frames and control parameters ('in_mex_x', 'in_mem_y', 'in_prevf0', 'in_xq0', 'in_xq1', 'out_speech', 'read_c2_sn_out', 'out_mem_fir', 'out_sq') and generates encoded bits ('encoded_bits'). The output ports include not only these encoded bits but also several memory addresses, data paths for interfacing with other modules or memory components ('out_mem_x', 'out_mem_y','out_prevf0', 'out_xq0', 'out_xq1', 'addr_speech', 'addr_sn', 'addr_mem_fir', 'addr_nlp_sq', 'in_mem_fir', 'in_sq'), flags to indicate a frame has been processed ('done_oneframe'), and control signals for managing reads and writes to external components or memories ('write_c2_sn', 're_c2_sn', 'we_c2_sn', 'read_fir', 'write_fir', 'read_sq', 'write_sq').\n\nInternal signals like 'c_w0_1', 'c_w0_2', 'c_w0', 'c_w1', 'c_lsp_check', 'clsp0' to 'clsp9', 'check_pitch1', 'check_best_fo1', 'check_pitch2', 'check_best_fo2'', 'c_e', 'c_sn', 'ch_lsp', and 'c_lsp' are utilized for processing data within the module. These variables handle intermediary computations and internal states reflecting the encoding process's progress.\n\nThe code composes several key blocks: the parameter definitions for dimensioning data and constants, state machine blocks handling the primary control flow of the module, and combinational logic for managing state transitions and output signals. The process is controlled by a finite state machine, toggling between START and DONE states to indicate when encoding of a frame begins and completes. Upon reset, the module initializes all outputs and internal states to ensure consistent operation starting from a known state."
