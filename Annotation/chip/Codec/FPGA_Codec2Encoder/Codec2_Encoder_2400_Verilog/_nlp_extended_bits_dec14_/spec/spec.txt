Module name: nlp_extended_bits_dec14. Module specification: This module implements a complex signal processing unit for natural language processing or speech analysis tasks. It takes inputs startnlp (initiates processing), clk and rst (clock and reset signals), nlp_mem_x and nlp_mem_y (80-bit input data), and prev_f0 (32-bit previous fundamental frequency). The module outputs best_f0 and out_prev_f0 (32-bit best and previous fundamental frequencies), donenlp (processing completion signal), pitch (32-bit calculated pitch), and debug signals check_cmax_bin, check_i, check_fw_real, and check_in_real. Internally, it uses numerous signals for addressing, state management, and intermediate calculations. The module is organized into several processing stages: initialization and data preparation, notch filtering, FIR filtering, FFT
