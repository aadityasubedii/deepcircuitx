    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a complex signal processing unit for NLP or speech analysis. It performs notch filtering, FIR filtering, FFT computation, and pitch estimation. The module uses a state machine to control the processing flow, including data preparation, multiple filtering stages, FFT analysis, and post-processing. It utilizes various memory units for storing intermediate results and coefficients, and outputs the best fundamental frequency and pitch estimation."
