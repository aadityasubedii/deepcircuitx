Module name: RAM_speech_86. 
Module specification: The "RAM_speech_86" serves as a single-port RAM module designed for speech data storage, leveraging the Altera-specific 'altsyncram' component for memory operations. It accepts a series of input ports including an 8-bit "address" for selecting memory addresses, a "clock" signal for synchronized memory operations, a 32-bit "data" input for the data to be written, and control signals "rden" and "wren" for read and write operations, respectively. The sole output port, a 32-bit "q", represents the data fetched from the memory if reading is enabled. This module uses an internal wire "sub_wire0" which acts as a conduit connecting the data output of the altsyncram component to the "q" output port. Structurally, the code begins with parameter definitions affecting the operation of the 'altsyncram' like clock settings, memory mode, and initialization parameters. It then details the instantiation of the 'altsyncram' component, mapping the external inputs and outputs to the internal logic defined within the module. This module is crafted for a specific FPGA family, "Cyclone IV GX", with settings that include disabling runtime modifications and handling new data on simultaneous reads and writes. This specification encapsulates the functionality and internal architecture of the RAM_speech_86, providing a complete overview of how it manages data storage and access within FPGA based systems.
