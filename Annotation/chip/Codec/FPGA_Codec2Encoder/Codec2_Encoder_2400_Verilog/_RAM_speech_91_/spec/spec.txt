Module name: RAM_speech_91. 
Module specification: The RAM_speech_91 is a Verilog module designed to implement a single-port RAM using the altsyncram component from Altera, tailored for the Cyclone IV GX device family. It is structured to interface with a 32-bit data bus and an 8-bit address bus. The input ports include a clock signal for synchronization, an 8-bit address for specifying the memory location, a 32-bit data input for writing, and control signals rden and wren to enable read and write operations respectively. The output port is a 32-bit signal 'q', holding data read from the specified memory address. Internally, it uses a wire named sub_wire0 as an intermediary to transfer data from the altsyncram's output to the module's output port q. The code utilizes predefined parameters to set up the altsyncram component, configuring aspects like the initialization file ("RAM_speech_91.mif"), memory size (160 words), and data width (32-bits). This setup facilitates storing and retrieving data for digital processing applications, ensuring operations are conducted in sync with the provided clock signal.
