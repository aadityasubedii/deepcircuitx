    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"RAM_speech_91\" module serves as a single-port RAM using Altera's altsyncram for data storage/retrieval. It supports 32-bit data operations with 8-bit addressing, synchronized by an input clock. The module facilitates reading and writing via rden and wren signals, respectively. Data flow is managed via internal wire sub_wire0, connecting altsyncram's output to the module's output port. Configurations like memory size, data width, and initialization file are predefined."
