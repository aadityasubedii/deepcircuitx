    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_33 module simulates a single-port RAM tailored for speech data on Cyclone IV GX FPGAs using an `altsyncram` component. It manages memory through inputs for address, data, and clock synchronization, with read/write controls enabled by `rden` and `wren` signals. The module securely transitions data from `altsyncram` to output using an intermediary wire, `sub_wire0`, ensuring reliable data handling and operational efficiency in speech processing applications."
