    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_17 module implements a single-port RAM using the 'altsyncram' component, optimized for Cyclone IV GX devices. It manages synchronous memory operations, interfacing via inputs (8-bit address, clock, 32-bit data, read/write enables) and a 32-bit output ('q'). Internal connections and a detailed parameter configuration of 'altsyncram' facilitate specific memory functionalities tailored for speech data applications."
