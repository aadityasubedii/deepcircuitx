Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_36 module implements a single-port, 32-bit wide RAM using Altera's 'altsyncram' for Cyclone IV GX FPGAs. It handles 8-bit addressing and provides dedicated ports for data input, read/write enable, and output. Internally, data transfer uses the 'sub_wire0' intermediary. Configuration settings prevent runtime modifications and use a predefined MIF file for initialization, ensuring controlled, reliable memory operations.
