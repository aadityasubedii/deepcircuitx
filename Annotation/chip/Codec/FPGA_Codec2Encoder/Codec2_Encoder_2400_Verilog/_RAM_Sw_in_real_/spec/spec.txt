Module name: RAM_Sw_in_real. Module specification: The RAM_Sw_in_real is a Verilog module that utilizes the altsyncram megafunction from Altera to define a single-port RAM which operates on a Cyclone IV E FPGA. The module accepts a 9-bit address and a 32-bit data input to perform memory operations, governed by a clock signal. The controls for read and write operations are managed through boolean signals; 'rden' for read enable, and 'wren' for write enable. The output is a 32-bit data line 'q' which reflects the data at the specified memory address when read is enabled. Internally, the module makes use of a wire 'sub_wire0' which connects the output of the altsyncram component to the 'q' port, thus enabling data transfer from the RAM. Depicted sequences in the code include input and output port declarations, internal signal instantiation for intermediate data holding, and instantiation of the altsyncram along with its configuration. The configuration of the altsyncram defines specific aspects like device family, operation mode (single-port), memory capacity (512 words), and other essential operational settings to ensure correct functionality with the intended FPGA hardware and usage circumstances.
