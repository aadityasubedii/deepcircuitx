    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_Sw_in_real module implements a single-port RAM using Altera's altsyncram megafunction tailored for Cyclone IV E FPGA. It interfaces through 9-bit address and 32-bit data inputs, controlled by clock and boolean signals (rden, wren) to handle read and write operations. Outputs 32-bit data at 'q' reflecting current memory content at the addressed location. Configured for optimal operation with customizable device settings and standardized data handling."
