It utilizes a memory initialization file \"RAM_speech_122.mif\", supporting a configuration optimized for the Cyclone IV GX device family. Inputs include an 8-bit address, a 32-bit data input, and control signals for read (rden) and write (wren) operations. It outputs a 32-bit data (q) corresponding to the data at the specified address when read is enabled. The RAM is configured not to preserve previous data on power-up and does not allow data to be read during write operations to the same address."
