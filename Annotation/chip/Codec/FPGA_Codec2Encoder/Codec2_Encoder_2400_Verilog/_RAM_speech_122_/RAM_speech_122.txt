Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_122 module implements a single-port RAM targeting speech data storage, utilizing Alteraâ€™s Cyclone IV GX family. It employs an 8-bit address and 32-bit data inputs with read and write enable signals, outputting data based on the specified address. The module uses the `altsyncram` component for core memory operations, configured through parameters to fulfill specific needs like initialization from a ".mif" file and controlled read/write behaviors.
