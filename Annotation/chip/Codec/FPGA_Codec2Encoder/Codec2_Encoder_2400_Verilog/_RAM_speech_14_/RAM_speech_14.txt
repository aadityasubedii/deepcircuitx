Module-level comment: The "RAM_speech_14" module enables single-port RAM operations using an `altsyncram` component, tailored for the Cyclone IV GX device. It manages 32-bit data transactions at user-specified addresses, controlled by `rden` and `wren` signals, synchronized by a clock. Configurations like memory size and initialization are specified, ensuring system-specific optimized memory interactions.
