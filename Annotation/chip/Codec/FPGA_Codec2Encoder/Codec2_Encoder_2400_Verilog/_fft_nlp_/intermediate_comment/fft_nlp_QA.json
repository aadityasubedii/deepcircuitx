It processes complex input data (`in_real_data` and `in_imag_data`) and computes the frequency spectrum, outputting `write_fft_real` and `write_fft_imag`. The computation includes multiple states indicating different parts of the FFT process, such as initialization, loop handling, cosine and sine calculations via a COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm (`cossin_cordic`), division, and accumulative additions. The module is operated in a synchronous manner, governed by a clock (`clk`) and reset (`rst`) signals, and is parameterized to allow flexibility in its bit-width and internal operations. It starts the FFT process upon receiving a high signal on `startfft` and sets `donefft` high upon completion of the transformation, which shows it operates on a start-trigger and completes with a done flag pattern."
