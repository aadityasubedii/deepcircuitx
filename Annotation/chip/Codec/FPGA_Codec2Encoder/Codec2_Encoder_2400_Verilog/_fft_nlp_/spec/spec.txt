Module name: dft. Module specification: The 'dft' module is designed to perform a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on complex input data in Verilog, ideal for frequency spectrum analysis applications. It accepts inputs through ports `startfft` (which initiates the FFT computation), `clk` (the clock signal for synchronization), `rst` (an active-low reset signal), and complex data inputs `in_imag_data` and `in_real_data`. The output includes `donefft` to indicate completion, address signals `addr_in_imag`, `addr_in_real`, `addr_out_real`, and `addr_out_imag` for locating data, and the transformed data `write_fft_real` and `write_fft_imag`. Internally, the module uses several state control and data processing signals like `STATE`, `NEXT_STATE`, and loop counters `k`, `t` to manage the processing flow. It leverages peripherals like multipliers (qmult1-4), adders (adder1-2), and specialized blocks for cosine-sine computation (`cossin_cordic`) and floating-point division (`fpdiv_clk`). The code structure outlines an FSM with states for initialization, computation, and result handling, effectively breaking down the DFT computation into manageable tasks that are executed in sequence as defined by the logic under clock-edged triggers and reset conditions. This structure ensures synchronized, sequential execution of complex mathematical operations integral to FFT processing.
