Module-level comment: The 'dft' module executes Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on complex input data using a structured Finite State Machine (FSM). It manages inputs and outputs through dedicated ports, employs multipliers and adders for computations, and integrates specialized blocks for trigonometric and division operations. The FSM drives the sequence of data processing stages, from initialization through computation to output data storage, triggered by clock and reset signals. This approach effectively segments the transformation into manageable steps, ensuring accurate and synchronized data transformation.
