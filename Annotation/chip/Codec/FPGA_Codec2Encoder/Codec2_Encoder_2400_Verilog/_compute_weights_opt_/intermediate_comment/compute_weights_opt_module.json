    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"compute_weights_opt\" module computes weight values w0 and w1 using a Finite State Machine (FSM) based on inputs x0, x1, xp0, and xp1. Controlled by start, clock, and reset signals, it transitions through multiple states, utilizing arithmetic (qadd, qmult) and comparison (fplessthan, fpgreaterthan) operators to dynamically adjust computations based on input conditions. Outputs include computed weights and a completion signal, encapsulating complex decision logic within a synchronous design framework."
