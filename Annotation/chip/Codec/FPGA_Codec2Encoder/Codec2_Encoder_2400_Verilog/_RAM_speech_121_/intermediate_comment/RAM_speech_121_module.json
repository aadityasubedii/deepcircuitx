    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_121 module implements a single-port RAM utilizing Altera's 'altsyncram' tailored for Cyclone IV GX devices. It manages a 32-bit width, 160-word memory accessed via an 8-bit address. Functionalities include synchronized read/write operations controlled by input signals, using internal wiring (`sub_wire0`) for data flow management from the memory to the output. This design ensures efficient real-time data handling suitable for speech processing applications."
