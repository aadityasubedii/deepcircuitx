It utilizes the `altsyncram` component from Altera (now Intel) to implement the RAM functionality. The RAM is set up to operate in single-port mode with fixed configurations such as a bypass on clock inputs and no data output register clear. It supports data operations based on the provided address and control inputs such as read enable (rden) and write enable (wren). The RAM data width is 32 bits, and it's configured to use an initialization file, \"RAM_speech_76.mif\", specifying the initial contents of the RAM."
