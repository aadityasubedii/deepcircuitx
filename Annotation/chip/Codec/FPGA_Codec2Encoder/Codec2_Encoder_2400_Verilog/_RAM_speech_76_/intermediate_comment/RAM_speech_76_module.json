    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_76 module implements a 32-bit single-port RAM using Altera's altsyncram component. It handles data reads and writes based on an 8-bit address input, synchronized by a clock signal. The input `data` is written or read under the control of `rden` and `wren` signals. Internally, `sub_wire0` transfers the output from altsyncram to the `q` output port. Configuration is specified through parameters like device family and memory initialization from \"RAM_speech_76.mif\"."
