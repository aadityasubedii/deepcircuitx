Module name: cossine_accurate.

Module specification: The `cossine_accurate` module is designed to calculate the cosine and sine values of a provided input angle using iterative Taylor series approximation. It takes three input ports: `startcs`, `clk`, and `rst`, which are the start signal, clock signal, and active low reset signal, respectively, along with an `angle` input, which specifies the angle in radians or a scaled integer representation. The module outputs the calculated cosine (`cos`) and sine (`sin`) values and a signal `donecs` to indicate completion of the computation. Internally, the module uses several signals such as `STATE` and `NEXT_STATE` for managing the state transitions in its finite state machine (FSM), counters like `i` for iterations, and temporary registers `t`, `t1`, `sum`, `sum1` to hold intermediate values and sum results of the series. Signals `rec1` and `rec2` store coefficients for the Taylor series terms, and `startfmod`, `num1`, and `num2` control and provide input to a modulus operation ensuring angles are within a 0 to 2π range. The computation involves multiple instances of fixed-point arithmetic blocks like `fpmodulus` for modulus operation, and `qmult` and `qadd` for multiplying and adding operations, respectively, as specified by the signals `m1_in1`, `m1_in2`, etc., for input and `m1_out`, `a1_out`, etc., for output. The processing starts with initialization and modulo computation, followed by an iterative computation loop controlled by the FSM through multiple states, ending with setting the sine and cosine outputs once the computation is sufficiently accurate after several iterations. The module resets and initializes various counters and accumulators between computations as dictated by the FSM’s states, ensuring robust cyclic operation upon successive calculations.
