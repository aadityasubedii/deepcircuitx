The input angle is first reduced modulo `2\u03c0` to ensure it falls within a standard cycle. The module then uses a Taylor series approximation (as inferred from the iterative computation involving coefficients `rec1` and `rec2`) to calculate the sine (`sin`) and cosine (`cos`) values iteratively, over multiple clock cycles. The process starts when `startcs` is asserted and the module signals completion through `donecs` when the calculations are done. The state machine within controls the flow of the computation tasks performed across multiple cycles dictated by the specified states such as initializing, setting recursive values, multiplying, adding, etc. The design likely uses fixed-point arithmetic module instances (like `fpmodulus`, `qmult`, and `qadd`) to manage the computational accuracy and efficiency."
