Module-level comment: The `cossine_accurate` module computes the cosine and sine of an input angle using iterative Taylor series approximations. It employs a finite state machine (FSM) for managing state transitions across computation steps, leveraging fixed-point arithmetic units (`fpmodulus`, `qmult`, `qadd`) for precision. Interactions between various internal registers and arithmetic modules across states facilitate the accurate and cyclic calculation of trigonometric functions.
