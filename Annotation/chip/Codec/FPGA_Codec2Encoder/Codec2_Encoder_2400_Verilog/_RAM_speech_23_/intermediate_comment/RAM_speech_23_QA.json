This RAM has one input address port and a corresponding data output port. It supports operations such as read and write, controlled by the 'rden' (read enable) and 'wren' (write enable) signals, respectively. The RAM is initialized with data from a \".mif\" (Memory Initialization File) specified by the 'init_file' parameter. The memory is configured not to allow any changes during runtime as indicated by the 'ENABLE_RUNTIME_MOD=NO'. Moreover, the RAM has a specific configuration for handling reads during write operations, which doesn't back-read the newly written data (`NEW_DATA_NO_NBE_READ`). It operates synchronously with the system clock, 'clock'."
