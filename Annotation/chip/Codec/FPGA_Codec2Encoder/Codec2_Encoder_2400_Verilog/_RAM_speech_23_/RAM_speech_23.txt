Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_23 module implements a single-port RAM using the `altsyncram` component for Cyclone IV GX FPGA, facilitating data storage with designated read and write operations. It manages data interactions through input ports (address, data, rden, wren) and output port (q), synchronized by the clock signal. Configuration prevents runtime modifications and specifies read-write behaviors, initialized from `RAM_speech_23.mif`.
