    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_21 module defines a single-port RAM using Altera\u2019s `altsyncram` for rapid data access, suitable for speech processing. It interfaces with 8-bit addresses and 32-bit data inputs/outputs, controlled by read and write enable signals. Internally, it employs a wire `sub_wire0` to route data from `altsyncram` to the output as per the clock synchronization and control logic specified."
