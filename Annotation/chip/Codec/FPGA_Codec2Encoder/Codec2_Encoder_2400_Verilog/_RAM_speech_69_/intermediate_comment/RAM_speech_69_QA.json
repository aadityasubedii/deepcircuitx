It interfaces with external logic or data sources via inputs such as the address bus, data bus, read and write enable signals, and a clock. The outputs include a data bus that outputs the data read from the RAM. The RAM can be configured through parameters like the number of words, width, initialization file, and several control options related to reading and writing behaviors, clock management, and other features. This configuration allows for storing and retrieving data based on the address provided, controlled by read and write enable signals under the synchronization of the provided clock signal."
