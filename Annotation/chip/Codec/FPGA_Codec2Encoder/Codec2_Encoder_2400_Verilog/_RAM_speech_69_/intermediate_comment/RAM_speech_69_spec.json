    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_69.\nModule specification: \nThe RAM_speech_69 module encapsulates a single-port RAM functionality using Altera's altsyncram component, tailored for operations like data storage and retrieval in a synchronous environment. This module interfaces with external systems via input ports which include an 8-bit `address` to specify the RAM location, a synchronous `clock` signal, a 32-bit `data` bus for input data, and control signals `rden` (read enable) and `wren` (write enable). The output is handled through a 32-bit `q` bus, which outputs data read from the specified RAM location. Internally, the module uses a wire `sub_wire0` to transfer output data from the altsyncram component to the `q` output port. The altsyncram component itself is configured to operate in a single-port mode with a specific initialization file, among other parameters that define its behavior such as the number of words and data width. The configuration ensures operations like write and read, controlled by the `wren` and `rden` signals respectively, are performed correctly with respect to the provided clock synchronization, making the module suitable for applications requiring rapid data access and storage in digital systems.\n",

The outputs include a data bus that outputs the data read from the RAM.
