It takes a start signal 'startdiv' and a reset signal 'rst' along with a 32-bit input 'in'. The division process is governed by a state machine that transitions through multiple states to compute the division iteratively. The state machine adjusts values and determines whether to shift the denominator left or right during computations. It accumulates the division result in register 'ans' and signals completion of division through the 'donediv' output once the division is correctly calculated. Adjustments for negative inputs and tracking computation steps are handled within different states of the state machine."
