Module-level comment: The fpdiv_clk_acc module performs synchronized floating-point division. It leverages a state machine controlled by input signals (startdiv, clk, rst) and a 32-bit input 'in'. Outputs are given through 'donediv' and 'ans'. Internally, it uses arithmetic modules (adder, multiplier) and logical comparators to implement iterative calculation. State transitions manage the division specifics, handling negative inputs and alignment adjustments, ensuring precise results per clock cycle.
