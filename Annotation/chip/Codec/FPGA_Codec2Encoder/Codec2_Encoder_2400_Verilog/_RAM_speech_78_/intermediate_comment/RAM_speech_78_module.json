    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_78 module serves as a single-port RAM, primarily for storing and retrieving 32-bit speech data. It interfaces via an 8-bit address, a clock, data inputs, and read/write controls. Internally, it employs the `altsyncram` component from Altera (Intel), setup with specific parameters for memory management and operational modes. `sub_wire0` acts as a buffer for data before delivery to the output `q`. Overall, the module efficiently manages data flow and synchronization in speech processing systems."
