Module-level comment: This module implements a codec2 voice compression encoder for 2400 bps encoding of a single audio frame. It uses a finite state machine to control the encoding process, which includes analyzing the frame, converting speech to LSP, encoding pitch and energy, and quantizing LSP parameters. The module interfaces with memory components and sub-modules for signal processing operations, and outputs a 48-bit encoded bitstream along with intermediate results.
