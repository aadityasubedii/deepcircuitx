    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_82. Module specification: The RAM_speech_82 module is designed for implementing a single-port RAM on an Altera FPGA, specifically for the Cyclone IV GX family, leveraging the \"altsyncram\" component. The module accepts a 8-bit 'address' for specifying memory locations, and a 32-bit 'data' input for writing to these locations. It uses a 'clock' signal to synchronize read and write operations which are controlled by the 'rden' (read enable) and 'wren' (write enable) signals. The output, 'q', is a 32-bit wire that conveys the data read from memory. Internally, the module utilizes 'sub_wire0', a 32-bit wire, which serves as an intermediary storage that holds the data output from the altsyncram component before it is mapped to the 'q' output. The module's architecture includes declarations of input and output ports, specification of signal integrity attributes for the 'clock' and 'rden', and an altsyncram component setup with specific parameters such as operational mode, memory initialization, and clock management tailored for optimized performance in an FPGA environment.",

It is capable of both reading (rden) and writing (wren) operations based on the control signals. The clock signal synchronizes these operations.
