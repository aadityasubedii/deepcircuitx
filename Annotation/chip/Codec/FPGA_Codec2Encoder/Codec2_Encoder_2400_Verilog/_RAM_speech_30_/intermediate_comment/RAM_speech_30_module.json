    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_30 module implements a single-port RAM on an Altera Cyclone IV GX FPGA using the `altsyncram` component. It supports synchronized read and write operations via input signals for address, data, read/write enable, moderated by the clock. Output 'q' displays data read based on the `address` and `rden`. Configurations via `altsyncram_component` ensure optimal RAM utilization and performance, tailored for the specified FPGA family and operational modes."
