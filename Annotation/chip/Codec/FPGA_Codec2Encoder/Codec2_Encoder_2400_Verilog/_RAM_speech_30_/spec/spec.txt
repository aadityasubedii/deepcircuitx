Module name: RAM_speech_30. Module specification: RAM_speech_30 is a Verilog module designed for implementing a single-port RAM on an Altera Cyclone IV GX FPGA, using the `altsyncram` component to support basic read and write operations. The module has five input ports: `address` (8-bit, specifying the memory address for data storage or retrieval), `clock` (synchronizes read and write operations), `data` (32-bit, representing the data to be stored at the address when write enable is active), `rden` (read enable signal, allows data reading from the specified address), and `wren` (write enable signal, enables data writing to the address). It has one output port, `q` (32-bit, presents data read from the specified address when read enable is high). The module includes an internal signal `sub_wire0` (32-bit, used as an intermediate connection from the `altsyncram` output to the module's output port `q`). `altsyncram_component` is the core of the module, configured to handle the RAM operations according to the set parameters like the intended FPGA family, operation mode, memory initialization file, and others, ensuring that the writes and reads to the RAM are managed correctly under the synchronization of the `clock`. This module effectively demonstrates handling and configuring internal FPGA RAM for typical read-write operations while aligning with the FPGA hardware specifications.
