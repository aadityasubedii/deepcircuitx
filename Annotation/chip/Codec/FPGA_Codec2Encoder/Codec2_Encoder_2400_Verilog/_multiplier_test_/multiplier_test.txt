Module-level comment: The `multiplier_test` module multiplies two 8-bit input signals, 'a' and 'b', and adds 9 to their product. This result is directly assigned to the 8-bit output 'out'. The module achieves this through a single Verilog `assign` statement, simplifying the implementation with no internal signals used.
