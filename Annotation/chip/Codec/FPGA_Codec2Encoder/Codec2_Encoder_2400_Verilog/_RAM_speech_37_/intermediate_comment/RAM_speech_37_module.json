    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"RAM_speech_37\" module is a single-port RAM designed for speech applications, using the Cyclone IV GX optimized 'altsyncram' component. It supports 32-bit data operations synchronized by a clock signal, facilitating read and write access based on control signals (rden, wren) and an 8-bit address input. Data transfer is managed internally via a 'sub_wire0' that connects 'altsyncram' output to the RAM output port."
