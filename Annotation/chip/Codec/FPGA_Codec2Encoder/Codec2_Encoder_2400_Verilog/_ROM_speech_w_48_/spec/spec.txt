Module name: ROM_speech_w_48. Module specification: This module implements a Read-Only Memory (ROM) for speech data, containing 320 entries of 48-bit values. It takes a 10-bit address input 'addr' to select one of the 320 entries and outputs the corresponding 48-bit data through 'dataout'. The internal signal 'w' is a 2D array that stores the pre-computed speech-related data for each address. The module is structured with a parameter 'N' set to 48 for the data width, and an always block that initializes the ROM contents and assigns the selected data to the output. The ROM entries are initialized with specific 48-bit values, with the first and last few entries being zeros and the middle entries containing various non-zero values, likely representing a speech waveform or filter coefficients. When given an address, the module outputs the corresponding
