Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements a 320-entry speech data ROM with 48-bit data width.
It uses a 10-bit address input to select and output the corresponding 48-bit data.
The ROM is initialized with pre-computed speech-related values (possibly waveform samples or coefficients).
Data retrieval is performed combinatorially in an always block, with the output updated on address changes.
