It has a 10-bit address input and a 48-bit data output. The ROM contains 320 entries (indexed from 0 to 319), each storing a 48-bit value. The module appears to be storing pre-computed speech-related data, possibly coefficients or waveform samples. When given an address, the module outputs the corresponding 48-bit data stored at that address. The first and last few entries are filled with zeros, while the middle entries contain various non-zero values, suggesting a speech waveform or filter coefficients."
