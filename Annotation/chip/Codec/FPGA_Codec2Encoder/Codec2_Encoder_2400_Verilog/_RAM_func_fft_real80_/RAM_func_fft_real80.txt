Module-level comment: The RAM_func_fft_real80 module implements a single-port RAM tailored for Cyclone IV E FPGA, managing 80-bit data via altsyncram. It supports synchronized read/write operations controlled by `rden` and `wren` signals, with address and data managed through specific ports. Configuration is handled by `defparam` to optimize behavior suited for FFT applications, using internal relaying through `sub_wire0`.
