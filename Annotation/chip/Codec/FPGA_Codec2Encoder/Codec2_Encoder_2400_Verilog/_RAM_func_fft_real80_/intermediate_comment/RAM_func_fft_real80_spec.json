    "spec": "Module name: RAM_func_fft_real80. Module specification: The RAM_func_fft_real80 is a Verilog module designed to implement a single-port RAM using the `altsyncram` component, specifically for the Cyclone IV E FPGA family. The module facilitates both read and write operations where the `address` input port (9-bit) specifies the target memory address, the `clock` input synchronizes operations, and the `data` input (80-bit) carries data to be written into memory. Two control signals, `rden` and `wren`, enable reading and writing respectively. The output on the `q` port (80-bit) displays data fetched from memory. Internally, `sub_wire0` (80-bit) functions as a conduit, passing data from the RAM block to the `q` output port, ensuring that data read from the specified address is promptly reflected at the output. The module prominently features an `altsyncram` component configured for single-port operation with specific parameters like runtime configuration and output data handling detailed through `defparam` settings, which fine-tune the RAM block's behavior to optimize its functionality and performance. This setup effectively supports the module's role in handling data associated with real FFT operations by providing dedicated memory storage and management tailored to specific application needs.",

It selects the location in the memory where data will be written to or read from.\n- `clock`: A clock signal that synchronizes the read and write operations in the RAM.
