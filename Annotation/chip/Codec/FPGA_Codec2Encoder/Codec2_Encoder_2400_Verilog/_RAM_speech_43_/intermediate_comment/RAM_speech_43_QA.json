The RAM is configured to operate using a single data port for both reading and writing data. It takes an 8-bit address and contains 160 words, each 32 bits wide. The RAM does not allow reading during a write operation that targets the same address. The module uses an external clock and supports controlled access to the memory through read enable (rden) and write enable (wren) signals. The behavioral properties of the memory such as its initial contents are configured through a memory initialization file (`RAM_speech_43.mif`). The `OUTPUT` is taken from `sub_wire0`, which is directly connected to the data output of the `altsyncram` component."
