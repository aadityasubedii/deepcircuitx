    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_43 module implements a single-port RAM using Altera\u2019s `altsyncram` for synchronized read/write operations. It supports an 8-bit address and 32-bit data bus, with controlled access via `rden` and `wren` signals. Internally, the module uses `sub_wire0` to link `altsyncram` output to the external data output, ensuring data integrity and timed operation based on an external clock. Configured for Cyclone IV GX, the module is initialized from `RAM_speech_43.mif`."
