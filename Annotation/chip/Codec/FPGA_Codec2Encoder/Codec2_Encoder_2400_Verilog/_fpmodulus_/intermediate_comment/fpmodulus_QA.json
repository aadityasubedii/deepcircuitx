It uses a finite state machine (FSM) with several states such as START, SET_MOD, SET_IF, CHECK_IF, CALC_MOD, ASSIGN_MOD, and DONE to control the flow of the computation. The module checks if 'num1' is larger than 'num2' and calculates their difference until 'num1' is less than 'num2', thus efficiently finding the modulus. The result 'mod' and a 'donefmod' signal flagging completion of the operation are provided as outputs."
