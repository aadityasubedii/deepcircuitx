    "spec": "Module name: fpmodulus. Module specification: The 'fpmodulus' module is crafted for calculating the modulus of two input numbers using a finite state machine (FSM). The module operates with input ports: 'startfmod' for triggering the computation, 'clk' as the clock signal for synchronization, 'rst' for resetting the state machine, and 'num1' and 'num2' which are the numbers involved in the modulus operation. The outputs of the module are 'mod', where the result of num1 % num2 is stored, and 'donefmod', a signal indicating the completion of the operation. Within the module, internal signals include 'c_here' used in the CALC_MOD state, 'STATE' and 'NEXT_STATE' for FSM state management, adder inputs 'a1_in1', 'a1_in2', comparison operands 'gt1_in1', 'gt1_in2', and outputs 'a1_out' from the adder as well as 'gt1' indicating if the current modulus is greater than 'num2'. The FSM transitions through several states such as START, SET_MOD, SET_IF, CHECK_IF, CALC_MOD, ASSIGN_MOD, and DONE to control the flow of the modulus calculation. Alongside the FSM, specific blocks like 'qadd' and 'fpgreaterthan' handle arithmetic and comparison operations crucial for progressing and determining the sequence of FSM states, particularly during modulus checking and assignment operations. The code is structured to reflect the initialization in the START state, evaluating and calculating modulus in subsequent states, and finally completing the computation in the DONE state providing output through 'donefmod'.",
