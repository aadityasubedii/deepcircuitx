    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_87. \n\nModule specification: The RAM_speech_87 module is a Verilog-based single-port Random Access Memory (RAM) leveraging the Altera-specific \"altsyncram\" component. It functions using an 8-bit address input to perform read and write operations of 32-bit data, synchronized by a clock signal. Key input ports include: `address`, which selects the RAM address to access; `clock`, a synchronization signal for operations; `data`, representing the data to be written; `rden`, enabling data reading when set high; and `wren`, enabling data writing when set high. The sole output port, `q`, delivers the 32-bit output data from the specified RAM address if `rden` is active. Internally, the module utilizes a signal `sub_wire0` bridging the output of the altsyncram component to the module's output. The `altsyncram` block itself is configured with parameters such as memory initialization file, device family, and operational behavior, including the mode setting for single port use without allowing read during write operations. Defining parameters (`defparam`) of the `altsyncram_component` specifies attributes like memory size, intended device family, and data handling capabilities, ensuring tailored hardware functionality. The meticulous configuration and parameter setup within this module emphasize its suitability for high-efficiency memory operations in specified FPGA architectures.",
