Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_87 module implements a single-port 32-bit RAM using an Altera-specific "altsyncram" component for FPGA platforms. It supports synchronized read and write operations controlled by clock, read enable (rden), and write enable (wren) signals, with configuration parameters including the memory initialization file and operational modes tailored for the Cyclone IV GX family. This module effectively handles data storage and retrieval tasks by interfacing the altsyncram outputs directly to the module's data output port through internal wiring.
