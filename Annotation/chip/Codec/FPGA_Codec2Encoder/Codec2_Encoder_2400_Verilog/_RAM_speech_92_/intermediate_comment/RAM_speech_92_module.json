    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_92 module simulates a single-port RAM using Altera's altsyncram component with single-port mode configurations. This module handles both reading and writing operations driven by an 8-bit address and respective enable signals (rden, wren), synchronizing via clock input without requiring external clock enable controls. It utilizes a 32-bit internal wire, sub_wire0, and is specifically optimized for the Cyclone IV GX device family."
