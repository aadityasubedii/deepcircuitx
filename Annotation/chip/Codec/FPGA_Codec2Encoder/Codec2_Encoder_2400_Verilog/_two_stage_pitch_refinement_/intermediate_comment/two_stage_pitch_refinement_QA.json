It utilizes finite state machines (FSM) with specified states to orchestrate the computational steps. Key operations within these steps include starting division operations, setting pitch minWidth and maxWidth, adjusting pitch refinement parameters, and employing multipliers and adders for processing. The module interfaces with external FP arithmetic units (like dividers, multipliers, adders, and comparators) and pitch refinement sub-modules (hpr1 and hpr2). The state transitions control the data flow and computation sequencing, advancing upon receiving ready signals from operations like divisions and pitch refinement computations. At the end, refined pitch values are output, and addresses for related data are also managed throughout the computation stages."
