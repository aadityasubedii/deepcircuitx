Module-level comment: The 'two_stage_pitch_refinement' module refines pitch parameters in two stages, using a finite state machine (FSM) for orchestration. It integrates with external FP arithmetic units, leveraging dividers, multipliers, adders, and comparators. Inputs include pitch frequency, sample count, and complex numbers, while outputs offer refined pitch values and related data addresses. The internal process involves conditional computations, interfacing with pitch refinement sub-modules, and accumulating results for finalized outputs.
