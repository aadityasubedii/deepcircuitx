Module-level comment: The qadd module performs signed addition or subtraction on two N-bit inputs, 'a' and 'b', based on their sign bits. Using internal signal 'res', it adds the numbers if their signs are identical, or subtracts if different, assigning the resultant sign correctly. Logic is executed in conditional blocks to manage different sign scenarios and ensure precise arithmetic results on output 'c'.
