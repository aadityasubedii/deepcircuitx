Module name: qadd. Module specification: The qadd module, designed in Verilog, effectively calculates the addition or subtraction of two signed N-bit integers, specifically managing how the sign bits influence the operation. The input ports 'a' and 'b' each accept these N-bit signed numbers, while the module's output, 'c,' also an N-bit signed number, stores the final arithmetic result. Internally, the 'res' register temporarily holds calculations, facilitating correct display on the output port 'c' after operations. The Verilog code dictates logic through several conditional blocks: firstly, it checks if the sign bits of 'a' and 'b' are identical, in which case it performs straightforward addition; secondly, it handles cases where 'a' and 'b' have different signs - conducting subtraction, then deciding the result's sign based on the operands' magnitudes. This well-structured approach ensures correct results even in various computational scenarios, reflecting a meticulously designed system for basic arithmetic operations using signed integers.
