When the sign bits of both inputs (a and b) are the same, the module simply adds their absolute values and assigns the common sign to the result. If the signs differ, the module subtracts the smaller absolute value from the larger one. The result's sign is determined based on whether the first number is larger (keeping the sign of the larger value, i.e., 0 when a > b if a is positive and b is negative, or 1 if b > a in the opposite case). The module properly manages the corner case when the subtraction results in zero, setting the sign bit to 0."
