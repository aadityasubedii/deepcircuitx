    "spec": "Module name: ROM_cb0. Module specification: The ROM_cb0 is a Verilog module designed to function as a read-only memory (ROM) for storing and retrieving predefined 32-bit constant values. It has a single 4-bit wide input port named 'addr', which serves as the address selector to access one of the 16 data entries held within the module. The output port, 'dataout', is 32-bit wide and outputs the selected data entry corresponding to the address provided via 'addr'. Internally, the module utilizes an array named 'cb0' consisting of 16 elements, each capable of storing a 32-bit value. The main always block of the code initializes this array with hardcoded values and assigns the element indexed by 'addr' to 'dataout'. This setup enables the ROM to function as a lookup table, outputting specific data values based on the input address, helpful in various hardware design contexts where fixed configurations are frequently accessed.",

It takes a 4-bit address input which allows selection from one of these 16 data entries. Depending on the 4-bit address provided on 'addr', the corresponding data from the array 'cb0' is output through 'dataout'.
