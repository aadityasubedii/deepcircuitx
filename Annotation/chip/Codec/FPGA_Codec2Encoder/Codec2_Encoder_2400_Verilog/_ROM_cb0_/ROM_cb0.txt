Module-level comment: The ROM_cb0 module acts as a lookup table storing 16 predefined 32-bit values, retrievable via a 4-bit address input 'addr'. It uses an internal array 'cb0' initialized with constants, outputting the selected value on 'dataout' based on the 'addr' input. This structure simulates the ROM behavior essential for accessing fixed configuration data in hardware designs.
