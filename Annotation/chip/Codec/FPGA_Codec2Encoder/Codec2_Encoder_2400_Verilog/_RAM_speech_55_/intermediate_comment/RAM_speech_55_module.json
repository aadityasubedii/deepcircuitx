    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"RAM_speech_55\" module implements a single-port RAM for managing speech data on a Cyclone IV GX FPGA, initialized from \"RAM_speech_55.mif\". It utilizes an `altsyncram` component configured for 160x32-bit storage, operating under a single clock. Ports include an 8-bit `address`, 32-bit `data`, with `rden` and `wren` controls, and a 32-bit output `q`. The internal `sub_wire0` transfers data between the `altsyncram` and the output."
