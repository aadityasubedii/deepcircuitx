The `post_process_sub_multiples` module processes start signals, controls states via a state machine, calculates frequency bins, and manages maximum and minimum thresholds to determine the optimal f0. This is done using arithmetic operations such as multiplication and addition, conditional checks, and a division process, adapting the processing based on the feedback from the calculated values. The module outputs the best f0 value once it completes processing, signaled by the `doneppsm` flag."
