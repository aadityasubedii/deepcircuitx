    "module": "Module-level comment: The `post_process_sub_multiples` module identifies the optimal fundamental frequency (f0) from frequency analysis results. It operates with a state machine controlling processing stages initiated by a `startppsm` signal. The module employs arithmetic and logic units, processing input data from frequency peak bins, enforcing thresholds, and iterating through potential f0 candidates to select the best one, based on dynamic conditions managed within the states. The output is the determined best f0, complemented by flags indicating the completion and addresses for intermediate data fetching, useful for analyzing and fine-tuning frequency recognition routines."
