    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_2 module implements a single-port RAM using the \"altsyncram\" component, tailored for 32-bit data management across 256 locations via an 8-bit address. It synchronizes data transactions on the rising clock edge, with separate enable controls for reading (rden) and writing (wren). The internal `sub_wire0` facilitates data flow from the altsyncram to output `q`, with configurations set for a Cyclone IV E family, ensuring efficient memory operation."
