    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"RAM_W_real\" module implements a single-port RAM using Altera's `altsyncram` for FPGA-based memory operations. It handles 512 words of 32-bit data, interfaced via inputs `address`, `clock`, `data`, `rden`, and `wren`. Data reads and writes at specified addresses are coordinated through `sub_wire0`, reflecting data on `q` output. Configured for a Cyclone IV E FPGA, it initializes from \"RAM_W_real.mif\" without extra clocks or asynchronous clears, optimizing direct memory access."
