Module-level comment: The 'ROM_cb2' module is a read-only memory (ROM) lookup table, providing 32-bit data outputs based on a 4-bit input address. It utilizes an internal array 'cb2' with 16 predefined 32-bit values. Upon receiving an address, it directly outputs the corresponding value from this array using combinational logic in an 'always@(*)' block, efficiently serving as data storage within hardware designs.
