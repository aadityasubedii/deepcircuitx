    "spec": "Module name: ROM_cb2. Module specification: The 'ROM_cb2' module functions as a read-only memory (ROM), serving as a lookup table that provides a 32-bit data output based on a 4-bit input address. The module includes one input port, 'addr', which is a 4-bit signal determining the index into the internal memory array. The output port, 'dataout', delivers a 32-bit value corresponding to the data stored at the address specified by 'addr'. Internally, the module utilizes a signal array 'cb2', consisting of 16 registers each 32-bits wide. This array holds the predefined binary values that are output based on the input address. In the code, the 'always@(*)' block initializes these values and defines the logic to output the corresponding data through 'dataout' based on 'addr'. This setup allows the 'ROM_cb2' to efficiently provide stored data for given addresses, operating essentially as a static data storage or lookup mechanism within hardware designs.",
