    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_85.\nModule specification: The RAM_speech_85 is a single-port RAM module designed for use with the Altera Cyclone IV GX FPGA, leveraging the altsyncram component for memory operations. This module operates with inputs such as an 8-bit `address` specifying the memory location for read and write operations, a `clock` signal for synchronization, a 32-bit `data` input for writing, and control signals `rden` (read enable) and `wren` (write enable) to manage reading and writing respectively. The output is a 32-bit `q` which holds the data read from the specified memory address. Internal signals include `sub_wire0`, a temporary holder for the altsyncram\u2019s output before being relayed to `q`. The code initiates an altsyncram component configured through parameters such as operation mode, data widths, enable and reset controls, and specifies the hardware family and memory initialization file. Key configurations prevent runtime modifications and enable certain data read behaviors during write operations, adhering closely to specific operational requirements for dependable memory management in digital systems.",
