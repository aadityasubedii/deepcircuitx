    "spec": "Module name: hs_pitch_refinement. Module specification: The 'hs_pitch_refinement' module is designed for refining the pitch, specifically harmonic speech pitch, in a DSP system focused on signal processing tasks such as synthesis or enhancement. This module takes a range of pitch values and improves them by maximizing the measured energy. Input ports include `starthpr` (start signal), `clk` (clock signal), `rst` (reset), `Wo_in` (initial angular frequency omega), `L` (loop boundary), and range limits `pmin`, `pmax`, `pstep`. Additionally, it takes in `out_real`, `out_imag`, which are likely part of the input data towards calculating pitch energy, and `m1_out`, `m2_out` for multiplication outputs relevant in different stages. Output ports consist of `Wo_out` (refined angular frequency omega), `m1_in1`, `m1_in2`, `m2_in1`, `m2_in2` (inputs to external multiplication modules), `addr_real`, `addr_imag` (addresses for accessing array memory), and `donehpr` as a completion indicator.\n\nThe internal structure uses signals like `STATE`, `NEXT_STATE` for finite state machine operation which controls the sequence of operations; and a variety of computational intermediate signals such as `Wo`, `E`, and `m` for storing current values of frequency, energy, and loop counter, respectively. Comparator and divider circuit signals like `gt1`, `lt1`, `div_ans`, and various inputs to these blocks (`gt1_in1`, `lt1_in1`, `div_in` etc.) assist in logical and arithmetic decision-making during state transitions.\n\nThe core of the code is segmented into states managed by two major always blocks: one for state transitioning and another handling operations per state, including initializing, calculating, incrementing, comparing values, and determining when to terminate. The design incorporates arithmetic modules (`adder1`, `adder2`), a divider (`divider1`), and comparators (`fpgt1`, `fplt1`) to assist with numeric operations, controlled by signals generated during different states of execution, ensuring that the pitch refinement works within the defined range and steps, incrementally adjusting towards the pitch with highest associated energy calculation, before outputting the refined value and signaling completion.",

Module specification: The 'hs_pitch_refinement' module is designed for refining the pitch, specifically harmonic speech pitch, in a DSP system focused on signal processing tasks such as synthesis or enhancement. This module takes a range of pitch values and improves them by maximizing the measured energy. Input ports include `starthpr` (start signal), `clk` (clock signal), `rst` (reset), `Wo_in` (initial angular frequency omega), `L` (loop boundary), and range limits `pmin`, `pmax`, `pstep`. Additionally, it takes in `out_real`, `out_imag`, which are likely part of the input data towards calculating pitch energy, and `m1_out`, `m2_out` for multiplication outputs relevant in different stages. Output ports consist of `Wo_out` (refined angular frequency omega), `m1_in1`, `m1_in2`, `m2_in1`, `m2_in2` (inputs to external multiplication modules), `addr_real`, `addr_imag` (addresses for accessing array memory), and `donehpr` as a completion indicator.\n\nThe internal structure uses signals like `STATE`, `NEXT_STATE` for finite state machine operation which controls the sequence of operations; and a variety of computational intermediate signals such as `Wo`, `E`, and `m` for storing current values of frequency, energy, and loop counter, respectively. Comparator and divider circuit signals like `gt1`, `lt1`, `div_ans`, and various inputs to these blocks (`gt1_in1`, `lt1_in1`, `div_in` etc.) assist in logical and arithmetic decision-making during state transitions.\n\nThe core of the code is segmented into states managed by two major always blocks: one for state transitioning and another handling operations per state, including initializing, calculating, incrementing, comparing values, and determining when to terminate. The design incorporates arithmetic modules (`adder1`, `adder2`), a divider (`divider1`), and comparators (`fpgt1`, `fplt1`) to assist with numeric operations, controlled by signals generated during different states of execution, ensuring that the pitch refinement works within the defined range and steps, incrementally adjusting towards the pitch with highest associated energy calculation, before outputting the refined value and signaling completion."
