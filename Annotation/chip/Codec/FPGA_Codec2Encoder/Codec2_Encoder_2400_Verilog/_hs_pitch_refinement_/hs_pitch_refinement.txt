Module-level comment: The 'hs_pitch_refinement' module refines pitch by identifying the value with maximum energy within a specified range. Using a state machine, it iterates over potential pitches, calculating their associated energies and comparing these to identify the optimal pitch. Inputs include initial pitch estimates and operational parameters; outputs provide refined pitch and status. Internal arithmetic and comparison units support these operations, controlled via state transitions to ensure systematic refinement and result delivery.
