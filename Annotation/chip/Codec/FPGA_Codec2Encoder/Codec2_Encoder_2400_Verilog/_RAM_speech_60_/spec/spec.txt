Module name: RAM_speech_60.  
Module specification: The RAM_speech_60 module is designed for voice data storage, utilizing a parameterized single-port RAM component (`altsyncram`) targeting high-performance applications in a `Cyclone IV GX` FPGA environment. The module defines its interfaces with five inputs: an 8-bit `address` for specifying the RAM location, a 1-bit `clock` to synchronize operations, a 32-bit `data` port for input data, and two 1-bit control signals, `rden` (read enable) and `wren` (write enable). Outputs include a 32-bit `q`, which outputs data from the specified memory address when reading is enabled. Internally, the module uses a wire `sub_wire0` as an intermediary connection, which receives data from the `altsyncram` component's output and forwards it to the `q` output. The Verilog code is structured with port definition at the beginning, followed by signal declaration including `sub_wire0` and output `q` setup. The `altsyncram` component instantiation adheres to configurations for operational mode, memory initialization, and device-specific settings. Parameters like memory words count, width, and read/write behavioral properties are set explicitly to tailor the module's functionality to its intended use in speech data handling.
