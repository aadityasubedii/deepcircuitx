Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_60 module functions as a single-port RAM tailored for speech data storage, using a parameterized `altsyncram` from Intel. It features inputs for address, clock, data, and control signals (read and write enable), and outputs the data stored at specified addresses. Internally, it leverages `sub_wire0` to link `altsyncram` outputs to the external `q` output, with configurations set for fixed memory size and behavior suitable for `Cyclone IV GX` FPGAs.
