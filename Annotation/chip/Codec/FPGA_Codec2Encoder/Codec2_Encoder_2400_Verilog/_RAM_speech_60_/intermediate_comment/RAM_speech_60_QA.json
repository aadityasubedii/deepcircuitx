It uses an instance of `altsyncram`, a parameterized RAM component from Altera (now Intel), to store and manage the speech data with specific configurations like memory initialization from a \".mif\" file and runtime modification disablement. The RAM's functionality is controlled via inputs for address, data, read enable, and write enable, and it outputs the data stored at the addressed location when read operations are enabled. The module operates within a `Cyclone IV GX` FPGA family environment, suggesting its use in high-performance or resource-constrained applications related to voice or speech processing."

When high, the data at the address specified by `address` is placed on the output.\n- `wren` (1-bit): Write enable signal that allows data to be written to the RAM.
