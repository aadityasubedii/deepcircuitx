It is implemented using the \"altsyncram\" component from Altera (now part of Intel), which is configured to operate in a single-port mode. The module has an input interface for address, data, and control signals (read enable `rden`, write enable `wren`), and it outputs the data stored at the addressed location through the output `q`. The RAM is designed to use an initialization file \"RAM_speech_101.mif\", indicating it is pre-initialized with specific data relevant to speech applications. This setup is mostly used in digital signal processing (DSP) applications, particularly those handling speech or audio data."
