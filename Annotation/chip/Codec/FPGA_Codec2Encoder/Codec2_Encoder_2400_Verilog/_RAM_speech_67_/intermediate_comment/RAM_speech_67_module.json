    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_67 module defines a single-port RAM using the 'altsyncram' for speech data storage, compatible with Cyclone IV GX. It supports 256x32-bit data operations triggered on the clock's rising edge, with separate read and write enable signals. The internal 'sub_wire0' ensures data flows from the altsyncram component to the output 'q' during read operations. Configuration is set for optimal performance with settings like bypassed clock enable and predefined memory initialization."
