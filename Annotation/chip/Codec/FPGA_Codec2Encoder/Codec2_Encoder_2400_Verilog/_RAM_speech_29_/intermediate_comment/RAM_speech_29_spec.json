    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_29. Module specification: The RAM_speech_29 module is designed to implement a single-port RAM utilizing the `altsyncram` component targeting Cyclone IV GX FPGA family. It interfaces through input ports such as `address` (8-bit, for specifying the memory location), `clock` (for synchronizing operations), `data` (32-bit, for writing data), `rden` (read enable, controls reading operations), and `wren` (write enable, controls writing operations). There is one output port `q` (32-bit, outputs data read from the specified address). The module uses an internal signal `sub_wire0` (32-bit) which connects the output data from the `altsyncram` component to the output port `q`. In the Verilog code, sections include port definitions, internal signal declarations, and instantiation of the `altsyncram` component with various parameters like memory initialization, operation mode, and handling for read and write operations set for runtime conditions. By detailed configuration of memory settings such as power-up behavior and collision management during write-read operations, the module effectively manages data storage and retrieval in synchronous digital systems.",
