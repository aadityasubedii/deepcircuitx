Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_29 module implements a single-port RAM interfaced via an 8-bit address and 32-bit data ports, facilitated by the `altsyncram` component targeting Cyclone IV GX. It supports synchronous read/write operations controlled by `rden` and `wren`. Internal wiring links the `altsyncram` output to the module's output, ensuring efficient data flow alignment with configured parameters like memory initialization and write-read collision management.
