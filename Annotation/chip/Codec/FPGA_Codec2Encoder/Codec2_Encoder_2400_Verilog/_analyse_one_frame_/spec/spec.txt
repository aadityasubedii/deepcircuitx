Module name: analyse_one_frame. Module specification: This module performs analysis on a single frame of speech data for voice processing applications. It takes inputs such as startaof (start signal), clk (clock), rst (reset), mem_x_in and mem_y_in (input memory data), in_prev_f0 (previous fundamental frequency), out_sn, out_mem_fir, and out_sq (filtered speech data). The module outputs processed data including mem_x_out and mem_y_out (processed memory data), out_prev_f0 and out_best_f0 (updated frequency estimates), aof_w0_out (estimated fundamental frequency), voiced_bit (voicing indicator), and various control signals for memory operations. Internally, it uses a state machine to control the processing flow, which includes windowing the input samples, performing Discrete Fourier Transform (DF
