    "module": "Module-level comment: This module analyzes a single frame of speech data for voice processing applications. It applies windowing, performs DFT, estimates pitch using NLP, refines pitch estimates, calculates spectral amplitudes, and determines voicing. The module uses a state machine to sequence operations, interfacing with memory for data storage and retrieval. It incorporates various sub-modules for specific processing tasks, including FFT, NLP, pitch refinement, amplitude estimation, and voicing determination."
