Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_58 module implements a single-port RAM using Altera's `altsyncram` component on Cyclone IV GX FPGA. It addresses 256 locations with 32-bit width, initialized from "RAM_speech_58.mif". It manages read and write operations synchronized by a clock, enabled by `rden` and `wren`. Data flow is handled internally using `sub_wire0`, linking the `altsyncram` output to module output `q`.
