Module name: RAM_speech_58. Module specification: The RAM_speech_58 module implements a single-port RAM utilizing the `altsyncram` component designed for Altera's Cyclone IV GX FPGA series. This module is configured for a memory with an 8-bit address and a 32-bit data width, initialized from a file named "RAM_speech_58.mif." It supports read and write operations facilitated by the input ports `address`, `clock`, `data`, `rden` (read enable), and `wren` (write enable). The `address` port selects the memory location, the `clock` synchronizes operations, `data` provides input for write operations, `rden` enables reading, and `wren` enables writing. The output port `q` outputs the data read from the memory at the specified address. Internally, the `sub_wire0` signal connects the output from the `altsyncram` component to the `q` output. The code block encompassing the `altsyncram_component` declaration manages the specific configurations and behaviors of the memory such as runtime write prevention, along with setting the initialization file and device compatibility details. This module ensures efficient memory access and modification restrictions suitable for application-specific deployments on supported FPGA devices.
