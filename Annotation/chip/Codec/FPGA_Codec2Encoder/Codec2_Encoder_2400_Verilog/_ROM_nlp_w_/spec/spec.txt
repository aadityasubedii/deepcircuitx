Module name: ROM_nlp_w. Module specification: The ROM_nlp_w is a Verilog module designed to function as a Read-Only Memory (ROM) which holds a predefined set of 80-bit data values used for constant configurations or lookup tables in digital systems. The module utilizes a 6-bit input port named `addr`, which acts as a selector to pick and output a specific data entry from a pre-loaded array of data stored within the module. The data corresponding to the entered address is provided through an 80-bit output port named `dataout`. Internally, the module defines an 80-bit wide array `nlp_w` that contains 64 hardcoded binary values, serving the primary storage for the ROM content that `dataout` will send to other parts of the digital system based on the `addr` input. The code within the module includes an always block that effectively assigns the value from the `nlp_w` array indexed by `addr` to `dataout`, facilitating the data retrieval process based on the address received.
