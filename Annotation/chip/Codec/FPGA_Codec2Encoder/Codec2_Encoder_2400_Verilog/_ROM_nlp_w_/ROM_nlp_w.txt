Module-level comment: The ROM_nlp_w module serves as a Read-Only Memory storing 64 predefined 80-bit values, mapped by a 6-bit address input (`addr`). It outputs the selected data using an `addr` indexed lookup from the `nlp_w` internal array to the `dataout` port. This setup enables efficient retrieval of constant data for configuration or look-up purposes in digital designs.
