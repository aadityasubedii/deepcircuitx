It uses the input address signal, `addr`, to select and output a specific 80-bit wide data value from the pre-loaded array `nlp_w`. Each address corresponds to an index in the `nlp_w` memory block, where binary values are hardcoded. The output data for each address is assigned to `dataout` depending on the value of `addr`. This setup is typically used for storing constant configurations or lookup tables in digital systems."

The value of `addr` determines which 80-bit data entry from the memory block is outputted through the `dataout` port. It acts as the address selector for the ROM data retrieval.\n\nOutput ports: dataout.\nExplanation: The `dataout` is an 80-bit output port that serves to provide the data corresponding to the address specified by the `addr` input. It outputs the content from the `nlp_w` memory block based on the index given by `addr`. This port essentially outputs the requested ROM data, making it accessible elsewhere in the design or system where the ROM module is integrated."
