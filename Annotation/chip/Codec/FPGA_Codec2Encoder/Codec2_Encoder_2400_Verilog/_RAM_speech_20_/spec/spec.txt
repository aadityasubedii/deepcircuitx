Module name: RAM_speech_20. 
Module specification: The RAM_speech_20 module implements a single-port RAM using the `altsyncram` component from Altera, specifically tailored for the Cyclone IV GX device family. This module operates with a single clock and supports read and write functionalities. It features the following input ports: `address`, an 8-bit signal determining the RAM location for data access; `clock`, a synchronization signal for read/write operations; `data`, a 32-bit input specifying data to write into RAM; `rden`, a signal that when high, enables data reading from RAM; and `wren`, a signal that enables writing data to RAM when high. The sole output port, `q`, is a 32-bit signal outputting data read from the RAM. Internally, the module uses a signal `sub_wire0` to interconnect the output of the `altsyncram` component to the `q` output port. The `altsyncram` component is configured with various parameters such as memory initialization from "RAM_speech_20.mif", operation mode set to "SINGLE_PORT", and specific settings that inhibit reading during write operations. The code initialization defines the use of tri-state buffers for `clock` and `rden` to ensure robust signal integrity, and it includes specific compiler directives that standardize the simulation and synthesis behavior across different tools.
