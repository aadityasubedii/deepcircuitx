    "spec": "Module name: RAM_speech_99. \nModule specification: The RAM_speech_99 module implements a single-port RAM tailored for the Cyclone IV GX FPGA family, utilizing the altsyncram component to manage data storage and retrieval. It is designed to handle a data width of 32 bits with an 8-bit address input, supporting up to 160 words. The input ports include: 'address' for specifying the memory address in read/write operations, 'clock' for synchronizing the operations, 'data' for input data to be written, 'rden' to enable reading, and 'wren' to enable writing. The output port 'q' outputs the data read from the specified memory address. The module employs an internal signal, 'sub_wire0', which connects the output of the altsyncram component ('q_a') to the 'q' output port, facilitating the transfer of read data out of the RAM. The Verilog code is segregated into declaration of module and IO ports, the instantiation of internal signals, the configuration and instantiation of the altsyncram component. Key settings for the altsyncram component include initialization from a MIF file, enabling only single-port operation without runtime modification capability, and specific handling of read-during-write situations to ensure data integrity.",
