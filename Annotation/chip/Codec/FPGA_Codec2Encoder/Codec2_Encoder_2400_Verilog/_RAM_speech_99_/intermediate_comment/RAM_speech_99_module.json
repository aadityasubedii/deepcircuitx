    "module": "Module-level comment: The RAM_speech_99 module implements a single-port RAM specifically for Cyclone IV GX FPGAs using the altsyncram component. It supports 32-bit data width, 8-bit addressing for 160 words, and enables read/write operations synchronized by a clock input. Internal signal 'sub_wire0' bridges the component\u2019s output to the RAM's output port 'q'. Configuration is fixed, initialized from \"RAM_speech_99.mif\", and does not support runtime modifications."
