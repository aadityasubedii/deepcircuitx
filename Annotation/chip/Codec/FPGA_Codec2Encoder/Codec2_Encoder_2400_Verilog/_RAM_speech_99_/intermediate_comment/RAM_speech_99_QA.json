It is configured to handle 32-bit data widths with an 8-bit address width, allowing for 160 words of data. The RAM supports operations such as read and write, enabled by input signals for read enable (rden), write enable (wren), and clock. The implementation ensures that read operations fetch the newest data even during simultaneous write operations to the same address. The RAM is initialized from a file \"RAM_speech_99.mif\" and does not support runtime modification of its parameters."
