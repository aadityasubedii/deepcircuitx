The FPGA_Codec2Encoder repository is designed to implement a CODEC2 speech encoder at 2400 bps along with supporting modules that handle a variety of related signal processing tasks in a Verilog environment optimized for Cyclone IV GX FPGAs. The repository contains multiple RAM modules configured specifically for speech data, performing both read and write operations, and making heavy use of Altera's altsyncram component for efficient memory management. Additionally, there are modules dedicated to performing arithmetic operations such as logarithm calculations, modulus, floating-point division, and Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), all crucial for the encoding and speech processing tasks. Each module typically integrates a finite state machine (FSM) to manage its operations, ensuring that data flow and computational logic are meticulously controlled. Various modules also interface with external memory components and leverage internal arithmetic units to perform complex calculations, pointing towards a highly specialized and optimized system for speech encoding and signal processing in FPGA environments. This architecture not only supports the primary function of speech encoding at 2400 bps but also enhances the capability of the FPGA system to handle auxiliary processes such as pitch analysis, spectral computations, and data storage with robustness and precision.
