Module name: i2c_av_config.  
Module specification: The `i2c_av_config` module is responsible for configuring audio and video settings via an I2C bus. Utilizing a clock (`clk`) to manage timing and a reset signal (`reset`) to initialize internal states, the module controls data transfer to an external device through its output ports: `i2c_sclk` for the serial clock, `i2c_sdat` for the bidirectional serial data, and `status` that outputs the current index of data being processed from the lookup table. Internal signals include `i2c_data`, a 24-bit register combining a device address with lookup table data; `lut_data`, the actual data fetched from the lookup table; and `lut_index`, which tracks the position in the lookup table. Other signals include `i2c_start` to trigger I2C communication, `i2c_done` indicating transaction completion, and `i2c_ack` for acknowledgment feedback. The Verilog code contains two main blocks: An `always @(*)` block for fetching lookup table data based on `lut_index`, and a sequential `always @(posedge clk)` block implementing a state machine that manages I2C transaction initiation, processing, and retries or moves to the next lookup table entry upon successful communication. The `i2c_controller` submodule is interfaced within the module to handle low-level I2C operations based on provided control signals and data.
