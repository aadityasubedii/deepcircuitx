It utilizes an I2C controller sub-module to send configuration data stored in a lookup table (`lut_data`). The module sequences through the lookup table entries, sending each as part of an I2C transaction. The control state machine handles the initiation of I2C transactions and waits for their completion, advancing through the lookup table entries and managing retries if an acknowledgment (`i2c_ack`) is not received. The index of the current lookup table entry is reflected in the `status` output, allowing external observation of progress or diagnostics. The operation is dependent on an input clock (`clk`) and a reset signal (`reset`)."

It also serves as the value for the `status` output, indicating the progress of configuration.\n- `i2c_start`: This 1-bit signal serves as a control flag for the `i2c_controller` submodule, triggering the start of an I2C transaction when set to `1`.\n- `i2c_done`: This wire signal from the `i2c_controller` submodule indicates the completion of an ongoing I2C transaction. It helps the local control logic determine when to proceed to the next step.\n- `i2c_ack`: This wire signal from the `i2c_controller` indicates whether the last I2C transaction was acknowledged by the slave device. It is essential for error handling and determining successful configuration.\n- `control_state`: This 2-bit register represents the current state of the control state machine. It governs the operation sequence from starting an I2C transaction, waiting for its completion, and handling the success or retry based on acknowledgment."
