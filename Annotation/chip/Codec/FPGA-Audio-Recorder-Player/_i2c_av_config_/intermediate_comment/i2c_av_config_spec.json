    "spec": "Module name: i2c_av_config.  \nModule specification: The `i2c_av_config` module is responsible for configuring audio and video settings via an I2C bus. Utilizing a clock (`clk`) to manage timing and a reset signal (`reset`) to initialize internal states, the module controls data transfer to an external device through its output ports: `i2c_sclk` for the serial clock, `i2c_sdat` for the bidirectional serial data, and `status` that outputs the current index of data being processed from the lookup table. Internal signals include `i2c_data`, a 24-bit register combining a device address with lookup table data; `lut_data`, the actual data fetched from the lookup table; and `lut_index`, which tracks the position in the lookup table. Other signals include `i2c_start` to trigger I2C communication, `i2c_done` indicating transaction completion, and `i2c_ack` for acknowledgment feedback. The Verilog code contains two main blocks: An `always @(*)` block for fetching lookup table data based on `lut_index`, and a sequential `always @(posedge clk)` block implementing a state machine that manages I2C transaction initiation, processing, and retries or moves to the next lookup table entry upon successful communication. The `i2c_controller` submodule is interfaced within the module to handle low-level I2C operations based on provided control signals and data.",

It utilizes an I2C controller sub-module to send configuration data stored in a lookup table (`lut_data`). The module sequences through the lookup table entries, sending each as part of an I2C transaction. The control state machine handles the initiation of I2C transactions and waits for their completion, advancing through the lookup table entries and managing retries if an acknowledgment (`i2c_ack`) is not received.

It also serves as the value for the `status` output, indicating the progress of configuration.\n- `i2c_start`: This 1-bit signal serves as a control flag for the `i2c_controller` submodule, triggering the start of an I2C transaction when set to `1`.\n- `i2c_done`: This wire signal from the `i2c_controller` submodule indicates the completion of an ongoing I2C transaction.

It is essential for error handling and determining successful configuration.\n- `control_state`: This 2-bit register represents the current state of the control state machine. It governs the operation sequence from starting an I2C transaction, waiting for its completion, and handling the success or retry based on acknowledgment."
