Module-level comment: The `i2c_av_config` module configures AV settings via I2C, using a lookup table. It processes data sequentially indexed by `lut_index` and managed by a state machine. Transmissions are triggered and monitored via `i2c_start`, `i2c_done`, and `i2c_ack`, with a connected `i2c_controller` submodule handling the I2C details. Output status reflects progress by displaying the current `lut_index`.
