    "module": "Module-level comment: The `rs232_uart` module implements an RS-232 UART interface, handling serial data transmission and reception. It uses input ports like `tx_data_in` for loading transmission data and `rs232_rx` for receiving serial data, and output ports such as `rx_data_out` and `rs232_tx` for data output and connection to external RS-232 lines, respectively. Internally, it manages baud rate with a clock cycle counter (`baud_count`) and synchronization signal (`en_16_x_baud`). The module contains `uart_tx6` and `uart_rx6` submodules for transmit and receive buffer management, ensuring effective serial communication."
