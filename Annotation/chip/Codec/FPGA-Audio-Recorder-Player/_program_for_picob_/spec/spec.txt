Module name: program. Module specification: The 'program' module implements a program memory or instruction ROM, likely for a PicoBlaze microcontroller, optimized for a Spartan-6 FPGA. It takes a 12-bit address input and provides an 18-bit instruction output. The module has three input ports: address[11:0] for selecting the instruction, enable for activating the module, and clk for synchronous operations. The single output port is instruction[17:0], which provides the retrieved instruction data. Internally, the module uses multiple signals to interface with RAMB16BWER (Block RAM) instances, including address_a, data_out_a_*, and pipe_a11 for instruction selection. The module is structured with four RAMB16BWER instances (kcpsm6_rom_ll, kcpsm6_rom_l
