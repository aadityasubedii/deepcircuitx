Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements a program memory (instruction ROM) for a PicoBlaze-like microcontroller.
It uses four RAMB16BWER instances to store instructions, with LUT6_2 primitives for instruction
decoding and multiplexing. The module takes a 12-bit address input and outputs an 18-bit
instruction, optimized for Spartan-6 FPGA architecture.
