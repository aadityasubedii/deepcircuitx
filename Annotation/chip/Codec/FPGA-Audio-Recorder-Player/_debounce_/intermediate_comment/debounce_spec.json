    "spec": "Module name: debounce. \nModule specification: The 'debounce' module is designed to stabilize the input from a mechanical button by filtering out noise or oscillations. It operates synchronized to a clock signal. The module takes two inputs: 'clk', the clock input which drives internal logic including button input sampling, and 'i_btn', the raw button input susceptible to bounces. The module provides three outputs: 'o_state', the debounced state of the button which toggles only when the signal is stable for a specific period; 'o_ondn', a signal that goes high for one cycle when the button transitions from released to pressed; and 'o_onup', which goes high for one cycle upon transitioning from pressed to released. Internally, the module utilizes several key signals: 'sync_0' and 'sync_1', two registers for initial synchronization to reduce noise and glitches; 'counter', a 19-bit register to count the duration of signal stability; 'idle', a wire signal that checks if the button state is stable; and 'max', a condition indicating when the counter reaches its limit. The code features multiple always blocks to manage synchronization of the button signals and to adjust the counter based on the button's state stability, alongside assignments for output signals depending on counter conditions and button state changes. This structured approach ensures accurate detection and output indication of a button's press and release events with minimal noise interference.",

The module synchronizes the button input to the clock signal using two registers, `sync_0` and `sync_1`, to capture and delay the button state. It uses a counter to measure the time the button signal remains consistent (either high or low). The output state (`o_state`) toggles only if the button signal is stable for a sufficient duration, determined by the counter reaching its maximum value. Additionally, the module generates signals (`o_ondn` and `o_onup`) indicating the exact moments when the button is pressed down or released, respectively, after confirming the button's debounced state change."

Each positive edge of the clock drives the internal logic, including the sampling of the button input and updating of the internal states and counters.\n- i_btn: This is the raw input from a mechanical button which may have bouncing effects. The debounce module processes this input to generate a stable, debounced output.\n\nOutput ports: o_state, o_ondn, o_onup.\nExplanation:\n- o_state: This is the debounced state of the button. It changes state (toggles) only when the button input has been stable (unchanged) for a sufficiently long period determined by the `max` condition of the counter. This is the primary debounced output which reflects the stable state of the button.\n- o_ondn (output on down): This signal becomes high for one clock cycle when the debounced button state has just transitioned from not pressed to pressed. It indicates the moment the button is confirmed to be pressed down after filtering out any bounces.\n- o_onup (output on up): Similar to `o_ondn`, this signal becomes high for one clock cycle when the debounced button state transitions from pressed to not pressed. It signals the moment the button is released, providing a clean indication of this event."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: sync_0, sync_1, counter, idle, max.\nExplanation:\n- sync_0: This is a register used to capture the first level of synchronization of the raw button input (`i_btn`) with respect to the clock (`clk`). It helps in reducing the impact of any noise or glitches from the button input in the subsequent processing stages.\n- sync_1: This register captures the state of `sync_0` delayed by one clock cycle. The use of a double synchronization technique (using sync_0 and sync_1) minimizes metastability issues and further cleans the button signal from potential bounces or glitches.\n- counter: A 19-bit counter used to measure the duration for which the button signal (`sync_1`) has remained constant (either high or low). This is essential for determining the stability of the button state and assists in debouncing.\n- idle: This is a wire signal derived as a logical expression, evaluating if the debounced output state (`o_state`) matches the current stable input (`sync_1`). This signal is used to identify if the button state is stable or has changed, helping to manage the counter reset or increment.\n- max: A wire signal indicating when the counter reaches its maximum value, interpreted by checking if all bits of the `counter` are set to 1. This condition is crucial for toggling the debounced output state (`o_state`) or triggering the output signals (`o_ondn` and `o_onup`) marking the button's press or release events."
