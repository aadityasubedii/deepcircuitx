The module synchronizes the button input to the clock signal using two registers, `sync_0` and `sync_1`, to capture and delay the button state. It uses a counter to measure the time the button signal remains consistent (either high or low). The output state (`o_state`) toggles only if the button signal is stable for a sufficient duration, determined by the counter reaching its maximum value. Additionally, the module generates signals (`o_ondn` and `o_onup`) indicating the exact moments when the button is pressed down or released, respectively, after confirming the button's debounced state change."

Each positive edge of the clock drives the internal logic, including the sampling of the button input and updating of the internal states and counters.\n- i_btn: This is the raw input from a mechanical button which may have bouncing effects. The debounce module processes this input to generate a stable, debounced output.\n\nOutput ports: o_state, o_ondn, o_onup.\nExplanation:\n- o_state: This is the debounced state of the button. It changes state (toggles) only when the button input has been stable (unchanged) for a sufficiently long period determined by the `max` condition of the counter. This is the primary debounced output which reflects the stable state of the button.\n- o_ondn (output on down): This signal becomes high for one clock cycle when the debounced button state has just transitioned from not pressed to pressed. It indicates the moment the button is confirmed to be pressed down after filtering out any bounces.\n- o_onup (output on up): Similar to `o_ondn`, this signal becomes high for one clock cycle when the debounced button state transitions from pressed to not pressed. It signals the moment the button is released, providing a clean indication of this event."

It helps in reducing the impact of any noise or glitches from the button input in the subsequent processing stages.\n- sync_1: This register captures the state of `sync_0` delayed by one clock cycle. The use of a double synchronization technique (using sync_0 and sync_1) minimizes metastability issues and further cleans the button signal from potential bounces or glitches.\n- counter: A 19-bit counter used to measure the duration for which the button signal (`sync_1`) has remained constant (either high or low). This is essential for determining the stability of the button state and assists in debouncing.\n- idle: This is a wire signal derived as a logical expression, evaluating if the debounced output state (`o_state`) matches the current stable input (`sync_1`). This signal is used to identify if the button state is stable or has changed, helping to manage the counter reset or increment.\n- max: A wire signal indicating when the counter reaches its maximum value, interpreted by checking if all bits of the `counter` are set to 1. This condition is crucial for toggling the debounced output state (`o_state`) or triggering the output signals (`o_ondn` and `o_onup`) marking the button's press or release events."
