Module-level comment: The 'debounce' Verilog module stabilizes mechanical button inputs by filtering out noise or bounces. It synchronizes the raw button input ('i_btn') using a two-stage register system ('sync_0', 'sync_1'), monitors stability via a 19-bit counter, and outputs the debounced state ('o_state'). Additional signals ('o_ondn', 'o_onup') indicate precise moments of button press and release based on the counter reaching a pre-defined limit and state changes.
