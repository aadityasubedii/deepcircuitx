Module name: debounce. 
Module specification: The 'debounce' module is designed to stabilize the input from a mechanical button by filtering out noise or oscillations. It operates synchronized to a clock signal. The module takes two inputs: 'clk', the clock input which drives internal logic including button input sampling, and 'i_btn', the raw button input susceptible to bounces. The module provides three outputs: 'o_state', the debounced state of the button which toggles only when the signal is stable for a specific period; 'o_ondn', a signal that goes high for one cycle when the button transitions from released to pressed; and 'o_onup', which goes high for one cycle upon transitioning from pressed to released. Internally, the module utilizes several key signals: 'sync_0' and 'sync_1', two registers for initial synchronization to reduce noise and glitches; 'counter', a 19-bit register to count the duration of signal stability; 'idle', a wire signal that checks if the button state is stable; and 'max', a condition indicating when the counter reaches its limit. The code features multiple always blocks to manage synchronization of the button signals and to adjust the counter based on the button's state stability, alongside assignments for output signals depending on counter conditions and button state changes. This structured approach ensures accurate detection and output indication of a button's press and release events with minimal noise interference.
