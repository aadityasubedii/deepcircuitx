The FPGA-Audio-Recorder-Player repository is designed to facilitate a complete audio processing system on an FPGA, encompassing functionalities like audio recording, playback, and effects management. It includes modules such as a core 'controller' for orchestrating audio and system control tasks, 'i2c_controller' and 'i2c_av_config' for handling I2C communication and audio visual settings adjustment, and 'debounce' for stabilizing button inputs. Audio data transmission is managed by specialized modules like 'audio_codec' for synchronization between codec and digital system, and 'audio_effects' for audio sample manipulation. Memory operations are managed through 'ram_interface_wrapper', and instructions for the audio processor are maintained in 'myprogram2' and 'program_for_picob'. This repository also incorporates PicoBlaze soft microcontroller core implemented in 'kcpsm6_for_picob' and 'picob', integrating instruction memory and processor interfacing. Communication modules like 'rs232_uart', 'uart_rx6', and 'uart_tx6' ensure robust serial data handling. The 'sockit_top' serves as the main module for integrating submodules and controlling overall audio processing. Each component is meticulously designed to ensure efficient operations, leveraging state machines, look-up tables, and various synchronization mechanisms to deliver precise and user-controlled audio functionalities in a digital embedded environment.
