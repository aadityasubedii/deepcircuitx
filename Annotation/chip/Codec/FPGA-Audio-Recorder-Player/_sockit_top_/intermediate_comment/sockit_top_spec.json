    "spec": "Module name: sockit_top. Module specification: The 'sockit_top' module is the top-level integration for an audio processing system on a System on Chip (SoC). It manages audio data routing, volume adjustment, and I/O synchronization with external audio codecs and effect processing units. The module interfaces with hardware components like clocks and I/Os for audio data, and control signals for volume and playback. Key input ports include 'clk' for the main clock signal, 'playback' to toggle between playback and recording modes, 'volume_control' (2-bit input) for adjusting audio output volume, 'AUD_ADCDAT' for digital audio input, 'KEY' (4-bit) for additional controls, 'SW' (4-bit) for configuration controls, and 'audio_in' (16-bit) for raw audio data input. Output ports consist of various control and data signals like 'AUD_ADCLRCK', 'AUD_DACLRCK', 'AUD_DACDAT', 'AUD_XCK', 'AUD_BCLK', 'AUD_I2C_SCLK', 'AUD_I2C_SDAT', 'AUD_MUTE', 'PLL_LOCKED', 'audio_out' (16-bit processed audio data), and 'audio_clk' for audio-specific operations. Internal signals such as 'audio_selection', 'audio_output', 'audio_input', 'reset', 'main_clk', 'sample_end', and 'sample_req' manage selections, data routing, synchronization, and resets based on external conditions and circuit states. The module encompasses integrated sub-modules like a clock wizard for clock management, an I2C configuration block for codec setup, and an audio_codec and audio_effects modules for processing and management of audio signals to balance functionality, efficiency, and user interaction requirements.",
