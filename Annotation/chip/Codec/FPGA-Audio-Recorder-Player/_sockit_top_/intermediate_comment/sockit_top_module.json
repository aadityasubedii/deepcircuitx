    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'sockit_top' module integrates audio processing on an SoC, managing data routing and volume control via interfacing clocks and I/Os. It comprises input signals for controls and audio data, outputs for signals and processed audio, and internal logic for data handling and synchronization. The module utilizes sub-modules like clock management, I2C configuration, and audio processing blocks to enable configurable and responsive audio handling based on user inputs and internal circuit states."
