    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'audio_effects' module processes incoming audio samples by applying effects based on control signals. It handles sample processing within a clock-driven 'always' block, using a ROM table for sine wave outputs and feedback for volume-controlled outputs. It utilizes internal registers for ROM data, the last sample storaged, output data, and sine index management. The module supports different operational modes, switching between sine output, feedback modification, or emitting zero based on the 4-bit control input."
