Module name: audio_effects. Module specification: The 'audio_effects' module is designed to apply specific audio effects to incoming audio samples based on the state of its control signals. The module operates with several input ports including 'clk' (a clock signal for timing), 'sample_end' (indicating completion of current audio sample processing), 'sample_req' (requesting the processing of a new audio sample), 'volume_control' (determining the level of volume adjustment during feedback processing), 'audio_input' (a 16-bit port providing the sample to process), and 'control' (a 4-bit signal selecting the operation mode). The singular output port 'audio_output' delivers the processed 16-bit audio data. Internally, the module uses 'romdata', a predefined sine wave ROM table, 'index' to manage current ROM access position, 'last_sample' to store the last processed audio value, and 'dat' which caches the output data being processed. The module encompasses initializations to fill the 'romdata' array with sine values, sequential logic in an 'always' block that responds to edge triggers of the 'clk'. It updates 'last_sample' at the end of each sample, and within a sample request, selects the processing mode based on 'control': directly output the sine wave value from 'romdata', apply a volume modified version of 'last_sample', or output zero if no conditions are met. Transitioning through the sine table is managed by checking and updating 'index'. This module effectively synthesizes complex audio effects driven by external controls in real-time.
