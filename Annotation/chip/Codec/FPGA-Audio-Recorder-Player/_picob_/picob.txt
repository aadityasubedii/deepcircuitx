Module-level comment: The 'picoblaze' module serves as a controller interfacing with a PicoBlaze soft processor core. It manages inputs such as 'reset', 'clk', 'interrupt', and 'in_port', and outputs including 'port_id', 'read_strobe', 'write_strobe', 'out_port', and 'interrupt_ack' to facilitate processor control and data interfacing. The module houses two key components: 'pblaze_cpu' for processor functions and 'pblaze_rom' for instruction storage, efficiently coordinating execution, communication, and interrupt management in a synchronized digital environment.
