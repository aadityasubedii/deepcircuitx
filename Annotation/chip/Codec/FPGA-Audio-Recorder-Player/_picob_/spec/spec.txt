Module name: picoblaze. Module specification: The 'picoblaze' module in Verilog is designed to interface with a PicoBlaze processor, serving as a mediator between the processor and external devices. It includes both input and output ports such as 'reset', 'clk', 'interrupt', and 'in_port'. The 'reset' port is used to restart the processor to a known state, 'clk' synchronizes the module operations, 'interrupt' initiates an event response from the processor, and 'in_port' accepts external 8-bit data inputs. The output ports include 'port_id', 'read_strobe', 'write_strobe', 'out_port', and 'interrupt_ack', managing data read and write operations, port identification, processed data output, and interrupt acknowledgment respectively. Internally, signals like 'cpu_reset', 'pb_sleep', 'address', 'instruction', and 'bram_enable' are utilized to reset the CPU, disable sleep mode, interface address and instruction data between the ROM and the CPU, and enable ROM access. The module comprises two major blocks: 'pblaze_cpu' for the PicoBlaze processor instantiation and 'pblaze_rom' for instruction memory, facilitating program execution and interaction between the CPU and the instruction storage. This setup ensures seamless data handling, efficient execution of stored instructions, and responsive interrupt management in digital hardware systems.
