Module-level comment: The 'controller' module manages audio processing and system control for an embedded audio system. It synchronizes audio data handling, volume adjustments, and state transitions through internal and interfaced signals, leveraging clock signals, user inputs, serial communication, and memory management. Key functionalities are implemented in sub-modules like 'picoblaze' for microcontroller tasks, 'ram_interface_wrapper' for memory operations, and 'sockit_top' for core audio tasks, orchestrated by state machine logic in detailed always blocks.
