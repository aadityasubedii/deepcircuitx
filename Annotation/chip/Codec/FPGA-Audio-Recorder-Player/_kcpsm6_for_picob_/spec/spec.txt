Module name: kcpsm6. Module specification: The kcpsm6 module implements a PicoBlaze-6 soft microcontroller core for FPGA systems. It features instruction decoding, arithmetic and logic operations, register banks, program counter management, stack operations, and interrupt handling. The module has input ports for instruction (18-bit), in_port (8-bit), interrupt, sleep, reset, and clock signals, and output ports for address (12-bit), bram_enable, out_port (8-bit), port_id (8-bit), write_strobe, k_write_strobe, read_strobe, and interrupt_ack. Internal signals include control signals for timing states, execution control, reset handling, interrupt management, ALU operations, flag handling, and memory operations. The module is organized into several functional blocks, including instruction decoding, arithmetic and logic unit (ALU
