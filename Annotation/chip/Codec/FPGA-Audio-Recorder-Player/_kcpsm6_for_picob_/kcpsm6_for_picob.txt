Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements a PicoBlaze-6 soft microcontroller core for FPGA systems.
It features instruction decoding, arithmetic/logic operations, register banks,
program counter management, stack operations, and interrupt handling. The core
uses a multi-stage pipeline with separate instruction fetch, decode, and execute
stages. It includes an ALU for data processing, dual register banks, a hardware
stack, and supports interrupt handling. The module interfaces with external
memory and I/O through dedicated ports and control signals.
