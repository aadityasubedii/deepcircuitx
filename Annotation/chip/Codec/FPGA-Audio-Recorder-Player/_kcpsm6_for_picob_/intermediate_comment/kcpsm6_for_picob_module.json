    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/*\nThis module implements a PicoBlaze-6 soft microcontroller core for FPGA systems.\nIt features instruction decoding, arithmetic/logic operations, register banks,\nprogram counter management, stack operations, and interrupt handling. The core\nuses a multi-stage pipeline with separate instruction fetch, decode, and execute\nstages. It includes an ALU for data processing, dual register banks, a hardware\nstack, and supports interrupt handling. The module interfaces with external\nmemory and I/O through dedicated ports and control signals.\n*/"
