    "spec": "Module name: audio_codec.\n\nModule specification: The `audio_codec` module facilitates the transmission of digital audio data between an audio coder-decoder and a digital system. It synchronizes data transfer via ADC and DAC, manages volume control, channel selection, and tracks the timing of audio sampling. This module accepts a clock input (`clk`) to drive synchronization, a reset (`reset`) to initialize the system, a 2-bit `volume_control` for adjusting output volume, a 16-bit `audio_output` for DAC data, and a 2-bit `channel_sel` for selecting audio channels. Audio data from an external ADC is received through the `AUD_ADCDAT` input. The module outputs include a 16-bit `audio_input` for processed audio data, `sample_end` indicating the end of a sample period, `sample_req` for requesting the next audio sample, and control signals (`AUD_ADCLRCK`, `AUD_DACLRCK`, `AUD_DACDAT`, `AUD_BCLK`) for clocks and data transmission synchronization. Internally, it uses registers like `lrck_divider` and `bclk_divider` to generate clock signals, `shift_out`, `shift_temp`, and `shift_in` for handling serial data. The code leverages these registers and additional logic to handle various states like resets, setting, clearing, and shifting data in synchronization with audio frames and channel settings. Overall, the module efficiently handles the complexities of digital audio processing and transmission through meticulous signal management and state control.",

It supports functionalities such as volume control, sample request generation, and managing input-output audio signals through various control signals. The ADC and DAC operations are synchronized using clock dividers (`lrck_divider` and `bclk_divider`). Signals for the left-right clock (LRCLK) and bit clock (BCLK) are generated within the module. Data is exchanged in the form of serial audio data with an audio device via control lines (`AUD_ADCLRCK`, `AUD_DACLRCK`, `AUD_BCLK`, and `AUD_DACDAT`). The module takes in audio output data, processes it according to the current volume settings, and outputs audio input data. Additionally, it handles the timing for sample exchange and manages which audio channel (left or right) is currently active for data transfer."
