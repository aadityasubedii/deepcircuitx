Module-level comment: The `audio_codec` module manages digital audio data transmission between a codec and a digital system through synchronized ADC and DAC operations. It handles inputs for clock, reset, volume control, and audio output, offering outputs including processed audio data, sample flags, and control signals. Internally, it utilizes counters (`lrck_divider` and `bclk_divider`) for clock generation and registers (`shift_out`, `shift_in`, `shift_temp`) for serial data handling, ensuring data is timed and transferred accurately for audio processing.
