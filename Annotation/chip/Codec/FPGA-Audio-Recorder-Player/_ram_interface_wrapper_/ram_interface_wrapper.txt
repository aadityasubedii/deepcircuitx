Module-level comment: The 'ram_interface_wrapper' Verilog module interfaces with RAM, managing data transactions based on `DATA_BYTE_WIDTH`. It inputs commands and data, controls read/write operations, and outputs status and data through port and internal signal manipulation. Conditional logic adjusts memory addressing and data processing, while the nested 'ram_interface' sub-module directly handles physical RAM interactions, ensuring efficient and aligned operational control.
