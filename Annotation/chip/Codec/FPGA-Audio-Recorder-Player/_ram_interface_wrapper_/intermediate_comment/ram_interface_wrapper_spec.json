    "spec": "Module name: ram_interface_wrapper. Module specification: The 'ram_interface_wrapper' is a Verilog module configured to manage data interfacing between a system and a RAM, specifically designed to handle read and write operations influenced by the parameter `DATA_BYTE_WIDTH`. It coordinates data flow operations using input ports: `address` (26-bit RAM access location), `data_in` (data width determined by `DATA_BIT_WIDTH`), `write_enable` and `read_request` (control signals for write and read operations), `read_ack` (acknowledgment for read operations), and system signals `reset`, `clk`, and `sys_clk` for maintaining operational timing. Additional bidirectional pins `hw_rzq_pin` and `hw_zio_pin` are used for impedance calibration. Output ports include `STATLED3` and `STATLED4` (status indicators), `max_ram_address` (maximum address based on data width), `rdy` and `rd_data_pres` (ready state and data presence indicators), `data_out` (output data equivalent in size to `data_in`), `clkout` (output clock signal), and a series of RAM interface signals (RAS, CAS, WE, etc.) for direct hardware connection. Internally, the module uses signals like `wr_data_in` (formatted data for writing), `ram_rd_bus` (buffer for read data), various counters for tracking read and write operations, and flags such as `c3_p0_cmd_empty` and `c3_p0_wr_full` to monitor command and data buffers in the RAM interfacing process. The Verilog code integrates a conditional generation block that adjusts data handling and addressing based on `DATA_BYTE_WIDTH` and a sub-module `ram_interface` configured for detailed RAM operations control, ensuring aligned and effective memory management and interfacing.",

It aggregates the `data_in` signal, adjusting formatting based on the `DATA_BYTE_WIDTH`.\n- ram_rd_bus: This bus holds data read from the RAM, serving as an intermediate storage before data is outputted via `data_out`.\n- write_mask: Determines which bits of data are allowed to be written to memory, used in partial data writes to prevent overwriting unintended data sections.\n- ram_cmd_byte_addr: Adjusted (aligned) RAM byte address used for command signaling, derived from the `address` input but formatted to fit the memory's addressing scheme.\n- c3_p0_wr_count, c3_p0_rd_count: Counters to manage and monitor the count of write and read operations pending in the RAM interface buffers.\n- c3_calib_done: Indicates completion of the RAM interface calibration. It is crucial for ensuring the system is ready and stable to start memory operations.\n- c3_p0_cmd_empty, c3_p0_cmd_full: Flags indicating the status of the command queue, whether it is empty or full, to control flow of commands to memory.\n- c3_p0_wr_full, c3_p0_wr_empty: Flags showing the status of the write data buffer, useful for managing data flow and handling buffer overruns or starvation.\n- c3_p0_wr_underrun, c3_p0_wr_error: Indicate errors during write operations, such as data underrun (not enough data) or other errors (e.g., timing or alignment issues).\n- c3_p0_rd_full, c3_p0_rd_empty: Indicate the status of the read data buffer, whether it is full or empty, which affects the reading operations and data availability.\n- c3_p0_rd_overflow, c3_p0_rd_error: Indicate errors during read operations, such as buffer overflow (more data than can be handled) or other errors in reading data alignments or timing.\n\nThese internal signals help in managing data flow, addressing, error handling, and buffer status within the RAM interface, ensuring smooth operations and responsiveness to system requirements and RAM characteristics."

Module specification: The 'ram_interface_wrapper' is a Verilog module configured to manage data interfacing between a system and a RAM, specifically designed to handle read and write operations influenced by the parameter `DATA_BYTE_WIDTH`. It coordinates data flow operations using input ports: `address` (26-bit RAM access location), `data_in` (data width determined by `DATA_BIT_WIDTH`), `write_enable` and `read_request` (control signals for write and read operations), `read_ack` (acknowledgment for read operations), and system signals `reset`, `clk`, and `sys_clk` for maintaining operational timing. Additional bidirectional pins `hw_rzq_pin` and `hw_zio_pin` are used for impedance calibration. Output ports include `STATLED3` and `STATLED4` (status indicators), `max_ram_address` (maximum address based on data width), `rdy` and `rd_data_pres` (ready state and data presence indicators), `data_out` (output data equivalent in size to `data_in`), `clkout` (output clock signal), and a series of RAM interface signals (RAS, CAS, WE, etc.) for direct hardware connection. Internally, the module uses signals like `wr_data_in` (formatted data for writing), `ram_rd_bus` (buffer for read data), various counters for tracking read and write operations, and flags such as `c3_p0_cmd_empty` and `c3_p0_wr_full` to monitor command and data buffers in the RAM interfacing process. The Verilog code integrates a conditional generation block that adjusts data handling and addressing based on `DATA_BYTE_WIDTH` and a sub-module `ram_interface` configured for detailed RAM operations control, ensuring aligned and effective memory management and interfacing."
