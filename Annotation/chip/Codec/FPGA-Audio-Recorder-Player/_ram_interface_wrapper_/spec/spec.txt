Module name: ram_interface_wrapper. Module specification: The 'ram_interface_wrapper' is a Verilog module configured to manage data interfacing between a system and a RAM, specifically designed to handle read and write operations influenced by the parameter `DATA_BYTE_WIDTH`. It coordinates data flow operations using input ports: `address` (26-bit RAM access location), `data_in` (data width determined by `DATA_BIT_WIDTH`), `write_enable` and `read_request` (control signals for write and read operations), `read_ack` (acknowledgment for read operations), and system signals `reset`, `clk`, and `sys_clk` for maintaining operational timing. Additional bidirectional pins `hw_rzq_pin` and `hw_zio_pin` are used for impedance calibration. Output ports include `STATLED3` and `STATLED4` (status indicators), `max_ram_address` (maximum address based on data width), `rdy` and `rd_data_pres` (ready state and data presence indicators), `data_out` (output data equivalent in size to `data_in`), `clkout` (output clock signal), and a series of RAM interface signals (RAS, CAS, WE, etc.) for direct hardware connection. Internally, the module uses signals like `wr_data_in` (formatted data for writing), `ram_rd_bus` (buffer for read data), various counters for tracking read and write operations, and flags such as `c3_p0_cmd_empty` and `c3_p0_wr_full` to monitor command and data buffers in the RAM interfacing process. The Verilog code integrates a conditional generation block that adjusts data handling and addressing based on `DATA_BYTE_WIDTH` and a sub-module `ram_interface` configured for detailed RAM operations control, ensuring aligned and effective memory management and interfacing.
