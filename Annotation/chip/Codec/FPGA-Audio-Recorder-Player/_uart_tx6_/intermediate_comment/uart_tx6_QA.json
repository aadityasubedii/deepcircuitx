The module handles data buffering, and includes control signals to write to the buffer, reset the buffer, and manage the baud rate generation for data transmission. Multiple logical units within the module (LUTs, flip-flops) are used to implement the serial data output logic, data buffer control, and baud rate division required for correct UART operation. The module provides output flags to indicate buffer states such as full, half-full, and data presence."

This data is serialized and sent out through the serial_out port.\n- buffer_write: A control signal used to write the input data into an internal buffer.\n- buffer_reset: A reset signal to clear the internal buffer and pointer, returning the module to its initial state.\n- en_16_x_baud: Enable signal for the baud rate generator. It controls the timing intervals at which bits are read from the buffer and output on the serial line.\n- clk: Clock signal that synchronizes all operations inside the module including data storage, serialization, and control logic.\n\nOutput ports:\n- serial_out\n- buffer_data_present\n- buffer_half_full\n- buffer_full\nExplanation:\n- serial_out: The serialized output data stream of the UART. It transmits the data received on the data_in port, one bit at a time, according to UART protocol.\n- buffer_data_present: A flag that indicates whether there is data present in the buffer. It can be used to check if there are data left in the buffer to be sent.\n- buffer_half_full: A flag that indicates when the internal buffer of the module has reached half of its capacity. This can be used to manage the flow of data into the buffer to prevent overflow.\n- buffer_full: A flag that shows whether the internal buffer is completely filled. It helps to prevent buffer overflow by indicating when no further data should be written into the buffer until there is space available."
