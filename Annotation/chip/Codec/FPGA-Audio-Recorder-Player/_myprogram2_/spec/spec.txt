Module name: myprogram2. Module specification: This module implements an instruction memory interface for a simple processor or microcontroller system. It takes a 12-bit address input and provides an 18-bit instruction output. The module uses four RAMB16BWER (Block RAM) components to store and retrieve instruction data, each handling a portion of the 18-bit instruction. The design includes address decoding logic using LUT6_2 (Look-Up Table) components to select the appropriate instruction bits based on the input address. Input ports include a 12-bit address, an enable signal, and a clock. The output is an 18-bit instruction. Internal signals manage the interface with the Block RAMs, including address lines, data lines, and control signals for both port A (used) and port B (unused). The module is divided into sections for address decoding, Block RAM instantiation, and instruction selection logic. The
