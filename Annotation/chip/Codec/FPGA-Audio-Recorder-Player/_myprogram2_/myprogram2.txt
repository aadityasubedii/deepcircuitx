Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements an instruction memory interface for a simple processor.
It uses four RAMB16BWER components to store 18-bit instructions, accessed via
a 12-bit address input. LUT6_2 components decode the address and select the
appropriate instruction bits. The module provides synchronous operation with
a clock input and an enable signal, outputting the fetched 18-bit instruction.
