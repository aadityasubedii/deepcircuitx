    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'i2c_controller' orchestrates I2C communication by managing the I2C clock (`i2c_sclk`) and data line (`i2c_sdat`). It uses inputs like `clk`, `start`, and `i2c_data` to control data transmission, with outputs `done` and `ack` signaling transaction status. Internally, it operates through staged data processing and clock division, handled by registers and conditional logic within a main clock-driven process block, ensuring seamless byte-wise data handling and synchronization with the I2C protocol requirements."
