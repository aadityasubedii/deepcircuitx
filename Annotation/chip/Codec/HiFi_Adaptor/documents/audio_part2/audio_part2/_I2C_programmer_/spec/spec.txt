Module name: I2C_programmer. Module specification: The I2C_programmer is a Verilog module designed for managing I2C communication, particularly for transmitting data on the I2C bus. It accepts two input ports: `RESET`, which is a synchronous reset that clears all internal states and counters for a new sequence, and `i2c_clk`, the primary clock signal for controlling the operation timing. The outputs include `I2C_SCLK`, which is the serial clock line for I2C, `TRN_END` indicating the end of transmission, `ACK` signifying the collective acknowledgment from slave devices, `ACK_enable` controlling the bidirectional data line state, and `I2C_SDATA` serving as the bidirectional serial data line. Internally, the module uses several signals: `mi2c_clk_div` for clock division, `SD` for holding and shifting data, `SD_COUNTER` for controlling transmission sequences, and `mi2c_ctrl_clk` for operational timing. The code is structured into blocks handling clock management (`mi2c_clk_div` and `mi2c_ctrl_clk` toggling), data transmission cycle (`SD_COUNTER` and `SD` handling), and bit-wise data and clock line control within a large case statement triggered by the `CLOCK` signal. Each of these components contributes to precise control and management of serialized data transmission as per I2C protocol communication standards.
