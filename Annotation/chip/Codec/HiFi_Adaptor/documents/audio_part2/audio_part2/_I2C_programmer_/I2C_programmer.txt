Module-level comment: The I2C_programmer module facilitates I2C data transmission. Operating with a clock-divided mechanism (`mi2c_clk_div`), it controls data flow through a 24-bit shift register (`SD`) based on a sequence counter (`SD_COUNTER`). The module efficiently initiates and terminates I2C transmission cycles (handled by `TRN_END` and `ACK`), ensuring synchronized communication on the I2C bus using internal and external clock signals. Key control states and data transitions are driven by a detailed case statement, aligning with I2C protocol requirements.
