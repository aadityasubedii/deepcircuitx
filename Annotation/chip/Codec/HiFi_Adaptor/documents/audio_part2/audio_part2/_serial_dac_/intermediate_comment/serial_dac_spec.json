    "spec": "Module name: serial_dac. Module specification: The `serial_dac` module is designed to serialize stereo digital audio input from two 33-bit input ports, SDACL for the left audio channel and SDACR for the right audio channel, based on a clock signal (`clk`) and an enable signal (`enable`). The module determines serialization priority between the channels using a left-right select signal (`dac_lr`). When `enable` is high, the module serializes data from the selected channel from most significant to least significant bit; if `enable` is low, serialization halts and counters reset. Serialization is managed by dynamic counters, `SDACL_counter` and `SDACR_counter`, for each channel respectively. The serialized output is passed through `serial_dac`, which alternates between the two channels based on `dac_lr`. Internally, the module uses two important signals, `serial_1` and `serial_2`, to hold the bit values of SDACL and SDACR being outputted. The code involves multiple blocks for handling the reset conditions of counters, incrementing the appropriate counters on clock edges, and assigning serialized bits based on the current counter values. The module ensures that each bit of the audio data is processed correctly in response to timing and control signals, making it suitable for applications that require precise timing and order of audio data handling.",

It increments as each bit is processed when the `dac_lr` signal is high and the module is enabled. It resets to 0 whenever `enable` is low or when `dac_lr` changes state.\n- SDACR_counter: Similar to SDACL_counter, this 8-bit register keeps track of the serialization of bits from the right audio channel (SDACR). It functions by incrementing under the control of the clock when `dac_lr` signal is low and the module is enabled, and resets when `enable` is low or `dac_lr` changes state, favoring the left channel.\n- serial_1: This signal holds the bit of the left channel data (SDACL) that is currently being output. It is assigned based on the current count of the SDACL_counter, fetching the respective bit of SDACL.\n- serial_2: Similarly, this signal holds the bit of the right channel data (SDACR) being output. It is determined by the value of SDACR_counter, extracting the corresponding bit from SDACR. This data is output as `serial_dac` when the right channel is selected by `dac_lr`."

                    "text": "Module name: serial_dac. Module specification: The `serial_dac` module is designed to serialize stereo digital audio input from two 33-bit input ports, SDACL for the left audio channel and SDACR for the right audio channel, based on a clock signal (`clk`) and an enable signal (`enable`). The module determines serialization priority between the channels using a left-right select signal (`dac_lr`). When `enable` is high, the module serializes data from the selected channel from most significant to least significant bit; if `enable` is low, serialization halts and counters reset. Serialization is managed by dynamic counters, `SDACL_counter` and `SDACR_counter`, for each channel respectively. The serialized output is passed through `serial_dac`, which alternates between the two channels based on `dac_lr`. Internally, the module uses two important signals, `serial_1` and `serial_2`, to hold the bit values of SDACL and SDACR being outputted. The code involves multiple blocks for handling the reset conditions of counters, incrementing the appropriate counters on clock edges, and assigning serialized bits based on the current counter values. The module ensures that each bit of the audio data is processed correctly in response to timing and control signals, making it suitable for applications that require precise timing and order of audio data handling."
