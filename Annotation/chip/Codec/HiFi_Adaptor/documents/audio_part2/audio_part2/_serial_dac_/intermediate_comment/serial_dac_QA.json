When `enable` is active, it processes the input audio data, outputting it serially as `serial_dac`. If `dac_lr` is high, it prioritizes serialization of the left channel, and if low, the right channel. Each channel's data is processed sequentially from their most significant to least significant bit, controlled by respective counters `SDACL_counter` and `SDACR_counter`, which are reset based on the `enable` signal's state and the `dac_lr` status. This module suits applications in digital-to-analog conversion for audio outputs where data needs to be presented serially to an external DAC device."

It increments as each bit is processed when the `dac_lr` signal is high and the module is enabled. It resets to 0 whenever `enable` is low or when `dac_lr` changes state.\n- SDACR_counter: Similar to SDACL_counter, this 8-bit register keeps track of the serialization of bits from the right audio channel (SDACR). It functions by incrementing under the control of the clock when `dac_lr` signal is low and the module is enabled, and resets when `enable` is low or `dac_lr` changes state, favoring the left channel.\n- serial_1: This signal holds the bit of the left channel data (SDACL) that is currently being output. It is assigned based on the current count of the SDACL_counter, fetching the respective bit of SDACL.\n- serial_2: Similarly, this signal holds the bit of the right channel data (SDACR) being output.
