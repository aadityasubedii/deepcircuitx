Module name: serial_dac. Module specification: The `serial_dac` module is designed to serialize stereo digital audio input from two 33-bit input ports, SDACL for the left audio channel and SDACR for the right audio channel, based on a clock signal (`clk`) and an enable signal (`enable`). The module determines serialization priority between the channels using a left-right select signal (`dac_lr`). When `enable` is high, the module serializes data from the selected channel from most significant to least significant bit; if `enable` is low, serialization halts and counters reset. Serialization is managed by dynamic counters, `SDACL_counter` and `SDACR_counter`, for each channel respectively. The serialized output is passed through `serial_dac`, which alternates between the two channels based on `dac_lr`. Internally, the module uses two important signals, `serial_1` and `serial_2`, to hold the bit values of SDACL and SDACR being outputted. The code involves multiple blocks for handling the reset conditions of counters, incrementing the appropriate counters on clock edges, and assigning serialized bits based on the current counter values. The module ensures that each bit of the audio data is processed correctly in response to timing and control signals, making it suitable for applications that require precise timing and order of audio data handling.
