Module-level comment: The `serial_dac` module serializes stereo audio data inputs (SDACL for left and SDACR for right) based on clock (`clk`) and enable signals. It prioritizes serialization order via a select signal (`dac_lr`). Using internal counters (`SDACL_counter` and `SDACR_counter`), the module sequentially processes each bit of the audio data from MSB to LSB, outputting through `serial_dac`. Resets occur on `enable` low, ensuring data integrity during disabled states. The implementation hinges on controlled counter increments and bit assignments on selected clock edges.
