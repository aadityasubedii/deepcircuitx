It uses a lookup table (LUT) to hold configuration data and sends this data out in sequence over the I2C interface. The module operates by cycling through each configuration setting stored in the LUT index-wise. Various operational steps, controlled through the 'mstep' state machine, manage the sending process ensuring each configuration data is acknowledged by the receiving device before proceeding. The module handles I2C transactions, checks for acknowledgements ('mack'), and progresses through sending operations dictated by clock signals and reset conditions."
