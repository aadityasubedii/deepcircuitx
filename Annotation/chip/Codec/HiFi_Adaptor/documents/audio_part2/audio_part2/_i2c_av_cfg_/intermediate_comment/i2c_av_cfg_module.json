    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'i2c_av_cfg' module configures I2C interface settings for audio/video hardware. It employs a lookup table to store configuration data, sequentially transmitting it over I2C. Using a state machine, it manages data sending and acknowledgment, enabling transmissions based on internal conditions and external signals like 'clk', 'SCLK', and 'mack'. The state transitions facilitate data loading, checking acknowledgments, and indexing through the LUT. Outputs include the current state, initiation signal, and formatted I2C data."
