Module name: i2c_av_cfg. Module specification: The 'i2c_av_cfg' module is designed to manage the configuration of an I2C interface specifically for adjusting audio/video settings. It integrates a lookup table (LUT) for storing configuration data and sequences through these settings, transmitting them over the I2C bus. The inputs to the module include 'clk' (the main clock signal driving the state machine), 'reset' (initializes the module's internal states), 'SCLK' (the I2C serial clock line), 'mend' (signal indicating the end of a message transmission), and 'mack' (acknowledgment from the I2C slave). The outputs are 'mstep' (a 4-bit state machine indicator), 'mgo' (a signal to start transmission), and 'i2c_data' (a 24-bit data for I2C transmission). Internally, the module utilizes registers such as 'LUT_data' (16-bit register holding LUT configuration settings), 'LUT_index' (6-bit index for the LUT), and 'mstep' (4-bit state representation). The main operation involves a state machine transitioning through steps for sending data, awaiting acknowledgment, and progressing through the LUT. The module also defines the LUT content corresponding to various configuration settings such as line and headphone levels, audio path controls, and system power settings, upon which operations are dictated dynamically by the state machine depending on external input signals and internal conditions.
