    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'audio' module handles digital audio processing by coordinating I2C, ADC, and DAC operations. It manages audio signals through specified input and output ports, using internal clock control (`ctrl_clk`) and dividers (`clk_div`) for synchronization. Key submodules include an I2C programmer (`u1`), a serial ADC (`u2`), and a serial DAC (`u3`), orchestrating conversions and data transmissions within the system efficiently."
