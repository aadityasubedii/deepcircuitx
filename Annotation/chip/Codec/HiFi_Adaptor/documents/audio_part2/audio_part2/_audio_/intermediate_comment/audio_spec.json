    "spec": "Module name: audio. \nModule specification: The 'audio' module coordinates the processing of digital audio data in and out of a system by integrating I2C programming, serial ADC, and DAC functionalities. It manages input ports such as 'adcdat' for receiving digital audio data from an ADC, 'swt' as a reset or enable signal, 'clk' as the main clock, 'bclk', 'adclrck', and 'daclrck' for controlling the rate at which audio data is read from the ADC or sent to the DAC, and 'sdat' for I2C communications. Its outputs include an audio-specific clock 'aud_xclk', a serial clock 'sclk' for I2C communication, 'dacdat' outputting digital audio to a DAC, and an 8-bit wide 'gpio' for status and control signals. Internal signals such as 'serial_lf' and 'serial_rt' handle left and right audio data streams respectively, 'ctrl_clk' is a control clock toggled based on the main clock and I2C frequency, and 'clk_div' is a register functioning as a clock divider. The module also uses 'ACK', 'ACK_enable', and 'TRN_END' for acknowledgment and transmission control in I2C protocols, and 'data_23', a 24-bit internal signal likely for buffering. Key code sections include instances of an I2C programmer 'u1', a serial ADC 'u2', and a serial DAC 'u3', each configured with specific tasks for handling various facets of audio data transmission and reception. The 'always' block manages the clock divider and toggles 'ctrl_clk', which is then mapped to 'aud_xclk' and 'gpio[0]'.
