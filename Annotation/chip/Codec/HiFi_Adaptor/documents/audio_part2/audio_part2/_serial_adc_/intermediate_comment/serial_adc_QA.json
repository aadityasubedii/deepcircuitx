The design uses separate counters (SADCL_counter and SADCR_counter) to manage the position of incoming serial bits for each channel. On the falling edge of the 'enable' signal or the rising edge of the 'clk' (clock), the counters are reset to zero if the enable is inactive or adc_lr signal denotes channel selection. If 'enable' is active and in the presence of clock edges, the counters increment and direct the serial_adc input bit stream into appropriate bit positions of SADCL or SADCR registers, building a 33-bit parallel output for each channel. Thus, the module essentially captures 33 serial bits for each audio channel into parallel outputs, reset by disable condition or specific edge-triggered conditions. This functionality is critical for applications needing conversion from serial to parallel data format in real-time audio processing or similar digital signal processing tasks."

It streams the audio bits which are then stored into the parallel registers SADCL or SADCR based on the current channel selection.\n- **clk**: Clock signal that is used to time the sampling and shifting operations within the module. It primarily triggers the counters and data capture on the rising edge.\n- **enable**: Enable signal controls whether the ADC is active. If low (`0`), it resets the counters, effectively disabling data capture and resets the outputs.\n- **adc_lr**: This input determines which channel (left or right) is currently receiving the serial input bits. If high (`1`), data goes to the left channel (SADCL); if low (`0`), to the right channel (SADCR).\n\nOutput ports: SADCL, SADCR.\nExplanation:\n- **SADCL**: 33-bit register output for the Left audio channel. It stores the converted parallel digital data from serial input for the left channel.\n- **SADCR**: 33-bit register output for the Right audio channel. It holds the converted parallel digital data from serial input for the right channel.\nEach output accumulates serial input data based on the state of the adc_lr signal and is reset when enable is low."

It increments with each clock cycle when the module is enabled and the adc_lr signal is high (indicating left channel data capture). It is responsible for positioning each incoming serial bit into the correct bit location in the SADCL output register. SADCL_counter is reset to 0 either when the module is disabled (enable is low) or when it switches to process the other channel's data.\n\n- **SADCR_counter**: Similar to SADCL_counter, this is an 8-bit register but it serves the right audio channel. It tracks where the next incoming bit will be placed in the SADCR register. It increments only when the module is enabled and adc_lr signal is low (right channel data capture). Each increment of SADCR_counter corresponds to a new bit being received from the serial_adc that will be stored at the corresponding bit position in SADCR. It also resets to 0 under the same conditions as SADCL_counter, applicable for the right channel."
