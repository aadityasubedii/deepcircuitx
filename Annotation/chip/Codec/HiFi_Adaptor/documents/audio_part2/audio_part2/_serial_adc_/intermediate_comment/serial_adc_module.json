    "module": "Module-level comment: The `serial_adc` module converts serialized ADC input into 33-bit parallel outputs for left (SADCL) and right (SADCR) audio channels. It employs `clk` and `enable` signals for timing and control, using `adc_lr` for channel selection. Two 8-bit counters manage bit positioning during active phases, with reset conditions handled on negative edges of `enable` or `clk`. This design ensures accurate, real-time data capture suitable for digital audio processing."
