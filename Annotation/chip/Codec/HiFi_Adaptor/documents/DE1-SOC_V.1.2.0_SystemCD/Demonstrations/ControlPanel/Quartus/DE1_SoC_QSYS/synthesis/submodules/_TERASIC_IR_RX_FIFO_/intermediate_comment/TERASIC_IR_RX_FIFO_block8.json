    "block_comment": "This block handles the signal synchronization for 'pre_data_ready' based on the system's reset and clock signals. At the negative edge of 'reset_n', it resets 'pre_data_ready' to 0, ensuring it's clear during a system reset. On every positive clock edge, it updates 'pre_data_ready' to the current state of 'data_ready', thereby maintaining alignment with data availability."
