Module name: hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc.
Module specification: The `hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc` module is designed for clock management in an SDRAM system on an HPS platform, coordinating multiple clock signals with varying degrees of complexity. It accepts four input ports: `pll_hr_clk`, a high resolution PLL clock; `pll_dq_clk`, a data queue PLL clock; `pll_dqs_clk`, a data strobe PLL clock; and `dll_phy_delayctrl`, a signal providing delay control from a DLL. These inputs are used to manage various internally generated clock signals like `phy_clk_hr`, `phy_clk_dq`, and `phy_clk_dqs`, as well as to provide output clocks `afi_clk`, `avl_clk`, `adc_clk`, `adc_clk_cps`, and `hr_clk` essential for SDRAM operations. Internally, the module leverages a conditional structure controlled by the parameter `IS_HHP_HPS` to switch between direct signal assignment and using a clock buffer (`cyclonev_phy_clkbuf`) to derive the necessary internal clocks. Clocks are further manipulated through components like `cyclonev_leveling_delay_chain` for delay adjustments and `cyclonev_clk_phase_select` for phase selection, impacting how outputs such as `afi_clk` and `hr_clk` are generated. Conditional logic also handles inversion settings for `adc_clk` based on the `ADC_INVERT_PHASE` parameter setting. Each segment of the module is purposefully structured to optimize the clocking requirements specific to the operational demands of the embedded SDRAM system within the HPS platform.
