The block of code is a conditional routing block. If the condition specified by the `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME` parameter is met, the input data (`data_in`) is directly mapped to the output data (`data_out`). If this condition is not satisfied, no assignments are made in the scope of this block, and additional assignment will likely take place in an else-if or else branch (not provided in the snippet).
