Module name: alt_vipvfr130_common_avalon_mm_slave.
Module specification: This module is a Verilog implementation designed to act as an Avalon Memory-Mapped (MM) slave interface for managing read/write operations in an FPGA environment. It reacts dynamically to addresses and commands received over the Avalon bus interface. The input ports include a reset (`rst`), clock signal (`clk`), Avalon address bus (`av_address`), read (`av_read`), and write (`av_write`) control signals, write data bus (`av_writedata`), clear enable (`clear_enable`), data for internal registers (`registers_in`), internal register write control (`registers_write`), interrupt signals array (`interrupts`), and stopped condition indicators (`stopped`). The output ports consist of the read data bus (`av_readdata`), interrupt request signal (`av_irq`), module enable signal (`enable`), registers' triggers (`triggers`), and the data from internal registers (`registers`). Internal signals such as `global_stopped`, `clear_interrupts`, `triggers_nxt`, `internal_registers`, `interrupt_register`, and `interrupt_enables` are used to handle global states, manage interrupt flags, prepare register updates, store internal data, handle interrupts statuses, and control activated interrupts respectively. The code comprises several blocks: initialization and default settings upon reset or when clear conditions are met, Avalon write operations handling specific to address manipulations for module configurations, Avalon read operations that output specific internal states depending on the addressed queried, and dynamic register and trigger management based on both external commands via Avalon and internal conditions. This organized structure allows the module to efficiently manage hardware control tasks, parameter configuration, and interrupt handling in a modular FPGA design.
