Module name: ir_fifo. Module specification: The `ir_fifo` module is designed to implement a First In, First Out (FIFO) buffer functionality, mainly used to manage data buffering between different clock domains or varying data rates that require synchronization. The input ports include `aclr`, a signal for asynchronous resets of the FIFO; a 32-bit `data` input used to write data into the FIFO; `rdclk` and `wrclk`, the read and write clock inputs to control data flow timing; and `rdreq` and `wrreq`, which are signals to request read from and write to the FIFO respectively. The output ports consist of a 32-bit `q` for the FIFO's data output; `rdempty` to indicate if the FIFO is empty; a 5-bit `rdusedw` displaying the count of used words in the FIFO; and `wrfull`, which shows if the FIFO is full. Internal signals were not detailed in the snippet provided, suggesting that core functional blocks and internal state management are not visible in this excerpt. Critical sections such as logic implementation for FIFO operation and specific configurations for synthesis optimizations, hinted by placeholders for `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS`, are not included in the visible code. This specification covers the interface and proposed functionality of the `ir_fifo` module based on the given code snippet and associated descriptions.
