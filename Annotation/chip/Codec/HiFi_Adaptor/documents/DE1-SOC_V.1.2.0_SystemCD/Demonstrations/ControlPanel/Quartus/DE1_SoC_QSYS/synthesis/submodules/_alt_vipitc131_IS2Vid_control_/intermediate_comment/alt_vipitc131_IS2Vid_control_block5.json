    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code defines a constant signal for a write trigger mechanism. The signal named `write_trigger` is assigned a binary value of 0, indicating that the write trigger is inactive by default. This assignment ensures that the write functionality is disabled unless explicitly activated elsewhere in the code."
