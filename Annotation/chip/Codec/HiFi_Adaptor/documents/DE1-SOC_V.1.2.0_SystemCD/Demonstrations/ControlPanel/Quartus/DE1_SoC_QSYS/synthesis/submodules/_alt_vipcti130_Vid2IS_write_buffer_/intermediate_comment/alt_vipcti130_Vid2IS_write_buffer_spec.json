This module inputs video data through 'data_in' and processes it based on various control signals ('convert', 'hd_sdn', 'early_eop'). The module operates synchronously with a system clock ('clk') and initializes or clears its state with a reset signal ('rst'). It outputs buffered data through 'data_out' and manages packet indicators via 'packet_out'. Key inputs include 'rst', 'clk', 'convert', 'hd_sdn', 'early_eop', 'wrreq_in', 'data_in', and 'packet_in'. The outputs are 'wrreq_out', 'data_out', and 'packet_out'. Internally, the module uses 'write_buffer_data' to store video data temporarily, 'write_buffer_valid' to flag data validity, and 'write_buffer_packet' to manage packet status. The code includes generated blocks to handle data storage for each color plane, responding to changes in input signals and maintaining synchronization between input and output operations through careful state management. This setup ensures that the data is properly processed, stored, and transmitted in line with the control and timing demands of high-definition video systems.",

It supports configurable data widths and a number of color planes. The module processes incoming video data (`data_in`) and control signals (`convert`, `hd_sdn`, `early_eop`) to manage how data is written to an internal buffer (`write_buffer_data`). The buffer stores the data conditionally based on control signals, and outputs it through `data_out` when conditions are met (all valid buffer states or `early_eop`). It also manages packet indicators through `packet_out` based on similar conditions, optimizing transmission or processing paths in video systems. The handling of reset (`rst`), clock (`clk`), and write requests (`wrreq_in/out`) are integral to its operation in synchronization with system requirements. The internal logic implements condition-based data buffering, validity flagging, and packet control, adapting to changes in incoming signals and system states dynamically."

Serves as the timing signal for the module operations, ensuring synchronous data processing.\n- convert: Control signal for conversion mode, influencing the handling and timing of data buffering.\n- hd_sdn: High definition shutdown signal. Adjusts the handling of data based on the operational mode (standard definition or high definition).\n- early_eop: Early end of packet signal. Indicates that the current cycle is prematurely ending a packet, affecting output readiness and signal generation.\n- wrreq_in: Write request input. Signals when there is valid data on the `data_in` line that needs to be processed or buffered.\n- data_in: Incoming data to be buffered. This is the video data input that is subject to buffering based on the given control signals.\n- packet_in: Indicates whether the `data_in` belongs to a packet, affecting packet buffering logic and output control.\n\nOutput ports: wrreq_out, data_out, packet_out.\nExplanation:\n- wrreq_out: Write request output.
