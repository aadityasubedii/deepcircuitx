    "module": "Module-level comment: The AUDIO_IF module manages data flow between audio hardware components, DAC and ADC, via FIFOs. It synchronizes operations using an input clock and handles module resets, data reads and writes based on address mappings. It interfaces with external clocks and DAC/ADC data lines, ensures FIFO status management, and regulates DAC/ADC operations through dedicated internal controls and flags. Key operations are implemented in structured always blocks, managing data integrity and flow efficiently."
