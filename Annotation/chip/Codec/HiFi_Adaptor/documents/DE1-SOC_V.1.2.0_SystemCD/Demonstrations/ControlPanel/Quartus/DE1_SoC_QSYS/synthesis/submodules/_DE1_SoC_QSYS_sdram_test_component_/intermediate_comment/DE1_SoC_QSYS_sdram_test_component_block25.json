    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value of signal `zs_cke` to `cke`, effectively controlling the clock enable of memory operations. The direct assignment ensures that the clock enable signal `cke` mirrors the state of `zs_cke`, thus maintaining synchronization with any changes in `zs_cke`. This simple wiring is critical for the proper timing and operation of clock-dependent memory components in the design."
