    "block_comment": "This block manages the interrupt request (IRQ) signal based on data readiness and specific write operations. On a negative edge of `reset_n` or when not reset, the IRQ is cleared. If data transitions from not ready to ready (`pre_data_ready` to `data_ready`), the IRQ is set. It further allows manual control through a system write operation to a specific register (`IR_RX_CS_REG`); the IRQ is toggled based on the second bit of the write data (`s_writedata[1]`)."
