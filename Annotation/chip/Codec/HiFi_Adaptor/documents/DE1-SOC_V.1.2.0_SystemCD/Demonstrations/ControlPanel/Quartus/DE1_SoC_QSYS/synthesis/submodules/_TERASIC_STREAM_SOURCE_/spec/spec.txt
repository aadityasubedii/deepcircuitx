Module name: TERASIC_STREAM_SOURCE. 
Module specification: The TERASIC_STREAM_SOURCE is a Verilog module crafted to generate video data streams based on selectable patterns. It accommodates dynamic pattern switching through input signals. The primary input ports include 'clk' (clock signal for triggering operations), 'reset_n' (active-low reset for initializing states), 's_cs' (chip select for activation), 's_read' and 's_write' (for reading and writing module data), 's_writedata' (data for configuring module operations), 'src_ready' (indicating readiness for new data acceptance), and 'user_mode' (for pattern configuration). The outputs are 's_readdata' (module's internal state data), 'src_valid' (validity of output data), 'src_data' (pixel data), 'src_sop' (start of data packet), and 'src_eop' (end of data packet). Key internal signals include 'stream_active' indicating active video streaming, 'pat_id' for the current pattern identification, pixel counters 'x' and 'y', and 'disp_pat' determining the output pattern. It features critical operational blocks handling data generation based on these internal signals facilitated by conditional checking and pattern rendering dictated by the pattern ID or user mode. This module is instrumental for applications requiring controlled, pattern-based video stream generation such as in video testing or display technologies.
