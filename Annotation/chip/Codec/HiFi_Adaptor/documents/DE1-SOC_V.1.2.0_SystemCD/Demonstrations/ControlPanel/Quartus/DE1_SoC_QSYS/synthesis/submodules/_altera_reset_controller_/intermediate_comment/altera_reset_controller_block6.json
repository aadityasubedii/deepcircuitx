    "block_comment": "This block initializes a reset synchronizer chain. At the start, it sets the `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain` register to all high bits, with the number of bits set by `RSTREQ_ASRT_SYNC_TAP`. This ensures that the reset signal is consistently held across multiple clock cycles during the initial power-up or any subsequent resets."
