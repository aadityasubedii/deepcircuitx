Module-level comment: The alt_vipcti130_common_sample_counter is a Verilog module for counting samples in video processing systems, handling different scenarios based on the number of color planes. It supports conditions for single and multi-color planes through conditional generate blocks and manages counting logic tied to color planes, clock signals, and optional HD shutdown. The module adapts dynamically to different configurations indicated by parameters, leveraging internal counters and comparator logic to produce outputs like sample count, the start of samples, and the number of cycles per sample.
