    "block_comment": "This block defines a zero-initialized constant vector named `is_data`. The implementation simply creates a vector of width `DATA_WIDTH`, with each bit set to `0`. This can be used when initializing signals or comparing with other data vectors of the same width for equality to zero within the circuit design."
