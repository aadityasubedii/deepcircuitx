Module name: alt_vipitc131_common_to_binary.
Module specification: The alt_vipitc131_common_to_binary is a Verilog module designed to convert a one-hot encoded input to a binary encoded output. It utilizes two primary inputs and outputs: the input port 'one_hot', which receives a one-hot encoded signal where only one bit is high representing a specific mode among a set number defined by `NO_OF_MODES`; and the output port 'binary', which delivers the position of the high bit in the 'one_hot' input as a binary number, sized according to `LOG2_NO_OF_MODES`. Internally, the module employs two main signals: `binary_values`, a wide wire array that temporarily holds binary values corresponding to each potential high bit position in 'one_hot', and `binary_values_by_bit`, which rearranges these preliminary binary values for final output assembly. The module's code is structured into two nested generate loops: the outer loop iterates over possible binary positions, and the inner loops handle the one-hot positions, facilitating the mapping from one-hot representation to binary representation by setting up the necessary combinational logic for this translation. This structural organization ensures efficient computation and result synthesis, leveraging the bitwise OR operation to finalize the binary output.
