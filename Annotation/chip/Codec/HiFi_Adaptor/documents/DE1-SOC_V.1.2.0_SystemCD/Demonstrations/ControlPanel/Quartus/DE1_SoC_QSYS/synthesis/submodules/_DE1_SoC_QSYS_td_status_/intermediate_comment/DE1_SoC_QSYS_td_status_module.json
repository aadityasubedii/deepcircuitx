    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_td_status module processes a 2-bit input `in_port` based on the `address` to output a zero-extended 32-bit `readdata`. It features a synchronous reset and always-on clock enable signal. Address-based gating in `read_mux_out` and an always block controls the updating of `readdata` based on `address`, `clk`, and `reset_n`, ensuring responsive data forwarding and output control."
