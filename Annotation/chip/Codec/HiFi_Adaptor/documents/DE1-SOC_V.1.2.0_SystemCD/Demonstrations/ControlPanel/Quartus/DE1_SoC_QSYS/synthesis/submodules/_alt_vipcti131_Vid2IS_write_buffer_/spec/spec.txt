**Module name:** alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_write_buffer.

**Module specification:** The alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_write_buffer is a Verilog module designed to act as a video data buffering system, optimized for handling multiple color planes. The module operates under synchronization with a clock signal (`clk`) and can be reset through a reset signal (`rst`). The key functionalities revolve around managing data conversion (`convert`), handling high-definition mode (`hd_sdn`), and processing early termination signals (`early_eop`). Input ports include `wrreq_in` (write request), `data_in` (incoming video data), and `packet_in` (indicating packet association of the data) while the output ports comprise `wrreq_out` (write request output), `data_out` (processed data output), and `packet_out` (packet status after processing). Internally, the module utilizes `write_buffer_data` (data storage per color plane), `write_buffer_valid` (validity of the buffered data), and `write_buffer_packet` (packet status storage), which are managed based on configured parameters such as data width (`DATA_WIDTH`), number of color planes (`NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES`), and bits per sample (`BPS`). Different sections of the code handle reset conditions, data buffer operations during active clock edges, and conditional buffering based on mode and conversion requirements. The data and packet handling blocks ensure correct output signaling and data integrity across standard and HD video streams, making it a tailored solution for intricate video data management in diverse operational settings.
