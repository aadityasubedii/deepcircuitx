Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_oci_test_bench is a Verilog module designed primarily to serve as a test bench for CPU or On-Chip Interconnect (OCI) components within the DE1-SoC system framework. It is equipped with four input ports: `dct_buffer` [29:0], which is a 30-bit wide data stream used potentially for buffering data during tests; `dct_count` [3:0], a 4-bit counter that possibly indexes through data or iterations in tests; `test_ending`, a boolean signal indicating the imminent end of a test; and `test_has_ended`, a boolean signal confirming the completion of a test. The module does not define any output ports or internal signals, indicating that it primarily processes incoming test data without generating or storing intermediary data. Additionally, the code lacks distinct internal blocks or signal processing mechanisms, suggesting it functions as an interface or a framework for testing, with actual test logic implemented elsewhere.",
