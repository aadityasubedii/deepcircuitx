Comment: 
The block assigns the internal video clock signal. It directly maps the input signal 'is_clk' to 'vid_clk_int,' indicating that 'vid_clk_int' should replicate the 'is_clk' signal's state, effectively serving as a clock forwarding or renaming mechanism without any additional logic or conditioning.
