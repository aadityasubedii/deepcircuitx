    "module": "Module-level comment: The alt_vipitc131_IS2Vid_control module manages video signal operations with adaptive configurations for various operational modes and synchronization features. It leverages input signals (e.g., reset, clock, write acknowledgments) and outputs controls (e.g., enable signals, status updates). Internally, it uses registers and logical blocks for state management, signal processing, and conditional execution based on parametric controls, facilitating flexible video system functionalities."
