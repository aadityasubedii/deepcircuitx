    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_wrapper facilitates CPU debugging for the DE1-SoC system by managing JTAG interfaces and signal operations. It integrates numerous input and output ports for monitoring, trace controls, and handling breakpoints. Internally, it uses specialized signals (e.g., vji_cdr, vji_sdr) for specific JTAG operations within sub-modules that dictate data capturing, shifting, and instruction updates, ensuring synchronized debug and trace functionality across multiple CPU states and operations."
