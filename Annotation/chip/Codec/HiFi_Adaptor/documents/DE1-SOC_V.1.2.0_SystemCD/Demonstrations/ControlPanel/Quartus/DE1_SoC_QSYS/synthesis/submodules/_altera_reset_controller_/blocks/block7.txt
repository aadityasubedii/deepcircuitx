This block assigns values to signals for reset control. It sets `reset_out` to the value of `reset_out_pre2` and `reset_req` to `reset_req_pre`, indicating that this block is used to update the reset signals based on predefined conditions or previous states. These assignments occur on any change of the input signals, ensuring the reset logic remains current.
