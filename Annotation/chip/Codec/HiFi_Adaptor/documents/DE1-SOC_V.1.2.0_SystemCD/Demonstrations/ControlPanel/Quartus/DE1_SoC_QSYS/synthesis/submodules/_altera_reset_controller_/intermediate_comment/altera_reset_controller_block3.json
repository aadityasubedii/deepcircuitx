    "block_comment": "This Verilog code defines a reset synchronization chain. It detects and stabilizes a reset signal using a shift register technique to mitigate metastability. On the positive edge of the clock, if the last bit of the internal reset chain (`altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain`) is high, all bits in the synchronizer register (`r_sync_rst_chain`) are set high. Otherwise, the register shifts right by one bit, effectively delaying and desynchronizing the reset assertion across multiple clock cycles, thereby reducing the risk of metastability in downstream logic components."
