Module-level comment: The TERASIC_IRM module interfaces with an IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic device for IR data communications. It processes IR signals, setting an interrupt (`irq`) on data readiness and resetting it during specific write operations. The module operates with input control signals for read/write actions and manages interrupt logic via internal state tracking signals (`data_ready`, `pre_data_ready`). This ensures timely and reliable data handling between the IR receiver and the system master.
