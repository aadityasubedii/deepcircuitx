In the case of a write operation, data is driven from the system to the SRAM (`s_writedata` is assigned to `SRAM_DQ` if `SRAM_WE_n` is low). During a read operation, data is driven from the SRAM to the system (data from SRAM is assigned to `s_readdata`).\n- **s_readdata**: This signal is used to hold and output the data read from the SRAM back to the system. It is directly connected to the SRAM_DQ, thus it carries the data retrieved from the SRAM during read operations.\n- **SRAM_ADDR**: This signal carries the address from the system (`s_address`) to the SRAM. It directly maps the system address space to the SRAM address space.\n- **SRAM_WE_n**: Write enable signal, active low, used to control write operations to the SRAM. It passes the active low write signal (`s_write_n`) from the system to the SRAM.\n- **SRAM_OE_n**: Output enable signal, active low, used to control the output drivers of the SRAM during read operations. It passes the active low read signal (`s_read_n`) from the system to the SRAM.\n- **SRAM_CE_n**: Chip enable signal, active low, used to activate or deactivate the SRAM. It is controlled by the system\u2019s chip select signal (`s_chipselect_n`).\n- **SRAM_UB_n, SRAM_LB_n**: Upper byte and lower byte enable signals, both active low. These are used to enable access to specific byte lanes of the SRAM during data transfers. They are controlled by the byte enable signals from the system (`s_byteenable_n`), deciding which part of the data bus is active during a data transaction."
