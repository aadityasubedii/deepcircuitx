It generates outputs like modified sync timings, blanking interval configurations, vertical and horizontal start and end positions, and ancillary line positions, essential for video processing and synchronization in video systems. The module adjusts and predicts the next states of these video parameters to be used in further processing stages, supporting both serial and interlaced output modes."
