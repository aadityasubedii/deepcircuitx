Module-level comment: The alt_vipvfr131_prc module orchestrates video processing operations by handling interface communications for data transfer. It utilizes separate blocks for read master operations, core processing, control transactions, and output stream management, each tailored to effectively accommodate and support burst data reads, data unpacking, and streaming outputs according to defined system parameters. These implementations ensure synchronized handling of video frames, managing Avalon MM interactions while processing and streaming the video data efficiently.
