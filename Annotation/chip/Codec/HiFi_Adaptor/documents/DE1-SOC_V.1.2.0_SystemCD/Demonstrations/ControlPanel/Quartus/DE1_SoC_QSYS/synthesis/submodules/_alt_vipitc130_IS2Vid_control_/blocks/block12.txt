Comment: 
This block assigns a value to the signal `clear_interrupts` based on two conditions: when there is a write operation (`av_write`) and the address is specifically 8'd2 (`av_address == 8'd2`). By utilizing a logical AND operation, `clear_interrupts` becomes high only if both conditions are simultaneously met, indicating the intention to clear interrupts at a particular address in a memory-mapped control register.
