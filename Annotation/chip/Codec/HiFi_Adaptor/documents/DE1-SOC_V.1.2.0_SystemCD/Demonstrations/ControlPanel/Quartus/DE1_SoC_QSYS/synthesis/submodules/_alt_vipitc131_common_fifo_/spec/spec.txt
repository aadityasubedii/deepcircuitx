Module name: alt_vipitc131_common_fifo. 
Module specification: The "alt_vipitc131_common_fifo" module in Verilog implements a configurable FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer that supports either single-clock or dual-clock domains based on the configuration set by the parameter `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME`. It is designed to handle data of width specified by `DATA_WIDTH` and a depth defined by `FIFO_DEPTH`. The module features two sets of input and output ports: input ports include `wrclk` (write clock), `rdreq` (read request signal), `aclr` (asynchronous clear), `rdclk` (read clock for dual-clock mode), `wrreq` (write request signal), and `data` (input data). The output ports are `rdusedw` (read words used), `rdempty` (FIFO empty status), `wrusedw` (write words used), `wrfull` (FIFO full status), and `q` (output data). The different blocks within the module include conditional instantiation of either `scfifo` for single-clock domains or `dcfifo` for dual-clock configurations, with specific parameters such as FIFO depth and data width configured through `defparam`. The module efficiently manages FIFO operations using the internal modules (`scfifo` and `dcfifo`) without explicitly declared internal signals, relying on parameters and input/output ports to handle data flow and control signals. The configuration of the FIFO to optimize speed, overflow, underflow, and the optional use of registers for memory blocks is managed through parameters set in the instantiations of `scfifo` or `dcfifo`. This setup enables versatile, high-performance FIFO behavior crucial for applications requiring reliable data buffering across potentially varying clock domains.
