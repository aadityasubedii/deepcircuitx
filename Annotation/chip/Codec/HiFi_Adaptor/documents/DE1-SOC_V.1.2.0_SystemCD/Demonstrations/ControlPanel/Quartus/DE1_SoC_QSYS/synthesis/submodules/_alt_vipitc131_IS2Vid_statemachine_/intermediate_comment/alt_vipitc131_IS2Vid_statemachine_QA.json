This includes recognizing the start of packet (sop), managing different widths and heights, addressing interlacing, synchronization with ancillary data planes, and transitioning between various modes of operation (like idle, data processing, synchronization, etc.). The state transitions are driven by the incoming video attributes (like sop), and ancillary data validity, alongside parameters that dictate behavior such as whether to embed syncs and handling different numbers of color planes. Each state has conditions that guide the next state, ensuring proper handling, synchronization, and data integrity as the video data streams are processed."

It essentially reflects the current operational status of the state machine, determining how the module processes input signals and transitions between states.\n- state_next_int: This register is designed to hold the next state of the state machine. During each evaluation phase (always block sensitive to all input signals), this signal is determined based on the current state (`state_int`) and the conditional checks related to input signals and internal parameters. `state_next_int` directs the transition by being loaded into `state_int` at the next clock edge, steering the state machine to its subsequent operational phase."
