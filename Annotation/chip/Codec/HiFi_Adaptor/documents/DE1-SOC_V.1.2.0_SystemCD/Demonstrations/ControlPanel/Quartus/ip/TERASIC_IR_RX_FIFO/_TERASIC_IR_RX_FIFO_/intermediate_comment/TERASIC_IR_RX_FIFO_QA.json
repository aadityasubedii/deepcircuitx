It interfaces with an IR data receiver and facilitates data communication with a system processor. The module is responsible for capturing data from an IR receiver, storing it in FIFO, generating interrupts when data is ready, and allowing the processor to read from or write to specific registers (Data and Control/Status Registers). The module uses signals to manage FIFO operations (clear and data writing), handles read/write requests from the processor, and ensures that data is ready before it is processed or retrieved. The design includes mechanisms to reset FIFO state and generate interrupts based on the data readiness, enhancing communication efficiency and reliability in a system."

This input determines when the module should respond to read or write commands from the processor.\n- s_read: Read signal that triggers the module to perform data read operations from the selected register when asserted (high).\n- s_write: Write signal that triggers the module to write data to the selected register when asserted (high).\n- s_writedata: Data bus for write operations. It carries the data that needs to be written into the module's registers.\n- ir: Infrared input signal received from an external IR receiver which represents the captured data.\n\nOutput ports: [irq, s_readdata]. \nExplanation:\n- irq: Interrupt request output. It is asserted (high) by the module to inform the processor that new data is available in the FIFO or a specific status has changed which requires attention.\n- s_readdata: Data bus for read operations.
