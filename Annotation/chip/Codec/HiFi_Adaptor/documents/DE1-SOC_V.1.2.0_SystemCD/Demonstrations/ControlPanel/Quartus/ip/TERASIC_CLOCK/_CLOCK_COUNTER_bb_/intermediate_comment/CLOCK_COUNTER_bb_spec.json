    "spec": "Module name: CLOCK_COUNTER. \nModule specification: The CLOCK_COUNTER is a Verilog module designed primarily to count clock cycles. It interfaces with three input ports and one output port. The 'aclr' input serves as an asynchronous clear that resets the count to zero irrespective of the clock state, allowing for immediate reinitialization of the count. The 'clk_en' input is a clock enable that controls whether the counter should increment \u2013 it allows the counter to progress only when high. The 'clock' input is the primary clock signal driving the counting mechanism. The single output 'q' is a 32-bit signal representing the number of counted clock cycles, used for timing or synchronization in larger systems. The provided code lacks any internal signals, registers, or specific combinatorial or sequential logic circuits; hence, no details on such internal configurations can be specified without additional code. This module essentially outlines a high-level interface without detailing the inner workings such as state management or counting logic, which would be crucial for practical utility and further implementation.",

It is likely used to enable or disable the counting mechanism.
