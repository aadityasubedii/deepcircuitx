Module name: alt_vipitc131_IS2Vid_sync_compare.

Module specification: The `alt_vipitc131_IS2Vid_sync_compare` module synchronizes the start of frame (SOF) events between an input video (CVI) and an output video (CVO) interfaces in video processing applications. It compares frames based on their sync status and generates control signals to align the output video to the input video, ensuring video frames are genlocked with minimal discrepancies. The input ports include reset (`rst`), clock (`clk`), genlock enable vector (`genlock_enable`), horizontal total pixels minus one (`h_total_minus_one`), restart count control (`restart_count`), divider value for horizontal sync comparison (`divider_value`), start of frame for CVI (`sof_cvi`), SOF lock status for CVI (`sof_cvi_locked`), SOF for CVO (`sof_cvo`), and SOF lock status for CVO (`sof_cvo_locked`). The output ports consist of synchronization status for lines (`sync_lines`) and samples (`sync_samples`), frame or line repeat removal signal (`remove_repeatn`), horizontal and vertical reset counts (`sync_compare_h_reset`, `sync_compare_v_reset`), and genlock status (`genlocked`). Internal signals, such as `sof_cvi_int` and `sof_cvo_int`, detect rising edges of respective SOF signals; `enable` combines genlock and SOF lock signals; synchronization clear signals `sclr`, `sclr_frame_counter`, and `sclr_state` manage resets under different conditions; dynamic counters (`h_count`, `v_count`) and state regulators (`state`, `next_state`) govern synchronization transitions and validation. The sequence involves dynamic adjustments in response to synchronization conditions, comparatives reset calculations, and state-driven transitions, all orchestrated by a state machine structure. This module also incorporates an `alt_vipitc131_common_frame_counter` submodule that functions as the detailed frame counter, managing the alignment of vertical and horizontal frames. This submodule reads settings like horizontal total minus one and utilizes an `enable` signal to point out when the counter should be active, aiding in intricate genlock operations.
