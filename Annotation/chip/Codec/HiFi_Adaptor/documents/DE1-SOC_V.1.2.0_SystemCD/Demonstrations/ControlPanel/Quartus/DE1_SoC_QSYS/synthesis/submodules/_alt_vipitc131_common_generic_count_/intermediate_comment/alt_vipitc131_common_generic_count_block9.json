    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block configures a counter based on the parameter `TICKS_PER_COUNT`. If `TICKS_PER_COUNT` equals 1, the block sets `start_count` to 1, links `enable_count` directly to the `enable` signal, and sets `cp_ticks` to 0, thereby establishing a simple pass-through configuration for an enabled counter. If `TICKS_PER_COUNT` is not 1, the code initiates a register `ticks` with a width defined by `TICKS_WORD_LENGTH`, implying a setup for a more complex counting mechanism with a configurable tick length. For further functionality details, the block requires additional implementation code."
