Comment: 
This block generates an internal start-of-frame (SOF) signal for a CVI interface. It detects the rising edge of the SOF signal by performing a logical AND operation between the current SOF signal (sof_cvi) and the inverted previous SOF signal (sof_cvi_reg), resulting in a pulse that indicates the start of a new frame.
