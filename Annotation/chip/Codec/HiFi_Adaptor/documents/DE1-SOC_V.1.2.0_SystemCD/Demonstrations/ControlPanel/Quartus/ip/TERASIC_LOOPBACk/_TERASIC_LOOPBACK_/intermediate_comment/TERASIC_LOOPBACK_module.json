    "module": "Module-level comment: The TERASIC_LOOPBACK module tests loopback functionalities on signal pairs, operating synchronized by a clock and controlled via chip select, read, and write signals. It features internal registers and logic to manage test configurations, perform signal inversions, and output error detection results. Tests iterate over signal pairs evaluating predefined conditions to ensure robust loopback testing and is configurable for various test scenarios."
