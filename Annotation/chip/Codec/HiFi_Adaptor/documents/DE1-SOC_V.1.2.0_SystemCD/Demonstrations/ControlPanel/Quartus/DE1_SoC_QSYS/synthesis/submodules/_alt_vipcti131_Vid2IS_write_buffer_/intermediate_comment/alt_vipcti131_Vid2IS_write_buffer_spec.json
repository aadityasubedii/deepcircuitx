    "spec": "**Module name:** alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_write_buffer.\n\n**Module specification:** The alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_write_buffer is a Verilog module designed to act as a video data buffering system, optimized for handling multiple color planes. The module operates under synchronization with a clock signal (`clk`) and can be reset through a reset signal (`rst`). The key functionalities revolve around managing data conversion (`convert`), handling high-definition mode (`hd_sdn`), and processing early termination signals (`early_eop`). Input ports include `wrreq_in` (write request), `data_in` (incoming video data), and `packet_in` (indicating packet association of the data) while the output ports comprise `wrreq_out` (write request output), `data_out` (processed data output), and `packet_out` (packet status after processing). Internally, the module utilizes `write_buffer_data` (data storage per color plane), `write_buffer_valid` (validity of the buffered data), and `write_buffer_packet` (packet status storage), which are managed based on configured parameters such as data width (`DATA_WIDTH`), number of color planes (`NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES`), and bits per sample (`BPS`). Different sections of the code handle reset conditions, data buffer operations during active clock edges, and conditional buffering based on mode and conversion requirements. The data and packet handling blocks ensure correct output signaling and data integrity across standard and HD video streams, making it a tailored solution for intricate video data management in diverse operational settings.",

It is designed to manage the buffering of video data inputs based on various control signals. When the reset (rst) signal is active or during the positive edge of the clock (clk), the buffer will reset or update its content. The code handles data based on conditions such as whether HD mode is deactivated (hd_sdn), conversion is required (convert), and early end of packet signals (early_eop). The module can accept or reject data writes (wrreq_in) and outputs the data status using wrreq_out. Furthermore, it supports selective buffering of data for multiple color planes and adjusts the output data and packet status accordingly. The overall functionality revolves around efficiently managing video data streams considering operational modes and signal conditions to ensure correct data output and packet statuses."

When high, it resets the internal states and data buffers to their default values.\n- `clk`: Clock signal. Used to synchronize the operations within the module, ensuring data and signals are processed in each clock cycle.\n- `convert`: Conversion control signal. Determines the need for data conversion before writing into the buffer.\n- `hd_sdn`: High-definition shut down signal. When low, indicates the system should operate in HD mode affecting data processing logic.\n- `early_eop`: Early end of packet signal. Used to indicate an early termination of data packet, controlling the output readiness of the data.\n- `wrreq_in`: Write request input. When high, it indicates a request to write data into the buffer.\n- `data_in`: Data input. The video data that the module should buffer.\n- `packet_in`: Packet input signal. Indicates whether the current data forms part of a packet.\n\nOutput ports: wrreq_out, data_out, packet_out.\nExplanation:\n- `wrreq_out`: Write request output. Indicates the readiness of the buffer to send out data, considering internal conditions and signals like early_eop.\n- `data_out`: Data output. The video data output buffer after being processed internally, based on the buffer's logic and control signals.\n- `packet_out`: Packet output signal. Reflects the packet status after internal processing, providing information on whether the outputted data is part of a packet, influenced by conditions like early_eop."

Depending on the DATA_WIDTH and BPS configurations and operational conditions set by signals like convert and hd_sdn, the data is stored appropriately across varying color planes.\n- `write_buffer_valid`: This signal is an array of registers corresponding to each color plane, indicating whether the data stored in `write_buffer_data` is valid and ready to be output. It is set or reset based on conditions such as the presence of a write request (wrreq_in) and whether the module is processing data under normal or early end of packet conditions.\n- `write_buffer_packet`: This register holds the status of whether the current data in the buffer forms part of a packet. The status can be influenced by the packet_in input and is adjusted considering processing conditions like hd_sdn and the wrreq_out signal status, effectively showing if a buffered packet is ready to be forwarded as part of the output stream."

The key functionalities revolve around managing data conversion (`convert`), handling high-definition mode (`hd_sdn`), and processing early termination signals (`early_eop`). Input ports include `wrreq_in` (write request), `data_in` (incoming video data), and `packet_in` (indicating packet association of the data) while the output ports comprise `wrreq_out` (write request output), `data_out` (processed data output), and `packet_out` (packet status after processing). Internally, the module utilizes `write_buffer_data` (data storage per color plane), `write_buffer_valid` (validity of the buffered data), and `write_buffer_packet` (packet status storage), which are managed based on configured parameters such as data width (`DATA_WIDTH`), number of color planes (`NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES`), and bits per sample (`BPS`). Different sections of the code handle reset conditions, data buffer operations during active clock edges, and conditional buffering based on mode and conversion requirements. The data and packet handling blocks ensure correct output signaling and data integrity across standard and HD video streams, making it a tailored solution for intricate video data management in diverse operational settings."
