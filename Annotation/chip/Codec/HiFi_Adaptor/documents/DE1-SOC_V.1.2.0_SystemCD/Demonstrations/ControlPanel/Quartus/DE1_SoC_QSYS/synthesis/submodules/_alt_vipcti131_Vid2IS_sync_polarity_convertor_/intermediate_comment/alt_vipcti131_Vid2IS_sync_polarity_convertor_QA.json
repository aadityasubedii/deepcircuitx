The output, `sync_out`, is the result of optionally inverting `sync_in` depending on the logic conditioned by `datavalid` and its changes (edges). The module uses several internal registers and wires to detect the negative edge of `datavalid`, decide whether inversion is necessary, and apply this inversion conditionally to `sync_in` to produce `sync_out`. The decision to invert or not is updated with each clock cycle and the presence of a reset signal initializes all registers to 0, which implies no inversion by default. This module is primarily utilized in video and image processing technologies where synchronization signal characteristics might need dynamic adjustments."

Changes in its state (specifically negative edges) are used to determine whether the polarity of `sync_in` should be inverted.\n\nOutput ports: `sync_out`.\nExplanation:\n- `sync_out`: This is the output synchronization signal that may have its polarity inverted compared to `sync_in`. The inversion is based on the internal logic that tracks the state and transitions of the `datavalid` signal. If the inversion conditions are met (`invert_sync_nxt` is high), `sync_in` is inverted.

It is true (high) when `datavalid` transitions from high to low. This edge detection plays a crucial role in determining when to potentially change the inversion status of the sync signal.\n- `datavalid_reg`: This is a register used to store the previous state of the `datavalid` signal. It helps in detecting the negative edge by providing a comparison point for the current `datavalid` state.\n- `needs_invert_nxt`: This signal determines if there is a need to invert the `sync_in` signal during the next clock cycle based on the current logic conditions. It is set high if `datavalid` is high and `sync_in` is also high or if the `needs_invert` was already set high previously.\n- `needs_invert`: This is a registered version of `needs_invert_nxt`, capturing the decision to invert or not, based on the most recent update. It ensures that the decision to invert is stable over each clock cycle until updated again.\n- `invert_sync_nxt`: This signal is a next-state logic that decides whether to invert the sync signal during the current cycle. It is conditional upon whether a negative edge in `datavalid` was detected; if so, it will follow the `needs_invert_nxt` value, else it retains the previous `invert_sync` state.\n- `invert_sync`: This is the registered version of `invert_sync_nxt`, storing the current state of whether inversion is needed or not. This signal directly influences the output `sync_out` by toggling its value based on whether it is set high or low."
