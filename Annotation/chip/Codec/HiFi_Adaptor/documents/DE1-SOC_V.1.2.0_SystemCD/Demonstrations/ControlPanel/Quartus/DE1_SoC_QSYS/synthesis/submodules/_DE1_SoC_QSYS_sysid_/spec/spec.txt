Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_sysid. 
Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sysid module is designed to output a specific 32-bit identification (ID) number based on the state of the input 'address'. This module includes three input ports: 'address', 'clock', and 'reset_n'. The 'address' is a crucial single-bit input that determines the output value on the 'readdata' port, outputting a 32-bit value '525D2B41' (equivalent to decimal 1381894597) when high, and 0 when low. The 'clock' and 'reset_n' inputs are standard inclusions for synchronization and resetting in digital designs, although they are not utilized in the logic of this module. The module features one output port, 'readdata', which outputs the ID based on the 'address' input. Internally, the module uses a wire type signal for 'readdata', directly assigned through a conditional (ternary) operator based on the 'address' input. The concise Verilog code uses an 'assign' statement to implement the logic, neatly grouping the module's entire functionality without additional computational or conditional blocks, ensuring simplicity and clarity in reading and modifying the ID delivery mechanism.
