    "block_comment": "This block generates a clear signal for the frame counter. It implements an OR operation between three input signals: sclr (likely a system clear), sof_cvi_int (possibly start of frame for input), and sof_cvi_int (possibly start of frame for output), assigning the result to sclr_frame_counter, which is used to reset or clear the frame counter when any of these conditions are met."
