Comment: 
This Verilog block defines specific parameter values for a frame counter module, setting it to work with different configurations of color planes. The parameters set include the number of color planes, whether these planes are processed in parallel, a logarithmic value (base 2) of the number of color planes, a sequence-to-parallel conversion flag, and an adjustment value for totals. Each parameter is assigned a corresponding value from the system's definition, tailoring the module's operation to the specific needs of the video processing context it is used in.
