It utilizes the incoming reset signals, clock signals, and a locked signal from the PLL to produce stable and synchronized reset outputs tailored for different parts of the system such as the memory controller (AFI clock), address/command path, sequencer, and read capture logic. The module ensures that all these components are reset properly in line with the defined clock domains, enhancing reliability and functionality in memory operations."
