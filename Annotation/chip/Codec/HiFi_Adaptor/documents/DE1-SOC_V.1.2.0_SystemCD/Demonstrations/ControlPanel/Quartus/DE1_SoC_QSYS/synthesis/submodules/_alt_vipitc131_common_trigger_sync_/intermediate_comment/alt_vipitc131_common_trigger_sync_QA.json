It uses either a direct assignment when the clocks are the same, or a toggle-based synchronization mechanism when the clocks differ. The trigger signal (trigger_in) is first registered and a toggle mechanism is applied whereby the toggle flips based on the condition of trigger_in relative to its previous state and an acknowledgment signal (ack_in). The toggle synchronized to a separate clock domain using a sub-module (alt_vipitc131_common_sync), and finally, the output (trigger_out) is generated by XORing the synchronized toggle with its registered value, thereby ensuring the trigger's correct synchronization across clock domains."

It is used to reset the internal registers associated with the input clock domain.\n- input_clock: The clock signal corresponding to the domain of the incoming trigger signal, used for registering the trigger signal and controlling the toggle mechanism.\n- rst: Reset signal for the synchronization clock domain, ensuring that the system can properly reset in this second clock domain.\n- sync_clock: The clock signal of the second domain to which the trigger signal needs to be synchronized.\n- trigger_in: The incoming trigger signal that needs to be synchronized to the sync_clock domain.\n- ack_in: An acknowledgment input that affects the toggle mechanism, which helps in determining when the trigger_in has been successfully processed or acknowledged in the context it is used.\n\nOutput ports: [trigger_out].\nExplanation:\n- trigger_out: The output trigger signal that has been synchronized to the sync_clock domain.
