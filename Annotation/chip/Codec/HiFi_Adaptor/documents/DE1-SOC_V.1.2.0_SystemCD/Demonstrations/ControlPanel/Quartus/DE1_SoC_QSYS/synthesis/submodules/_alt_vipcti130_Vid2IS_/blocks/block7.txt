Comment: 
This line defines a simple signal assignment in Verilog, forwarding the value of one signal to another. The `wrreq_post_swap` signal is assigned the value of the `wrreq_pre_swap` signal, effectively creating a direct connection between the two without any logical transformation. This can be used to ensure timing or to align signals in the same clock domain for subsequent operations. For a detailed understanding of the context, refer to the surrounding code where these signals are used.
