Module name: alt_vipitc130_common_to_binary.
Module specification: The alt_vipitc130_common_to_binary module is designed to convert a one-hot encoded signal into a binary representation, primarily used for determining the active mode index. It has one input port `one_hot`, a vector of bits denoting the active mode through a single high bit, and one output port `binary`, containing the zero-based binary index of the activated mode. The size of `one_hot` is defined by the parameter `NO_OF_MODES`, whereas `binary` is sized according to `LOG2_NO_OF_MODES`. Internally, the module uses two critical arrays of wires: `binary_values` for temporary storage of binary indices, and `binary_values_by_bit` to facilitate bitwise OR operations for the final output assemble. The Verilog code structures this transformation using nested generate blocks, where the first set of loops calculates and assigns intermediate binary values for each possible active mode. The second nested loops then transpose and reduce this intermediate matrix to compute each bit of the final output `binary`, based on the position of the active bit in the `one_hot` input. This module is parameterized to handle varying sizes of input vectors dynamically, suiting different application requirements.
