This block transforms a one-hot encoded signal into its corresponding binary value. Using bitwise manipulation, the code assigns a segment of the `binary_values` array to either `one_hot_pos + 1` or 0, depending on the state of `one_hot[one_hot_pos]`. Each bit of the one-hot input signal potentially sets a different range of bits in `binary_values`, calculated based on `one_hot_pos` and `LOG2_NO_OF_MODES`, facilitating a bitwise mapping from one-hot to binary form.
