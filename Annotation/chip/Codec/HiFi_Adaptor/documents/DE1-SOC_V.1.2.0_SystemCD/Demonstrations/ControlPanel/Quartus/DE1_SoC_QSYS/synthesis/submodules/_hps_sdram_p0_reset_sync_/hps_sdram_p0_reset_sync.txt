Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync` module synchronizes an asynchronous reset signal (`reset_n`) with a clock signal (`clk`) for stable SDRAM interface operations in FPGAs. It employs a series of flip-flops, determined by `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` and `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT`, to sequentially filter `reset_n` against metastability. The flip-flops are updated on the clock's rising edge or reset's falling edge, with a final synchronized reset output (`reset_n_sync`) derived from this chain.
