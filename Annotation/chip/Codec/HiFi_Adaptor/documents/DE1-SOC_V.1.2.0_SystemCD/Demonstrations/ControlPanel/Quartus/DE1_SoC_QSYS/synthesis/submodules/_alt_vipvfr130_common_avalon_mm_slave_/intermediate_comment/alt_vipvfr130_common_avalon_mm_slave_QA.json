It handles read and write requests through the Avalon bus, manages internal registers based on these requests, and processes interrupts. The module can also control and reflect the status of various outputs, respond to address-specific actions such as enabling functionalities or clearing interrupts, and provides functionality to reset the state. Additionally, it includes support for configurable data width, address width, and the number of outputs, interrupts, and registers using Verilog parameters."

It indicates if all outputs are in a stopped state, thus representing a global stop condition across all operations handled by the module.\n- **clear_interrupts**: This signal controls the clearing of interrupt flags.

It uses the address and operation type (read/write) to determine when to reset interrupt flags.\n- **triggers_nxt**: This array signal indicates the next state of each trigger. Each bit in `triggers_nxt` is set when a write operation happens to addresses corresponding to internal registers, essentially prepping the module for a register update at the next clock cycle or as determined by internal logic.\n- **internal_registers**: This array of registers stores data internally. Each register can be accessed and modified via the external Avalon interface or through internal logic pursuant to specific module operations.\n- **interrupt_register**: Manages the status of interrupts. It is updated either by clearing specific bits when interrupts are acknowledged and cleared (controlled by `clear_interrupts`), or by setting bits when interrupts are active and the corresponding enable is set (`interrupt_enables`).\n- **interrupt_enables**: This register array shows which interrupts are enabled. Only enabled interrupts will affect the `interrupt_register`, meaning an active interrupt that is not enabled would not cause an update or trigger any internal or external actions prompted by an interrupt state."
