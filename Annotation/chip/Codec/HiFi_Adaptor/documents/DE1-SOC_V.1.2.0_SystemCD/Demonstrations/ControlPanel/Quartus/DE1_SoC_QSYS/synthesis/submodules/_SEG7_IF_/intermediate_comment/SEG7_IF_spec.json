Module specification: The SEG7_IF module is designed to interface with a 7-segment display array, catering specifically to handling read, write, and reset operations. It facilitates data writing and reading concerning individual segments of a display. The inputs to this module include a clock signal `s_clk` for synchronization, an address input `s_address` specifying the target segment address, a read signal `s_read` to enable segment state reading, a write signal `s_write` enabling data writing, a data input `s_writedata` representing the information to be written, and a reset input `s_reset` that initializes the segment states. The outputs are `s_readdata`, outputting the data read from the specified segment, and `SEG7`, which drives the entire 7-segment display. Internal signals such as `base_index`, `write_data`, `read_data`, and `reg_file` respectively calculate the target bit within the register, temporarily store the write data, hold the read segment data, and maintain the state of the display segments. The code executes different operations based on signals: reset initializes all segments either to `1` or `0`, controlled by `DEFAULT_ACTIVE`; write operation transfers data from `s_writedata` to the specific segment in `reg_file`; and read operation fetches segment data into `s_readdata`. Additionally, the `SEG7` output can invert the stored values before output based on `LOW_ACTIVE`. This modular setup ensures efficient control and configuration of a multi-segment 7-segment display, powered by straightforward and robust synchronous logic blocks responding to real-time input signals.",

It takes input signals for clock, reset, read, write, and data, and manages an internal register array that stores the state of each segment of the display. The module allows writing to this register array via a specified address and data inputs, and reading the current state through a read operation. It handles the resetting of the displays to a default state (either all segments on or off based on configuration) upon reset. The output to the actual 7-segment display is either the direct register values or their logical inverse, contingent upon the configuration for active-low outputs. The module also outputs the data read from a specific segment address."

It is used to synchronize the operations within the module, specifically for reading from and writing to the internal registers.  \n- s_address: Address input. This specifies the target segment address within the 7-segment display for read and write operations.  \n- s_read: Read control signal. When asserted (logic high), it enables reading the state of the 7-segment display segment specified by s_address.  \n- s_writedata: Write data input. This is the data that will be written to the segment of the display specified by the s_address during a write operation.  \n- s_write: Write control signal. When asserted (logic high), it enables writing the data present on s_writedata to the segment specified by s_address.  \n- s_reset: Reset signal. When asserted, it resets the state of all segments in the display to a default configuration defined by the module parameters (either all bits on or all bits off).\n\nOutput ports: s_readdata, SEG7.  \nExplanation:  \n- s_readdata: Data output of a read operation. It holds the state of the 7-segment display segment read from the internal register specified by s_address after a read operation is performed.  \n- SEG7: 7-segment display outputs. This bus contains the states of all segments in the 7-segment display, directly driven based on the contents of the internal register file. The output can be either the direct value from the register or its logical inverse, controlled by a module parameter for active-high or active-low configuration."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: base_index, write_data, read_data, reg_file.  \nExplanation:  \n- base_index: This is used to calculate the starting bit position in the register file for the segment specified by s_address. It's typically calculated by shifting s_address left by 3 bits (multiplied by 8) because each segment of the display is controlled by 8 bits.  \n- write_data: This holds the data that is being written to the specified segment of the display. It\u2019s transient storage for the data coming from the s_writedata input during a write operation.  \n- read_data: This holds the data that has been read from the specified segment. It is used to output the current state of a segment through the s_readdata port after a read operation.  \n- reg_file: This is the main internal storage representing the segments of the 7-segment display. It is an aggregated register array where each segment has an 8-bit section within this register to control its individual segments (a, b, c, etc. of display). The entire 7-segment display state is held within this register file, and it\u2019s updated or accessed based on read or write operations."
