Module name: alt_vipvfr131_vfr_controller. Module specification: The alt_vipvfr131_vfr_controller is a Verilog module designed to control the reading of video frames, operating within a state machine framework to manage the flow and processing of video data. The module has several input ports: `clock` and `reset` for basic operation synchronization, `master_interrupt_receive` and `go_bit` for frame processing control, `next_bank` to switch between two data banks, and various configuration and data inputs for these banks, including packet width, height, interlacing, base address, sample count, and words count. Output ports include `master_address`, `master_write`, `master_writedata` for interfacing with external memory, `running` and `frame_complete` to indicate processing status, and `width_of_next_vid_packet`, `height_of_next_vid_packet`, and `interlaced_of_next_vid_packet` to transmit video packet characteristics, along with `do_control_packet` to signal control packet processing. Internally, the module utilizes a `state` register to hold its current state in the finite state machine, which dictates the module's operation through states such as IDLE, SENDING_ADDRESS, and WAITING_END_FRAME, among others. The `bank_to_read` register indicates the active data bank. Key blocks of the code handle resetting conditions, transitioning between states while updating control signals and configuring data transfers based on the state, and reacting to frame completion signals. The module effectively manages the flow of video data reading tasks from initialization to data handling and finalization based on the operational state and external inputs.
