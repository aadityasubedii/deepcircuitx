This block assigns a portion of the `data_out` bus from the `write_buffer_data` array. By dynamically calculating the bit-range using the loop variable `i` and the parameter `BPS`, it allows each segment of `write_buffer_data[i]` to be mapped to a corresponding segment of `data_out`, ensuring that data is organized into non-overlapping slices per index `i`. This technique is essential for efficiently handling parallel data transfers or serialization of buffer contents into broader bus widths.
