    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipitc131_IS2Vid_statemachine. \nModule specification: The alt_vipitc131_IS2Vid_statemachine is a Verilog module designed as a state machine to handle and process incoming video and ancillary data. It manages data transitions across various states in response to video attributes and operation parameters. Inputs to the module include rst (reset), clk (clock), request_data_valid (data validity flag), sop (start of packet indicator), vid_v_nxt (vertical sync status), anc_datavalid_nxt (validity of upcoming ancillary data), q_data (4-bit data bus), sync_lost (loss of sync flag), anc_underflow_nxt (ancillary data underflow flag), ap_synched (auxiliary processor sync status), and enable_synced_nxt (next cycle sync enable). Output ports include state_next (indicating the next state) and state (present state). Internal signals include state_int and state_next_int, which respectively hold the current and next states of the machine, updated each clock cycle based on conditions evaluated in the always blocks. The code comprises initialization and transition blocks. The initialization block sets up the initial state upon reset or update transition states based on clock edges. The transition block, driven by multiple case statements based on the current state, conditions and input values, dictates transitions to subsequent states ensuring the system reacts aptly to the changing video data characteristics and system parameters. This setup guarantees rigorous data handling, processing and synchronization within the specified video processing context.",

It manages data transitions across various states in response to video attributes and operation parameters. Inputs to the module include rst (reset), clk (clock), request_data_valid (data validity flag), sop (start of packet indicator), vid_v_nxt (vertical sync status), anc_datavalid_nxt (validity of upcoming ancillary data), q_data (4-bit data bus), sync_lost (loss of sync flag), anc_underflow_nxt (ancillary data underflow flag), ap_synched (auxiliary processor sync status), and enable_synced_nxt (next cycle sync enable). Output ports include state_next (indicating the next state) and state (present state). Internal signals include state_int and state_next_int, which respectively hold the current and next states of the machine, updated each clock cycle based on conditions evaluated in the always blocks. The code comprises initialization and transition blocks. The initialization block sets up the initial state upon reset or update transition states based on clock edges. The transition block, driven by multiple case statements based on the current state, conditions and input values, dictates transitions to subsequent states ensuring the system reacts aptly to the changing video data characteristics and system parameters. This setup guarantees rigorous data handling, processing and synchronization within the specified video processing context."
