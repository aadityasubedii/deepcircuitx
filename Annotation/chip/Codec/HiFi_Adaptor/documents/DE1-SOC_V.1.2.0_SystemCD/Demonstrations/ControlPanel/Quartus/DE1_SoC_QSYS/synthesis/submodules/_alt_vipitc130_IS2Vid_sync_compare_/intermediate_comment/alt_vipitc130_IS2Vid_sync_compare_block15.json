    "block_comment": "This block implements synchronous reset and clock-based register updates for start-of-frame signals. It uses an always block triggered by positive edges of reset and clock, resetting the registers to 0 on reset and updating them with new values on each clock cycle when not in reset, ensuring proper timing and synchronization of the start-of-frame signals."
