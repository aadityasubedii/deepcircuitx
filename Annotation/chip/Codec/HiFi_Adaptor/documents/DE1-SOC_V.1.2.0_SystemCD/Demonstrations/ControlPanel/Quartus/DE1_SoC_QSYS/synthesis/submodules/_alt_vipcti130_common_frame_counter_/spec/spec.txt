Module name: alt_vipcti130_common_frame_counter. 
Module specification: The `alt_vipcti130_common_frame_counter` is a Verilog module designed to handle frame counting for video processing applications, specifically managing pixel sample counts within video frames. The module takes as input signals `rst` (reset), `clk` (clock), `sclr` (synchronous clear), `enable`, `hd_sdn` (horizontally disable counting under certain conditions), `h_total` (total horizontal count), `v_total` (total vertical count), `h_reset`, and `v_reset`. Its outputs include `new_line` (indicating the start of a new line within a video frame), `start_of_sample` (indicating the commencement of a pixel sample), `sample_ticks` (ticks within each sample period), and the current counts `h_count` (horizontal) and `v_count` (vertical). Internal signals such as `count_sample`, `h_total_int`, and `v_total_int` are crucial for adjusting the counts based on configuration and facilitating interaction with a submodule `alt_vipcti130_common_sample_counter` that manages detailed sample counting logic. The logic blocks within the module handle initialization and synchronous resets, conditionally modify total count parameters, and manage count updates during each clock cycle based on various conditions, including the end of line and frame boundaries. Additionally, the `sample_counter` submodule is instantiated and parameterized within this main module, closely integrating its functionality to optimize count management per video frame specifications.
