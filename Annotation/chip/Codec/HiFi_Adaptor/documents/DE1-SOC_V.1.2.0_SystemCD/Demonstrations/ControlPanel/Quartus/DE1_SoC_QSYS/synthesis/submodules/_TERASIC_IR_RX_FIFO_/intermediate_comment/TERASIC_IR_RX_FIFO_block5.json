    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to the 'read' signal based on the conditions of the 's_read' signal and 's_address' comparison. It checks if 's_read' is active and if 's_address' matches the defined 'IR_RX_DATA_REG'; if both conditions are true, 'read' is set to 1, otherwise, it is set to 0."
