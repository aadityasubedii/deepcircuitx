Module name: alt_vipitc130_common_sync.
Module specification: The alt_vipitc130_common_sync is a Verilog-based synchronization module designed to handle potential metastability issues when transferring signals across different clock domains. The module features parameters `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME` and `WIDTH` to adjust its operation based on whether the input and output clocks are the same and to set the width of the data signals, respectively. The input ports include `rst` (reset), used to initialize the synchronization registers to a known state; `sync_clock`, which controls the synchronization stages when clocks differ; and `data_in`, a parameterized multi-bit input data signal. The output port `data_out` provides the synchronized data signal. Internal signals `data_out_sync0` and `data_out_sync1` function as intermediate registers in a two-stage synchronization process. When `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME = 0`, `data_in` first passes through `data_out_sync0` at the rising edge of `sync_clock`, and then `data_out_sync1` captures this output at the subsequent rising edge, thereby mitigating metastability risk. The code uses a generate block to implement conditions when clocks differ, allowing `data_out` to either directly equal `data_in` if clocks are the same or pass through the two synchronization stages if not. FPGA-specific attributes set properties and constraints for the synthesis tools concerning the registers used as synchronizers.
