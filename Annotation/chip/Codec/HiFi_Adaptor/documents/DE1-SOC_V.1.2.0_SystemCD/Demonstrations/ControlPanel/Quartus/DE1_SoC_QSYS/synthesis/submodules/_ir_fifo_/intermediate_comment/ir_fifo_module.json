    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"ir_fifo\" module is a dual-clock FIFO for interfacing between different clock domains on Cyclone V FPGAs. It manages data synchronization using 'dcfifo_component' with parameters for overflow and underflow checks, data width, and buffer size. Inputs include control signals and data, and outputs provide data and status flags, connected via internal wires ('sub_wire0' to 'sub_wire3')."
