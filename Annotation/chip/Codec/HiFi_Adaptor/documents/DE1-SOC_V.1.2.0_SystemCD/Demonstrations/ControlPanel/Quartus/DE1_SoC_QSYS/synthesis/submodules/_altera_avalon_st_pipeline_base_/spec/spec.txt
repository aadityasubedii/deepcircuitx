Module name: altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base.
Module specification: The altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base is a Verilog module designed to facilitate data transfer within Altera's Avalon streaming interface by acting as a pipeline base. It harnesses dual buffering (through internal registers data0 and data1) and configurable flow control to efficiently manage data streams under varying system loads. The module incorporates several parameters and ports: input ports include clk (clock input to synchronize operations), reset (resets internal states), in_valid (indicates if incoming data is valid), in_data (actual input data), and out_ready (indicates if the downstream is ready to receive data). The output ports are in_ready (shows if the module is ready for new data), out_valid (indicates the validity of outgoing data), and out_data (the data being sent out). Internally, the module uses signals such as full0 and full1 to indicate the storage state of data0 and data1 buffers. Its operation is divided into blocks based on the value of the PIPELINE_READY parameter. If PIPELINE_READY is set, the handling of ready signals for output data is registered meaning in_ready depends only on the status of full0. Data handling and buffering logic in this case involve detailed management of the fullness states of both buffers, ensuring timely data transfer as per the availability and validity conditions driven by input and output conditions. If PIPELINE_READY is unset, it leads to a simpler unregistered output-ready handling where in_ready is directly influenced by the status of full1 and out_ready. This configuration flexibility allows the module to efficiently synchronize data input acceptance and output readiness relative to varied system conditions and reset events, enhancing the pipeline's overall data processing and transfer capabilities.
