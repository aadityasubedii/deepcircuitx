The FIFO is configurable for depth and data width, specified by the parameters FIFO_DEPTH and DATA_WIDTH. Depending on whether the clocks are the same or different (controlled by the CLOCKS_ARE_SAME parameter), the module internally selects between a single-clock FIFO (scfifo) and a dual-clock FIFO (dcfifo). The module supports functionalities like data writing and reading, and provides outputs such as FIFO full and empty status, and the number of used words in the FIFO. Additional configurable parameters are intended to optimize speed, handle overflow and underflow, and optionally add registers for memory blocks (Embedded Array Blocks - EAB)."
