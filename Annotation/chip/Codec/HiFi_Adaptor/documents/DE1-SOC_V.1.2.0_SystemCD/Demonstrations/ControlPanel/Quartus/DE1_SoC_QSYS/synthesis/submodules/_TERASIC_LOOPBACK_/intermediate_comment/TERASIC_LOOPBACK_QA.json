This loopback test involves input/output signals where the input data can be modified based on certain conditions and compared against expected outputs to detect any discrepancies. The module uses clocked processes to handle both data writing and error checking, primarily conditionally manipulating signal direction and inversion, thus enabling dynamic testing scenarios to verify the signal integrity or logical correctness.
