    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"altera_avalon_dc_fifo\" module implements a dual-clock FIFO buffer to ensure asynchronous data transfer between different clock domains using Altera's Avalon interface. It supports packet processing, error handling, and multiplexed channels. Features include configurable FIFO depth and data width, control via internal registers, and synchronization mechanisms via Gray-coded pointers to manage read/write operations across clock domains. This module integrates mechanisms for checking almost full/empty conditions to optimize data flow and system stability."
