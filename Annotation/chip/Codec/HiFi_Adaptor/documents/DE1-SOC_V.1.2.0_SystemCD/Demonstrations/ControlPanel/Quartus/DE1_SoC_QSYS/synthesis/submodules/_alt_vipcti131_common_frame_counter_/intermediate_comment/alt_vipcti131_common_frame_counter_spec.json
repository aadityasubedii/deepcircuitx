    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipcti131_common_frame_counter. \n\nModule specification: The module 'alt_vipcti131_common_frame_counter' is designed for frame counting in video processing, leveraging both horizontal (`h_count`) and vertical (`v_count`) counters to track the current position in a video frame based on different external and internal signals. It handles inputs including a reset signal (`rst`), a clock signal (`clk`), a synchronous clear signal (`sclr`), an enable signal (`enable`), and a horizontal synchronization signal (`hd_sdn`). Additionally, it takes configuration inputs for total horizontal (`h_total`) and vertical (`v_total`) dimensions, and reset positions (`h_reset`, `v_reset`). The output signals comprise of `new_line`, `start_of_sample`, and `sample_ticks`, which indicate the start of a new line, the start of a color sample, and the count of sampling ticks respectively, along with `h_count` and `v_count`. Internal signals such as `count_sample`, `h_total_int`, and `v_total_int` play a crucial role in adjusting the counters and integrating with a sub-module `alt_vipcti131_common_sample_counter` that refines the horizontal count and synchronizes the color sampling. Featuring parameters to control its behavior, the module integrates conditional adjusting of totals (`TOTALS_MINUS_ONE`), resulting in either direct assignment of total values or decrement-adjusted values to handle edge conditions. The primary logic blocks consist of the generation block to define adjusted totals, and a sequential block responding to edge-triggered resets and clocks to manage the core counting logic, conditionally resetting and incrementing counters based on module inputs and internal conditions.",

The counters increase based on external signals such as enable, reset, and synchronization signals, tracking the current position in the video frame. The module also integrates with a sample counter (alt_vipcti131_common_sample_counter), which further refines the counting mechanism based on the number of color planes, aiding in the precise control of video sampling. Conditions for adjusting the counters include initialization on reset, synchronous clearing, and wrapping the counts over based on total horizontal and vertical dimensions defined by the inputs `h_total` and `v_total`.
