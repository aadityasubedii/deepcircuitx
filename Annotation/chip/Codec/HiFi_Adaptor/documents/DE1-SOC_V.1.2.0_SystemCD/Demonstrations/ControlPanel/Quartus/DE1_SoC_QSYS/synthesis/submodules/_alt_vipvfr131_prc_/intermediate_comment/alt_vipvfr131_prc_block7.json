    "block_comment": "The block of code establishes an Avalon Memory Mapped (MM) slave interface, specifically used for control operations in the design. It is parameterized with address width, data width, output, interrupt, and register settings. Synchronous operation is stimulated by the clock and can be held with the reset input. Bi-directional data and address lines for reads and writes handle data operations on the bus. Other dedicated signals provide control operations like enabling, clearing and triggering. The number of outputs, interrupts and registers can be customized through module parameterization. Outputs include operation status like interrupts and stopped signals."
