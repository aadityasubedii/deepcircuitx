    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipitc131_common_sample_counter. \nModule specification: The `alt_vipitc131_common_sample_counter` module is designed for tracking counts of sample data in image or video processing applications, handling different formats based on the number of color planes. It takes five inputs: `rst` (reset), `clk` (clock), `sclr` (synchronous clear), `count_cycle` (indicates a counting event), and `hd_sdn` (mode selector). The outputs include `count_sample` (signals a sample count), `start_of_sample` (flags the start of a new sample), and `sample_ticks` (outputs the count of valid data units processed within a sample). Internally, the module uses `count_valids` (tracks valid cycles for color planes) and `new_sample` (signals when all color planes have been counted). The code structure includes a conditional generate block that adjusts the behavior based on the number of color planes (distinguished by `NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES == 1`). For a single color plane, outputs are directly tied to inputs. For multiple color planes, the counter increments based on `count_cycle` and resets on conditions dictated by `sclr` and `new_sample`. The output logic adjusts based on the state of `hd_sdn` and internal counters. This well-structured module efficiently manages the counting of video or image sample data, accommodating variations in the parallelism and number of color planes.",

It uses a parameterized design based on the number of color planes (NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES). The module generates signals such as `count_sample`, `start_of_sample`, and `sample_ticks`. When there's only one color plane, the counters simply pass through the `count_cycle` signal. For multiple color planes, the module counts the valid cycles and marks the start of new samples, adjusting the counters and outputs according to the control signals (`sclr`, `hd_sdn`) and the clock `clk`. The counters are reset on a system reset `rst`. The behavior of the counting and sample tracking changes based on whether color planes are handled sequentially or in parallel, which is determined by the parameter `COLOUR_PLANES_ARE_IN_PARALLEL` and the number of color planes involved."

Ensures that the module operates synchronously.\n- `sclr`: Synchronous clear input that resets counters when high, without waiting for a system reset.\n- `count_cycle`: Input signal that indicates a count event in each clock cycle.

It is used to determine when to reset `count_valids` or to signal the system that a new sample counting cycle should begin.\n- `count_valids`: This internal register holds the current count of valid cycles for the color planes. Its value is incremented based on the `count_cycle` signal unless a new sample is detected via `new_sample`. When `sclr` is high, or a new sample cycle begins, `count_valids` is reset.
