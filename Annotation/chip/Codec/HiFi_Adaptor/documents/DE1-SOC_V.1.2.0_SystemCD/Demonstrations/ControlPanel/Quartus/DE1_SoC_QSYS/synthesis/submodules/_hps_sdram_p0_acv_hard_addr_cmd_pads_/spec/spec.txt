Module name: hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_addr_cmd_pads.

Module specification: The `hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_addr_cmd_pads` module is designed for interfacing with SDRAM memory by managing address and command signals, ensuring they are correctly synchronized and conditioned to meet the SDRAM's timing requirements. It handles the conversion and alignment of signals from the DDR interface side inputs (`phy_ddio_*`) to the memory PHY interface outputs (`phy_mem_*`). Input ports include various reset and clock signals such as `reset_n`, `reset_n_afi_clk`, `pll_*_clk`, and DDR interface signals like `phy_ddio_address`, `phy_ddio_bank`, etc. These inputs are utilized to manage the DDR signal conversion, implementation of delay-locked loops, and phase adjustments for signal integrity. Output ports include `phy_mem_address`, `phy_mem_bank`, `phy_mem_cs_n`, and others, which are the processed signals ready to be sent to the SDRAM. Internal signals such as `ac_clk`, `addr_cmd_clk`, and `mem_ck_source` among others, play crucial roles in synchronization and clock generation processes within the module. There are several key sections in the code: signal conversion using instances like `hps_sdram_p0_generic_ddio`, clock generation and conditioning using various components like `hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc` and `altddio_out`, and memory clock output management using `hps_sdram_p0_clock_pair_generator`. These sections collectively ensure that the SDRAM operates reliably under different system conditions and configurations.
