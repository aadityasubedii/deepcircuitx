    "block_comment": "This block of code generates a masked version of the `ticks` signal called `cp_ticks`, which is conditioned on the `enable_ticks` signal. The masking is implemented using a bitwise AND operation between `ticks` and a bitmask created by replicating the `enable_ticks` signal across the entire width defined by `TICKS_WORD_LENGTH`. This ensures that `cp_ticks` retains the value of `ticks` only when `enable_ticks` is high, effectively gating the `ticks` signal based on the control provided by `enable_ticks`."
