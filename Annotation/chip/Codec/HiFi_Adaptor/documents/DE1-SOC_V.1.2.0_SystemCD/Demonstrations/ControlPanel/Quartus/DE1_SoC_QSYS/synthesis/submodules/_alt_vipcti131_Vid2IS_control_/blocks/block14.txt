Comment: 
The block generates `av_readdata` based on the `av_address` input, which acts as a multiplexer selecting different pieces of status or configuration information. Conditional assignment is used, where `av_address` values from 1 to 13 correspond to different register data. The multiplexer outputs include flags for resolution validity, stability, interlace, line counts, sample counts, interrupts, and other status indicators, with each output formatted to maintain consistent bit-widths across the different cases.
