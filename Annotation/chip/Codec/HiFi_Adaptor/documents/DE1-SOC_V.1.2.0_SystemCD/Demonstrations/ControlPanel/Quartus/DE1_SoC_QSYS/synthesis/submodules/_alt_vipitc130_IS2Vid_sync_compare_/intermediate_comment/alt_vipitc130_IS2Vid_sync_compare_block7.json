    "block_comment": "This block generates a valid signal based on the logical AND of two input signals. It combines the validity signals from a remove operation (v_count_remove_valid) and a repeat operation (v_count_repeat_valid) to produce a single valid signal. The implementation uses a simple combinational logic gate (AND) to ensure that the output valid signal is true only when both input signals are valid simultaneously."
