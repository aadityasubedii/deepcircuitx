Comment: 
This block instantiates a video frame reader controller configured with specific parameters and connections. The controller manages the flow and processing of video data between the system's memory and an encoder, handling operations such as packet address and data transfer configurations. It supports dual-bank operation for video packet attributes like width, height, and interlacing properties, which allows smooth transitions and continuous video streaming. The controller receives control signals (e.g., 'go_bit', 'next_bank') to start processing and manage the memory bank swapping, while outputting signals such as frame completion and running status to coordinate with other system components.
