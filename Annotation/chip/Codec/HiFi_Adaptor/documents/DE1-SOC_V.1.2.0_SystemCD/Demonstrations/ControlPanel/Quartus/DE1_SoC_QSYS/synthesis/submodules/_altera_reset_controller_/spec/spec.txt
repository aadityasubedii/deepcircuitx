Module name: altera_reset_controller. 
Module specification: The 'altera_reset_controller' is a Verilog module designed to manage and synchronize multiple reset signals across different clock domains or reset conditions within digital systems. The functionality includes handling up to 16 reset inputs (`reset_in0` to `reset_in15`) and optionally 16 reset request inputs (`reset_req_in0` to `reset_req_in15`), conditioned by parameters. It also processes these signals to generate a single, system-wide reset output (`reset_out`) and a reset request output (`reset_req`). Internally, the module uses signals such as `merged_reset` and `merged_reset_req_in` to combine incoming reset signals and requests. It employs synchronization chains (`altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain`, `r_sync_rst_chain`) to manage the timing and stability of the reset signals, ensuring they are free from glitches and are stable. The module also features conditional generation blocks and adaptation of reset signals based on configurations set by parameters such as `SYNC_DEPTH` and `RESET_REQUEST_PRESENT`. This allows for flexible integration into various system designs requiring robust reset management.
