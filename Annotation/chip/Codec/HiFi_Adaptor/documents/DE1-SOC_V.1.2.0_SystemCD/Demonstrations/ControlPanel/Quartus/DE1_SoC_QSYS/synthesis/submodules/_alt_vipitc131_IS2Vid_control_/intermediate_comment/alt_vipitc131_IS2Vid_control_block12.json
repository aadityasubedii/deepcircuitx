    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the boolean condition to the `clear_interrupts` signal, which is activated when there is a write operation (`av_write` is true) and the address is specifically 8'd2 (`av_address == 8'd2`). This ensures that interrupts are cleared only under these specific conditions, enhancing control over interrupt management."
