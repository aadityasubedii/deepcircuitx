Comment: 
This block conditionally assigns high byte values to `read_temp` based on `mask[1]`. If `mask[1]` is high, `read_temp` for bits 15 to 8 is set to high impedance (`8'bz`), otherwise, it copies bits 15 to 8 from `read_data` to `read_temp`. This is commonly used in bus interfacing, where high impedance states are necessary to avoid conflicts on shared lines.
