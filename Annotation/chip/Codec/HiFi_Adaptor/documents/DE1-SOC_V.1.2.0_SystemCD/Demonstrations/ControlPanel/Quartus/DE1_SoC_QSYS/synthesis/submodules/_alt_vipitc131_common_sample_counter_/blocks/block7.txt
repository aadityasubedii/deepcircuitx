Comment: 
This block sets the signal `start_of_sample` to a high logic level (`1'b1`). This assignment is used to indicate the initiation of a sampling process in the design. The implementation uses a continuous assignment statement, ensuring that `start_of_sample` constantly maintains the value `1'b1` once this block is executed.
