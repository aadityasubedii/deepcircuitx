Module name: audio_fifo.  
Module specification: The `audio_fifo` is a Verilog module designed to implement a dual-clock FIFO buffer tailored for the handling of audio data within digital systems using asynchronous read and write operations. The module's functionality includes accepting 32-bit audio data streams and managing data integrity across different clock domains with the aid of a `dcfifo_component`. Key input ports include `aclr` for asynchronously clearing the FIFO, `data` for the audio stream input, `rdclk` and `wrclk` for read and write clock inputs, and `rdreq` and `wrreq` for read and write request signals. Output ports comprise `q` for the 32-bit data output from FIFO, `rdempty` for indicating FIFO emptiness, and `wrfull` for indicating FIFO fullness. Internally, the module utilizes signals `sub_wire0`, `sub_wire1`, and `sub_wire2` to respectively connect the `rdempty`, `wrfull`, and data output `q` from the `dcfifo_component` to the respective outputs of the `audio_fifo` module. The code establishes the dual-clock FIFO's configuration tailored for optimal performance on Cyclone IV E FPGA devices, including settings for FIFO size, data width, synchronization delays, and enabling overflow and underflow checking. This thorough configuration ensures the module effectively manages audio data with high efficiency and reliability in real-time audio processing applications.
