Module name: AUDIO_DAC. Module specification: The AUDIO_DAC module interfaces with a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for audio data, handling the synchronization and data transmission to convert digital audio from a FIFO queue to an analog signal. This module operates under a primary system clock (`clk`) along with specific input signals for module reset (`reset`), writing data (`write` with `writedata`), FIFO control (`clear`), and DAC timing (`bclk`, `daclrc`). It signals when the FIFO is full via `full` and outputs bit-by-bit audio data to the DAC through `dacdat`. Internally, the module utilizes `request_bit` to manage data requests, `bit_to_dac` for holding the current DAC data bit, a counter `bit_index` for bit tracking, and toggles channel control with `dac_is_left`. Moreover, it handles FIFO's data read operation statuses through `dacfifo_empty`, `dacfifo_read`, and `dacfifo_readdata`, and detects channel switching with `is_left_ch`. The code is divided into major functional blocks for data handling based on bit clock edges, interfacing with a FIFO submodule (`audio_fifo`) for data buffering and channel-sensitive audio processing. This structured approach ensures efficient and stable digital-to-analog conversion suitable for audio applications, governing data flow and synchronization accurately according to external clock signals and internal logic condition states.
