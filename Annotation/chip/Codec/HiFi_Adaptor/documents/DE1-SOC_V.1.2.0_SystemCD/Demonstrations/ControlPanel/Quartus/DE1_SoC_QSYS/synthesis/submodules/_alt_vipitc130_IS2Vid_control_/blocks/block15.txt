Comment: 
This Verilog code block is designed to control a write trigger signal. The `write_trigger` is generated by logically ANDing the `av_write` signal with the negation of the `is_side_registers` signal. This implementation ensures that the `write_trigger` is only active when `av_write` is high and `is_side_registers` is low, effectively enabling writes only to main registers and not to side registers.
