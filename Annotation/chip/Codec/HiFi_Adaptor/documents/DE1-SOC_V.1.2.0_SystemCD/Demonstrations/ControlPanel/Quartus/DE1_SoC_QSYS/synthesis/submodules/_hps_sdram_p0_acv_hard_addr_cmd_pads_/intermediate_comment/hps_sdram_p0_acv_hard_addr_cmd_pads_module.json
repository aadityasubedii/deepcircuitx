    "module": "Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_addr_cmd_pads` module interfaces with SDRAM by managing and synchronizing address and command signals via a DDR interface. It converts `phy_ddio_*` inputs to `phy_mem_*` outputs using phased clocks, delay-locked loops, and signal conditioners. Components like `hps_sdram_p0_generic_ddio` handle signal conversion, while `hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc` and `altddio_out` are responsible for precise clock generation and control, ensuring compliance with SDRAM timing requirements."
