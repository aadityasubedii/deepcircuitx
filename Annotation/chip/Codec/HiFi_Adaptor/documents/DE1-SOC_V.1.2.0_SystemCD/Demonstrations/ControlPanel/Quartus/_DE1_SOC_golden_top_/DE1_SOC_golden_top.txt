Module-level comment: The DE1_SOC_golden_top module serves as the top-level entity for the DE1-SoC FPGA board, interfacing with onboard peripherals including ADC, Audio Codec, DRAM, GPIO, Hex displays, and HPS. It routes and synchronizes various input/output signals and manages bi-directional communication with internal and external components. Implementation uses submodules, signal assignments, and internal wiring to encapsulate complex functionality, promoting modularity and clarity.
