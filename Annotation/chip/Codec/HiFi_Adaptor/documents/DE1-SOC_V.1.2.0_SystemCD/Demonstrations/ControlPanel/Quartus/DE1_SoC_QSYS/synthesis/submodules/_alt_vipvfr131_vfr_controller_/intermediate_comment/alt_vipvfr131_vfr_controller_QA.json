It operates in a state machine with various states including IDLE, SENDING_ADDRESS, SENDING_SAMPLES, SENDING_WORDS, SENDING_TYPE, SENDING_GO_AND_ENABLE_INTERRUPT, and WAITING_END_FRAME. The module reads video packet data from two banks (bank0 and bank1), selects which bank to use based on the input signal 'next_bank,' and processes control packets with provided configuration for packet width, height, and whether the video is interlaced or not. The process flow involves setting up packet data such as base address, samples count, and words count per frame. Ultimately, the module outputs signals to control the video packet reading process, toggling between running and completed states based on the go_bit input and an interrupt receive signal."
