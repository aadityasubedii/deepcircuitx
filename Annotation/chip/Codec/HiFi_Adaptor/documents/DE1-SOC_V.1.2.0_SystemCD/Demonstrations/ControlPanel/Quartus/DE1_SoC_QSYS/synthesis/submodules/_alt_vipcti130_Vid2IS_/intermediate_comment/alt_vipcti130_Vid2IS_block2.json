    "block_comment": "This block defines a constant logical low signal for 'is_eop' (end of packet). It is implemented using a continuous assignment statement in Verilog, forcefully setting the 'is_eop' signal to 0, indicating the condition of the 'end of packet' is never met within the current context."
