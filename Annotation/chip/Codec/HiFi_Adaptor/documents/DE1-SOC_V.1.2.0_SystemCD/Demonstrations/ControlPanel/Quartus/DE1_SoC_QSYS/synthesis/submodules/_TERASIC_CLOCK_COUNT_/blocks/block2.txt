Comment: 
This block manages a clock counter, `clk1_cnt`, which is reset or incremented based on different triggers. When `trigger_send` is high, the counter is reset to 0, indicating a new cycle is starting. If not triggered by `trigger_send` but `counting_now` is high, the counter increments, tracking the number of `CLK_1` clock cycles. This dual-trigger mechanism allows for flexible counting based on external conditions.
