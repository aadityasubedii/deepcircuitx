Module name: AUDIO_DAC. Module specification: The AUDIO_DAC module interfaces with an audio Digital-to-Analog Converter, managing digital audio data conversion and ensuring proper signal timing for DAC operations. It accepts input ports including clk (clock signal for operations), reset (synchronous reset for initializing states), write (trigger for writing data), writedata (audio data to be written), clear (asynchronous clear for the FIFO buffer), bclk (bit clock signal for time intervals), and daclrc (distinguishes left and right audio channels). The output ports are full (indicates if the FIFO is full) and dacdat (outputs the converted digital bit stream). Internally, the module utilizes signals such as request_bit (flag for new bit processing), bit_to_dac (current output bit), bit_index (tracks bit position), dac_is_left (indicates left channel processing), data_to_dac (current audio data word), and shift_data_to_dac (holds data as it's shifted out). Moreover, it includes a block for a FIFO buffer managed by an `audio_fifo` instance handling data writes and reads based on the control signals, and logic blocks to handle bit-stream generation synchronized with the audio clock signals, ensuring the accurate timing and processing of audio data for playback.
