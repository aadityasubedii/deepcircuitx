    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/*\nThis module implements a configurable video scaler for SoC applications. It scales input video to a different resolution using a polyphase algorithm. The module consists of video input/output bridges, packet demux/mux, line buffer, scaler core, and scheduler. It processes video data through these components, applying scaling operations based on configured parameters. The design supports various input/output dimensions and scaling options, managed by a central scheduler for efficient data flow and processing.\n*/"
