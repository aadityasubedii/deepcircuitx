    "module": "Module-level comment: The alt_vipitc130_common_to_binary module converts a one-hot encoded input (`one_hot`) to a binary index (`binary`). It calculates binary representations for each potential mode using generated loops, then reorganizes and reduces these values to produce the binary output. Parameterized for varying vector sizes, it leverages nested generate constructs for efficient computation."
