It utilizes an internal IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic component to process IR signals. The module reads IR data, checks if new data is ready, and manages an interrupt signal (irq). If new data has become available, it sets the irq high. The irq is reset to low on writing through the SPI interface or during system resets. It facilitates communication by reading from and writing to external devices via a simple parallel interface. The operation is synchronized to the system clock and is active low reset sensitive, ensuring correct initialization and synchronization."
