    "block_comment": "This block configures parameters for a divider counter module responsible for managing color planes in a graphical system. The parameters specify the number of color planes, whether these planes are in parallel, a logarithmic scale of the number of color planes, a configuration for sequential to parallel conversion, and a preset value for defining operational bounds. The module's functionality hinges on these parameters to accurately process and handle multiple color planes, supporting system scalability and flexibility in graphical applications."
