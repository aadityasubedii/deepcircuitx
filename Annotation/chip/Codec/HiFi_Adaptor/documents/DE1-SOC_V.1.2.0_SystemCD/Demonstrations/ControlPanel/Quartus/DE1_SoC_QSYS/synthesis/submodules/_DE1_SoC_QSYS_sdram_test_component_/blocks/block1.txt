This block maps command codes to corresponding text codes. Using conditional assignments, the block checks the value of `cmd_code` and assigns a hexadecimal text code to `txt_code` based on the command. For each `cmd_code` from `3'h0` to `3'h7`, there is a specific `txt_code`, and if none of these match, `txt_code` defaults to `24'h424144`. This systematizes command representation into a uniform format for further processing or display.
