The block of code functions as an assignment operation that syncs the data output. Specifically, it assigns the value of 'data_out_sync1' to 'data_out', ensuring that the output data reflects the current state or value of 'data_out_sync1'. This direct assignment in Verilog represents a continuous assignment which is evaluated continuously as the right-hand-side value changes.
