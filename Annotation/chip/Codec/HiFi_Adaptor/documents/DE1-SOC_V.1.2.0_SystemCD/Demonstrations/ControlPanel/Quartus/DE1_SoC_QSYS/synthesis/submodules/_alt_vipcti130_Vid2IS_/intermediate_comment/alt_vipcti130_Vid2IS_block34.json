    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of `vid_datavalid_reg` to the signal `ap`. The implementation uses a straightforward continuous assignment statement, which means the value of `ap` will continuously reflect any changes in `vid_datavalid_reg` immediately when they occur. This can be useful in designs where `ap` acts as a status flag or a control signal that should directly follow another state or signal."
