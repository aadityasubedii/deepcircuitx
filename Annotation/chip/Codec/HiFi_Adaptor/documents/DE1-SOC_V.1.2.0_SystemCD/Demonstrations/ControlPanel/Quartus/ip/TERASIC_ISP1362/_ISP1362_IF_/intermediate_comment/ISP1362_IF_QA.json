It includes signal assignments for data transfer, control signals, and interrupts management between these entities. The module directs inout USB_DATA lines based on the chip select signals, provides corresponding read and write functionalities, and routes interrupts from the USB to the HC and DC. Additionally, it handles addressing for both controllers and ensures proper USB signaling based on controller-specific signals."
