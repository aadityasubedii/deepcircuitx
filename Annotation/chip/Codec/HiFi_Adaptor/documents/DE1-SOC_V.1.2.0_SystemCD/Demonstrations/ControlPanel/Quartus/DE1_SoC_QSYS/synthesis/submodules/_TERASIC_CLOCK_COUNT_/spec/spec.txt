Module name: TERASIC_CLOCK_COUNT. Module specification: The TERASIC_CLOCK_COUNT module is engineered to manage and count clock cycles from two external clock inputs, CLK_1 and CLK_2. It operates using an internal system clock (s_clk_in) and facilitates controlled counting based on specific commands. The input ports include s_clk_in (system clock), s_reset_in (reset signal), s_address_in (register address), s_read_in (read command), s_write_in (write command), s_writedata_in (input data for write operations), and the clock inputs CLK_1 and CLK_2. The output includes s_readdata_out, a 32-bit data port that conveys current counting status or cycle counts based on the read operations. Internally, the module employs several signals: counting_now (indicates active counting), cnt_down (countdown register), pre_counting_now (previous counting state), trigger_send (trigger for reset), and clk1_cnt/clk2_cnt (counters for CLK_1 and CLK_2). The code is structured into several blocks: a block handling the resetting, countdown and counting control based on user command (s_write_in); another for managing output data depending on read commands; and two more blocks, each responsible for counting cycles of CLK_1 and CLK_2, resetting counters whenever required. The entire functionality supports starting, stopping, and resetting counting processes, making it versatile for applications needing precise clock cycle tracking.
