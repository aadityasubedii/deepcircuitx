Comment: 
This block generates a synchronized enable signal. It uses a conditional assignment to decide whether to pass through a new enable value or retain the previous synchronized enable value based on the next state of `synced_int_nxt`. If `synced_int_nxt` is true, `enable` is assigned to `enable_synced`; otherwise, it retains the value of `enable_synced_reg`.
