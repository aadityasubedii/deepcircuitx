    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a synchronous data latch with an asynchronous reset. On every positive edge of the clock (clk) or negative edge of the reset (reset_n), the block operates: if reset_n is low, it clears the data stored in 'readdata' by setting it to 0. If the reset is not activated and the clock enable (clk_en) signal is high, it updates 'readdata' with the value from 'read_mux_out', zero-extended to 32 bits."
