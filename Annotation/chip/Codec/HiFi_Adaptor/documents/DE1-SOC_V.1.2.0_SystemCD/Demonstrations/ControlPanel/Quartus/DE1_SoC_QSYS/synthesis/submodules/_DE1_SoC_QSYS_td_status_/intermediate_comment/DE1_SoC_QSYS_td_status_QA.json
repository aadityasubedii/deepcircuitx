The module reads a 2-bit input from `in_port` and selectively outputs a 32-bit value based on the 2-bit `address` input. The output, `readdata`, will be either zero or the input value extended to 32 bits when `address` is zero. The main operations are gated by a clock signal `clk` and are responsive to a negative reset signal `reset_n`. When reset is active (low), the readdata is set to 0. When not in reset and clock is enabled, which is always set to 1 in this module, the output `readdata` updates based on the input `in_port` and the condition of the `address`. This module performs basic data forwarding and zero-extension based on a simple address check."

This signal is used to reset the internal state of the module, specifically setting the `readdata` output to zero when activated.\n\nOutput ports: [readdata].\nExplanation:\n- `readdata`: A 32-bit output that serves as the main data output of the module.

If `address` equals zero, `read_mux_out` will have the value of `data_in`; otherwise, it will be zero.
