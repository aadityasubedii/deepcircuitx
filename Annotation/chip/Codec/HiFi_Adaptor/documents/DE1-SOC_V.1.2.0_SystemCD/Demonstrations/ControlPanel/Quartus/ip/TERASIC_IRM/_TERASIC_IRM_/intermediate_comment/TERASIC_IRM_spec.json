    "spec": "Module name: TERASIC_IRM. Module specification: The TERASIC_IRM module facilitates interfacing with an infrared receiver important for handling data reception and processing via interrupts. The module receives incoming IR signals and uses an IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic component to decode them. Key inputs include 'clk' (system clock for synchronization), 'reset_n' (active-low system reset), 's_cs_n' (SPI communication control), 's_read' and 's_write' (SPI read and write controls), 's_writedata' (32-bit input data from SPI), and 'ir' (IR data input). It outputs 'irq' (interrupt request when new IR data is available) and 's_readdata' (32-bit output data from IR receiver). Internal signals 'data_ready' and 'pre_data_ready' manage data reception status and interrupt generation; 'data_ready' indicates availability of new IR data, while 'pre_data_ready' stores the previous state of 'data_ready' to detect new data arrivals. The IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic instance receives the IR data and controls, decoding it into a usable format and signaling when new data is ready. The module operation is conducted over two primary blocks: One handles the updating of the 'pre_data_ready' register based on the current 'data_ready' status and system reset conditions; the other manages the 'irq' signal based on 'data_ready' changes, ensuring that interrupts are correctly raised and cleared during SPI write operations or system resets.",

It utilizes an internal IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic component to process IR signals. The module reads IR data, checks if new data is ready, and manages an interrupt signal (irq). If new data has become available, it sets the irq high. The irq is reset to low on writing through the SPI interface or during system resets. It facilitates communication by reading from and writing to external devices via a simple parallel interface. The operation is synchronized to the system clock and is active low reset sensitive, ensuring correct initialization and synchronization."
