    "block_comment": "This block of code is assigning a constant value to a signal, `out_empty`. It equates `out_empty` to `1'b0`, which is a binary number with a single bit of value `0`. This is done using the `assign` keyword, implying that `out_empty` will always hold the value `0` throughout its usage in the design."
