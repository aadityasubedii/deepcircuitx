    "block_comment": "This block conditionally assigns a value to `read_temp[7:0]` based on `mask[0]`. If `mask[0]` is true, `read_temp[7:0]` is set to a high-impedance state (`8'bz`), otherwise it takes the value of `read_data[7:0]`. This functionality is used for controlled data bus isolation or tri-state bus management, enabling or disabling the output to prevent bus conflicts."
