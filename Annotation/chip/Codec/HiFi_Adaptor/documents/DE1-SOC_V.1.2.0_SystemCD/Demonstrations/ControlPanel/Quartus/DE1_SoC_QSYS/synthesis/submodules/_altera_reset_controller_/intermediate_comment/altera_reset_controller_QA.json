It supports combining several reset request signals and determining the overall system reset state. The parameters allow configuration for the number of reset inputs, specific behaviors like reset request handling, synchronization depth, and timings related to asserting or deasserting resets. The module generates outputs that are synchronized resets based on the logic defined in the code, considering the parameters set and the state of input reset signals and clock. This helps in managing the reset orchestration more reliably in complex FPGA or ASIC designs."

These inputs allow the module to monitor multiple reset signals and react accordingly.\n- `reset_req_in0` to `reset_req_in15` are optional reset request inputs. These are used to signal a need for additional reset processing, based on certain conditions specific to the use case. The usage of these signals is optional and controlled by module parameters (`USE_RESET_REQUEST_INx`).\n- `clk` is the clock input for the module. It is used to drive the synchronization of reset signals so that the output reset signals are phase-aligned or adapted to the clock domain in which they will be active.\n\nOutput ports: \n- reset_out, \n- reset_req.\n\nExplanation: \n- `reset_out` is the output reset signal that results from synchronized and optionally combined multiple input reset signals. It is to be connected to other parts of the system that require a clean, debounced, and synchronized reset signal.\n- `reset_req` is the output reset request signal which conditionally behaves based on internal module logic involving input reset requests and sync conditions. This output signal can be used to trigger specific reset related actions or alerts in the system, depending on the design requirements."
