This Verilog block is designed to manage edge capture functionality, specifically resetting or setting an edge capture flag based on various conditions. On the negative edge of a reset signal (reset_n), or a positive clock edge (clk), the block checks if the system is undergoing reset using `reset_n`; if true, the edge capture register `edge_capture[0]` is cleared. When not resetting, and if clock enable (`clk_en`) is active, it checks for a write strobe (`edge_capture_wr_strobe`); if present, `edge_capture[0]` is reset. If the write strobe is not active but an edge is detected on `edge_detect[0]`, then `edge_capture[0]` is set.
