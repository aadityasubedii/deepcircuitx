It operates as a state machine with three main states: IDLE, GUIDANCE, and DATAREAD. Initially, the module waits in the IDLE state until a signal below a specified duration threshold is detected, subsequently moving to the GUIDANCE state to confirm the signal pattern. If the guidance pattern is correct, it transitions to the DATAREAD state, where it reads and processes the incoming data bits based on their duration and stores them. Finally, it checks if the received data matches expected patterns (using a checksum mechanism), and if correct, forwards the data. The module uses various counters to track time durations and ensure accurate signal processing. Outputs include a data ready signal and the processed data itself."
