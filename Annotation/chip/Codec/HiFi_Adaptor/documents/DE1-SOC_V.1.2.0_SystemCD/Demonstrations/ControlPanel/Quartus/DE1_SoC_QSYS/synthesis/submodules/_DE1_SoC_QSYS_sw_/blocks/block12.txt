This block of Verilog code manages the edge capture mechanism for a signal. On a positive clock edge or negative reset, it checks if the system is under reset; if true, it clears the first bit of the `edge_capture` register. Otherwise, it checks if the clock enable (`clk_en`) is high. Within this condition, if the `edge_capture_wr_strobe` signal is active, it again clears the `edge_capture[0]`. But if an edge detection (`edge_detect[0]`) occurs, it sets `edge_capture[0]` to all ones. This implementation helps in capturing and acknowledging edge-triggered events efficiently.
