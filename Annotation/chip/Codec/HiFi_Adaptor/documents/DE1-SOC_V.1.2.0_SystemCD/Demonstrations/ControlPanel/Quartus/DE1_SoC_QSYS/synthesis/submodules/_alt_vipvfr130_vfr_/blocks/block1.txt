Comment: 
This block of Verilog code initializes an instance of the `alt_vipvfr130_common_stream_output` module to manage data streaming. It is parameterized with a data width specified by `DATA_WIDTH`. Within the block, signals for clock (`clk`), reset (`rst`), data outputs, and flow control (`dout_ready`, `dout_valid`, etc.) are connected to corresponding inputs and outputs of the module. Special control signals like `dout_sop` (start of packet) and `dout_eop` (end of packet) manage packet boundaries. Internally, the module interfaces with an encoder through signals prefixed with `FROM_encoder_TO_outputter` and `FROM_outputter_TO_encoder`, which helps in coordinating the data flow between these components. The `enable` signal is set to always on, which suggests continuous operation.
