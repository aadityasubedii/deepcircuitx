Module name: alt_vipcti130_common_sample_counter.

Module specification: The alt_vipcti130_common_sample_counter is a Verilog module designed to count sample cycles based on input signals and the configuration of the number of color planes. It handles both single and multiple color plane arrangements differently using conditional generation blocks. The input ports include 'rst' (a reset signal that initializes the state), 'clk' (the clock signal guiding the module's operation), 'sclr' (a synchronous clear that resets counters following the clock's edge), 'count_cycle' (signal indicating a cycle to be counted), and 'hd_sdn' (which affects counting when high definition shutdown is active). The output ports are 'count_sample' (indicating a sample count based on conditions), 'start_of_sample' (marking the beginning of a new sample), and 'sample_ticks' (showing the number of cycles per sample based on the number of color planes and defined by LOG2_NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES bits width). Internally, the module uses 'count_valids' (a register that counts valid cycles and triggers a new sample start when it reaches a threshold determined by the number of color planes) and 'new_sample' (a wire determining when to start a new sample based on the 'count_valids' comparison). For a single color plane, it outputs the 'count_cycle' directly as 'count_sample' and marks every cycle as a new sample, with 'sample_ticks' output reset to zero. For multiple color planes, logic includes conditions based on 'hd_sdn', manages counting cycles, and determines when to start a new sample based on 'count_valids'. This module adapts to configurations through parameters like the NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES, COLOUR_PLANES_ARE_IN_PARALLEL, and LOG2_NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES, which influence the operations within conditional blocks.
