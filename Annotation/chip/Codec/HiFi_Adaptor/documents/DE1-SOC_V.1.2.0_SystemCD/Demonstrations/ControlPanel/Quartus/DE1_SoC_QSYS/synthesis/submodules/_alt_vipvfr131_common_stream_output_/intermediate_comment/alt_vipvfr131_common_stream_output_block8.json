    "block_comment": "This block generates an end-of-packet (EOP) signal. It implements this by using a logical AND operation between the `dout_valid` and `dout_eop` signals, producing the `eop` signal when both conditions are simultaneously true, indicating the current data output represents the end of a packet."
