Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_mm_interconnect_1. Module specification: This module is an interconnect or bus matrix for a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, managing communication between multiple masters (ALT_VIP_VFB read and write masters) and a slave (SDRAM). It features input ports for clock, reset, and master interfaces, and output ports for slave interfaces. The module uses internal signals for address routing, command/response demultiplexing, width adaptation, and burst adaptation. Key components include Avalon Universal Master/Slave translators, address routers, command and response crossbars, width adapters, and burst adapters. These components work together to handle data transfers, arbitration, and protocol conversions between different SoC components, allowing efficient communication despite differences in bus widths, protocols, or timing requirements. The module employs various
