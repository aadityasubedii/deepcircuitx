    "block_comment": "The block instantiates an IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic module for processing infrared data signals. It handles the initialization and operational control using input clock (clk) and reset (reset_n) signals. Additionally, the module receives IR data signals through the 'ir' input and outputs the status of the data readiness and the processed data through 'data_ready' and 'writedata', respectively. This setup facilitates the reception and readiness verification of IR data in a system."
