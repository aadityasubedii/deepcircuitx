Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_ledr. 
Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_ledr is a Verilog module designed for controlling a 10-bit output port, typically used to drive LEDs. It features input ports including a 2-bit `address` for selecting operational registers, a `chipselect` for enabling module response, a system `clk` for synchronization, `reset_n` as an active-low reset, `write_n` as an active-low write enable, and a 32-bit `writedata` where only the lower 10 bits are utilized. The output ports are `out_port`, representing a 10-bit direct mirror of the internal `data_out` register reflecting LED states, and `readdata`, a 32-bit output enabling external verification of `data_out` contents. Internally, the module employs `clk_en` permanently set high indicating potential future functionality expansion, `data_out` as a 10-bit register storing LED data conditions, and `read_mux_out` for routing `data_out` to `readdata` based on the `address`. The operations within the module are divided into data processing on every positive clock edge or negative reset edge to handle reset and data writing to `data_out` conditional on chip select, write enable, and the address. Additionally, data multiplexing is managed by `read_mux_out` and overall data output control via consistent updates to `out_port` and `readdata`.
