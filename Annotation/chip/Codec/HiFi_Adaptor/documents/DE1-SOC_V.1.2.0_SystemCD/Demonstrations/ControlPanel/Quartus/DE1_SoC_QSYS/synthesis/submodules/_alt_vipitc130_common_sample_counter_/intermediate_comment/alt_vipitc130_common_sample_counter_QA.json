It handles different scenarios based on whether there is a single colour plane or multiple. For a single colour plane, it outputs constant values indicating each cycle is a sample and there are no ticks between samples. For multiple colour planes, it incorporates a more complex logic using a register to accumulate valid counts and decides when a new sample is initiated based on these counts. The output signals, `count_sample`, `start_of_sample`, and `sample_ticks`, provide information about the sampling state, whether a new sample has started, and the number of ticks in the current sample, respectively. The module's behavior can also adjust based on whether signal `hd_sdn` is asserted, modifying how it counts samples and recognizes the start of a sample. Additionally, the module responds and initializes on system reset or can be cleared with an active clear signal."

Its behavior can change based on the status of `hd_sdn`.\n- `start_of_sample`: Outputs a signal indicating the start of a new sample, which can be continuously `high` if there is only one colour plane or determined by the counting mechanism for multiple colour planes.\n- `sample_ticks`: Outputs the count of ticks (cycles) that have been counted within the current sample.

It essentially checks if the `count_valids` register has reached its limit, which indicates all planes have been sampled, and thus, a new sample can start.
