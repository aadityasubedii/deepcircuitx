This block forms part of a packetization process, specifically for handling packet headers. It assigns the start and end markers of a packet (start and end of packet signals) to the upper bits of the input payload. This is implemented by concatenating `in_startofpacket` and `in_endofpacket` and assigning them to the specified slice of `in_payload`, which spans from `DATA_WIDTH` to `DATA_WIDTH + PACKET_WIDTH - 1`.
