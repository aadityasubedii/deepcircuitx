Comment: 
This Verilog code assigns the value from `out_data_buffer` to `out_data`. This is a simple data transfer operation where the content of the buffer `out_data_buffer` is moved to the output data signal `out_data`, effectively updating `out_data` with the buffered value. This assignment ensures that `out_data` carries the latest value stored in `out_data_buffer`, and it happens continuously as the statement is combinational.
