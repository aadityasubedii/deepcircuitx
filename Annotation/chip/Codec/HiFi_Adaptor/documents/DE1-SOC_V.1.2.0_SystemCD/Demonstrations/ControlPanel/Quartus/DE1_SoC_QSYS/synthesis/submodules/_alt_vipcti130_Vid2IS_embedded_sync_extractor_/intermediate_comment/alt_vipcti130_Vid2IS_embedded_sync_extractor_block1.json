    "block_comment": "This Verilog block implements a video data processing and ancillary (ANC) state control mechanism. The block initializes video data registers, delay counters, and state variables to default values upon reset. During normal operation, it buffers incoming video data and updates horizontal, vertical, and frame delays based on `vid_enable`. Moreover, the block manages an ANC state machine that transitions between states like `ANC_IDLE`, `ANC_DATA_FLAG_x`, `ANC_DID`, `ANC_SID`, and `ANC_USER_WORDS`, manipulating data count and state transitions based on `anc_nxt`, video sync signals, and embedded control conditions. The state machine orchestrates the handling of ancillary data within video streams, conditioned by `vid_locked` and `GENERATE_ANC` parameters."
