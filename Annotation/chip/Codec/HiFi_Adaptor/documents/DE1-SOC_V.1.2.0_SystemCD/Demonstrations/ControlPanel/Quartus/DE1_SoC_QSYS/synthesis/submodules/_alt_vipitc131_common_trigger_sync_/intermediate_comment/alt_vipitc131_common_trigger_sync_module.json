    "module": "Module-level comment: The alt_vipitc131_common_trigger_sync module synchronizes a trigger signal across different clock domains. If clocks are identical (`CLOCKS_ARE_SAME`=1), the output (`trigger_out`) directly mirrors the input (`trigger_in`). Otherwise, it employs a toggle-based synchronization, leveraging internal signal registers and a sub-module synchronization to ensure precise cross-domain signal integrity. This results in `trigger_out` being a synchronized, stable version of the trigger input signal."
