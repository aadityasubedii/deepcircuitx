Module-level comment: The TERASIC_IR_RX_FIFO module interfaces with an IR receiver, managing data via a FIFO buffer. It processes IR signals, stores data, and supports controlled data access with read/write operations. The module uses input signals for control and synchronization, output for data and interrupts, and internal signals for FIFO and data flow management. Key components include signal edge detection, FIFO control, and data transfer mechanisms facilitated by sub-modules for efficient data buffering and IR data processing.
