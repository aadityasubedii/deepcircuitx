Comment: 
This block of Verilog code is responsible for generating a signal named `update_sample`. The signal is determined by a logical AND operation between two other signals: `update_active_sample` and `update_total_sample`. This implementation ensures that `update_sample` is asserted (set to high) only when both input signals are simultaneously asserted.
