Module-level comment: The SEG7_IF module interfaces with a 7-segment display, handling read, write, and reset operations. It includes input controls for address selection, data writing, or reading, and resetting. Internally, it uses index calculations and registers to process and store segment state data, which is then directed to output ports managing the display state. Logic blocks respond to clock signals ensuring synchronized operations.
