Comment: 
This block conditionally assigns a value to `usedw_output` based on the `USED_WORDS_WIDTH`. If `USED_WORDS_WIDTH` is 16 or higher, it assigns the lower 16 bits of `usedw` to `usedw_output`. This implementation effectively truncates or selects a subset of `usedw` when the condition is met, ensuring `usedw_output` always holds a maximum of 16 bits of data.
