Module name: SEG7_IF.

Module specification: The SEG7_IF module serves as an interface to a seven-segment display controller, facilitating data exchange between system memory and the display segments. The input ports include `s_clk` (system clock), `s_address` (address of the segment), `s_read` (enables read operation), `s_writedata` (data to be written to a segment), `s_write` (enables write operation), and `s_reset` (initializes segments to a default state). The output ports are `s_readdata` (carries data read from a segment), and `SEG7` (sends data to the 7-segment display respecting the LOW_ACTIVE parameter). Internal signals comprise `base_index` (calculates the start index in the segment data array), `write_data` and `read_data` (temporary storage during write and read operations), and `reg_file` (a register array storing the state of each segment bit). The code structure features conditions within the negedge triggered always block to handle reset, write, and read operations, adjusting `reg_file` as necessary. Outputs are managed using assignments, with `SEG7` reflecting the negation of `reg_file` if LOW_ACTIVE is true, and `s_readdata` assigned from the `read_data` signal. This architecture ensures synchronized, accurate control and data flow between the system's memory bus and the physical display elements in compliance with operational signals and configurations.
