Module name: alt_vipvfr130_common_unpack_data. 
Module specification: The `alt_vipvfr130_common_unpack_data` module processes and adapts an input data stream of varying bit-width (`DATA_WIDTH_IN`) into an output stream with a specified different width (`DATA_WIDTH_OUT`). It operates within a system defined by a `clock` and `reset` signal for synchronization and resetting, respectively. The module takes `data_in`, which is the data to be processed. It deals with flow control through `stall_in` and `stall_out` signals; the `stall_in` pauses reading new data, whereas `stall_out` manages the module's data output flow. The `clear` signal is used to reset or discard the data under specific conditions. The core outputs are `read`, which signals when the module wants to ingest new input data, `write`, which manages the data output readiness, and `data_out`, which is the adapted output data stream. Internally, `need_input` and `ena` signals control data flow based on stall conditions and data availability; `need_input` directs the reading operations, and `ena` is activated when there is no input stall. In the module, an instantiation of the `alt_vipvfr130_common_pulling_width_adapter` submodule adapts the input data width to the output data width, manages the interface logic for pulling and discarding data using control signals like `pull`, `pull_en`, `discard`, and `discard_en`, and operates based on the clock and enable conditions managed by `ena`. An always block handles the logic for the `write` signal, ensuring it is properly reset and managed according to the `stall_out` condition and `ena` status. This module provides an essential functionality in systems requiring dynamic data width adaptation and flow control management.
