    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipcti130_common_frame_counter. \nModule specification: The `alt_vipcti130_common_frame_counter` is a Verilog module designed to handle frame counting for video processing applications, specifically managing pixel sample counts within video frames. The module takes as input signals `rst` (reset), `clk` (clock), `sclr` (synchronous clear), `enable`, `hd_sdn` (horizontally disable counting under certain conditions), `h_total` (total horizontal count), `v_total` (total vertical count), `h_reset`, and `v_reset`. Its outputs include `new_line` (indicating the start of a new line within a video frame), `start_of_sample` (indicating the commencement of a pixel sample), `sample_ticks` (ticks within each sample period), and the current counts `h_count` (horizontal) and `v_count` (vertical). Internal signals such as `count_sample`, `h_total_int`, and `v_total_int` are crucial for adjusting the counts based on configuration and facilitating interaction with a submodule `alt_vipcti130_common_sample_counter` that manages detailed sample counting logic. The logic blocks within the module handle initialization and synchronous resets, conditionally modify total count parameters, and manage count updates during each clock cycle based on various conditions, including the end of line and frame boundaries. Additionally, the `sample_counter` submodule is instantiated and parameterized within this main module, closely integrating its functionality to optimize count management per video frame specifications.",

It uses input signals like reset (rst), clock (clk), and enable signals to control the counting process. The module interfaces with a sample counter submodule (`alt_vipcti130_common_sample_counter`) for managing how pixel samples are counted. The parameters and additional logic handle different configurations, such as the number of color planes and whether totals are decreased by one. It properly resets counts based on horizontal (h_reset) and vertical (v_reset) reset values and generates signals indicating the start of a new line and sample point in the video stream."

This signal plays a critical role in controlling when the horizontal count (`h_count`) is incremented.\n\n- `h_total_int`: An internal representation of the total horizontal counts, which can be modified based on the `TOTALS_MINUS_ONE` parameter. It's used to determine when to reset the horizontal count (`h_count`) and to signal the start of a new video line (`new_line`). If `TOTALS_MINUS_ONE` is true, it uses the raw `h_total` input, otherwise, it subtracts one from `h_total`.\n\n- `v_total_int`: Similar to `h_total_int`, this signal represents the modified version of total vertical counts (`v_total`), conditioned by the `TOTALS_MINUS_ONE` parameter. It determines when to reset the vertical count (`v_count`). Like with horizontal counts, if `TOTALS_MINUS_ONE` is true, it uses the raw `v_total` input; otherwise, it subtracts one from `v_total`.
