    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk module interfaces with JTAG for CPU debug via synchronized signals. It handles debug commands by evaluating JTAG's instruction (`ir_in`) and status (`sr`) inputs to control outputs like breaks and memory access. Internal signals insure operations' timing and correct sequence, featuring synchronizers for stabilizing inputs and combinational logic for output control based on updated states and commands."
