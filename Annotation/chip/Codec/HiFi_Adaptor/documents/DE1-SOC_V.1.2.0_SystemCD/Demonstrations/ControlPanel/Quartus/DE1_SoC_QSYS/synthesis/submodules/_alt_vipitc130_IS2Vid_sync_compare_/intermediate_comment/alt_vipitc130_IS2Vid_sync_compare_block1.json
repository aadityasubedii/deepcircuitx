    "block_comment": "This block implements a state machine for managing synchronization between CVI and CVO signals. The state transitions are determined based on the current state and the status of sof_cvi_int and sof_cvo_int signals, with three possible states: SC_CVI, SC_CVO, and IDLE (default). The block uses a case statement to define the transition logic for each state, updating the next_state variable accordingly."
