Comment: 
This Verilog block manages the signal `trigger_send` based on a clock or reset input. On a positive edge of `s_reset_in`, `trigger_send` is reset to 0. If a transition from not currently counting (`pre_counting_now`) to currently counting (`counting_now`) is detected, `trigger_send` is set to 1; otherwise, it remains 0. This logic ensures `trigger_send` is activated only at the start of a counting phase, following any reset.
