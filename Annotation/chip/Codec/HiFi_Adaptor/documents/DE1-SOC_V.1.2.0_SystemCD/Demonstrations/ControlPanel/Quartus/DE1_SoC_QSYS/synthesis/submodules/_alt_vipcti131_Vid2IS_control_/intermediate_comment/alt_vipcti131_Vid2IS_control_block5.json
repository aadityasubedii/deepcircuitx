    "block_comment": "This block serves as a reset or parameter update mechanism for a video signal processing module. Upon reset, it initializes video parameters such as stability, interlacing, active pixel count, and lines per field to predefined or zero values. If the block is not in a reset state, it conditionally updates these parameters based on the `is_update` signal, copying new values from corresponding input signals, or maintaining the current state if there is no update."
