    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code assigns a slice of an input payload to the value of the input channel width. The extracted slice ranges from index (DATA_WIDTH + PACKET_WIDTH) to index (DATA_WIDTH + PACKET_WIDTH + PCHANNEL_W - 1) inclusive. This operation is akin to packing part of the payload data with the size of PCHANNEL_W into the broader payload structure, specifically placed after the packet and data portions."
