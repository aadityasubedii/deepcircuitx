    "block_comment": "This block implements a synchronization and genlock control system for video processing. It manages horizontal and vertical counters, state transitions, and synchronization flags based on reset, clock, and input signals. The implementation includes logic for handling reset conditions, state transitions, synchronization of lines and samples, and genlock status updates, with multiple stages of pipelining to improve timing and stability."
