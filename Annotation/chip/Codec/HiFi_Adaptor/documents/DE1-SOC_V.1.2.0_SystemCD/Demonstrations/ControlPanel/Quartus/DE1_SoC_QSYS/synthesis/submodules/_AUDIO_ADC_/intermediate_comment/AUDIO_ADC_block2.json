    "block_comment": "This block manages data capturing and buffering for an ADC system using a bit-indexing method. Upon a positive `bclk` edge, if a reset or clear condition is detected, it initializes registers and disables write and validity flags. If no reset, it toggles off `adcfifo_write` if previously set, and resets registers if the channel changed, marking validity and setting a wait flag. It then processes serial ADC data into a buffer per bit, and on certain conditions, writes to ADC FIFO unless full, managing data integrity and flow."
