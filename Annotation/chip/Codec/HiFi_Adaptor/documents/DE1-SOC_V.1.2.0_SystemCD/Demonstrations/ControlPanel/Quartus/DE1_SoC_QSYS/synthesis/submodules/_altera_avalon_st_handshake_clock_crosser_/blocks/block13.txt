This block of code is responsible for defining the in_payload value related to empty packet data. More specifically, it uses a Verilog assign statement to set a portion of the in_payload bit vector (from indices DATA_WIDTH + PACKET_WIDTH + PCHANNEL_W to DATA_WIDTH + PACKET_WIDTH + PCHANNEL_W + EMPTY_WIDTH - 1) equal to in_empty value, effectively mapping the 'empty' packet data into the correct segment of the larger payload data structure.
