This block extracts a specific segment of data from a register array for video packet sample bits transfer from a slave to a controller. It utilizes bit slicing to select the section of the `registers` array correspondingly defined by multiplying `SLAVE_DATA_REQUIREDWIDTH` with 10 and adding its range to extract the exact bit width needed. This selected slice represents the video packet samples being transferred to the controller from the slave bank1.
