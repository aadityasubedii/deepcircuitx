    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_wrapper.\n\nModule specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_wrapper is designed for integrating various JTAG debugging functionalities associated with a CPU within the DE1-SoC system architecture. It handles multiple signals related to CPU debugging, such as breakpoints, trace memory controls, and the JTAG test access port (TAP) control signals. Specifically, the module processes 32-bit data registers with inputs like MonDReg and break_readreg, and a clk signal to coordinate operations across the debug platform. Other critical inputs include status and control signals like debugack, monitor_error, and tracemem_on amongst others. Outputs from the module cater to different actions on the JTAG interface, such as enabling/disabling breakpoints or controlling trace memory and OCI memory actions. Internally, the module uses signals like vji_cdr for capturing data in JTAG's Data Register and vji_sdr for shifting data within this register. The internal setup spans multiple components; one prominently handles the test clock settings, and another segment is responsible for breaking mechanisms and managing OCI and trace memories based on input states. Each block is connected through synthesized JTAG control and status signals, ensuring the module operates consistently within its expected parameters for efficient debug and monitoring operations.",

Specifically, the module processes 32-bit data registers with inputs like MonDReg and break_readreg, and a clk signal to coordinate operations across the debug platform. Other critical inputs include status and control signals like debugack, monitor_error, and tracemem_on amongst others. Outputs from the module cater to different actions on the JTAG interface, such as enabling/disabling breakpoints or controlling trace memory and OCI memory actions. Internally, the module uses signals like vji_cdr for capturing data in JTAG's Data Register and vji_sdr for shifting data within this register. The internal setup spans multiple components; one prominently handles the test clock settings, and another segment is responsible for breaking mechanisms and managing OCI and trace memories based on input states. Each block is connected through synthesized JTAG control and status signals, ensuring the module operates consistently within its expected parameters for efficient debug and monitoring operations."

It takes in numerous signals related to debugging (like breakpoints, monitor states, and trace memory controls) and manages several actions such as data observation and control through JTAG debug interactions. The module provides outputs that can dictate actions such as breaking or continuing CPU processing and accessing or controlling trace memory, which are essential for debugging purposes. It interfaces internally with sub-modules tailored for specific debugging tasks within the JTAG environment, ensuring proper synchronization and functionality during debug operations."

It handles multiple signals related to CPU debugging, such as breakpoints, trace memory controls, and the JTAG test access port (TAP) control signals. Specifically, the module processes 32-bit data registers with inputs like MonDReg and break_readreg, and a clk signal to coordinate operations across the debug platform. Other critical inputs include status and control signals like debugack, monitor_error, and tracemem_on amongst others. Outputs from the module cater to different actions on the JTAG interface, such as enabling/disabling breakpoints or controlling trace memory and OCI memory actions. Internally, the module uses signals like vji_cdr for capturing data in JTAG's Data Register and vji_sdr for shifting data within this register. The internal setup spans multiple components; one prominently handles the test clock settings, and another segment is responsible for breaking mechanisms and managing OCI and trace memories based on input states. Each block is connected through synthesized JTAG control and status signals, ensuring the module operates consistently within its expected parameters for efficient debug and monitoring operations."
