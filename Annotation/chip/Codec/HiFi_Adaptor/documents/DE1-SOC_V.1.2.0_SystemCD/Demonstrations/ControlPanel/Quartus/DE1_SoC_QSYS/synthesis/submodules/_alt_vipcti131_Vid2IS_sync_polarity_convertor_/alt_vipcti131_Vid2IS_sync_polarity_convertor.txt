Module-level comment: This Verilog module, alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_sync_polarity_convertor, dynamically inverts the sync signal (`sync_in`) based on the data validity (`datavalid`). It detects negative edges of `datavalid`, using them to conditionally invert `sync_in` each clock cycle, thus driving `sync_out`. Internal registers and combinational logic manage inversion decisions and output computation, ensuring responsive and stable signal adjustments.
