Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll_sys.  
Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll_sys module is designed for creating multiple synchronized output clocks from a single reference clock input using an instantiated `altera_pll` configurable PLL block tailored for Altera/Intel platforms. The module takes two input ports: `refclk`, the reference clock whose frequency serves as the baseline for generating the output clocks, and `rst`, which resets the PLL to a known state when activated. It provides five output clocks (`outclk_0` to `outclk_4`), each with configurable frequency, phase shift, and duty cycle, alongside an additional output `locked` that indicates the PLL's locking status. Internally, the module lacks user-defined signals, as it directly maps input signals to output through the `altera_pll` instantiation, which handles all configuration internally. The primary block in the code is the `altera_pll` instantiation, where the PLL's operational parameters like number of clocks, frequency, phase, and duty are defined for each output. This setup is critical for applications requiring precise timing and frequency control across multiple components or systems.
