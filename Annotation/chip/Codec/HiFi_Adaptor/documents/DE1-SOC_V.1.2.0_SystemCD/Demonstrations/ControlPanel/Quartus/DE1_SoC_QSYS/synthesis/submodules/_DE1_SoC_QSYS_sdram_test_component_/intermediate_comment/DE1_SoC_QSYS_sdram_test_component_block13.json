    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of `read_data` to `mem_bytes`. The assignment uses a continuous assignment statement in Verilog (`assign`), which means `mem_bytes` will always be equal to `read_data` whenever `read_data` changes, ensuring real-time updates to `mem_bytes` based on the value of `read_data`."
