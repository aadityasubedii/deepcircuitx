Module name: alt_vipcti130_Vid2IS_resolution_detection.

Module specification: The alt_vipcti130_Vid2IS_resolution_detection module is designed to detect the resolution of video input signals by analyzing active video samples and lines per video frame. The module uses input ports including rst (reset), clk (clock), count_cycle (valid video cycle for counting samples), ap (active video signal), hd_sdn (high-definition shutdown), start_new_line, start_new_field, end_of_vsync, f (field indicator), and vid_locked (video signal stability indicator). The outputs include update (signal update indicator), interlaced (video interlace status), active_sample_count, active_line_count_f0, active_line_count_f1, total_sample_count, total_line_count_f0, total_line_count_f1, total_line_count, stable (stability status), resolution_valid, and resolution_change (resolution change indication). Key internal signals like count_sample (conditioned count_cycle), ap_plus_1 (active pixel and counting condition), and end_of_active_line (end of active video line) among others help in the internal computation of sample and line counts. The module comprises several blocks, including instantiation of a common sample counter, signal assignments for line and field management, and always blocks handling dynamic updates of counts and status outputs. There are detailed checks and balances for video signal stability, resolution validation, and interlace detection to ensure accurate resolution output as expected for downstream processing tasks in video systems.
