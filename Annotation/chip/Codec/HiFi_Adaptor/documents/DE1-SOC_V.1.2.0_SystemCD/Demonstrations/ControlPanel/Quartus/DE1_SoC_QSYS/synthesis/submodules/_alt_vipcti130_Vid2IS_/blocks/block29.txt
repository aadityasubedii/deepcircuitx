Comment: 
This block calculates the next state of an overflow signal for a FIFO or similar data structure. It combines the current write request signal (`wrreq`) or the previous overflow state (`overflow_reg`) with the full status (`full`), indicating that an overflow condition should persist or initiate when the structure is full and a write is attempted.
