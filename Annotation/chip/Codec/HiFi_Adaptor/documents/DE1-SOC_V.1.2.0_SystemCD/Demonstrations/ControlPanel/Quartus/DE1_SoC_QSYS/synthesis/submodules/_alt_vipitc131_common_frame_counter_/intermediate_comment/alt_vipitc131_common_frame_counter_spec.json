    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipitc131_common_frame_counter.\n\nModule specification: The 'alt_vipitc131_common_frame_counter' is a Verilog module designed primarily for video processing applications where it functions as a frame counter, managing both horizontal (`h_count`) and vertical (`v_count`) position tracking in a video frame. Its operation is conditioned on input signals including `rst` for resetting all counters, `clk` as the clock signal, `sclr` for clearing counter values, an `enable` signal to manage the counting operation, and `hd_sdn` which modulates the horizontal count based on a sampling condition; `h_total` and `v_total` determine the total horizontal pixels and vertical lines, respectively, while `h_reset` and `v_reset` provide reset values. Output ports include `new_line` indicating the start of a new line, `start_of_sample` triggered by a submodule, and `sample_ticks` reflecting the tick count per color plane. The module also contains `h_count` and `v_count` which indicate the current position in the frame. Internally, the module uses `count_sample`, `h_total_int`, and `v_total_int` signals to help dictate frame and sampling timing; for example, `h_total_int` and `v_total_int` can adjust their values based on the parameter `TOTALS_MINUS_ONE` to offset by one. The module also makes use of the `alt_vipitc131_common_sample_counter` submodule for detailed sample counting and timing, tailored via parameters like `NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES` and `LOG2_NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES`. Key sections in the code include parameter definitions for customization, instantiation of the `sample_counter` submodule, conditional assignments for internal signals using the `generate` block, and sequential logic to manage and update counts triggered by the clock and reset signals. Together, these features enable the module to efficiently track and manage frames and sample timings within video processing applications.",

It counts the horizontal (`h_count`) and vertical (`v_count`) positions within a video frame based on various inputs such as `enable`, `h_total`, `v_total`, `h_reset` and `v_reset`. Additionally, it interfaces with a submodule `sample_counter` to manage color plane sample timings (`sample_ticks`) and the triggering of a new sample (`start_of_sample`). The parameters allow for customization related to the number and handling of color planes. The module is capable of handling frame size specifications directly or adjusted by one through the `TOTALS_MINUS_ONE` parameter. It uses synchronous resets and can clear counts based on `sclr`, and adjusts counts when encountering horizontal end-of-line (`new_line`) and sampling conditions."

The value of `h_total_int` can either be directly the `h_total` input or adjusted by subtracting one, depending on the `TOTALS_MINUS_ONE` parameter.\n- `v_total_int`: Similar to `h_total_int`, this signal represents the internal vertical total count, used to manage the vertical counting or `v_count`. It similarly can be assigned directly from `v_total` or adjusted based on the `TOTALS_MINUS_ONE` parameter.
