It transitions through various states based on incoming video data signals to manage the synchronization and processing requirements of received video packets. The state machine starts in the \"FIND_SOP\" state looking for the start of a packet (SOP). It then proceeds through states related to video width and height parameters, handles interlacing, synchronization of auxiliary data (ANC data), and processes different modes based on data values and synchronization status. It dynamically adjusts its state transitions based on parameters and external conditions such as valid data requests, synchronization loss, and video vertical signals. This allows it to robustly manage video streams, ensuring that data is processed correctly and in synchronization with external controls."

It is crucial for the state machine to synchronize and start processing a new data stream.\n- vid_v_nxt: This signal is indicative of a vertical timing reference in the video data, used primarily in synchronization and managing transitions when handling ancillary data.\n- anc_datavalid_nxt: Signal that indicates whether the incoming ancillary data is valid, contributing to decision-making in states that handle ancillary data like WAIT_FOR_ANC and INSERT_ANC.\n- q_data: 4-bit input data used in various states to determine specific modes or actions based on its value.\n- sync_lost: Signal that indicates a loss of synchronization in the video stream, prompting the state machine to reset to the initial state to re-establish synchronization.\n- anc_underflow_nxt: Indicates an underflow condition in the ancillary data, affecting the handling of states related to ancillary data processing.\n- ap_synched: Signal to indicate that the processing path is synchronized, used to transition to states that assume synchronized processing.\n- enable_synced_nxt: Signal used to control transitions related to synchronization, specifically moving to WAIT_FOR_SYNCH state if not already synchronized.\n\nOutput ports: state_next, state.\nExplanation:\n- state_next: Represents the next state of the state machine based on the current state and input conditions.
