Module-level comment: This module implements a test bench for a CPU in a System-on-Chip design. It monitors various CPU signals, including register values, control signals, and memory access operations. The test bench performs error checking by detecting undefined ('x') values in critical signals, filters some input signals, and decodes instruction operations. It uses numerous input ports to receive CPU states and output ports to provide filtered signals and test completion status. The module employs always blocks for signal monitoring and error reporting, ensuring proper CPU behavior during simulation.
