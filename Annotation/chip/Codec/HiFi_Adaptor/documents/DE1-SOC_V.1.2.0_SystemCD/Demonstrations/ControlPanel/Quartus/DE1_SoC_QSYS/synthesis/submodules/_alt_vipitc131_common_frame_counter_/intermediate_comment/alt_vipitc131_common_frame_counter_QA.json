It counts the horizontal (`h_count`) and vertical (`v_count`) positions within a video frame based on various inputs such as `enable`, `h_total`, `v_total`, `h_reset` and `v_reset`. Additionally, it interfaces with a submodule `sample_counter` to manage color plane sample timings (`sample_ticks`) and the triggering of a new sample (`start_of_sample`). The parameters allow for customization related to the number and handling of color planes. The module is capable of handling frame size specifications directly or adjusted by one through the `TOTALS_MINUS_ONE` parameter. It uses synchronous resets and can clear counts based on `sclr`, and adjusts counts when encountering horizontal end-of-line (`new_line`) and sampling conditions."
