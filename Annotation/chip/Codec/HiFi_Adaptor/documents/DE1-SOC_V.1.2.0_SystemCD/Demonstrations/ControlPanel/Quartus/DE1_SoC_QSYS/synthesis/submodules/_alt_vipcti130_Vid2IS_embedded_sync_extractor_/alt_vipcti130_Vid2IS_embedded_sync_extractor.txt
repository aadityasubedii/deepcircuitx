Module-level comment: The alt_vipcti130_Vid2IS_embedded_sync_extractor module extracts sync signals (frame, horizontal, vertical) from video streams with embedded syncs, supporting SD and HD formats. It processes input video data based on control signals like vid_enable and vid_hd_sdn, utilizing internal state machines and data shift registers to handle ancillary data parsing and sync extraction efficiently. This design ensures precise sync signal output and reliable video data validation for video processing applications.
