    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"ir_fifo\" module implements a dual-clock FIFO buffer for data synchronization between different clock domains using a \"dcfifo_component\" specific to Cyclone V. It manages read/write operations with inputs aclr, data, rdclk, rdreq, wrclk, wrreq and outputs q, rdempty, rdusedw, wrfull. Internal wires sub_wire0 to sub_wire3 link component statuses and data outputs to external ports, ensuring reliable data flow and state monitoring in asynchronous systems."
