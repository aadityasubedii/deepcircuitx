Module name: `alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_resolution_detection`.
Module specification: The `alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_resolution_detection` module detects video resolution for potentially interlaced video streams by analyzing the count of active and total samples and lines across fields. It operates on input signals such as a reset (`rst`), a clock signal (`clk`), counting enable (`count_cycle`), and several others related to video stream processing like active picture detection (`ap`), horizontal drive synchronization (`hd_sdn`), along with signals for starting new lines or fields, and video lock indication (`vid_locked`). Outputs from the module include flags indicating update occurrences, interlaced video detection, active and total sample and line counts for differing fields, and other status indicators including stability and resolution validity or changes. Internally, the module integrates a sub-module for sample counting (`alt_vipcti131_common_sample_counter`) with assigned parameters handling different configurations like color planes. It manages numerous intermediate signals such as counters for samples and lines, flags for active video processing, field identification, and counters resets, alongside logic to determine resolution stability and validity. Notable sections in the code handle initialization and synchronous state updates based on video locking and line or field transitions, ensuring accurate resolution counting and change detection. This forms a robust system for real-time monitoring and analytics of video resolution characteristics suited to various signal input conditions, iteratively adjusting to match the active video feed.
