    "block_comment": "This block of code functions to determine if there should be an update in the state by comparing the current update signal with a stored register value. It achieves this by performing an XOR operation between the `update` signal and the `is_update_reg` register; the result, `is_update`, will be high if the signals are different, indicating a change in state is required."
