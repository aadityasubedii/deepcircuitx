    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the update mechanism for a frame line count in a digital imaging system. When the `reset_f0` signal is high, the `active_line_count_f0` is shifted right by one bit, and the least significant bit is set to '0'. If `update_active_line_f0` is high, it indicates that the count needs to update, which is then replaced by `next_active_line_count` with its least significant bit set to '1'. Otherwise, it retains its previous value, thus ensuring the line count is correctly maintained through various operating conditions."
