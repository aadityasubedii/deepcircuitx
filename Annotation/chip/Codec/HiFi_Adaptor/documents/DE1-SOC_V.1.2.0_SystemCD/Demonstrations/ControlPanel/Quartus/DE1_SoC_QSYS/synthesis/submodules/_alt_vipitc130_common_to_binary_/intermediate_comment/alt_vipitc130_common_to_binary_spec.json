    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipitc130_common_to_binary.\nModule specification: The alt_vipitc130_common_to_binary module is designed to convert a one-hot encoded signal into a binary representation, primarily used for determining the active mode index. It has one input port `one_hot`, a vector of bits denoting the active mode through a single high bit, and one output port `binary`, containing the zero-based binary index of the activated mode. The size of `one_hot` is defined by the parameter `NO_OF_MODES`, whereas `binary` is sized according to `LOG2_NO_OF_MODES`. Internally, the module uses two critical arrays of wires: `binary_values` for temporary storage of binary indices, and `binary_values_by_bit` to facilitate bitwise OR operations for the final output assemble. The Verilog code structures this transformation using nested generate blocks, where the first set of loops calculates and assigns intermediate binary values for each possible active mode. The second nested loops then transpose and reduce this intermediate matrix to compute each bit of the final output `binary`, based on the position of the active bit in the `one_hot` input. This module is parameterized to handle varying sizes of input vectors dynamically, suiting different application requirements.",

It accepts a one-hot encoded input vector `one_hot` where only one bit is high at any time, corresponding to the active mode. The module outputs a binary number `binary` which represents the index of the active mode (zero-based). The number of modes (`NO_OF_MODES`) and the logarithm base 2 of the number of modes (`LOG2_NO_OF_MODES`) are parameterized, allowing for flexible adaptation to different sizes of one-hot vectors. The conversion process utilizes nested generate blocks to assign values conditionally based on the active bit in the one-hot input, with further reshaping and reduction to form the final binary output."

The length of this vector is determined by the parameter `NO_OF_MODES`.\n\nOutput ports: [binary]. Explanation: The `binary` output is a vector of bits that holds the binary representation of the index of the currently active mode indicated by the `one_hot` input vector. This is a zero-based index where the position of the active high bit in the one-hot vector is translated into its binary form.

Each section of this array (segmented by `LOG2_NO_OF_MODES`) temporarily stores a binary representation of the mode index (zero-based, but adjusted for conditional +1 during the conversion) if the corresponding bit in `one_hot` is high.\n- `binary_values_by_bit` is another intermediate wire array that rearranges the bits from `binary_values`. It realigns them so that bits that contribute to the same binary output position across all modes are grouped together. This realignment facilitates the final bitwise OR operation that constructs each bit of the output `binary` vector by aggregating bits from across all potential modes, allowing for the correct binary representation of the index of the active `one_hot` bit."
