    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for edge capture control in a digital system. It operates asynchronously, resetting or updating the `edge_capture[1]` register based on clock and reset signals. On a negative edge of `reset_n`, the register is cleared. When enabled by `clk_en`, the register is either cleared if `edge_capture_wr_strobe` is active, or set to all ones (`-1` in Verilog) if an edge is detected on `edge_detect[1]`."
