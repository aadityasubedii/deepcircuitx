    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_key module processes edge-triggered signals from key presses on FPGA systems, generating interrupts based on masked edge detection. It manages input keys with double-latching for edge recognition, controlled via registers for interrupt masking and edge capture, driven by synchronous clock logic. It interfaces through specific buses for addressing, data write, and control signals, enabling responsive and configurable button event handling."
