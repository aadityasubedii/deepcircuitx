    "block_comment": "This code block defines a synchronous resettable data transfer mechanism. On the positive edge of the clock or a reset signal, the block either initializes all output and control signals to zero if the reset is active, or processes data transfer based on internal readiness and enable flags. Specifically, if the internal ready signal \u2018int_ready_reg\u2019 is high and the 'enable_synced' is true, data, start-of-packet (sop), and end-of-packet (eop) signals are transferred from internal signals to their corresponding outputs; otherwise, valid signal 'int_valid_reg' is set low. Additionally, readiness for accepting new data is updated based on the 'dout_ready' status."
