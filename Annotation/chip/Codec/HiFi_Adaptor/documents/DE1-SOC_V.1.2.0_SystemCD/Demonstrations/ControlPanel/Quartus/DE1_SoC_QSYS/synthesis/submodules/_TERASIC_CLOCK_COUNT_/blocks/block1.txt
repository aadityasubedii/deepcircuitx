Comment: 
This block manages a counter that increments with each positive edge of the clock signal CLK_2, but resets when a trigger signal is sent. On the rising edge of `trigger_send`, the counter (`clk2_cnt`) is reset to zero. If the `trigger_send` is not active, and counting is enabled (`counting_now` is true), the counter increments at each positive clock edge of `CLK_2`.
