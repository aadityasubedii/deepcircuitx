It is configured to handle data streams that have specific packet structures characterized by its address, type, number of samples, and words per packet. The core's operation is largely governed by its finite state machine (FSM) with states including IDLE, WAITING, RUNNING, and ENDING. Its primary responsibilities are issuing read commands, ensuring synchronizations with input data latencies using shift registers, and handling data transfers according to the ready and enable signals. The module also provides functionalities for the start of packet (sop), end of packet (eop), and data validation. It manages the status of the system which could either be active or stopped, and it ensures the completion of data packet transfers. Additionally, it includes error-handling mechanisms, such as clearing the inputs when certain conditions are met to prevent erroneous data handling during packet transference."
