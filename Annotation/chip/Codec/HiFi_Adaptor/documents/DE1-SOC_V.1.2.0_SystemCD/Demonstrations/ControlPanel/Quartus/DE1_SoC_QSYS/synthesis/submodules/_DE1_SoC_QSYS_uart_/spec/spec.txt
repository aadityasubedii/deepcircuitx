Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_uart. Module specification: This module implements a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) system for the DE1-SoC development board. It handles serial communication by integrating transmit (TX), receive (RX), and register management submodules. The module has input ports for address, control signals (begintransfer, chipselect, clk, read_n, reset_n, write_n), received data (rxd), and write data (writedata). Output ports include status signals (dataavailable, irq, readyfordata), read data (readdata), and transmitted data (txd). Internal signals manage baud rate, error detection, data flow control, and interrupt handling. The module consists of three main blocks: DE1_SoC_QSYS_uart_tx for data transmission, DE
