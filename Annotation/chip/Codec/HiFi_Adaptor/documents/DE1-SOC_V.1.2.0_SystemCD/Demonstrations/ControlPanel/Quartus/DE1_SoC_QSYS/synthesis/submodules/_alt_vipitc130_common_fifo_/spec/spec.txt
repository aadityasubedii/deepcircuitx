Module name: alt_vipitc130_common_fifo. Module specification: The alt_vipitc130_common_fifo is a Verilog module designed to implement a configurable FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer with parameterizable data width and depth. It supports either single-clock or dual-clock operations for write and read functionalities, determined by the `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME` parameter. Input ports include `wrclk` (write clock), `rdreq` (read request), `aclr` (asynchronous clear), `rdclk` (read clock, used when clocks are different for read and write operations), `wrreq` (write request), and `data` (data to be written, width determined by `DATA_WIDTH`). Output ports comprise `rdusedw` and `wrusedw` (indicating the number of words that can be read and written, respectively), `rdempty` (signals if the FIFO is empty), `wrfull` (signals if the FIFO is full), and `q` (data read from the FIFO, width matches `DATA_WIDTH`). The module does not use internal signals outside of those associated with instantiated submodules (`scfifo` or `dcfifo`). It contains a generate block that conditions the use of either a single-clock FIFO (`scfifo`) or a dual-clock FIFO (`dcfifo`) based on the `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME` parameter. Each FIFO type is instantiated with parameters like FIFO depth, data width, and additional configurations such as speed optimization and register usage settings. This module effectively abstracts FIFO functionality with adjustable parameters and dual clocking options to suit various data handling and synchronization scenarios in digital systems.
