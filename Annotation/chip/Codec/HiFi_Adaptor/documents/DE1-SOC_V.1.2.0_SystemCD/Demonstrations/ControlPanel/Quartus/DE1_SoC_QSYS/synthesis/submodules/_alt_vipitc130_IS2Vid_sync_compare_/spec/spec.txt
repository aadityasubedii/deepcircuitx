Module name: alt_vipitc130_IS2Vid_sync_compare. Module specification: This module performs synchronization comparison for video processing, primarily for genlock functionality. It compares input (CVI) and output (CVO) video signals, managing start-of-frame synchronization, line and sample counts, and generating control signals for synchronization adjustments. The module uses input ports such as rst (reset), clk (clock), genlock_enable, serial_output, h_total_minus_one, restart_count, divider_value, sof_cvi, sof_cvi_locked, sof_cvo, and sof_cvo_locked to control its operation. Output ports include sync_lines, sync_samples, remove_repeatn, sync_compare_h_reset, sync_compare_v_reset, and genlocked, which provide synchronization status and control signals.
