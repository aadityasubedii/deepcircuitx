This Verilog code defines a signal `start_of_sample` that is constantly set to a high value (1'b1). The block functions as a signal initializer, ensuring that `start_of_sample` remains asserted. This may be used to indicate the beginning of a sample in a larger digital system, typically used in timing or control operation modules.
