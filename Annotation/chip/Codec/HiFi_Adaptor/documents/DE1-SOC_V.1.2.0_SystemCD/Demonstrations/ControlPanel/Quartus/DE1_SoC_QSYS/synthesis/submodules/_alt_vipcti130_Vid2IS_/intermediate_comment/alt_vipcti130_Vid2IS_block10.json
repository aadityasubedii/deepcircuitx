    "block_comment": "This block, labeled \"avalon_st_output,\" manages video stream processing and synchronization for output. Initially, it checks if GENERATE_SYNC is less than 2 to proceed. Within this condition, the code converts sequential data to parallel when CONVERT_SEQ_TO_PAR is true using a buffer module 'alt_vipcti130_Vid2IS_write_buffer,' which processes inputs like video write requests (`wrreq_pre_swap`), data, and packet signals, outputting post-swap signals. If conversion isn't required, direct signal assignments are used. Following this, an 'alt_vipcti130_common_fifo' module handles data buffering with respective video and system clocks, and outputs to a synchronization module 'alt_vipcti130_common_sync' for fields' and enable's state alignment. The final output section uses the 'alt_vipcti130_Vid2IS_av_st_output' module controlled by synchronization results and various input signals, determining video frame parameters and output control. If GENERATE_SYNC is 2 or higher, standard low values or zeros are assigned to outputs to indicate inactivity."
