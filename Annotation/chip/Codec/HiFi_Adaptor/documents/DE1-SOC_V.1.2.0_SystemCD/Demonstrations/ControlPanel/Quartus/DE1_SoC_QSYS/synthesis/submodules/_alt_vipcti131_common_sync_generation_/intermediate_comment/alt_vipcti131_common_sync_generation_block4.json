    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for maintaining a frame counter in a video processing context. The instantiation of `alt_vipcti131_common_frame_counter` manages horizontal and vertical counts in a video stream. It is reset (`rst`) upon system or manual reset and clocked (`clk`) by a system-wide clock. The counter is operated when `enable` input is high, typically linked to a count control signal. It resets its horizontal (`h_reset`) and vertical (`v_reset`) counts based on `start_of_vsync_f0`. The module tracks total samples and lines per frame using `h_total` and `v_total`, respectively. Its functional execution utilizes signals such as `hd_sdn` for handling high-definition shut down signalling, and the counts (`h_count`, `v_count`) are updated every `sample_ticks`, delineating the progression of pixel sampling across frames."
