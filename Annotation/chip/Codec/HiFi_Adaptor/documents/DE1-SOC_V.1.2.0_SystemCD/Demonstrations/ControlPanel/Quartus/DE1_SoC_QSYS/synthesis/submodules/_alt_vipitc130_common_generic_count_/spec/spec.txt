Module name: alt_vipitc130_common_generic_count. Module specification: The alt_vipitc130_common_generic_count is a Verilog module primarily designed as a configurable counter with enhanced control capabilities. The module's essential functionality includes counting clock cycles or ticks, influenced by multiple input signals and parameters. It captures inputs such as `clk` (clock signal), `reset_n` (active-low reset signal), `enable` (enables counting), `enable_ticks` (controls tick-based counting), `max_count` (the upper limit for the counter), `restart_count` (signal to restart the counting), and `reset_value` (value for resetting the counter). The outputs include `count` (the current counter value), `enable_count` (indicates if counting is active), `start_count` (signals the beginning of a counting process), and `cp_ticks` (current tick status). Internally, the module utilizes a register `ticks` to track the number of tick cycles since the last increment, crucial for controlling when the counter increments, governed by the `TICKS_PER_COUNT` parameter. The code utilizes condition-based logic encapsulated within a `generate` block to manage differing behaviors when TICKS_PER_COUNT is set to 1 versus other values, affecting outputs like `enable_count`, `start_count`, and `cp_ticks`. The main counter logic handled outside the `generate` block adjusts the `count` based on the combination of enable signals, reset conditions, and whether the count has reached its maximum value. This module provides a robust framework for various counting and timing functions in digital systems, where precise control and flexible configuration are required.
