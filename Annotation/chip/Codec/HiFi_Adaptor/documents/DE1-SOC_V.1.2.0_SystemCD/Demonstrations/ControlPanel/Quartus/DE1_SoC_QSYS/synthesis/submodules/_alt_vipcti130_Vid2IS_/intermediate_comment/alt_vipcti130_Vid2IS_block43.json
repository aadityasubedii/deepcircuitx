    "block_comment": "This block initializes video interface signals on reset and updates them with new values otherwise. Upon reset, signaled by `rst_vid_clk`, it clears all video interface signals to their default states, zeroes, or deasserted. When not in reset, the block assigns incoming video data to `vid_data_input` and conditionally processes synchronization signals and data valid signals based on compilation parameters, ensuring correct signal assignment and data integrity."
