Module name: alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_control. 

Module specification: The `alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_control` module is designed for controlling video input stream tasks, mainly in a video processing system. The functionality includes handling resolution change detection, controlling interlaced video signals, configuring active pixels and lines, managing parameters for different video standards, and providing support for Avalon Memory Mapped (MM) Slave Interface read/write operations. 

The module has an array of input ports such as `rst`, `clk`, `usedw`, `overflow_sticky`, `is_output_enable`, `update`, `resolution_change`, `interlaced`, `active_sample_count`, `active_line_count_f0`, `active_line_count_f1`, `total_sample_count`, `total_line_count_f0`, `total_line_count_f1`, `stable`, `resolution_valid`, `vid_std`, `av_address`, `av_read`, `av_write`, and `av_writedata`. These inputs are utilized for managing control information, status flags, and properties of the video stream. 

The output ports consist of `enable`, `clear_overflow_sticky`, `is_interlaced`, `is_active_sample_count`, `is_active_line_count_f0`, `is_active_line_count_f1`, `sof_sample`, `sof_line`, `sof_subsample`, `refclk_divider_value`, `genlock_enable`, `av_readdata`, and `status_update_int`. They are used for conveying the current operational state, control signals, or configuration data related to other sections of the video system or to the Avalon interface.

Moreover, there are internal signals like `is_stable`, `is_total_sample_count`, `is_total_line_count_f0`, `is_total_line_count_f1`, `is_std`, `is_update`, `is_update_reg`, `is_resolution_valid`, `enable_reg`, `usedw_output`, `status_update_int_reg`, `stable_int_reg`, `is_stable_reg`, `clear_interrupts`, `interrupt_enable`, `clear_overflow_sticky_reg`, and `resolution_change_reg` which are utilized to hold state, control, and status information, as well as to handle interrupts and initiate Avalon interface read/write operations.

The module is divided into several blocks. There's a block for handling Avalon interface read/write operations, a block for defining module behavior based on control and status flags, and another block for handling interrupts. Additional logic is included for edge detection to create update pulses and to synchronize state changes based on an input clock or a reset signal. The overall functionality of the module is determined by parameters at compile time for customizing the module's behavior and compatibility according to specific hardware design requirements.
