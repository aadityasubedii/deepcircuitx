    "spec": "Module name: IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic. \nModule specification: The IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic module is designed to interface with infrared signals following the IRDA standard through a state machine approach with three main states: IDLE, GUIDANCE, and DATAREAD. It starts in the IDLE state, waiting to detect a signal of specific duration, then moves to the GUIDANCE state to confirm the signal pattern, and finally transitions to the DATAREAD state to read and process incoming data bits. It uses iCLK and iRST_n as clock and reset inputs, respectively, for managing the timing and initial conditions. The iIRDA input receives the IR signal, and the iREAD Input initiates the read operation. The outputs are oDATA_REAY, indicating data readiness, and oDATA, a 32-bit output carrying processed data. Internally, the module uses counters like idle_count, state_count, and data_count to measure durations in specific states. The state register tracks the current module state. Data are temporarily stored in DATA during processing, transitioning to the oDATA output upon confirmation of valid data. The code efficiently implements state transitions, signal detection and processing functions, data validation, and reset conditions. The state management ensures robust interpretation of incoming data, flagging its readiness when processing completes successfully. The design balances resource utilization and processing requirements to meet the IRDA specification criteria effectively.",

It operates as a state machine with three main states: IDLE, GUIDANCE, and DATAREAD. Initially, the module waits in the IDLE state until a signal below a specified duration threshold is detected, subsequently moving to the GUIDANCE state to confirm the signal pattern. If the guidance pattern is correct, it transitions to the DATAREAD state, where it reads and processes the incoming data bits based on their duration and stores them. Finally, it checks if the received data matches expected patterns (using a checksum mechanism), and if correct, forwards the data. The module uses various counters to track time durations and ensure accurate signal processing. Outputs include a data ready signal and the processed data itself."

                    "text": "Module name: IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic. \nModule specification: The IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic module is designed to interface with infrared signals following the IRDA standard through a state machine approach with three main states: IDLE, GUIDANCE, and DATAREAD. It starts in the IDLE state, waiting to detect a signal of specific duration, then moves to the GUIDANCE state to confirm the signal pattern, and finally transitions to the DATAREAD state to read and process incoming data bits. It uses iCLK and iRST_n as clock and reset inputs, respectively, for managing the timing and initial conditions. The iIRDA input receives the IR signal, and the iREAD Input initiates the read operation. The outputs are oDATA_REAY, indicating data readiness, and oDATA, a 32-bit output carrying processed data. Internally, the module uses counters like idle_count, state_count, and data_count to measure durations in specific states. The state register tracks the current module state. Data are temporarily stored in DATA during processing, transitioning to the oDATA output upon confirmation of valid data. The code efficiently implements state transitions, signal detection and processing functions, data validation, and reset conditions. The state management ensures robust interpretation of incoming data, flagging its readiness when processing completes successfully. The design balances resource utilization and processing requirements to meet the IRDA specification criteria effectively."
