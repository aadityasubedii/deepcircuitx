    "block_comment": "This block assigns the end-of-packet flag to the `dout_endofpacket` signal. The assignment uses a continuous assignment statement to directly map the `eop_out` signal to `dout_endofpacket`, indicating that the latter should reflect the end-of-packet status as indicated by `eop_out`."
