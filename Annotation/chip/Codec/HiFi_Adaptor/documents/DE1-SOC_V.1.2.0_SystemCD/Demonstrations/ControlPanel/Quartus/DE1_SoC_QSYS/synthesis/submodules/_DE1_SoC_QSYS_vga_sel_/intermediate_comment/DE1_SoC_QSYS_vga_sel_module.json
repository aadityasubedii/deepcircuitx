    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"DE1_SoC_QSYS_vga_sel\" module is a basic I/O interface for VGA selection, utilizing control signals like `chipselect`, `write_n`, and specific `address` settings to manage data operations. It synchronously handles writing to and outputting from a register `data_out` based on the clock signal `clk`. The module outputs the data through `out_port` and formats it into a 32-bit `readdata`. It uses internal logic to reset and conditionally write to `data_out`, making it a tailored solution for controlled data handling in system-on-chip designs."
