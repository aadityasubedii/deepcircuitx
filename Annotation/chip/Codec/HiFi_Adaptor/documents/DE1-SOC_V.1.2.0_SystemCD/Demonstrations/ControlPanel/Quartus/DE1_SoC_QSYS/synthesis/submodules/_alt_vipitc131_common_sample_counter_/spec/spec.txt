Module name: alt_vipitc131_common_sample_counter. 
Module specification: The `alt_vipitc131_common_sample_counter` module is designed for tracking counts of sample data in image or video processing applications, handling different formats based on the number of color planes. It takes five inputs: `rst` (reset), `clk` (clock), `sclr` (synchronous clear), `count_cycle` (indicates a counting event), and `hd_sdn` (mode selector). The outputs include `count_sample` (signals a sample count), `start_of_sample` (flags the start of a new sample), and `sample_ticks` (outputs the count of valid data units processed within a sample). Internally, the module uses `count_valids` (tracks valid cycles for color planes) and `new_sample` (signals when all color planes have been counted). The code structure includes a conditional generate block that adjusts the behavior based on the number of color planes (distinguished by `NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES == 1`). For a single color plane, outputs are directly tied to inputs. For multiple color planes, the counter increments based on `count_cycle` and resets on conditions dictated by `sclr` and `new_sample`. The output logic adjusts based on the state of `hd_sdn` and internal counters. This well-structured module efficiently manages the counting of video or image sample data, accommodating variations in the parallelism and number of color planes.
