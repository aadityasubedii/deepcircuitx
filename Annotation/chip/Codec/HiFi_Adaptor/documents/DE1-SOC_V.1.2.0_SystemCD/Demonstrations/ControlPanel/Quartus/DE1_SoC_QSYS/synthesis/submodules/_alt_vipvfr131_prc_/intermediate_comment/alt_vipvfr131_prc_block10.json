    "block_comment": "This function calculates the minimum number of bits required to represent a given binary number. It begins with the maximum width of 512 bits and iteratively checks, decrementing from 512, whether a smaller number of bits (2 to the power of the current index) can still represent the given value, updating the required width as it finds a smaller sufficient bit-width."
