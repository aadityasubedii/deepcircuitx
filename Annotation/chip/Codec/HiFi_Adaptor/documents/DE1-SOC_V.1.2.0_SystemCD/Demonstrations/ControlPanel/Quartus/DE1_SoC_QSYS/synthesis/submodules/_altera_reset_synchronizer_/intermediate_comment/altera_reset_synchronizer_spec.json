    "spec": "Module name: altera_reset_synchronizer. Module specification: The `altera_reset_synchronizer` module is a fundamental component used in FPGA designs to synchronize reset signals across different clock domains, ensuring they are stable and glitch-free. It features input ports `reset_in` (a reset signal that can be either asynchronous or synchronous, used to initiate the resetting of internal states) and `clk` (the clock signal used to synchronize the reset process). The output port `reset_out` delivers a synchronized reset signal suitable for use in downstream logic. Internally, the module utilizes a shift register array `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain`, which, depending on the `DEPTH` parameter, adjusts its size to manage multiple stages of reset synchronization. An additional internal signal, `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out`, captures the state of the first bit of the shift register to output a stable reset signal. The module operates in two modes determined by the `ASYNC_RESET` parameter: In asynchronous reset mode, managed by an `always` block sensitive to both `posedge clk` or `posedge reset_in`, the reset signal immediately sets the entire chain and its output to high upon `reset_in` assertion, and for clearing, zeroes are introduced and shifted through. In the synchronous reset mode, the `always` block, only sensitive to `posedge clk`, continuously shifts the state of `reset_in` into the chain, updating the output accordingly. Both configurations use `generate` constructs to control the behavioral logic based on the mode specified, thereby providing flexibility and robustness in handling various synchronization scenarios in FPGA applications.",

It takes an asynchronous reset signal ('reset_in') and a clock signal ('clk'), and outputs a synchronized reset signal ('reset_out'). The synchronization is managed through a shift register chain of length specified by the 'DEPTH' parameter. The design can be configured to handle either asynchronous or synchronous resets based on the 'ASYNC_RESET' parameter. During asynchronous reset mode, when 'reset_in' is asserted (high), it immediately sets the entire shift register chain and the output to high. Otherwise, it shifts zero into the last register of the chain and propagates this through the registers, thus ensuring synchronous behavior relative to the clock signal. In synchronous reset mode, the shift operation directly incorporates the 'reset_in' value into the chain every clock cycle, still maintaining synchronization with 'clk'. The output 'reset_out' replicates the last state of the shift register chain, now effectively synchronized with the clock, minimizing the risk of metastability in downstream logic triggered by the reset."
