Module-level comment: The "audio_fifo" module is a dual-clock FIFO designed for audio data transfer across different clock domains. It synchronizes 32-bit audio data using input and output ports for control and data flow, and an internal dcfifo_component configured for Cyclone IV E FPGAs. This component manages FIFO operations with features like overflow and underflow checks, ensuring data stability within specified synchronization delays.
