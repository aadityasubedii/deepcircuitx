    "block_comment": "This Verilog block implements a synchronous write operation to the `data_out` register. On the negative edge of `reset_n`, it resets `data_out` to 0. During the clock's positive edge, if the `chipselect` is active, `write_n` is inactive, and `address` is 0, it updates `data_out` with `writedata`."
