    "module": "Module-level comment: This module converts video input streams to internal streams (IS) with configurable parameters. It performs sync extraction, resolution detection, and signal conversion. The module uses FIFOs for data buffering, handles embedded or separate sync signals, and supports interlaced video. It includes control logic for overflow detection, resolution changes, and sync generation. The module interfaces with both video input and output clocks, managing clock domain crossing and providing status updates through an Avalon interface."
