    "block_comment": "This block generates an interrupt ready signal based on the synchronization of an enable signal. The interrupt ready (`int_ready`) is an assigned signal that results from a logical AND operation between the stored interrupt ready register (`int_ready_reg`) and the synchronized enable signal (`enable_synced`). This ensures that the interrupt ready signal is asserted only when both the register is set and the enable condition is met."
