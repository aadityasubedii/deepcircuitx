    "block_comment": "This block manages the edge capture mechanism for a specific signal line, indexed at 7. On a positive clock edge or negative reset, it checks conditions to modify the state of `edge_capture[7]`. If `reset_n` is low, it clears `edge_capture[7]`. If clock enable (`clk_en`) is active, it further checks if a write strobe (`edge_capture_wr_strobe`) is active, in which case it clears `edge_capture[7]`; if an edge detection (`edge_detect[7]`) is observed, it sets `edge_capture[7]` to -1, indicating an edge was captured."
