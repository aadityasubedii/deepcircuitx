Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_tck. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_tck is a Verilog module designed for JTAG interface-based debugging within a CPU system, focusing on trace data management and breakpoint monitoring. The module inputs include data registers such as `MonDReg` and `break_readreg` for handling debug-related data, and control signals like `ir_in` to specify operational modes. It employs `tdi` as a serial input, and uses `tck`, the JTAG clock, for timing synchronization. Additionally, it responds to various state inputs such as `debugack` and `jtag_state_rti` to manage its operations accordingly. Key outputs include `ir_out`, `jrst_n`, `sr`, `st_ready_test_idle`, and `tdo`, which collectively output status, control bits, and JTAG data. Internally, the module uses signals like `debugack_sync` and `monitor_ready_sync` to ensure reliable, synchronous operations across its functional blocks. Noteworthy internal blocks include synchronization units that align the incoming signals `debugack` and `monitor_ready` with `tck`, and a complex shifting mechanism for the scan register `sr` dictated by the input instruction register and JTAG operations. The module efficiently handles different data and monitoring procedures critical to real-time CPU debugging via JTAG, aided by detailed signal management and state-driven logic.
