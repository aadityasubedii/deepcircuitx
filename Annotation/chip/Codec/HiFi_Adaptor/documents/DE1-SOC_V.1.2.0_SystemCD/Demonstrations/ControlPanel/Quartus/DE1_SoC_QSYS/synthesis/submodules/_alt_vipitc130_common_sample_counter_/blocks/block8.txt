This block assigns the value of `count_cycle` to `count_sample`. The assignment ensures that `count_sample` reflects the current cycle count, maintaining synchronization between these two values. Such an operation is crucial in designs where cycle count tracking is needed for operations that depend on specific cycle counts.
