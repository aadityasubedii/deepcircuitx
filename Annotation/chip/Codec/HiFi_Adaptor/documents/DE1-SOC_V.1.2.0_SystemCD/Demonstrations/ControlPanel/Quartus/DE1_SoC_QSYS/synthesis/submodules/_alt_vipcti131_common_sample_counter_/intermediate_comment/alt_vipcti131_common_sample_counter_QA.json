It takes inputs like clock and reset signals, and based on the parameter settings about whether it is working with parallel color planes or just a single color plane, it behaves differently. For a single color plane, it simply forwards the counting cycle, indicating every cycle as the start of a sample. For multiple color planes, it manages a counter to track valid counts and determines the start of a new sample based on these counts. The output signals indicate the current sample count, the initiation of a sample, and the number of ticks per sample. This module is particularly useful in scenarios where synchronization and precise sample counting across multiple color planes are essential, such as in video processing hardware."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports: rst, clk, sclr, count_cycle, hd_sdn.\nExplanation:\n- rst: Reset signal. It's used to initialize or reset the system to a known state. When this signal is active (high), the internal counter (`count_valids`) is reset.\n- clk: Clock signal. It drives the synchronization of the internal processes and state updates in the module, typically used for triggering events at positive clock edges.\n- sclr: Sample clear signal. It's used to optionally reset the counter (`count_valids`) asynchronously with respect to the main reset signal, providing additional control over when counting starts and stops.\n- count_cycle: Count cycle signal. It serves as the primary counting input, advancing the counter whenever it is active (high) based on the module configuration and current state.\n- hd_sdn: High-definition shutdown signal. This is an additional control signal used to modify counting behavior based on its state (high or low).\n\nOutput ports: count_sample, start_of_sample, sample_ticks.\nExplanation:\n- count_sample: Count sample signal. This output indicates a countersample event based on the input count cycle and module logic, adjusted by the hd_sdn signal and the internal `new_sample` logic.\n- start_of_sample: Start of sample signal. This signals the beginning of a new sample. It is asserted depending on the state of `count_valids` or immediately if hd_sdn is high.\n- sample_ticks: Sample ticks signal. This output provides the value of the `count_valids` register, which indicates the number of ticks (counts) occurred for the current sample; valuable for tracking how many cycles each sample is taking, especially when multiple color planes are involved."

It is used to count the valid counts or ticks for each sample when handling multiple color planes. The register increments as per the count_cycle input and resets based on specific conditions influenced by other signals like sclr, new_sample, and the rst signal.\n- new_sample: This is a wire that acts as a flag to indicate when a new sample should start. It assesses whether the `count_valids` register has reached its limit (NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES - 1), which suggests that the current sample cycle has completed, and hence a new sample needs to be initiated. This signal plays a crucial role in synchronizing the start of a new sample and resetting the `count_valids` register when necessary."
