Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart.
Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart module serves as a JTAG UART communication interface for a DE1 System on Chip (SoC), used to handle data transmission and reception. The module features input ports such as av_address, av_chipselect, av_read_n, av_write_n, av_writedata, clk, and rst_n. These inputs facilitate memory-mapped interface communications, system synchronization, and reset operations. Outputs include av_irq, av_readdata, av_waitrequest, dataavailable, and readyfordata which signal interrupt requests, data transactions, system readiness, and data availability. Internally, the module utilizes signals like fifo_FF, rfifo_full, fifo_rd, fifo_wr, and various flags and signals that control read and write operations, FIFO buffer statuses, and manage interrupts based on buffer thresholds and operational errors. Sub-modules such as DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart_scfifo_r and DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart_scfifo_w are integrated within this top-level module for modular handling of specific read and write operations respectively. The sub-modules correspond to managing simulated FIFO buffers for data read and write operations, handling tasks such as data buffering, empty and full status flags, and assist in the data flow management in the UART communication. The overall design coordinates processing based on the system clock and reset conditions, involving detailed interaction between control and data flow across its internal and integrated sub-modules.
