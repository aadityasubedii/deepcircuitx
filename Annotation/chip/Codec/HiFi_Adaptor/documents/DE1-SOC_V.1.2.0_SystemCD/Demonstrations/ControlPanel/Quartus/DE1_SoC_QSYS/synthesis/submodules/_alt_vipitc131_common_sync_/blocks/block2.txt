This block of code is for a double stage flip-flop synchronizer in Verilog. When a reset 'rst' or positive clock edge 'sync_clock' is detected, the block will execute. If a reset is activated, both 'data_out_sync0' and 'data_out_sync1' get assigned with zeros of array size WIDTH. Otherwise, in the case of a positive clock edge, 'data_in' gets latched into 'data_out_sync0', and the value of 'data_out_sync0' gets transferred to 'data_out_sync1'. This system helps eliminate metastability by allowing 'data_in' to cross the clock domain boundaries.
