Comment: 
This block is responsible for assigning a default value of '0' to the signal 'out_error'. It utilizes the 'assign' keyword, which creates a continuous assignment statement indicating the current state of 'out_error' in the designed system. This essentially indicates that 'out_error' won't register any errors by default unless explicitly triggered elsewhere.
