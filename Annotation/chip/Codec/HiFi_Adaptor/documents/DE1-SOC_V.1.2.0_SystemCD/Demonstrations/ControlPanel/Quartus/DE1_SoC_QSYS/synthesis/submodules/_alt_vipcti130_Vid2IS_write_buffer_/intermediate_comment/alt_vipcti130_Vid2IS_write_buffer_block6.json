    "block_comment": "This block of code initializes a generate loop for creating multiple write buffers, one for each color plane in a system. Inside the loop, the `genvar` variable `i` iterates from 0 up to `NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES - 1`, creating a distinct context for each iteration labeled `write_buffer_generation_for_loop`, which likely includes further instantiation of hardware or logic specific to handling different color planes in a design."
