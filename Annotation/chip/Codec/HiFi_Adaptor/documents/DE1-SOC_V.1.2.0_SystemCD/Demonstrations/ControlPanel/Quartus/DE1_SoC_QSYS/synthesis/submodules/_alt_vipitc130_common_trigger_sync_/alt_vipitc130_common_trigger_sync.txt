Module-level comment: The 'alt_vipitc130_common_trigger_sync' module synchronizes a trigger signal across different clock domains using `input_clock` and `sync_clock`. If clocks are the same, it directly passes the `trigger_in` to `trigger_out`. Otherwise, it uses toggle-based change detection combined with synchronization blocks to mitigate clock domain-induced metastability, handling resets and edge detection reliably. This is achieved by capturing `trigger_in`, toggling on edges acknowledged by `ack_in`, then synchronizing and stabilizing this toggle to produce the safe, glitch-free output `trigger_out`.
