This Verilog block implements a reset synchronizer. It operates on the positive edge of a clock signal. The block specifically functions by shifting the previous state of an internal chain represented by `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain` and updating its state with the value of `reset_out_pre` at the least significant bit. This creates a delay for the reset signal which helps in synchronizing it across different clock domains to avoid metastability issues.
