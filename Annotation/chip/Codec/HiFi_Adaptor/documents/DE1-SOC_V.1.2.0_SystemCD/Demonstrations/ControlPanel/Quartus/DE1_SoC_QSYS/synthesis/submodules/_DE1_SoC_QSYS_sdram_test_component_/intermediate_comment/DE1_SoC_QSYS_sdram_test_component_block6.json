    "block_comment": "This block assigns a read mask based on the value of the `index`. If the `index` is 0, `read_mask` is assigned the value `rd_mask_pipe_0`; if `index` is 1, it is assigned `rd_mask_pipe_1`; otherwise, it defaults to `rd_mask_pipe_2`. This uses a conditional (ternary) operator to select the appropriate read mask from three different pipelines depending on the index value."
