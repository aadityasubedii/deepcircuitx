Module-level comment: The TERASIC_IR_RX_FIFO module is designed for IR data reception and management using an internal FIFO buffer. It captures IR data, stores it in FIFO, and manages data read/write operations via control registers. The module uses internal signals for FIFO control, edge detection for interrupts, and handles the synchronization and data flow control through instances of FIFO and IRDA receiver blocks. This ensures efficient data handling and communication with a system processor.
