Module name: alt_vipitc131_common_generic_count. 

Module specification: The alt_vipitc131_common_generic_count module is a parameterizable Verilog module designed to act as a configurable counter. It provides functionalities such as counting up to a user-defined maximum value, resetting at either a global or a specific condition, and the ability to manage ticks for controlling the rate of counting. The module encompasses several input ports: `clk` (a clock signal for synchronization), `reset_n` (an active-low signal to reset the counter), `enable` (to activate counting), `enable_ticks` (to manage tick-based features), `max_count` (defining the upper limit of counting), `restart_count` (to reinitialize the count during operation), and `reset_value` (a specific value for counter-resetting). Output ports include `count` (the current count), `enable_count` (permits counting based on conditions), `start_count` (signals when to initiate counting), and `cp_ticks` (reflects the current tick value). Internal to the module, a `ticks` register is employed for tracking sub-counts which adjust the main counting frequency based on system requirements. The Verilog `generate` block within the module is used for conditional compilationâ€”applying tick management when `TICKS_PER_COUNT` is greater than one. The module first checks if ticks per count is one, allowing direct count management without additional conditions; otherwise, it employs logic employing ticks for finer control over counting operations. 

This module orientates around flexibility in counting mechanisms, suitable for a range of digital design applications requiring precise count operations and control.
