Module name: AUDIO_IF. Module specification: The AUDIO_IF module acts as an interface between an audio system and its hardware components, specifically managing audio data I/O for a DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) and an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter). The module synchronizes operations using the input clock avs_s1_clk, and employs an array of input/output ports such as avs_s1_reset for internal reset, avs_s1_address for selecting internal addresses, avs_s1_read for enabling read operations, and avs_s1_writedata for providing data to write operations. Outputs include avs_s1_readdata for delivering data read from internal buffers or status registers, avs_s1_export_DACDAT for sending out processed DAC data, and avs_s1_export_XCK as a system clock output. Internal signals like fifo_clear manage FIFO buffer clearances, dacfifo_write and adcfifo_read control data flows into and out of FIFOs, among others like reg_readdata storing results for output. The module integrates sub-modules called AUDIO_DAC and AUDIO_ADC for handling DAC and ADC operations respectively, each parameterized for 32-bit data operations through defparams. Compositionally, the code manages reset conditions, writes to DAC FIFO based on address matching, reads ADC data conditioned on FIFO status, and orchestrates data flow through module interfaced clocks and data lines ensuring robust operation and synchronization between the audio interface and digital audio components.
