Module name: alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_av_st_output. 
Module specification: The alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_av_st_output module handles the complex task of converting and controlling video data streams with precision. It primarily processes incoming video signals by managing them through various stages including control header construction, resolution handling, and framing based on interlacing and prediction settings. Key input ports include rst (reset), enable (operation control), q (video data and control packets from FIFO), empty (FIFO buffer availability), is_interlaced, is_sync_to, is_field_prediction (video processing modifiers), is_active_sample_count, is_active_line_count_f0 and f1 (resolution parameters), is_clk (clock signal), and is_ready (ready signal from downstream components). Output ports include rdreq (FIFO data request), is_valid (validity of output data), is_data (processed video data), is_sop and is_eop (packet start and end indicators), and is_output_enable (controls output data activation). Internally, the module leverages signals like is_data_fifo (storage of video data) and is_packet (packet boundary flag) among others to control data flow and processing stages, influenced by an array of states set in a finite state machine. Each state from IDLE to OUTPUT_ANC is crucial, serving functions from waiting for new data to sending out converted video packets. The moduleâ€™s design facilitates careful synchronization and coordination between input commands, internal processing stages, and output readiness, ensuring seamless video stream management suitable for high-quality video applications.
