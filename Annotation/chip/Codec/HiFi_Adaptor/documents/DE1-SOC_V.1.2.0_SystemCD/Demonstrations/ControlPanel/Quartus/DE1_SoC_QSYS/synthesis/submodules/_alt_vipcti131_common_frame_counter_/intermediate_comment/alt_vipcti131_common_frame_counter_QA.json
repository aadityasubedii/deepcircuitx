The counters increase based on external signals such as enable, reset, and synchronization signals, tracking the current position in the video frame. The module also integrates with a sample counter (alt_vipcti131_common_sample_counter), which further refines the counting mechanism based on the number of color planes, aiding in the precise control of video sampling. Conditions for adjusting the counters include initialization on reset, synchronous clearing, and wrapping the counts over based on total horizontal and vertical dimensions defined by the inputs `h_total` and `v_total`. The output flags `new_line` and `start_of_sample` indicate the start of a new line and sampling moments respectively, which are crucial for synchronizing video processing tasks."
