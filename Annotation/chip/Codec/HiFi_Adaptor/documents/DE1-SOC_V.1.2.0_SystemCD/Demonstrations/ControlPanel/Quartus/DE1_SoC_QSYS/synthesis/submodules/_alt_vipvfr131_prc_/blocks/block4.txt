Comment: 
This line of code is primarily responsible for assigning the value of 'valid_out' signal to 'dout_valid'. It works in such a way that whenever a system clock triggers a positive edge, the digital output signal 'dout_valid' is updated to match the current value of the 'valid_out' signal. This operation ensures that the valid state of the output data is consistently synchronized with the status of the 'valid_out' signal.
