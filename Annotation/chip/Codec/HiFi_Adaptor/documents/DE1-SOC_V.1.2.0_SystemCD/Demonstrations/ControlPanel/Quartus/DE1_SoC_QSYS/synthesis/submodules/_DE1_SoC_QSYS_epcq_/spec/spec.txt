Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_epcq. 

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_epcq module functions as a controller for interfacing with an EPCQ (Erasable Programmable Configurable Quad) device, managing memory read and write operations efficiently. The module accepts several input ports including `address`, a 9-bit selection line to navigate memory addresses within the EPCQ; `chipselect` to enable or disable device operations; `clk` for synchronizing tasks across the system; a read enable `read_n` that's active-low; a reset signal `reset_n` which is also active-low; `write_n` to enable writes when low; and `writedata`, a 32-bit data line for messages from the CPU. The output ports include `dataavailable`, signaling data readiness for reading; `endofpacket`, showing completion of data packet transmission; `irq` for interrupts requiring CPU action; `readdata` giving back read information to the CPU; and `readyfordata` indicating the device can handle more write operations. Internal signals extensively coordinate timing and data transactions within submodules like `DE1_SoC_QSYS_epcq_sub` and `tornado_DE1_SoC_QSYS_epcq_atom`. For example, `MISO`, `MOSI`, `SCLK`, and `SS_n` are SPI communication lines for data transfer and control. The module also includes blocks such as a submodule interface for read/write operation configuration, an instantiation of ROM for initialization, and status handling using status registers that monitor operations like data readiness, packet completion, and error states. This Verilog module integrates memory management with hardware interfacing for effective EPCQ control.
