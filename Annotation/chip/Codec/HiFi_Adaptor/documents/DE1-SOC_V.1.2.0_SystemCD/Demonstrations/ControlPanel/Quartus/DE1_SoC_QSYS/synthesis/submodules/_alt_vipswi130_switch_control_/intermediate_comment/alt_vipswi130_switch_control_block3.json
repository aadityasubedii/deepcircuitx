    "block_comment": "This Verilog block manages output control settings and selection multiplexing based on synchronization signals and write commands. At each positive edge of the clock or if the reset signal is asserted, the block initializes the `output_control` and `select` arrays for corresponding indices based on the `NO_INPUTS` parameter. If reset is not asserted and an Avalon write operation (`av_write`) targets the address offset by 3 from the current index `i`, the `output_control` for that index is updated with data from the Avalon bus. Additionally, when a global synchronization flag (`global_synced`) is set, the block updates the `select` array with the values from `output_control` to finalize the multiplexing configuration."
