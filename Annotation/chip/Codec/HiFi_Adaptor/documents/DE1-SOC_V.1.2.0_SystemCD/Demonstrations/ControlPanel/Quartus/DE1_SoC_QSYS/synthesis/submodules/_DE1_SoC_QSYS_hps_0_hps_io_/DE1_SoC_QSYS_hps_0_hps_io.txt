Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_hps_0_hps_io module manages I/O interfacing for a DE1 SoC, facilitating communication with memory and peripherals like Ethernet, USB, and SPI. It utilizes both input and output ports to handle data transactions, and internal signals for precise control over memory operations. The module integrates these functionalities via the DE1_SoC_QSYS_hps_0_hps_io_border sub-module, ensuring cohesive data management and signal integrity across the system.
