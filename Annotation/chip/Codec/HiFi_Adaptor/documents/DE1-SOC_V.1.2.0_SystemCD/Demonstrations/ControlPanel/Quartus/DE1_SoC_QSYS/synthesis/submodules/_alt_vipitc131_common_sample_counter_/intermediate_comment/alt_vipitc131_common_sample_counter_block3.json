    "block_comment": "This block assigns a value to `count_sample` based on the condition of `hd_sdn`. If `hd_sdn` is true, `count_sample` is set to the value of `count_cycle`; otherwise, it is set to the result of a bitwise AND operation between `count_cycle` and `new_sample`. This conditional assignment allows selective updating of the `count_sample` based on the `hd_sdn` signal, integrating control flow directly into the data path."
