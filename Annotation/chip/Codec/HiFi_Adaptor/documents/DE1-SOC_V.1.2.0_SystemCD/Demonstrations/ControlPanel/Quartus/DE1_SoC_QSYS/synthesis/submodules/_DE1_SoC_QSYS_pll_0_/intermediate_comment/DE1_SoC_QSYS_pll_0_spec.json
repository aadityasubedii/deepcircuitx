    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll_0. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll_0 module is designed for FPGA designs requiring multiple output frequencies from a single reference clock. It employs an Altera PLL instance to take a reference clock input (`refclk`) and a reset input (`rst`) to provide stable and configurable multiple output clocks (`outclk_0` to `outclk_4`) and a locked signal (`locked`). The `refclk` serves as the source clock for PLL, which generates five derived output clocks, each configurable with specific frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles. The `rst` input allows for the re-initialization of the PLL to maintain stability. The `locked` signal indicates the successful locking of the PLL to the desired frequencies and phases, ensuring the system's reliable operation. Internally, the module consists of an `altera_pll` instance configured with parameters for output frequencies, phases, and duty cycles, primarily acting as a wrapper to configure and manage this PLL block. There are no internal signals explicitly used, as the module primarily interacts with the `altera_pll` instance directly, organizing and directing the logic for PLL configuration and output.",
