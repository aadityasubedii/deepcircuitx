It handles inputs such as a clock signal (clk), a reset signal (reset_n), data validation signal (in_valid), data readiness indication (in_ready), and end-of-packet signaling (in_endofpacket). The module outputs two types of credits: symbol credits and packet credits. \n\n1. **Symbol Credits Calculation**: Depending on the ratios of SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT to SYMBOLS_PER_CREDIT, the module calculates credits either by simple addition per beat when the beat criteria is met (if divisible without remainder) or via a more complex rollover method when a multiple beat count rolls over to equal a symbol credit.\n\n2. **Packet Credits**: Incremented with each end-of-packet indicator coinciding with a beat (data valid and ready).\n\nThis system is flexible through parameters like USING_PACKETS to enable or disable certain functionality related to packets, thus accommodating varied operational configurations. The credits tracked by this module are presumably used to manage or throttle data throughput or processing resources in larger systems."

Symbol credits are calculated based either on a fixed ratio per beat or through counting and detecting rollovers, dependent on the relationship between SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT and SYMBOLS_PER_CREDIT.\n- **packet_credits [15:0]**: This output shows the number of packet credits accumulated.

It indicates whether a valid data beat is available for processing. Its state transitions help determine when to calculate and update credits.\n- **eop_beat (end of packet beat)**: This signal is activated when a 'beat' coincides with the end-of-packet signal (`in_endofpacket`). It is crucial for managing packet credits and is used in scenarios where packet tracking is applicable, driven by the USE_PACKETS parameter.\n- **sym_count**: This signal maintains a running count of symbols processed. It is essential for handling credit calculations, particularly when symbol credits need to be computed over multiple beats.\n- **next_sym_count**: This is the projected (or next) value of `sym_count` considering the current operational conditions. It is calculated each clock cycle and helps determine if there will be a rollover situation.\n- **rollover**: This signal indicates when the symbol count reaches or exceeds the threshold set by SYMBOLS_PER_CREDIT. It triggers the resetting of `sym_count` and an increment in symbol credits, and it also considers end-of-packet conditions."
