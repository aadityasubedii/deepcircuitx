Module name: alt_vipitc130_common_sample_counter.
Module specification: The `alt_vipitc130_common_sample_counter` is a Verilog module that dynamically adjusts its behavior based on configuration parameters and input signals to efficiently manage sample counting for different operational modes related to color planes in a video processing context. It accepts inputs such as `rst` (reset), `clk` (clock), `sclr` (synchronous clear), `count_cycle` (indicator of countable cycles), and `hd_sdn` (which modifies counting logic and sample identification based on its state). It produces outputs `count_sample` (indicating if the current cycle is part of a sample), `start_of_sample` (indicating initiation of a new sample), and `sample_ticks` (number of counted cycles in the current sample, size determined by `LOG2_NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES`). Internally, the module uses `count_valids`, a register to track valid cycles, more specifically, it is utilized in multiple color plane scenarios to manage the count of cycles constituting a complete sample. `new_sample`, a wire signal, derives from `count_valids` to indicate when a sample limit is met thereby necessitating a sample turnover. The code employs conditional generation (using `generate` blocks) which delineates between single and multiple color plane setups: for single plane, the processing is straightforward with constant outputs, while for multiple planes, a more complex logic using registers and conditional checks governs the outputs. The module ensures its versatile functionality can cater to systems with varying characteristics defined by the parameters, especially adjusting to the presence and interaction of multiple colour planes.
