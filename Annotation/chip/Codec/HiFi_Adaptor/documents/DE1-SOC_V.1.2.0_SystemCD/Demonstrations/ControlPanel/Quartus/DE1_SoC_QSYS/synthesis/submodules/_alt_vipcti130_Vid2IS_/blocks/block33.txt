This block determines if the current sample is the last one during vertical sync periods. It utilizes a logical AND operation, combining `valid_reg` with the OR result of `start_of_vsync` and `end_of_vsync` to identify if the sample is at the start or end of these periods, marking it as the last sample if these conditions are met.
