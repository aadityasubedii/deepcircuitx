    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a memory physical layer (PHY) interface for an SDRAM controller in a Hard Processor System (HPS). It manages low-level interactions between the controller and memory devices, handling data I/O, address/command signals, clock generation, and control signals. The module uses a HardMemPHY instance, reset logic, clock management (PLLs/DLLs), and I/O pads to achieve its functionality. It supports various memory operations, timing adjustments, and calibration features to ensure proper signal integrity and timing for memory transactions."
