Module-level comment: The alt_vipitc130_IS2Vid_calculate_mode module calculates and outputs essential video timing parameters for video synchronization. It takes input signals including frame, sync, and porch dimensions for potentially interlaced and serial output video. Using internal computations for active lines, total number of lines, and sync start times, the module delivers outputs like sync timings, blanking intervals, and vertical/horizontal start/end positions. These are vital for the subsequent stages of video signal processing and display adjustments.
