    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipcti130_common_sample_counter.\n\nModule specification: The alt_vipcti130_common_sample_counter is a Verilog module designed to count sample cycles based on input signals and the configuration of the number of color planes. It handles both single and multiple color plane arrangements differently using conditional generation blocks. The input ports include 'rst' (a reset signal that initializes the state), 'clk' (the clock signal guiding the module's operation), 'sclr' (a synchronous clear that resets counters following the clock's edge), 'count_cycle' (signal indicating a cycle to be counted), and 'hd_sdn' (which affects counting when high definition shutdown is active). The output ports are 'count_sample' (indicating a sample count based on conditions), 'start_of_sample' (marking the beginning of a new sample), and 'sample_ticks' (showing the number of cycles per sample based on the number of color planes and defined by LOG2_NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES bits width). Internally, the module uses 'count_valids' (a register that counts valid cycles and triggers a new sample start when it reaches a threshold determined by the number of color planes) and 'new_sample' (a wire determining when to start a new sample based on the 'count_valids' comparison). For a single color plane, it outputs the 'count_cycle' directly as 'count_sample' and marks every cycle as a new sample, with 'sample_ticks' output reset to zero. For multiple color planes, logic includes conditions based on 'hd_sdn', manages counting cycles, and determines when to start a new sample based on 'count_valids'. This module adapts to configurations through parameters like the NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES, COLOUR_PLANES_ARE_IN_PARALLEL, and LOG2_NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES, which influence the operations within conditional blocks.",

It operates differently based on the number of color planes specified. If only one color plane is used, it simply outputs the count cycle as the sample count and marks every cycle as the start of a new sample. For more than one color plane, it uses a more complex logic to calculate when a new sample starts and how many ticks (count cycles) occur for each sample. The module handles both reset conditions and an optional clear signal, and incorporates logic to deal with high definition shutdown signaling through its `hd_sdn` input, which influences the sample counting behavior."

It is derived based on the equality comparison between the `count_valids` register and the total number of color planes minus one. When `count_valids` has counted up to this value, `new_sample` indicates the end of one sample cycle and the start of another, influencing both `count_sample` and `start_of_sample` outputs under conditions of multiple colour planes.\n\n- count_valids: A register signal used to count valid sample cycles up to a certain threshold determined by the number of color planes. Its width is set by `LOG2_NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES`. It increments every cycle where `count_cycle` is asserted, or resets to zero when a new sample is indicated by `new_sample`. This signal helps in keeping track of the number of cycles counted for each sample when handling multiple color planes. It is also directly used to determine when a new sample should start and feeds directly into the `sample_ticks` output, indicating the ticks per sample count in multi-plane mode."
