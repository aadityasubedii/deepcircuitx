    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipitc130_common_sync.\nModule specification: The alt_vipitc130_common_sync is a Verilog-based synchronization module designed to handle potential metastability issues when transferring signals across different clock domains. The module features parameters `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME` and `WIDTH` to adjust its operation based on whether the input and output clocks are the same and to set the width of the data signals, respectively. The input ports include `rst` (reset), used to initialize the synchronization registers to a known state; `sync_clock`, which controls the synchronization stages when clocks differ; and `data_in`, a parameterized multi-bit input data signal. The output port `data_out` provides the synchronized data signal. Internal signals `data_out_sync0` and `data_out_sync1` function as intermediate registers in a two-stage synchronization process. When `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME = 0`, `data_in` first passes through `data_out_sync0` at the rising edge of `sync_clock`, and then `data_out_sync1` captures this output at the subsequent rising edge, thereby mitigating metastability risk. The code uses a generate block to implement conditions when clocks differ, allowing `data_out` to either directly equal `data_in` if clocks are the same or pass through the two synchronization stages if not. FPGA-specific attributes set properties and constraints for the synthesis tools concerning the registers used as synchronizers.\n",

It handles the potential metastability issues through a two-stage flip-flop synchronization scheme if the input and output are not clocked by the same signal (CLOCK_ARE_SAME = 0). The module accepts a parameterized input `data_in` and outputs a synchronized version `data_out` across potentially different clock domains. If the input and output clocks are the same, it directly assigns the input to the output. If not, it uses a generate block to construct synchronization logic where `data_in` gets synchronized through intermediate registers `data_out_sync0` and `data_out_sync1` with the `sync_clock`, thus safely transferring the data between different clock domains. Additional FPGA-specific attributes are set for the registers to ensure correct handling by synthesis tools regarding their treatment as synchronizers and to ignore timing checks between these registers."

It's crucial for setting up a stable initial state and resolving any potential issues from power-up or undesired mid-operation states.  \n- sync_clock: This is the clock input with respect to which `data_in` will be synchronized when the clocks are not the same (CLOCK_ARE_SAME = 0). It can be a different clock domain than the one `data_in` originates from, and it controls the timing of the synchronization stages within the module.  \n- data_in: This is the multi-bit input data signal that needs to be synchronized to the `sync_clock` domain if the input and output clocks are different. Its width is parameterized by the `WIDTH` parameter, allowing for flexibility in data size.\n\nOutput ports: data_out.  \nExplanation:  \n- data_out: This is the multi-bit output data signal that has been synchronized to the `sync_clock` clock domain if the input and output clocks are different, or directly forwarded from `data_in` if they are the same. The width of `data_out` is also determined by the `WIDTH` parameter and matches the width of `data_in`.

It captures `data_in` at the rising edge of `sync_clock` when the input and output clocks are not the same (CLOCK_ARE_SAME = 0). This register helps reduce the possibility of metastability by providing a buffer stage before the data reaches the final output.  \n- data_out_sync1: This is the second and final synchronization stage register. It captures the output from `data_out_sync0` at the next rising edge of `sync_clock`. Having this second synchronization stage further mitigates the risks associated with metastability by providing a more stable data output which is then assigned to `data_out`. This two-stage synchronization mechanism ensures safer data transactions between different clock domains."
