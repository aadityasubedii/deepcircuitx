This block assigns a specific segment of data from a register array to the signal `vid_packet_words_bank0_bits_FROM_slave_TO_controller`. It extracts the data starting from the index `(SLAVE_DATA_REQUIREDWIDTH*2)` to `(SLAVE_DATA_REQUIREDWIDTH*2)+SLAVE_DATA_REQUIREDWIDTH-1`, effectively sourcing one segment (with a width equal to `SLAVE_DATA_REQUIREDWIDTH`) from a larger dataset, transferring data from a slave to a controller module.
