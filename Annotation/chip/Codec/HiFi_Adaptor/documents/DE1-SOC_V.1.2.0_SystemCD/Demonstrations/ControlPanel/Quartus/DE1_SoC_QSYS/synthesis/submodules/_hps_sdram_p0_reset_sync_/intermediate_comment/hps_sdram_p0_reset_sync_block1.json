    "block_comment": "This block generates synchronized reset signals. It uses a slice of a registered reset signal array `reset_reg` to produce multiple reset outputs, where the number of outputs is defined by `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT`. The slice starts from `RESET_SYNC_STAGES - 1` to `RESET_SYNC_STAGES + NUM_RESET_OUTPUT - 2`, ensuring each output is synchronized over the specified stages, enhancing the stability and reliability of the reset functionality across different parts of the circuit."
