Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk. Module specification: The module "DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk" is designed for handling JTAG debug functionalities synchronized with the system clock for debugging a CPU system. It processes debug commands based on input registers tied to JTAG's instruction and status updates. The input ports include `clk` for the clock signal; `ir_in`, a 2-bit instruction register input determining the debug operation; `sr`, a 38-bit status register providing status information; and `vs_udr` and `vs_uir` signals which indicate updates to data and instruction registers respectively. The output ports comprise the 38-bit `jdo` JTAG data output, multiple action indicators such as `take_action_break_a`, conditional memory access controls like `take_action_ocimem_a`, and trace handling signals including `take_action_tracectrl`. Internally, the module uses signals like `enable_action_strobe` for action control, `ir` for storing the current operational code, and synchronizing signals such as `sync_udr` to handle the propagation of the external signals delicately to avoid metastability. The main sections in the Verilog code include the instantiation of standard synchronizers for input signal stabilization, sequential logic for state and action updates based on clock edges, and combinational logic to control the outputs based on the status of internal registers and the decoded instruction signals. The module thus efficiently integrates synchronization, decision-making based on input commands, and the direct control of system outputs necessary for effective debugging of the CPU, ensuring a robust and reliable debugging interface.
