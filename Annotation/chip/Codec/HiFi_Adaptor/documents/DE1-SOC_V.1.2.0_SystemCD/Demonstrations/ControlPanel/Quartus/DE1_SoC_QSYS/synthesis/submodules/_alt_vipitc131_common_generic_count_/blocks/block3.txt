This block controls the counting mechanism, enabling it conditionally. `enable_count` is assigned based on whether `enable` is active and either the `ticks` count has reached a predefined limit minus one (`TICKS_PER_COUNT - 1`) or the `enable_ticks` is inactive, allowing the system logic to either progress based on a tick count or operate uninhibited if tick enabling is turned off.
