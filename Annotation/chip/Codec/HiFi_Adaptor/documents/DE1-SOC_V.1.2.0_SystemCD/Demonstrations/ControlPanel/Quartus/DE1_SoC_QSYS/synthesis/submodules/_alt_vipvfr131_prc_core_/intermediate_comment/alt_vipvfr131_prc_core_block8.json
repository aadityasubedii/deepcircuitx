    "block_comment": "This Verilog block represents a state machine that's controlled by a clock and a reset signal. The state machine transitions between IDLE, WAITING, RUNNING and ENDING states, managing command (CMD) events, data reading and writing, and signal validations. On reset, certain signals and states are initialized. For normal operation: in the IDLE state, the machine prepares for a new operation by setting the CMD flag, status, and other necessary signals based on certain conditions; in the WAITING state, the CMD flag is cleared and the machine transitions to RUNNING when enabled; in RUNNING, data is read, signals are updated, and it transitions to ENDING when reading is completed and certain conditions are met; finally in ENDING, status is updated, reading is completed and machine returns to IDLE state. Signal validation and assignment is done at every state. A shift register is used to manage input validation."
