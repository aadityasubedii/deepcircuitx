It facilitates the process by reading input data (data_in) when it's not stalled (enabled by ena, which is true when not stalled by stall_in), adapting it from a width of DATA_WIDTH_IN to DATA_WIDTH_OUT using an internal module (fu_inst), and forwarding it to the output (data_out) while managing control signals like write and read based on stall conditions from both input (stall_in) and output (stall_out) sides. The module also responds to a reset condition by setting write to low and handles data discard driven by a clear signal."
