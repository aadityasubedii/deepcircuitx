Module name: alt_vipvfr130_common_avalon_mm_master.
Module specification: The alt_vipvfr130_common_avalon_mm_master module is designed to act as an Avalon MM (Memory-Mapped) master, facilitating data transfer and control within an FPGA system or between FPGAs. It handles both read and write operations, burst transfers, and FIFO operations for data and command handling. The module operates with distinct input and output ports: input signals such as clock, reset, address (addr), and data signals (writedata); and output signals like av_address and readdata, among others. The primary internal signals in the module include ena (enables FIFO operation when not stalled), cenable (constantly enables command FIFO operations), and stall (manages data flow and backpressure). Notably, the module interconnects with a sub-module named alt_vipvfr130_common_avalon_mm_bursting_master_fifo, which is configured with specific parameters such as ADDR_WIDTH and DATA_WIDTH to support the required data and address sizes, as well as flags like READ_USED and WRITE_USED to manage read and write capabilities. This sub-module handles the actual implementation of the burst operations and data FIFOs, interfacing with the Avalon MM protocols for address and data management. The main module serves as the overarching control structure, linking the internal logic and submodules to the input commands and external interface requirements, ensuring synchronization and operational integrity according to the Avalon MM standards.
