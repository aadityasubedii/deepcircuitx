This block manages the edge capture process for a specific signal bit within a register. Upon a positive clock edge or negative reset, it checks the reset condition; if asserted low, it clears the edge capture register at position 4 to zero. If not reset, and if clock enable (`clk_en`) is true, it next checks if there's a write strobe (`edge_capture_wr_strobe`); if true, it also clears this register. If neither reset nor strobe are active but an edge is detected on this specific bit (`edge_detect[4]`), the register is set to -1, indicating a detected edge.
