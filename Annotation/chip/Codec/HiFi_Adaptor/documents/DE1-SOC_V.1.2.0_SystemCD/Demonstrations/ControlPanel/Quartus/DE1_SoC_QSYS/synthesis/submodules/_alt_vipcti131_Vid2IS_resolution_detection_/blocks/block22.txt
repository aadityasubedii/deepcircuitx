Comment: 
This Verilog code block manages the count of active lines for frame 1. Depending on conditions, it updates the count or resets it. If 'reset_f1' is high, the count is shifted right by one bit and the least significant bit is set to 0. If 'update_active_line_f1' is true, it updates the count to 'next_active_line_count' with the LSB set to 1. Otherwise, it retains the current count.
