    "module": "Module-level comment: The alt_vipcti131_common_fifo module is a configurable FIFO buffer supporting single-clock or dual-clock operation modes based on the CLOCKS_ARE_SAME setting. It dynamically sets FIFO address widths using the alt_clogb2 function for efficient memory management. Depending on clock settings, it either uses a scfifo or a dcfifo, optimized for speed and synchronization, and can employ embedded array blocks for enhanced performance."
