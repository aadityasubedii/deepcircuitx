This block constructs a concatenated address `test_addr` for testing purposes. It combines two smaller address segments, `addr_crb` and `addr_col`, using Verilog's concatenation operator `{}`, where `addr_crb` forms the higher bits and `addr_col` comprises the lower bits of `test_addr`. This concatenation enables creating a broader address space by utilizing both row and column addresses.
