It accepts a one-hot encoded input vector `one_hot` where only one bit is high at any time, corresponding to the active mode. The module outputs a binary number `binary` which represents the index of the active mode (zero-based). The number of modes (`NO_OF_MODES`) and the logarithm base 2 of the number of modes (`LOG2_NO_OF_MODES`) are parameterized, allowing for flexible adaptation to different sizes of one-hot vectors. The conversion process utilizes nested generate blocks to assign values conditionally based on the active bit in the one-hot input, with further reshaping and reduction to form the final binary output."

Explanation: The `one_hot` input is a vector of bits where only one bit is typically set to high (1) at any instance. This vector represents a one-hot encoded signal, indicating the active mode among multiple possible modes, with each bit corresponding to a specific mode. The length of this vector is determined by the parameter `NO_OF_MODES`.\n\nOutput ports: [binary]. Explanation: The `binary` output is a vector of bits that holds the binary representation of the index of the currently active mode indicated by the `one_hot` input vector. This is a zero-based index where the position of the active high bit in the one-hot vector is translated into its binary form.

It realigns them so that bits that contribute to the same binary output position across all modes are grouped together.
