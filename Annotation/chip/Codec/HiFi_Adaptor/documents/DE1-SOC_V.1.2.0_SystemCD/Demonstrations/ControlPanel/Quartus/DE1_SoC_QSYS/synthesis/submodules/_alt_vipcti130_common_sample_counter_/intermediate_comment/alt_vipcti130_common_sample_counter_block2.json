    "block_comment": "This code block determines the initiation of a sample based on hardware signal or counter status. The `start_of_sample` signal is asserted high (`1'b1`) when `hd_sdn` is high, otherwise it checks if `count_valids` equals zero (all bits are zero in the count of valid color planes specific to `LOG2_NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES`)."
