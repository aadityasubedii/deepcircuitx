    "module": "Module-level comment: The `alt_vipcti130_common_fifo` module implements a configurable FIFO buffer for data management within single or cross-clock domain systems. It handles variable data widths and depths, using `scfifo` for same clock domains, and `dcfifo` for dual-clock setups. The module configures internal FIFO behavior via parameters and exploits generate blocks to selectively instantiate and set up the FIFO based on the clock configuration, enhancing adaptability and performance for specific system requirements."
