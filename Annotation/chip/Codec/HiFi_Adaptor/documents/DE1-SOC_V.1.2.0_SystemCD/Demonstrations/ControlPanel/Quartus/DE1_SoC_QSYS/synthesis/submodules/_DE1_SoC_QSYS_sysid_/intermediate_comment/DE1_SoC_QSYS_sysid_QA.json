It outputs a 32-bit value based on the input 'address'. If the 'address' input is high (logic 1), it outputs the 32-bit hexadecimal value '525D2B41' (which is 1381894597 in decimal), otherwise, it outputs 0. This functionality is useful for systems where a specific ID needs to be read based on an address input, often utilized in identifying or validating hardware components within a system. The module operates synchronously with a clock input and an active-low reset signal 'reset_n', although these are not explicitly used in the logic presented."

A high signal (logic 1) on this input leads the module to output a specific 32-bit ID.\n- 'clock': This is the clock input signal for the module. It is included for synchronizing the operations in a typical digital system, though it's not explicitly used in the current logic of this module.\n- 'reset_n': This is an active-low reset signal. It is generally used to initialize or reset the state of a module or system. Like 'clock', it is included in the interface standard but not employed in the operational logic of this given example.\n\nOutput ports: [readdata]. \nExplanation: \n- 'readdata': This is a 32-bit output port which outputs data based on the state of the 'address' input. When 'address' is high (logic 1), 'readdata' outputs the hex value '525D2B41' (1381894597 in decimal). When 'address' is low (logic 0), the output is 0.
