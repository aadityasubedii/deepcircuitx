The core functionality includes synchronizing the streaming of data packets based on the 'enable' signal and the internal synchronization states. When enabled, it manages the data flow by verifying when the output buffer (dout) is ready and allowing data from the input buffer (int) to pass through, handling start-of-packet (sop) and end-of-packet (eop) conditions. This module ensures data is correctly aligned and transferred only when it is validated and the output buffer is ready for new data, maintaining synchronization with packet beginnings and endings, maximizing data integrity and flow control."
