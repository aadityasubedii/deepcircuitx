Comment: 
This Verilog block manages the interrupt mask register based on chip operations. Upon a negative edge reset, the interrupt mask is cleared to `0`. If the chip is selected, a write operation is detected, and the targeted address is `2`, it updates the `irq_mask` with the least significant 10 bits of `writedata`.
