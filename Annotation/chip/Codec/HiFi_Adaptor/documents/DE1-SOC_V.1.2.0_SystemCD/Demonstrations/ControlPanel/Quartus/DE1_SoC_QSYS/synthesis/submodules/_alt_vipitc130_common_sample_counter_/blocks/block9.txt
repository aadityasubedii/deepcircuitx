This Verilog block configures the sampling process based on the number of color planes to be processed. For a single color plane, the block directly assigns `count_cycle` to `count_sample` and sets `start_of_sample` high, while keeping `sample_ticks` low, implying straightforward propagation without conditional checks. For multiple color planes, a register `count_valids` is used to track valid samples, and a wire `new_sample` determines when all planes have been sampled, resetting once it matches (NUMBER_OF_COLOR_PLANES-1). This setup manages sampling complexities over differing numbers of color planes, enhancing modularity.
