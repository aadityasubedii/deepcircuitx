    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipvfr130_prc_read_master. \nModule specification: The `alt_vipvfr130_prc_read_master` module acts as a master read controller optimized for interfacing with an Avalon-MM bus protocol. It primarily handles read operations from memory, utilizing command signals like address, read/write operation indicators, burst mode configurations, and burst lengths. Essential inputs include `clock` and `reset` for synchronizing and resetting module operations, configuration commands like `cmd_addr`, `cmd_write_instead_of_read`, and `cmd_burst_instead_of_single_op`, and `ena` for module activation. Outputs such as `stall` indicate module readiness and ports like `av_address`, `av_read`, and `av_burstcount` control Avalon bus interactions. Internal signals like `read_FROM_width_adaptor_TO_master_fifo` and `readdata_FROM_master_fifo_TO_width_adaptor` manage data flow between the master FIFO and the width adapter, serving crucial roles in data handling and transfer. The module comprises two main blocks: `alt_vipvfr130_common_avalon_mm_bursting_master_fifo` which manages FIFO operations for commands and data, and `alt_vipvfr130_common_pulling_width_adapter` that adjusts data widths for output. The fusion of these components ensures efficient data traffic management and burst-read operations, solidifying the module's capability to handle complex memory interfacing tasks seamlessly.",

Essential inputs include `clock` and `reset` for synchronizing and resetting module operations, configuration commands like `cmd_addr`, `cmd_write_instead_of_read`, and `cmd_burst_instead_of_single_op`, and `ena` for module activation. Outputs such as `stall` indicate module readiness and ports like `av_address`, `av_read`, and `av_burstcount` control Avalon bus interactions. Internal signals like `read_FROM_width_adaptor_TO_master_fifo` and `readdata_FROM_master_fifo_TO_width_adaptor` manage data flow between the master FIFO and the width adapter, serving crucial roles in data handling and transfer. The module comprises two main blocks: `alt_vipvfr130_common_avalon_mm_bursting_master_fifo` which manages FIFO operations for commands and data, and `alt_vipvfr130_common_pulling_width_adapter` that adjusts data widths for output. The fusion of these components ensures efficient data traffic management and burst-read operations, solidifying the module's capability to handle complex memory interfacing tasks seamlessly."
