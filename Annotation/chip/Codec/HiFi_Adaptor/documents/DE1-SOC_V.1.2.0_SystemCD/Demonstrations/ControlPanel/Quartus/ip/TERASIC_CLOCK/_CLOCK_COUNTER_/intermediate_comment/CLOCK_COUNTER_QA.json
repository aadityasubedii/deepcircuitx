It counts upward upon each clock cycle when enabled and not asynchronously cleared, reset, or loaded with specific conditions. The counter outputs a 32-bit `q` value representing the count. Input signals such as `aclr` for asynchronous clear and `clk_en` for clock enable control its operation. The module operates exclusively in the \"UP\" counting mode as indicated by the parameter settings."
