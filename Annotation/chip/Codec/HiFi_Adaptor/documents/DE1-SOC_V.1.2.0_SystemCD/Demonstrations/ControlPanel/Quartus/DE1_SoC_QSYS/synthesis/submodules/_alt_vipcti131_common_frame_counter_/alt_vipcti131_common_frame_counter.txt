Module-level comment: The 'alt_vipcti131_common_frame_counter' is a video processing module handling frame counting via horizontal (h_count) and vertical (v_count) counters, based on clock (clk) and reset (rst) signals. It adjusts counts using internal (`count_sample`, `h_total_int`, `v_total_int`) and external (`enable`, `hd_sdn`, `h_reset`, `v_reset`) signals, integrated with a sub-module for precision color sampling. This design achieves synchronous control of video frame progression, managing line and frame transitions effectively.
