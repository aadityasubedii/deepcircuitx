    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_reset_synchronizer` module synchronizes reset signals in FPGA designs across different clock domains. It uses a parameterized shift register (`altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain`) to manage reset states under both synchronous and asynchronous modes, controlled by the `ASYNC_RESET` parameter. In asynchronous mode, resets immediately propagate through the register upon `reset_in` assertion, while in synchronous mode, `reset_in` is clock-aligned. The final synchronized reset output (`reset_out`) stems from the last register state, ensuring stability in subsequent logic circuits."
