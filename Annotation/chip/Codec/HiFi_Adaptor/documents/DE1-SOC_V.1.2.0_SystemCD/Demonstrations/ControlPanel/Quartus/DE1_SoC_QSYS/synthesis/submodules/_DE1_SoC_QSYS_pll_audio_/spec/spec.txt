Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll_audio. 
Module specification:
The DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll_audio is a Verilog module designed for audio applications. It configures and instantiates a phase-locked loop (PLL) using the Altera PLL component, tailored for generating a clock suitable for audio processing at a frequency of 18.432 MHz. The module inputs a reference clock (`refclk`) used as the base frequency and a reset signal (`rst`) for initializing the PLL. It outputs a clock signal (`outclk_0`) and a status signal (`locked`), indicating whether the PLL has locked to the desired frequency. Internal signals include `altera_pll_i.rst`, which connects to the input reset; `altera_pll_i.refclk`, linked to the reference clock; `altera_pll_i.outclk`, which includes the output clock configured at 18.432 MHz; and `altera_pll_i.locked` that ties to the lock status output. The PLL is instantiated with various parameters, including the enabling of a fractional VCO multiplier and setting most output configurations for other clocks to zero, since only one output clock is used. This module incorporates standard settings for phase shifts and duty cycles while focusing on generating a single, precise clock output essential for audio applications.
