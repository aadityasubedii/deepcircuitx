    "module": "Module-level comment: The alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_av_st_output module processes video data streams, handling conversion and control in relation to sync settings, prediction, and interlacing. It utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) to transition between states like IDLE, CONTROL_HEADER, WIDTH adjustments, HEIGHT adjustments, and data outputs (HEADER, OUTPUT_DATA, OUTPUT_ANC), managing both packet and data flow based on internal and external readiness signals. This design ensures robust and synchronized video data handling, conditioned for real-time streaming applications."
