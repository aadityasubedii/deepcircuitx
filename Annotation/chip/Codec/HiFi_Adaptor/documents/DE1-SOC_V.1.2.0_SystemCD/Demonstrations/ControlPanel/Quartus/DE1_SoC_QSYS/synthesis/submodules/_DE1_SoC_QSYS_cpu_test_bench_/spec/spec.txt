Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_test_bench. Module specification: This module is a test bench for a CPU in a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, designed to validate the correctness of the CPU implementation. It has numerous input ports including control signals (e.g., A_ctrl_ld_non_bypass, A_en), register values (e.g., A_bstatus_reg, A_estatus_reg), memory access signals (e.g., d_address, d_read), and clock/reset signals. Output ports include filtered versions of some input signals (e.g., A_wr_data_filtered, M_bht_ptr_filtered) and a test completion indicator (test_has_ended). Internal signals comprise decoded instruction operation signals (W_op_*), registered versions of some inputs (A_mem_b
