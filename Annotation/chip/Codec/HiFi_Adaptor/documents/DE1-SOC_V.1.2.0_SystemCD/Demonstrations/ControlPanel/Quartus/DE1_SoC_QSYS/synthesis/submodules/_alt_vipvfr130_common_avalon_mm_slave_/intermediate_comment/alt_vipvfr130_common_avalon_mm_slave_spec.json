    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipvfr130_common_avalon_mm_slave.\nModule specification: This module is a Verilog implementation designed to act as an Avalon Memory-Mapped (MM) slave interface for managing read/write operations in an FPGA environment. It reacts dynamically to addresses and commands received over the Avalon bus interface. The input ports include a reset (`rst`), clock signal (`clk`), Avalon address bus (`av_address`), read (`av_read`), and write (`av_write`) control signals, write data bus (`av_writedata`), clear enable (`clear_enable`), data for internal registers (`registers_in`), internal register write control (`registers_write`), interrupt signals array (`interrupts`), and stopped condition indicators (`stopped`). The output ports consist of the read data bus (`av_readdata`), interrupt request signal (`av_irq`), module enable signal (`enable`), registers' triggers (`triggers`), and the data from internal registers (`registers`). Internal signals such as `global_stopped`, `clear_interrupts`, `triggers_nxt`, `internal_registers`, `interrupt_register`, and `interrupt_enables` are used to handle global states, manage interrupt flags, prepare register updates, store internal data, handle interrupts statuses, and control activated interrupts respectively. The code comprises several blocks: initialization and default settings upon reset or when clear conditions are met, Avalon write operations handling specific to address manipulations for module configurations, Avalon read operations that output specific internal states depending on the addressed queried, and dynamic register and trigger management based on both external commands via Avalon and internal conditions. This organized structure allows the module to efficiently manage hardware control tasks, parameter configuration, and interrupt handling in a modular FPGA design.",

It becomes active when there's a write operation (`av_write`) to the address `2`, which is designated for interrupt control. It uses the address and operation type (read/write) to determine when to reset interrupt flags.\n- **triggers_nxt**: This array signal indicates the next state of each trigger. Each bit in `triggers_nxt` is set when a write operation happens to addresses corresponding to internal registers, essentially prepping the module for a register update at the next clock cycle or as determined by internal logic.\n- **internal_registers**: This array of registers stores data internally. Each register can be accessed and modified via the external Avalon interface or through internal logic pursuant to specific module operations.\n- **interrupt_register**: Manages the status of interrupts. It is updated either by clearing specific bits when interrupts are acknowledged and cleared (controlled by `clear_interrupts`), or by setting bits when interrupts are active and the corresponding enable is set (`interrupt_enables`).\n- **interrupt_enables**: This register array shows which interrupts are enabled. Only enabled interrupts will affect the `interrupt_register`, meaning an active interrupt that is not enabled would not cause an update or trigger any internal or external actions prompted by an interrupt state."

It reacts dynamically to addresses and commands received over the Avalon bus interface. The input ports include a reset (`rst`), clock signal (`clk`), Avalon address bus (`av_address`), read (`av_read`), and write (`av_write`) control signals, write data bus (`av_writedata`), clear enable (`clear_enable`), data for internal registers (`registers_in`), internal register write control (`registers_write`), interrupt signals array (`interrupts`), and stopped condition indicators (`stopped`). The output ports consist of the read data bus (`av_readdata`), interrupt request signal (`av_irq`), module enable signal (`enable`), registers' triggers (`triggers`), and the data from internal registers (`registers`). Internal signals such as `global_stopped`, `clear_interrupts`, `triggers_nxt`, `internal_registers`, `interrupt_register`, and `interrupt_enables` are used to handle global states, manage interrupt flags, prepare register updates, store internal data, handle interrupts statuses, and control activated interrupts respectively. The code comprises several blocks: initialization and default settings upon reset or when clear conditions are met, Avalon write operations handling specific to address manipulations for module configurations, Avalon read operations that output specific internal states depending on the addressed queried, and dynamic register and trigger management based on both external commands via Avalon and internal conditions. This organized structure allows the module to efficiently manage hardware control tasks, parameter configuration, and interrupt handling in a modular FPGA design."
