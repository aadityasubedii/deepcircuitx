    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipcti131_common_sync. \nModule specification: The alt_vipcti131_common_sync module is designed for signal synchronization across different or the same clock domains, using a dual D-type flip-flop approach. This module handles the synchronization of an input vector `data_in` towards `data_out`. The input port `rst` is an asynchronous reset that clears the state of synchronization, `sync_clock` is the controlling clock for the synchronization process, and `data_in` provides the data bits to be synchronized with a width specified by the parameter WIDTH. The output `data_out` delivers the vector consisting of synchronized data bits. Internally, `data_out_sync0` and `data_out_sync1` are registers capturing data at two consecutive edges of `sync_clock`, effectively mitigating the risk of metastability. The module uses a conditional generate statement to alter its behavior based on the parameter `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME`. If clocks are the same, `data_out` directly mirrors `data_in`. Otherwise, data passes through the two flip-flops with potential resets controlled by `rst`. The use of specific `altera_attribute` settings guides synthesis tools on handling synchronization correctly, emphasizing its criticality in asynchronous interfaces. This architectural approach ensures robust data transfer across clock boundaries or within the same clock domain, providing a stable and safe output.",

It uses dual D-type flip-flops (data_out_sync0 and data_out_sync1) to synchronize an input data signal 'data_in' to the output 'data_out' based on the clock signal 'sync_clock'. When the reset signal 'rst' is asserted, both flip-flops are reset to zero. If the clocks of the input and output are the same (controlled by the parameter CLOCKS_ARE_SAME), the output directly follows the input to avoid unnecessary synchronization. Otherwise, 'data_in' is synchronized through the cascaded flip-flops to mitigate metastability risks in asynchronous interfaces. The module also utilizes specific attributes (altera_attribute) to guide synthesis tools on handling synchronization correctly."

This signal helps ensure the circuit starts correctly during power-up or any other situations where a defined initialization is required.\n- sync_clock: The clock signal under which the synchronization takes place. It is used for clocking the dual flip-flops through which data synchronization across possibly different clock domains is managed.\n- data_in: The data input which needs to be synchronized. It is a vector with a width defined by the parameter WIDTH. This input provides the actual data bits that are intended to be synchronized from the source clock domain to the target clock domain defined by sync_clock.\n\nOutput ports: data_out. \nExplanation: \n- data_out: The synchronized output data which is assumed to be stable and safe to use in the target clock domain after passing through the dual flip-flop synchronization scheme. This port outputs a vector that matches the width of the input vector data_in. The synchronization mechanism minimizes the risk of metastability issues when transitioning between different clock domains or ensuring coherency within the same clock domain if required.\n"
