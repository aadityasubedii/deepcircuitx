Comment: 
The block of code assigns a fixed value to two output signals in a data packet, specifically the start of the packet and the end of the packet. The implementation uses an `assign` statement, which is the Verilog way of setting values to a signal. The values are both set to zero (denoted by 2'b0 in Verilog), reflecting an idle state indicating no ongoing transmission of a packet.
