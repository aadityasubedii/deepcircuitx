It tracks the counts separately for each clock signal and provides an interface to read these counts. The module uses a central clock signal, s_clk_in, and includes functionality to start counting based on a command received (by writing a non-zero value to a specific address). The counting can be stopped by writing zero or reaching a countdown limit. The module also supports functionality to reset the counts and stop counting based on a reset signal or an internal trigger mechanism that reacts to state changes in the counting process. The output gives the status of whether it is currently counting and the counts of CLK_1 and CLK_2 cycles."

It helps in controlling the counting operations for both clocks.\n- `cnt_down`: This register holds the countdown value. It's decremented on each clock cycle when the module is in the counting mode and used to determine when to stop counting.\n- `pre_counting_now`: This is a previous-state holder for the `counting_now` signal. It's used to detect changes in the `counting_now` state (specifically, transition from not counting to counting), which triggers certain actions like resetting clock counters.\n- `trigger_send`: This signal represents a trigger used to reset the clock cycle counters (`clk1_cnt` and `clk2_cnt`). It is set when there's a transition from not counting to counting based on the state change between `pre_counting_now` and `counting_now`.\n- `clk1_cnt` and `clk2_cnt`: These registers count the clock cycles from the external clock inputs `CLK_1` and `CLK_2`, respectively.
