    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code sets the `write_trigger` signal to a constant value of 0. Specifically, the `assign` statement is used for continuous assignment, ensuring that `write_trigger` always holds the value 0, effectively disabling or deactivating any associated write operations that are controlled by this signal."
