It operates through different states, namely IDLE, GUIDANCE, and DATAREAD, to detect, synchronize, and decode the incoming IRDA data packets. The module monitors the duration of high and low signals to transition between these states, decoding the data when in the DATAREAD state. It validates the received data byte by checking it against a complementary half stored within the byte, and if valid, the data is passed to an output register, indicating that the data is ready. The module also handles reset conditions and read commands to manage and output the final decoded data."

The module uses this signal to decode the IRDA data.\n- iREAD: This input is used to indicate whether the IRDA data that has been processed and stored should be read and outputted from the module.\n\nOutput ports: oDATA_REAY, oDATA.\nExplanation:\n- oDATA_REAY: This is the data ready output signal. It indicates whether the decoded data is ready to be read, which is used externally to determine when to read the data from the output port.\n- oDATA: This is the output data port, which provides the final decoded IRDA data. This port outputs the data when it is signalled as ready through the oDATA_REAY signal and a read command is received via iREAD."

It becomes '1' when a complete byte is successfully received and verified, ready to be transferred to the oDATA output when requested.\n- idle_count: This is a counter used to measure the duration of the idle (high) state in the IR signal, helping to transition to the GUIDANCE state if the duration matches specific conditions.\n- idle_count_flag: This flag controls the idle_count. It enables the counter when the system is in the IDLE state and the IRDA signal is low.\n- state_count: A counter used within different states (specifically GUIDANCE) to measure the duration of certain conditions and aid transitions between states.\n- state_count_flag: This flag governs the state_count functionality, enabling or disabling counting based on current conditions aligned with state transitions.\n- data_count: This counter is used in the DATAREAD state to track the duration of the data bits being read.\n- data_count_flag: This flag enables the data_count when the module is in the DATAREAD state and the condition of the incoming data signal requires counting.\n- bitcount: This register counts the number of bits that have been processed in the current packet during the DATAREAD state.
