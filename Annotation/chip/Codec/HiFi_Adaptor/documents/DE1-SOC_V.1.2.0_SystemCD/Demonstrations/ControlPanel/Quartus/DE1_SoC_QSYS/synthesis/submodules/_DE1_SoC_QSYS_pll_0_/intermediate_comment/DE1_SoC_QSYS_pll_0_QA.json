The PLL, implemented with the `altera_pll` instance, takes a reference clock input and generates five different output clocks with specified frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles. Additionally, it provides a 'locked' signal indicating when the PLL has achieved and is maintaining the desired frequency and phase parameters, ensuring stable output clocks for other parts of the system. The module also handles a reset condition (`rst`) which allows for re-initialization of the PLL."

It serves as the source clock from which all other output clocks are derived. The typical frequency for this input is specified in the module configuration.\n- `rst`: This is the reset input. It is used to reinitialize the PLL when activated. This ensures that the PLL starts afresh, re-acquiring lock and stability in case of any disturbances or configuration changes.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`, `outclk_3`, `outclk_4`, `locked`.\nExplanation: \n- `outclk_0` to `outclk_4`: These are output clocks generated by the PLL. Each output clock can be configured to have a specific frequency, phase shift, and duty cycle based on the needs of the application. These clocks are used for various timing and logic operations throughout the FPGA where different frequencies or phase alignments are needed.\n- `locked`: This output signal indicates whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the desired frequencies and phase alignments. A high signal ('1') indicates that all output clocks are stable and operating at their configured parameters, which is critical for reliable system operation."
