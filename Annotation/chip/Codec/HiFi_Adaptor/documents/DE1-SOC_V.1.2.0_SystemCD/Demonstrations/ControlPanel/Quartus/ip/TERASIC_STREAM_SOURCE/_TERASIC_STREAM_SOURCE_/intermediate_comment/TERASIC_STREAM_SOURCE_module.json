    "module": "Module-level comment: The TERASIC_STREAM_SOURCE module generates a configurable video data stream for simulation purposes. It handles video patterns based on input commands and user modes, managing pixel positioning and data validity through sequential and combinational logic. Key operations include pattern selection, dynamic frame updates, and output signaling for packet boundaries, facilitated by internal state management and condition evaluations for the video dimensions and read/write operations."
