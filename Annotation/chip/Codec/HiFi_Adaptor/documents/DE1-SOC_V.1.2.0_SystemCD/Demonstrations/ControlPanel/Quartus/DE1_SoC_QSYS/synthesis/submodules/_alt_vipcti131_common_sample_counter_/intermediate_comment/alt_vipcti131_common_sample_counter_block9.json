    "block_comment": "This block manages the assignment of sample controls based on the configuration of color planes. If there is only one color plane, it directly assigns the cycle count to count_sample, sets start_of_sample high immediately, and keeps sample_ticks low, indicating simple, static control signals. For multiple color planes, it implements dynamic control by using a counter, count_valids, to track valid color samples. When count_valids equals the number of color planes minus one, it triggers new_sample, suggesting that all required color plane samples have been collected for this cycle."
