It features programmable start, stop, and reset functionalities, allowing for fine control over counting operations. The timer can be set to run continuously or to generate interrupts on timeout events, supporting both simple elapsed time tracking and more complex event-driven behaviors. The timer operates on a 32-bit internal counter with separate registers for the high and low parts of the period value, which can be set and read through specified addresses. It also includes functionality for snapshotting the current value of the timer, which can be read back and used, for example, to measure exact intervals or monitor timer status without stopping the counter. The module outputs an interrupt (IRQ) signal when a timeout occurs, if interrupts are enabled. The timer is versatile, designed for generic use across various applications that require precise timing and scheduling capabilities."
