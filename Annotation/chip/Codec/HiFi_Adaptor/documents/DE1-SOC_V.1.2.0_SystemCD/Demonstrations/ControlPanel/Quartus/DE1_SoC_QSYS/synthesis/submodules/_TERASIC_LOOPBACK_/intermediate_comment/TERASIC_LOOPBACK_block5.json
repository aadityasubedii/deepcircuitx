    "block_comment": "This block of code controls the output `lb_out` based on the conditions of `test_dir_invert` and `test_value_invert`. If `test_dir_invert` is true, `lb_out` is set to a high-impedance state using a replicated bit pattern (for the defined `PAIR_NUM`). Otherwise, it outputs either the complement of `test_out` if `test_value_invert` is true, or simply `test_out`. This logic is implemented using a conditional operator to efficiently select the output state based on the input flag conditions."
