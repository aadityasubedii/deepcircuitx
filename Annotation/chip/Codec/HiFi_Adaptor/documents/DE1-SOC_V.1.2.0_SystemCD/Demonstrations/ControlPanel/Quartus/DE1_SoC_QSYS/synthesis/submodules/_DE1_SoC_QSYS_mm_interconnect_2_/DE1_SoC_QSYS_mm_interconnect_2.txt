Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements a memory-mapped interconnect fabric for SoC design, facilitating communication between master and slave components. It uses address routers, demultiplexers, arbiters, and pipeline stages to manage address decoding, data routing, and arbitration. The interconnect supports cross-clock domain transfers and efficient bus protocol handling, enabling seamless integration of various system components.
