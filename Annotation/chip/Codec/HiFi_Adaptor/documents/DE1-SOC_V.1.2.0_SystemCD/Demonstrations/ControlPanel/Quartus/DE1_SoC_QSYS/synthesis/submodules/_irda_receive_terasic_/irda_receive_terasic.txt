Module-level comment: The IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic module decodes infrared signals from an IRDA interface into a 32-bit digital output. Utilizing a state machine approach (IDLE, GUIDANCE, DATAREAD), it manages signal durations through internal counters to accurately transition states and assemble the data. Outputs indicate data validation and readiness based on the defined error-checking mechanism, responsive to clocks and reset inputs for robust operation.
