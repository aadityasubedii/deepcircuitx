    "block_comment": "This block of code extracts a specific video packet base address for bank 1 from a register array. It uses a bit slicing technique to access a slice from an array of registers defined by a calculated index based on `SLAVE_DATA_REQUIREDWIDTH`. The address bits are assigned to the `vid_packet_base_address_bank1_bits_FROM_slave_TO_controller` signal, ensuring that the correct segment of the register contents is extracted based on the width requirements for slave data."
