Module-level comment: The alt_vipitc130_IS2Vid_statemachine is a state machine for video processing synchronization. It handles state transitions based on video packet signals, maintaining synchronization through dynamic adjustments to states like FIND_SOP, WIDTH_*, HEIGHT_*, and others, driven by clock and reset signals. It robustly addresses variations in video data and synchronization losses, operating via defined internal logic and multiple input and output conditions.
