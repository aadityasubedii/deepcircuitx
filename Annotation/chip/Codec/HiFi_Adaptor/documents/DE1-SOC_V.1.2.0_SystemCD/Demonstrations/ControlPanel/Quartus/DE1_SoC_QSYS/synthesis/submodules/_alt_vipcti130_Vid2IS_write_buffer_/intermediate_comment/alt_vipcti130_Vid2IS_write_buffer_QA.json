It supports configurable data widths and a number of color planes. The module processes incoming video data (`data_in`) and control signals (`convert`, `hd_sdn`, `early_eop`) to manage how data is written to an internal buffer (`write_buffer_data`). The buffer stores the data conditionally based on control signals, and outputs it through `data_out` when conditions are met (all valid buffer states or `early_eop`). It also manages packet indicators through `packet_out` based on similar conditions, optimizing transmission or processing paths in video systems. The handling of reset (`rst`), clock (`clk`), and write requests (`wrreq_in/out`) are integral to its operation in synchronization with system requirements. The internal logic implements condition-based data buffering, validity flagging, and packet control, adapting to changes in incoming signals and system states dynamically."

Used to initialize the module and reset all internal states and buffers.\n- clk: Clock input. Serves as the timing signal for the module operations, ensuring synchronous data processing.\n- convert: Control signal for conversion mode, influencing the handling and timing of data buffering.\n- hd_sdn: High definition shutdown signal. Adjusts the handling of data based on the operational mode (standard definition or high definition).\n- early_eop: Early end of packet signal. Indicates that the current cycle is prematurely ending a packet, affecting output readiness and signal generation.\n- wrreq_in: Write request input. Signals when there is valid data on the `data_in` line that needs to be processed or buffered.\n- data_in: Incoming data to be buffered. This is the video data input that is subject to buffering based on the given control signals.\n- packet_in: Indicates whether the `data_in` belongs to a packet, affecting packet buffering logic and output control.\n\nOutput ports: wrreq_out, data_out, packet_out.\nExplanation:\n- wrreq_out: Write request output. Indicates to the downstream elements that the data in the `data_out` is valid and ready to be processed or sent out.\n- data_out: Output data from the buffer. This is the buffered video data made available for further processing or transmission.\n- packet_out: Packet indication output. Mirrors or modifies the input packet indicator (`packet_in`) based on the buffering status and `early_eop` conditions, signaling packet boundaries or status changes."
