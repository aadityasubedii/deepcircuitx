    "module": "Module-level comment: The alt_vipcti131_common_sync_generation module is designed to generate synchronization signals (sof and div) critical for video processing systems. It leverages input control and timing signals, analyzing vertical and horizontal counts to determine frame initiation and adjust frame rates. Internal logic includes enabling sequences and counters, controlled by reset and clock signals, ensuring precise signal timing. This module coordinates its operations through two integrated sub-modules handling frame and division counters, configured via parameterizable attributes for flexibility in various video formats."
