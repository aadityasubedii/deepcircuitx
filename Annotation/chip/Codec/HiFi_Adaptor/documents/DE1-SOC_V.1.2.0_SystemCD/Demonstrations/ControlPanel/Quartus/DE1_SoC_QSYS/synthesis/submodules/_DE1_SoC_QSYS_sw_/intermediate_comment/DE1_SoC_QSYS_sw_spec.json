    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_sw. \n\nModule specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sw is a Verilog module designed for edge detection and interrupt handling based on the input from switches or digital signals. It interfaces with external input through a 10-bit input port 'in_port' and detects rising and falling edges in these signals across clock cycles. Input and output ports include: 'address' and 'chipselect' for selecting internal registers, 'clk' for synchronizing the module operations, 'reset_n' for resetting the module, 'write_n' and 'writedata' for handling write operations, along with 'irq' for outputting interrupt signals and 'readdata' for outputting register data. Internally, it utilizes signals such as 'data_in' for passing the 'in_port' values, 'd1_data_in' and 'd2_data_in' for capturing data across clock cycles to detect edges, 'edge_capture' for storing edge detection statuses, 'irq_mask' for managing interrupt conditions, and several control signals like 'clk_en' and 'edge_capture_wr_strobe'. The code is organized into several blocks handling specific operations such as reset conditions, data capturing and edge detection, register writes, and output preparations. The 'irq' signal is managed based on the masked conditions matched by detected edges, and the read operations are multiplexed based on the selected address. This module is effective for implementing realtime hardware event management in digital systems.\n",

The module reads a 10-bit input signal ('in_port'), detects edges between consecutive clock cycles, and uses specific addresses to control and access interrupt masks, edge capture registers, and input data. It features an interrupt signal output ('irq') which is asserted when a registered edge matches the interrupt mask conditions.

It is monitored to detect changes that might generate interrupts or require action.\n- `reset_n`: An active-low reset signal that resets the internal state and registers of the module when asserted (low).\n- `write_n`: An active-low write enable signal, used to determine when the data in `writedata` should be written to the selected register.\n- `writedata`: A 32-bit input data bus used for writing data into registers within the module based on the address and `chipselect` inputs.\n\nOutput ports: irq, readdata.\nExplanation:\n- `irq`: An output interrupt signal that goes high when an edge is detected on any of the `in_port` inputs that have corresponding bits set in the `irq_mask` register.

It permits the propagation of certain clock-dependent processes in the module, specifically where gating with `clk_en` controls the operation.\n- `d1_data_in`: A register that captures the value of `data_in` at a given clock edge.

Only masked bits will contribute to the `irq` signal when their edges are captured.\n- `read_mux_out`: A wire that multiplexes output data based on the `address` input.

It interfaces with external input through a 10-bit input port 'in_port' and detects rising and falling edges in these signals across clock cycles. Input and output ports include: 'address' and 'chipselect' for selecting internal registers, 'clk' for synchronizing the module operations, 'reset_n' for resetting the module, 'write_n' and 'writedata' for handling write operations, along with 'irq' for outputting interrupt signals and 'readdata' for outputting register data. Internally, it utilizes signals such as 'data_in' for passing the 'in_port' values, 'd1_data_in' and 'd2_data_in' for capturing data across clock cycles to detect edges, 'edge_capture' for storing edge detection statuses, 'irq_mask' for managing interrupt conditions, and several control signals like 'clk_en' and 'edge_capture_wr_strobe'. The code is organized into several blocks handling specific operations such as reset conditions, data capturing and edge detection, register writes, and output preparations. The 'irq' signal is managed based on the masked conditions matched by detected edges, and the read operations are multiplexed based on the selected address. This module is effective for implementing realtime hardware event management in digital systems.\n"
