Module name: TERASIC_IRM. Module specification: The TERASIC_IRM module facilitates interfacing with an infrared receiver important for handling data reception and processing via interrupts. The module receives incoming IR signals and uses an IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic component to decode them. Key inputs include 'clk' (system clock for synchronization), 'reset_n' (active-low system reset), 's_cs_n' (SPI communication control), 's_read' and 's_write' (SPI read and write controls), 's_writedata' (32-bit input data from SPI), and 'ir' (IR data input). It outputs 'irq' (interrupt request when new IR data is available) and 's_readdata' (32-bit output data from IR receiver). Internal signals 'data_ready' and 'pre_data_ready' manage data reception status and interrupt generation; 'data_ready' indicates availability of new IR data, while 'pre_data_ready' stores the previous state of 'data_ready' to detect new data arrivals. The IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic instance receives the IR data and controls, decoding it into a usable format and signaling when new data is ready. The module operation is conducted over two primary blocks: One handles the updating of the 'pre_data_ready' register based on the current 'data_ready' status and system reset conditions; the other manages the 'irq' signal based on 'data_ready' changes, ensuring that interrupts are correctly raised and cleared during SPI write operations or system resets.
