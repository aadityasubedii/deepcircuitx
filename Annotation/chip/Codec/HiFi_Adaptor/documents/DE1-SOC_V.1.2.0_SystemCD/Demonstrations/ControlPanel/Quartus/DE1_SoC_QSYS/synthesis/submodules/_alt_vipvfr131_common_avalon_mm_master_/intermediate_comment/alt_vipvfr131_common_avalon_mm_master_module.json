    "module": "Module-level comment: The `alt_vipvfr131_common_avalon_mm_master` module serves as an Avalon memory-mapped master, managing read and write transactions, including bursts, to memory. It interfaces through distinct clock and reset signals for core and Avalon operations, handling data and command flows via input commands and FIFO-based sub-modules controlled by internal enable and status signals. This setup allows efficient synchronization with the memory interface, ensuring stable and flexible data transactions per the Avalon protocol."
