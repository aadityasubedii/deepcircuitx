This block initializes control and status registers on reset and updates them based on writing operations. On reset, it clears several control registers and status flags, preparing the system for operation. Otherwise, it selectively updates these registers and flags depending on the address accessed and the write operation flag, enabling dynamic control and status monitoring of the system's functionality.
