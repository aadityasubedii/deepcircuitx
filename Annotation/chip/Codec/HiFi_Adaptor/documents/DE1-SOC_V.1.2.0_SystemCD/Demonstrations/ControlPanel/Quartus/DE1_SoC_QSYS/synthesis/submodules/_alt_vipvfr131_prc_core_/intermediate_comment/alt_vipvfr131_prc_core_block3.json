    "block_comment": "This block determines the end-of-packet (EOP) output signal based on the current output validity. If the output is valid (`valid_out` is high), it directly assigns the precomputed EOP signal (`pre_eop_out`) to `eop_out`. If not valid, it retains the previous cycle's EOP state (`eop_out_d1`)."
