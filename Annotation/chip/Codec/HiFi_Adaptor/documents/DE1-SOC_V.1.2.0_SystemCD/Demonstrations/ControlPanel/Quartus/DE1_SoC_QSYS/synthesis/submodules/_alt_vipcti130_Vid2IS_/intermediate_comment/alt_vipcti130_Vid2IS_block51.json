    "block_comment": "This block assigns the reset signal for the video clock domain. It directly connects the general reset signal `rst` to the `rst_vid_clk`, which is likely used to reset components or circuits operating in the video clock domain. This ensures that the video-related parts of the design are reset synchronously with the main reset signal."
