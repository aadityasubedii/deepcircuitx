    "block_comment": "This code block manages the synchronization of the reset signal depending on specific conditions. If no output reset synchronization is needed and no reset request is present, reset signals are directly assigned. Otherwise, it employs dual instances of the `altera_reset_synchronizer` module, customized for both the primary reset and reset request signals, each based on conditions like `SYNC_DEPTH` and whether the reset is asynchronous. This setup ensures that the reset signals are properly synchronized to the system clock for stable operation across different scenarios."
