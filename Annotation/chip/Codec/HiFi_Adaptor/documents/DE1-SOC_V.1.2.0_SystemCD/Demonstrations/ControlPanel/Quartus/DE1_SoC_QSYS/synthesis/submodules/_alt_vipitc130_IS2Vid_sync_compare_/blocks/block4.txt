This block determines if synchronization lines are active. It compares a next vertical reset signal (sync_compare_v_reset_next) to zero and assigns the result to the syncing_lines output. If the next vertical reset signal is greater than zero, syncing_lines is set to true, indicating active synchronization; otherwise, it's false.
