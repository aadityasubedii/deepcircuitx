    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipcti130_common_fifo. \nModule specification: The `alt_vipcti130_common_fifo` is a Verilog module designed to implement a configurable FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer that manages data flow either within the same clock domain or across different clock domains. The module accommodates variable data widths and depths and supports both single-clock and dual-clock FIFO configurations through the parameter `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME`. Input ports include `wrclk` (write clock), `rdreq` (read request), `aclr` (asynchronous clear), `rdclk` (read clock), `wrreq` (write request), and `data` (data to be stored). Output ports consist of `rdusedw` (read words used), `rdempty` (read empty indicator), `wrusedw` (write words used), `wrfull` (write full indicator), and `q` (output data). The module employs an internal signal `input_fifo`, which serves as the FIFO buffer, configurable as either `scfifo` or `dcfifo` based on the clock configuration. The module features blocks for FIFO configuration which include parameter settings for FIFO type, data width, depth, and operational hints aimed at performance maximization. Depending on the `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME` value, appropriate FIFO architecture (single or dual-clock) is instantiated and configured, with special parameters tailored for each type's optimal functionality.\n",

Its configurability lies in handling data of variable widths and depths, and being adaptable to either single-clock or dual-clock FIFO operation. When clocks are the same (`CLOCKS_ARE_SAME` parameter is 1), a single-clock FIFO (`scfifo`) is used, otherwise a dual-clock FIFO (`dcfifo`) is employed. The module includes features such as synchronous resets (`aclr`), data write (`wrreq`) and read requests (`rdreq`), and offers outputs that indicate the status (full, empty) and usage (words used) of the FIFO buffers. These configurations and uses allow for optimized data handling suited for specific system requirements regarding speed and buffer sizing."

It also monitors and outputs the status of the FIFO buffer, including whether it is full, empty, and the number of words written or read. The other configurations related to this FIFO (such as data width, depth, speed maximization, and register configurations) are adjusted through the `defparam` keyword directly associated with this instance.
