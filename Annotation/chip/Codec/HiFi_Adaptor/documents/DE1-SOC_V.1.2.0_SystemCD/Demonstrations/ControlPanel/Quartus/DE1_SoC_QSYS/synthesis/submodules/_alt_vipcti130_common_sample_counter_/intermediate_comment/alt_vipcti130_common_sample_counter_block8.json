    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of `count_cycle` to `count_sample`. This is a direct assignment operation in Verilog, where the value of one signal (`count_cycle`) is copied to another signal (`count_sample`) every simulation cycle. This permits real-time tracking or comparison of cycle counts in systems like timers or performance monitors."
