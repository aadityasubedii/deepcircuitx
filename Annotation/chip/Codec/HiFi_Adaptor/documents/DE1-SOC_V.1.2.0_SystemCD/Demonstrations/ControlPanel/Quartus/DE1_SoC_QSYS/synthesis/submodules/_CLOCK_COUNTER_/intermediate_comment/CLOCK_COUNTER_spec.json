Module specification: The 'CLOCK_COUNTER' module is designed to efficiently track increments in a system through a counter by utilizing the 'lpm_counter' component from library primitives. It primarily features three input ports: 'aclr', an asynchronous clear input that, when high, resets the counter to zero; 'clk_en', a clock enable input controlling the counter's ticking functionality - it must be high for the counter to advance; and 'clock', the main clock signal that triggers counter incrementation on its rising edge, provided that 'clk_en' is high and 'aclr' is not active. The output of the module is a 32-bit signal 'q', which shows the current count. Internally, a wire named 'sub_wire0' is used to connect the output of the 'lpm_counter' component to the module's 'q' output, facilitating any further modifications or signal processing within the module with ease. The primary subsection of the code encapsulates setting up the 'lpm_counter' component parameters and mapping its inputs and outputs accordingly, including setting operational modes such as the counting direction (up) and enabling counting without additional gating control signals.",
