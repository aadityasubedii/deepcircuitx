Module name: alt_vipcti131_common_sync_generation. 
Module specification: The alt_vipcti131_common_sync_generation Verilog module is pivotal in generating synchronization signals, namely start of frame (sof) and division signals (div), necessary for the precise coordination in video processing systems. It operates on a variety of inputs like reset (rst), clock (clk), and numerous control and data signals influencing vertical and horizontal counts for frame synchronization. The output signals include sof, indicating the initiation of a new frame, sof_locked, confirming the stability and readiness of the sof signal, and div, used to adjust frame rates. Internally, the module utilizes signals such as enable_next and sof_next to determine the conditions under which next actions should be triggered, and employs counters like h_count and v_count to keep track of video frames. The module integrates two primary blocks: alt_vipcti131_common_frame_counter for maintaining frame counts and its subdivision for managing division operations dictated by divider_value, annotated with specific parameters for customization depending on the video format and its synchronization needs. This meticulous orchestration of inputs, outputs, internal signals, and functional blocks ensures accurate synchronization essential for coherent video outputs.
