Comment: 
This block manages the routing of signal flow depending on the ready latency. If the ready latency is one, a common stream output process called `alt_vipvfr131_common_stream_output` is implemented with the parameters of the block designating the components of the stream output. These consist of clocking, validation, data encryption, packet start and end, etc. However, if the ready latency is something other than one, the outputs are directly assigned to the appropriate data flow signals, such as ready, valid, data, start of packet, and end of packet.
