Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_key. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_key module is designed for detecting and processing edge-triggered signals from physical key presses in FPGA systems, specifically intervening in interrupt signal generation. This is done through synchronous clocked logic to interface effectively with external key inputs and internal system registers. The input ports include address, chipselect, clk, in_port, reset_n, write_n, and writedata. 'address' selects internal registers; 'chipselect' enables module operation; 'clk' is the synchronization clock; 'in_port' registers button states; 'reset_n' is the asynchronous reset; 'write_n' enables write operations; 'writedata' holds data to be written into the registers. The outputs are 'irq', the interrupt request signal, and 'readdata', the output data from internal registers based on the address input. Internal signals such as clk_en (clock enable), d1_data_in and d2_data_in (delay elements for edge detection), data_in (direct key inputs), edge_capture (registers capturing edge events), edge_capture_wr_strobe (write strobe for edge captures), edge_detect (computed edge detection), irq_mask (interrupt activation mask), and read_mux_out (data multiplexer for output), facilitate the moduleâ€™s operation. The code includes initialization blocks under reset conditions, data capturing on the clock's rising edge with clock enable, conditional processing of input key states to determine rising or falling edges, and the managing of interrupt masks and captured edge data. Edge detection is computed via XOR between consecutive delayed values of input signals, ensuring accurate edge capture and interrupt triggering based on the setup irq_mask.
