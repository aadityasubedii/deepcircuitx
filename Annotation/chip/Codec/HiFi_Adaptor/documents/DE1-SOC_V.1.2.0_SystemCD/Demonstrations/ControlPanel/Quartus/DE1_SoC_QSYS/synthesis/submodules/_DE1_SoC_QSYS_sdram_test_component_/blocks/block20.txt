This block of Verilog code simply assigns the value of `zs_dqm` to `dqm`. Specifically, it ensures that the signal `dqm` mirrors the state of `zs_dqm`, thereby allowing for easier tracking and control of data quality management across modules. The implementation leverages a continuous assignment statement for real-time updates.
