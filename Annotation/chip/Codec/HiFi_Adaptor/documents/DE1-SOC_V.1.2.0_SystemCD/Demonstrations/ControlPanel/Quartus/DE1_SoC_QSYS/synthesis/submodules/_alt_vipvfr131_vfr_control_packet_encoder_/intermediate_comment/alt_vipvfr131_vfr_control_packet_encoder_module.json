    "module": "Module-level comment: The `alt_vipvfr131_vfr_control_packet_encoder` module encodes control packets for video frame attributes such as dimensions and interlacing. It uses a state machine driven by `BITS_PER_SYMBOL` and `SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT` to manage data flow and processing. The module transitions through various states to construct packets, controlling output validation and timing using internal signals and a generate block for dynamic configuration. This ensures reliable data and control packet output based on input signals and video parameters."
