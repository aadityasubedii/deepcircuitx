Module-level comment: The AUDIO_DAC module interfaces with a DAC, managing digital-to-analog audio conversion. It synchronizes digital audio data from a FIFO queue using control signals (bclk, daclrc) for timing and channel control, while handling buffer statuses to prevent data underflows or overflows. Implemented using internal logic to toggle data bits and channel tracking, it maintains continuous output to the DAC through managed FIFO reads and data shifting operations, based on external clock and reset conditions.
