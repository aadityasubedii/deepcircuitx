    "block_comment": "This block determines the transition condition for the `image_packet` signal. It updates `image_packet_nxt` based on the start of packet (`sop`) and end of packet (`eop`) signals, as well as the `dout_data`. Specifically, `image_packet_nxt` is set true either at the start of a new packet if `dout_data` is zero, or if it is currently active (`image_packet` is true) and it is not at the end of a packet (`eop` is not asserted)."
