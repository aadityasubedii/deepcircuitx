    "block_comment": "This block controls the FIFO clear signal based on specific conditions. It resets the FIFO clear signal to 0 when the system is out of reset. When a write operation occurs at the IR_RX_CS_REG address, it updates the FIFO clear signal with the least significant bit of the write data. If the FIFO clear signal is set, it resets back to 0 in the next clock cycle, ensuring a single cycle pulse for the clear operation."
