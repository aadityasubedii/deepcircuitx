Comment: 
The block assigns the signal `sop_out` to the output `dout_startofpacket`. This simple assignment indicates that the `dout_startofpacket` wire will carry the start-of-packet signal, mirroring the value of `sop_out` as soon as any changes occur. The implementation is straightforward, using a continuous assignment statement in Verilog, which establishes a concurrent, direct connection between the two signals.
