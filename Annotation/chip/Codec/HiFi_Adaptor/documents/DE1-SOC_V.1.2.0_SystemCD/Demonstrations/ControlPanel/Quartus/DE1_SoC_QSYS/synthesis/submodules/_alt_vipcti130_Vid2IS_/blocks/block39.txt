Comment: 
This block of code enables write request preprocessing. It uses a logical OR operation to determine the `wrreq_pre_enable` signal, which is set true when either `valid_nxt` is true or the end of packet (`eop`) is detected. The combination facilitates conditional write operations based on the packet's validity and endpoint status.
