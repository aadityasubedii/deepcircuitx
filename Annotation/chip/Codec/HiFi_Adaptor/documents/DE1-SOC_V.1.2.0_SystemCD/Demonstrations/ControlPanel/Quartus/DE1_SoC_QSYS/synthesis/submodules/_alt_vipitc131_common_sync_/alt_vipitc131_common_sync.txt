Module-level comment: Module 'alt_vipitc131_common_sync' performs data synchronization across different clock domains. If 'CLOCKS_ARE_SAME' equals true, it directly transfers 'data_in' to 'data_out'. If not, a two-stage synchronization is employed with 'data_out_sync0' and 'data_out_sync1' as buffers. These stages operate on 'sync_clock' positive edge or when 'rst' is high, managing synchronization reset and mitigating metastability issues for cross-clock domain data. Altera attributes ensure forced asynchronous synchronization and false path handling.
