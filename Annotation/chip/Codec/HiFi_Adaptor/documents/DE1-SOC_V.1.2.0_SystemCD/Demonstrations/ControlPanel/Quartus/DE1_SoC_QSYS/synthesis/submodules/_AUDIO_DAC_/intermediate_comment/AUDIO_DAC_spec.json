    "spec": "Module name: AUDIO_DAC. Module specification: The AUDIO_DAC module interfaces with a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for audio data, handling the synchronization and data transmission to convert digital audio from a FIFO queue to an analog signal. This module operates under a primary system clock (`clk`) along with specific input signals for module reset (`reset`), writing data (`write` with `writedata`), FIFO control (`clear`), and DAC timing (`bclk`, `daclrc`). It signals when the FIFO is full via `full` and outputs bit-by-bit audio data to the DAC through `dacdat`. Internally, the module utilizes `request_bit` to manage data requests, `bit_to_dac` for holding the current DAC data bit, a counter `bit_index` for bit tracking, and toggles channel control with `dac_is_left`. Moreover, it handles FIFO's data read operation statuses through `dacfifo_empty`, `dacfifo_read`, and `dacfifo_readdata`, and detects channel switching with `is_left_ch`. The code is divided into major functional blocks for data handling based on bit clock edges, interfacing with a FIFO submodule (`audio_fifo`) for data buffering and channel-sensitive audio processing. This structured approach ensures efficient and stable digital-to-analog conversion suitable for audio applications, governing data flow and synchronization accurately according to external clock signals and internal logic condition states.",

It processes digital audio data packed in a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queue to convert it into an analog signal that drives a DAC. The module synchronizes the data output to the DAC\u2019s bit clock (bclk) and left-right clock (daclrc), determining whether the data corresponds to the left or right audio channel. Data is shifted out bit by bit to the DAC on each negative edge of the bclk, controlled by the left or right channel status, and any reset or clear conditions. The module leverages a submodule, audio_fifo, to manage the buffering of incoming audio data and its regulated output to ensure smooth and continuous DAC feeding without overflow or underflow of data."
