Module name: alt_vipcti130_Vid2IS_sync_polarity_convertor.
Module specification: The alt_vipcti130_Vid2IS_sync_polarity_convertor is a digital logic component designed to conditionally invert an input synchronization signal (`sync_in`) based on a data-valid signal (`datavalid`). This module's input ports include a reset signal (`rst`) to initialize the module, a clock signal (`clk`) to time the logic updates, the synchronization signal (`sync_in`) to be potentially inverted, and the `datavalid` signal used for inversion control. The single output port is `sync_out`, which carries the possibly inverted synchronization signal. Internal signals such as `datavalid_negedge` detect a falling edge in the `datavalid` signal, `datavalid_reg` holds the previous state of `datavalid`, `needs_invert_nxt` determines if inversion is needed in the next state, `needs_invert` records whether the `sync_in` signal requires inversion across clock cycles, `invert_sync_nxt` prepares the invert signal state for the next clock cycle, and `invert_sync` serves to maintain the inversion state. The module's logic includes edge detection, next state logic for inversion control, and a sequential block that updates state registers on the rising edges of the clock or assertion of the reset signal. Finally, an output logic block generates the `sync_out` using an XOR gate that conditionally inverts `sync_in` based on the state of `invert_sync_nxt`. The careful arrangement of these blocks allows for dynamic adjustment of the input synchronization signal's polarity to meet varying system requirements.
