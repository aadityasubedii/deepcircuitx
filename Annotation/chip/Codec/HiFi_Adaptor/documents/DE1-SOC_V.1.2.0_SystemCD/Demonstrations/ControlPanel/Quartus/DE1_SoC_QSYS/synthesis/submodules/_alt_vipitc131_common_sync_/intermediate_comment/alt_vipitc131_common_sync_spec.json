    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipitc131_common_sync.\n\nModule specification: The 'alt_vipitc131_common_sync' module serves as a data synchronizer between different clock domains. The module uses input 'rst' as a reset signal to reset the synchronization process when required. It operates based on the 'sync_clock'. When 'CLOCKS_ARE_SAME' is true, it passes 'data_in' directly to 'data_out', else it employs a two-stage synchronization procedure. The input data 'data_in', defined for bit widths [WIDTH-1:0], undergoes this scheme to reduce cross-clock domain timing issues. \n\nThe module has a set of internal signals: 'data_out_sync0' and 'data_out_sync1'. 'data_out_sync0' represents the first synchronization stage capturing 'data_in' on the positive edge of 'sync_clock' or when 'rst' is high. At this stage, initial synchronization happens. The second stage involves 'data_out_sync1' which obtains data from 'data_out_sync0' on the positive edge of 'sync_clock' to secure the data against metastability issues. \n\nThe code is segmented into sections. The first part defines module parameters, inputs, outputs, and internal signals. Then, altera_attributes are assigned to both synchronization stages for handling forced asynchronous synchronization and false path assignment. The second part contains a 'generate' block for actual synchronization. If 'CLOCKS_ARE_SAME' is true, it directly assigns 'data_in' to 'data_out' bypassing synchronization procedures. Else, an 'always' block triggered at 'rst' or 'sync_clock' positive edge controls data synchronization: if 'rst' is true, the process resets, and if not, synchronization takes place. Finally, the synced data is assigned to 'data_out'.",
