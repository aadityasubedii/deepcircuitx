This block of code implements a synchronous reset and data synchronization mechanism. Upon detection of a positive edge on either the reset (`rst`) or synchronization clock (`sync_clock`), the block either resets the output signals `data_out_sync0` and `data_out_sync1` to zero when `rst` is asserted, or it latches the input signal `data_in` into `data_out_sync0` and propagates `data_out_sync0` to `data_out_sync1` if `rst` is not asserted. This ensures that the output data signals are consistently synchronized to the `sync_clock` with respect to input data or reset conditions.
