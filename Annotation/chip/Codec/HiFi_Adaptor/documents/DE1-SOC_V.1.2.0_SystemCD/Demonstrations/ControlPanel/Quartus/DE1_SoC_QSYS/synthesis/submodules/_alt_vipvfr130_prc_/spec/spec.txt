Module name: alt_vipvfr130_prc. 

Module specification: The 'alt_vipvfr130_prc' is a Verilog module designed primarily for processing video or image data, interfacing with a system through Avalon streaming and memory-mapped interfaces. The module uses input ports such as 'clock' and 'reset' for synchronization, and 'master_av_*' and 'control_av_*' for interfacing with memory and control registers. Output ports like 'dout_*' handle data streaming out of the module. Internally, signals such as 'stall_FROM_read_master_TO_prc_core' manage data flow between sub-modules, while parameters like 'BPS' and 'MAX_WIDTH' allow configuration to fit specific applications. The code structure includes several primary blocks: a memory read master ('alt_vipvfr130_prc_read_master') handling data fetching; a processing core ('alt_vipvfr130_prc_core') which processes the incoming data; and a control interface ('alt_vipvfr130_common_avalon_mm_slave') that manages writes and reads to module registers. The module also optionally houses a streaming output controller ('alt_vipvfr130_common_stream_output') which manages packet-based data output, ensuring compatibility with downstream devices or modules. This modular and parameterized approach allows the 'alt_vipvfr130_prc' to be adaptable and efficient for different applications in image or video processing contexts.
