Comment: 
This Verilog block defines a zero-padded assignment for a signal `usedw_output`. It pads the higher-order bits of the `usedw` signal up to 16 bits with zeros and assigns the result to `usedw_output`. The padding width is dynamically adjusted based on the `USED_WORDS_WIDTH`. This zero-extension helps maintain bit-width consistency for operations or interfaces expecting a 16-bit width.
