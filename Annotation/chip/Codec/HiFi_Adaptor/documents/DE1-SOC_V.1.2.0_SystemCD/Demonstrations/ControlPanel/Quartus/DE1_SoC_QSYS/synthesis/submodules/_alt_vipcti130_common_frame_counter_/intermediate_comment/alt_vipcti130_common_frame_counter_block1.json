    "block_comment": "The code block generates a signal `new_line` used to indicate the start of a new line in a video display system. It achieves this by checking if the horizontal count `h_count` has reached or exceeded a predefined total `h_total_int`, and if the `count_sample` condition is true, implying that the current sample is valid for creating a new line signal."
