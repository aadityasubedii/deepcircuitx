Module name: alt_vipitc130_common_trigger_sync. Module specification: The 'alt_vipitc130_common_trigger_sync' module is designed to synchronize a trigger signal (`trigger_in`) across different clock domains using `input_clock` and `sync_clock`. This process helps in handling the metastability caused by clock domain differences. The module has parameters to handle the scenarios where clocks are the same, using the `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME` parameter. When clocks differ, it deploys a toggle mechanism and synchronization blocks to manage signal changes across the clock domains effectively. The input ports include `input_rst` (asynchronous reset for input domain), `input_clock` (captures `trigger_in`), `rst` (asynchronous reset for synchronization domain), `sync_clock` (manages synchronization), `trigger_in` (trigger signal to be synchronized), and `ack_in` (acknowledgement of signal change). The output of the module is `trigger_out`, which represents the synchronized trigger signal in the `sync_clock` domain. Internally, the module uses `trigger_in_reg` to store the trigger signal, `toggle` as a change indicator signal, and `toggle_synched` to bring the `toggle` into the synchronization domain. It employs `alt_vipitc130_common_sync` for robust synchronization and `toggle_synched_reg` for output generation stability. The synchronization process involves catching the `trigger_in` on the `input_clock`, detecting changes using a toggle mechanism which fold in acknowledgment via `ack_in`, synchronizing the toggle, and finally stabilizing the output signal to prevent glitches ensuring reliable operation across the intended clock domains.
