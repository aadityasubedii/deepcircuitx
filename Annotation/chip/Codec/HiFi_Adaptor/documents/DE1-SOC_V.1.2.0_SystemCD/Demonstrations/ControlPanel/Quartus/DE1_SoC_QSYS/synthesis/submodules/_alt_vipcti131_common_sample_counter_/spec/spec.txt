Module name: alt_vipcti131_common_sample_counter. Module specification: The alt_vipcti131_common_sample_counter is a Verilog module designed for managing sample counting across color planes in video processing applications. It takes five primary inputs: rst (reset), clk (clock), sclr (sample clear), count_cycle (count cycle signal), and hd_sdn (high-definition shutdown). The outputs include count_sample (indicates a countersample event), start_of_sample (signals the beginning of a new sample), and sample_ticks (provides the number of ticks for the current sample). Internally, the module utilizes two signals: count_valids (a register that counts valid ticks for each sample across color planes) and new_sample (a flag indicating when a new sample should start). The code contains a generate block that bifurcates behavior based on the parameter NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES. If it's set to 1, the module simplifies the output to constant values. Otherwise, it uses count_valids and new_sample to manage complex counting behavior, adjusting outputs based on whether counting occurs in parallel across color planes and other conditions specified by input signals. This structured approach allows precise sample counting necessary for scenarios like synchronization in video processing hardware.
