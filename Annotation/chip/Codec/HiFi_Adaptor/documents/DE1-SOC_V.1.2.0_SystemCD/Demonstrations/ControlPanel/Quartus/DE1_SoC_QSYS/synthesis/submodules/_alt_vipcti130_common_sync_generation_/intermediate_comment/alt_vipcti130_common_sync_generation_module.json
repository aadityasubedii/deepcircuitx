    "module": "Module-level comment: The alt_vipcti130_common_sync_generation module generates synchronized Start of Frame (SoF) signals for video processing systems by utilizing input controls, counters, and embedded frame counters. It handles various synchronization scenarios influenced by input signal conditions and video format characteristics including interlacing. Internal logic controls counter behavior and outputs SoF based on validated counts and stability, ensuring precise video frame timings. This module is crucial for maintaining video integrity and timing in complex video processing environments."
