Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_ledr module controls a 10-bit output port for LED indications, accepting a 32-bit `writedata` and outputting both a 10-bit `out_port` and a 32-bit `readdata`. On `address == 0`, `chipselect`, and `write_n` conditions, it writes the least significant 10 bits of `writedata` to `data_out`, which directly drives `out_port` and part of `readdata`. The module resets `data_out` on a negative `reset_n`. Operation is clocked on positive edges of `clk`.
