    "block_comment": "This Verilog block assigns the output `q` to the value located at `read_address` in the memory array `mem_array`. The line uses an `assign` statement for continuous assignment, ensuring that any change in `read_address` is directly reflected on `q`, thus allowing for real-time data fetching from the memory array."
