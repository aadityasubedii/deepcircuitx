Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_alt_vip_swi_0

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_alt_vip_swi_0 is a digital module that routes data from two input streams to a single output stream based on control commands. It supports synchronous operations with input ports such as `clock` and `reset` for timing and initialization, data and control signals like `din_0_valid`, `din_0_data`, and `control_writedata` for streaming and manipulating data paths. Outputs include `dout_0_data` and control response signals like `control_readdata` that facilitate data output and feedback. Internal signals such as `enable`, `select`, and `synced` are managed by the `alt_vipswi130_switch_control` section, which configures the module's dynamic behavior such as input selection and synchronization status. Data buffering and intermediate handling are done using instances of `alt_vipswi130_common_stream_input` for each input stream, which buffer input data and manage flow with internal signals like `input_int_ready0`. The output handling is managed by `alt_vipswi130_common_stream_output`, which processes the selected input according to the switching logic defined in the procedural block, managing the output stream readiness and data integrity. The module ensures robust data packet transitioning at both input and output phases, marking packet boundaries and enforcing data consistency and readiness throughout.
