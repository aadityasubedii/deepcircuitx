/**
 * DE1_SoC_QSYS_hps_0: Interfaces FPGA with HPS using AXI buses and peripherals.
 * Manages data transfer between FPGA fabric and HPS via AXI protocols.
 * Handles memory operations, communication interfaces (Ethernet, QSPI, SDIO, USB, etc.),
 * and GPIO. Implements two sub-modules: fpga_interfaces for AXI communication
 * and hps_io for peripheral connections. Includes parameter checks for data width.
