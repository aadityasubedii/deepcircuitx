It uses input signals like reset (rst), clock (clk), and enable signals to control the counting process. The module interfaces with a sample counter submodule (`alt_vipcti130_common_sample_counter`) for managing how pixel samples are counted. The parameters and additional logic handle different configurations, such as the number of color planes and whether totals are decreased by one. It properly resets counts based on horizontal (h_reset) and vertical (v_reset) reset values and generates signals indicating the start of a new line and sample point in the video stream."
