Module name: AUDIO_ADC. Module specification: The AUDIO_ADC module is designed for acquiring audio data from an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) and managing it for further use. It synchronously processes audio bit data for left and right channels using a bit clock (bclk). The input ports include clk (main system clock), reset (resets module), read (triggers FIFO data output), clear (clears registers and FIFO), bclk (synchronizes serial data input), adclrc (distinguishes between channels), and adcdat (serial audio data). The output ports are readdata (outputs data from FIFO) and empty (indicates if FIFO is empty). Internal signals such as bit_index (tracks bit position), valid_bit (indicates valid data processing), reg_adc_left (indicates current channel), reg_adc_serial_data (shift register for audio bits), adcfifo_writedata (data sample for FIFO), adcfifo_write (write operation signal for FIFO), adcfifo_full (FIFO full status), wait_one_clk (one clock cycle delay flag), and is_left_ch (indicates processing channel based on adclrc) facilitate audio data management within the module. The code is organized into blocks handling signal assignments, channel distinction and processing within a synchronous block triggered by bclk, and integration with an audio FIFO for buffered output. This comprehensive structuring aids in efficiently managing audio signal acquisition and buffering, ensuring organized data handling for audio applications.
