Module name: alt_vipcti130_Vid2IS_write_buffer.

Module specification: The 'alt_vipcti130_Vid2IS_write_buffer' module is designed for buffering video data, supporting multiple color planes and configurable data widths. This module inputs video data through 'data_in' and processes it based on various control signals ('convert', 'hd_sdn', 'early_eop'). The module operates synchronously with a system clock ('clk') and initializes or clears its state with a reset signal ('rst'). It outputs buffered data through 'data_out' and manages packet indicators via 'packet_out'. Key inputs include 'rst', 'clk', 'convert', 'hd_sdn', 'early_eop', 'wrreq_in', 'data_in', and 'packet_in'. The outputs are 'wrreq_out', 'data_out', and 'packet_out'. Internally, the module uses 'write_buffer_data' to store video data temporarily, 'write_buffer_valid' to flag data validity, and 'write_buffer_packet' to manage packet status. The code includes generated blocks to handle data storage for each color plane, responding to changes in input signals and maintaining synchronization between input and output operations through careful state management. This setup ensures that the data is properly processed, stored, and transmitted in line with the control and timing demands of high-definition video systems.
