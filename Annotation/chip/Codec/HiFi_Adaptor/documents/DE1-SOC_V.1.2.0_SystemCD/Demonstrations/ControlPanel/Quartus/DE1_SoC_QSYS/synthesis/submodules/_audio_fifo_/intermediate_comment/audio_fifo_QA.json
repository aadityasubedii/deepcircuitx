It interfaces with audio data streams accepting 32-bit data inputs and outputs. Control is managed through separate read and write clocks (rdclk, wrclk) and request signals (rdreq, wrreq). The module uses a dual-clock FIFO (dcfifo) component to manage asynchronous read and write operations, ensuring data integrity across different clock domains. It provides output signals indicating when the FIFO is empty (rdempty) and when it is full (wrfull), aiding in the control of data flow in audio processing systems. The configurable parameters like FIFO size, width, and delay pipes are set for optimal performance in a Cyclone IV E FPGA device."
