Module-level comment: The TERASIC_IRM module interfaces with an infrared receiver to process IR signals and manage interrupts. It uses the IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic instance to decode IR data and tracks data readiness changes to handle interrupts through internal signals. The operations are governed by two main blocks; one updates the 'pre_data_ready' state on each clock cycle, and the other manages the 'irq' output based on data availability and SPI commands, ensuring synchronized and reliable interrupt signaling.
