Module-level comment: The IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic module processes IRDA signals through a state machine with IDLE, GUIDANCE, and DATAREAD states. It measures signal durations using counters, manages state transitions based on these timings, and validates incoming data. Outputs indicate data readiness and deliver processed data. The implementation uses clock-driven always blocks for synchronous state transitioning and data handling, ensuring robust and efficient IR data processing.
