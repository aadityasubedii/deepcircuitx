    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_tck. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_tck is a Verilog module designed for JTAG interface-based debugging within a CPU system, focusing on trace data management and breakpoint monitoring. The module inputs include data registers such as `MonDReg` and `break_readreg` for handling debug-related data, and control signals like `ir_in` to specify operational modes. It employs `tdi` as a serial input, and uses `tck`, the JTAG clock, for timing synchronization. Additionally, it responds to various state inputs such as `debugack` and `jtag_state_rti` to manage its operations accordingly. Key outputs include `ir_out`, `jrst_n`, `sr`, `st_ready_test_idle`, and `tdo`, which collectively output status, control bits, and JTAG data. Internally, the module uses signals like `debugack_sync` and `monitor_ready_sync` to ensure reliable, synchronous operations across its functional blocks. Noteworthy internal blocks include synchronization units that align the incoming signals `debugack` and `monitor_ready` with `tck`, and a complex shifting mechanism for the scan register `sr` dictated by the input instruction register and JTAG operations. The module efficiently handles different data and monitoring procedures critical to real-time CPU debugging via JTAG, aided by detailed signal management and state-driven logic.",

It deals with various debugging tasks like monitoring trace memory, checking breakpoints, and managing internal debug registers. The module takes multiple control signals and data inputs related to debugging and processes them based on the JTAG state machine and input instruction registers. The outputs include processed data register values, JTAG state indications, and control signals such as `tdo` for serial data out. It synchronizes incoming signals like `debugack` and `monitor_ready` using dual rank synchronizers to align with the JTAG clock (`tck`). Additionally, it manages shifts and sizes of internal scan registers (`sr`) according to the operation mode determined by instruction inputs. Overall, this module functions to aid in the debugging and monitoring of a CPU within a larger system through JTAG protocol."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals:\n- DRsize, debugack_sync, ir_out, monitor_ready_sync, sr, tdo, unxcomplemented_resetxx1, unxcomplemented_resetxx2\n\nExplanation:\n- **DRsize**: This register determines the shifting size for the scan register `sr` during various data register (DR) operations. It adjusts the internal shift operations based on JTAG instructions, aiding in data manipulation and serialization during scan operations.\n- **debugack_sync**: This is the synchronized version of the `debugack` input signal. It's synchronized with the JTAG clock `tck` to ensure stable and coherent signal processing inside the module. It is crucial in handling debugging acknowledgments that are time-sensitive and must be aligned with the system clock.\n- **ir_out**: The output instruction register that might represent a subset of the internal state or control settings of the module. It reflects changes based on conditions such as a reset or the synchronized states of `debugack` and `monitor_ready`.\n- **monitor_ready_sync**: A synchronized version of the `monitor_ready` input, aligned with the JTAG clock signal (`tck`). This ensures that the readiness state of the monitor can be used coherently within timed logic operations inside the module.\n- **sr**: The scan register, which is a central element in JTAG-based data scanning and manipulation. It holds and shifts data as directed by the JTAG instructions. It's updated dynamically in response to various scan operations (`vs_sdr`) and instruction inputs (`ir_in`).\n- **tdo**: The JTAG Data Out (TDO) signal, which carries data serially out of the module. It's directly driven by the least significant bit of the scan register `sr[0]`, maintaining continuous output flow during scan operations.\n- **unxcomplemented_resetxx1, unxcomplemented_resetxx2**: These signals appear to carry reset conditions possibly altered by internal logic (their exact manipulation isn\u2019t specified in the code). They are used as reset inputs to the synchronizer blocks, potentially ensuring that any reset conditions are cleanly applied to the synchronized signals.\n\nThese internal signals collectively support the module\u2019s functionality in managing trace data, implementing register shifts, handling JTAG operations, and ensuring signal integrity through synchronization."

It deals with various debugging tasks like monitoring trace memory, checking breakpoints, and managing internal debug registers. The module takes multiple control signals and data inputs related to debugging and processes them based on the JTAG state machine and input instruction registers. The outputs include processed data register values, JTAG state indications, and control signals such as `tdo` for serial data out. It synchronizes incoming signals like `debugack` and `monitor_ready` using dual rank synchronizers to align with the JTAG clock (`tck`). Additionally, it manages shifts and sizes of internal scan registers (`sr`) according to the operation mode determined by instruction inputs. Overall, this module functions to aid in the debugging and monitoring of a CPU within a larger system through JTAG protocol."

It adjusts the internal shift operations based on JTAG instructions, aiding in data manipulation and serialization during scan operations.\n- **debugack_sync**: This is the synchronized version of the `debugack` input signal. It's synchronized with the JTAG clock `tck` to ensure stable and coherent signal processing inside the module. It is crucial in handling debugging acknowledgments that are time-sensitive and must be aligned with the system clock.\n- **ir_out**: The output instruction register that might represent a subset of the internal state or control settings of the module. It reflects changes based on conditions such as a reset or the synchronized states of `debugack` and `monitor_ready`.\n- **monitor_ready_sync**: A synchronized version of the `monitor_ready` input, aligned with the JTAG clock signal (`tck`). This ensures that the readiness state of the monitor can be used coherently within timed logic operations inside the module.\n- **sr**: The scan register, which is a central element in JTAG-based data scanning and manipulation. It holds and shifts data as directed by the JTAG instructions. It's updated dynamically in response to various scan operations (`vs_sdr`) and instruction inputs (`ir_in`).\n- **tdo**: The JTAG Data Out (TDO) signal, which carries data serially out of the module. It's directly driven by the least significant bit of the scan register `sr[0]`, maintaining continuous output flow during scan operations.\n- **unxcomplemented_resetxx1, unxcomplemented_resetxx2**: These signals appear to carry reset conditions possibly altered by internal logic (their exact manipulation isn\u2019t specified in the code). They are used as reset inputs to the synchronizer blocks, potentially ensuring that any reset conditions are cleanly applied to the synchronized signals.\n\nThese internal signals collectively support the module\u2019s functionality in managing trace data, implementing register shifts, handling JTAG operations, and ensuring signal integrity through synchronization."

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_tck is a Verilog module designed for JTAG interface-based debugging within a CPU system, focusing on trace data management and breakpoint monitoring. The module inputs include data registers such as `MonDReg` and `break_readreg` for handling debug-related data, and control signals like `ir_in` to specify operational modes. It employs `tdi` as a serial input, and uses `tck`, the JTAG clock, for timing synchronization. Additionally, it responds to various state inputs such as `debugack` and `jtag_state_rti` to manage its operations accordingly. Key outputs include `ir_out`, `jrst_n`, `sr`, `st_ready_test_idle`, and `tdo`, which collectively output status, control bits, and JTAG data. Internally, the module uses signals like `debugack_sync` and `monitor_ready_sync` to ensure reliable, synchronous operations across its functional blocks. Noteworthy internal blocks include synchronization units that align the incoming signals `debugack` and `monitor_ready` with `tck`, and a complex shifting mechanism for the scan register `sr` dictated by the input instruction register and JTAG operations. The module efficiently handles different data and monitoring procedures critical to real-time CPU debugging via JTAG, aided by detailed signal management and state-driven logic."
