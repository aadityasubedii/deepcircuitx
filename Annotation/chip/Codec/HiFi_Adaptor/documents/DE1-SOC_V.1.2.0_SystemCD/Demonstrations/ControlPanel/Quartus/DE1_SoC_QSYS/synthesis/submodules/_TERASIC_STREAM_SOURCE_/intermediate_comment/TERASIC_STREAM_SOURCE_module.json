    "module": "Module-level comment: The TERASIC_STREAM_SOURCE is a Verilog module designed to generate configurable pattern-based video data streams. It utilizes input signals for dynamic pattern selection and relies on internal counters and registers to manage pixel data generation over video dimensions. Outputs are structured into packets marked by start and end signals. This module primarily serves in video streaming applications to facilitate testing and display operations using different color and pattern scaling effects, controlled through pattern IDs and user modes."
