Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements an interconnect for a SoC, managing communication between VIP frame buffer masters and SDRAM slave. It uses address routing, command/response demultiplexing, width/burst adaptation, and arbitration to handle data transfers. The module employs Avalon Universal translators, routers, crossbars, and adapters to efficiently bridge differences in bus widths, protocols, and timing requirements between SoC components.
