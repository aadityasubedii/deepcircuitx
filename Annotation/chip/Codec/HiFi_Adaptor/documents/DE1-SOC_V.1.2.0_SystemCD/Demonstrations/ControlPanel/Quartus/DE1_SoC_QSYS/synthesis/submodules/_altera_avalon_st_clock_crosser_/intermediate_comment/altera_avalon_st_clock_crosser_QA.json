It safely transfers a data stream from one clock domain to another, preventing data corruption due to clock domain misalignment. The module takes input data (`in_data`) under one clock domain (`in_clk`) and outputs it (`out_data`) under another clock domain (`out_clk`). The internal mechanisms ensure data synchronization between these domains, with adjustable synchronization depth to enhance reliability. Additionally, the module provides an optional output pipeline stage to further manage data throughput and latency across the clock domains."
