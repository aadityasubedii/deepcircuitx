    "module": "Module-level comment: The `alt_vipswi130_switch_control` module manages data routing and system control through external Avalon interface commands, synced to input synchronization signals. It features parameterizable inputs, outputs, and synchronization points, employing internal registers (`master_enable`, `output_switch`, `output_control`) and synchronized updates (`global_synced`) to configure routing (`select` outputs) and operational states (`enable` output). The module operates based on read and write operations signaled through `av_read` and `av_write`, adjusting registers and outputs accordingly, ensuring responsive and context-aware control of data flow."
