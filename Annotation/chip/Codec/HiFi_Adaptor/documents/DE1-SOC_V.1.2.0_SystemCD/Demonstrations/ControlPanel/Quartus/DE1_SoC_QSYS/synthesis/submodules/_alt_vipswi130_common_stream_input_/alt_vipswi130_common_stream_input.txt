Module-level comment: The `alt_vipswi130_common_stream_input` module processes streaming data inputs by employing multi-stage buffering and synchronization. It supports handling serial data with control signals, includes three buffering registers, and operates synchronously with a clock and reset signal. Outputs are regulated based on downstream readiness. This setup provides continuous data flow and integration in systems with varying computation speeds.
