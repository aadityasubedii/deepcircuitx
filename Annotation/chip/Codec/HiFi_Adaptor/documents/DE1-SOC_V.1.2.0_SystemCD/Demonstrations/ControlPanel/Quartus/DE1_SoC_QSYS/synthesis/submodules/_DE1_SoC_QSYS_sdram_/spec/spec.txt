Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram module serves as an SDRAM controller designed for interfacing an FPGA with SDRAM memory, performing necessary initializations, managing read and write operations, and handling command processing on a DE1-SoC board. Input ports include `az_addr`, `az_be_n`, `az_cs`, `az_data`, `az_rd_n`, `az_wr_n`, `clk`, and `reset_n`, used for addressing, data manipulation, clock synchronization, and system resetting from an Avalon bus interface. Output ports comprise `za_data`, `za_valid`, `za_waitrequest`, `zs_addr`, `zs_ba`, `zs_cas_n`, `zs_cke`, `zs_cs_n`, `zs_dq`, `zs_dqm`, `zs_ras_n`, and `zs_we_n`, which facilitate data output to the Avalon bus and control signals to the SDRAM. Significant internal signals like `i_state`, `m_state`, `f_pop`, and `refresh_request` orchestrate the control logic for initialization, SDRAM command execution, data flow management between FIFO and SDRAM, and refreshing cycles. The module includes a sub-module named `DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_input_efifo_module` for FIFO control, assisting in buffering and synchronizing input and output data streams. The Verilog code effectively wraps various functional sections including initialization sequence control, refresh management, command process handling, and I/O data handling, which manage the interfacing between the Avalon bus and SDRAM through detailed state machine implementations. This structured approach ensures smooth SDRAM operations, aligned with timing and protocol requirements.
