    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_spi_0 module functions as an SPI controller for FPGA-based data transactions with SPI devices. It utilizes input and output signals like MOSI, MISO, and SS_n to manage data transmission and reception. Internally, the module employs registers and state machines controlled by clock signals to maintain transaction integrity, manage device selection, and signal transaction completion through interfacing flags such as `dataavailable`, `endofpacket`, and interrupts (`irq`). The module effectively coordinates serial data communication via structured signal handling and state progression."
