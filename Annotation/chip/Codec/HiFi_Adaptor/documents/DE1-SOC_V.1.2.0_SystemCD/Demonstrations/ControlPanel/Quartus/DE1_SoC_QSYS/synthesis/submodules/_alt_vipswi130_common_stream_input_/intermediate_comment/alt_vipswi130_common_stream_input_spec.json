    "spec": "Module name: `alt_vipswi130_common_stream_input`.\n\nModule specification: The `alt_vipswi130_common_stream_input` is a Verilog module designed to manage the buffering and synchronization of streaming data inputs within digital signal processing systems. The module primarily operates under a paramount clock signal `clk` and manages resetting with a synchronous reset signal `rst`, ensuring all operations commence from a known state. Its input ports include `din_valid`, `din_data`, `din_sop`, and `din_eop` for receiving valid data signals, serial input data, and start and end of packet indicators respectively. The `int_ready` input signal indicates the readiness of downstream processing stages. Corresponding output ports are `din_ready`, `int_valid`, `int_data`, `int_sop`, and `int_eop` which manage data acceptance from upstream modules and data transmission to downstream components while signaling data validity and packet boundaries. Internally, the module utilizes three stages of buffering with registers such as `din_valid_reg`, `din_data_reg`, `din_sop_reg`, `din_eop_reg`, and their successive counterparts `din_valid_buf1_reg`, `din_data_buf1_reg`, etc., to intermediate data before being processed based on `int_ready` status. The module's control flow is governed by two primary always blocks: one that handles the pipeline and data stages resetting or progression based on the `int_ready` signal status, and another that manages the output readiness and data transition based on buffer stages to synchronize with the readiness of the downstream modules. This setup ensures smooth data flow across differing processing speeds and data rates in a controlled and reliable manner.",

The module primarily operates under a paramount clock signal `clk` and manages resetting with a synchronous reset signal `rst`, ensuring all operations commence from a known state. Its input ports include `din_valid`, `din_data`, `din_sop`, and `din_eop` for receiving valid data signals, serial input data, and start and end of packet indicators respectively. The `int_ready` input signal indicates the readiness of downstream processing stages. Corresponding output ports are `din_ready`, `int_valid`, `int_data`, `int_sop`, and `int_eop` which manage data acceptance from upstream modules and data transmission to downstream components while signaling data validity and packet boundaries. Internally, the module utilizes three stages of buffering with registers such as `din_valid_reg`, `din_data_reg`, `din_sop_reg`, `din_eop_reg`, and their successive counterparts `din_valid_buf1_reg`, `din_data_buf1_reg`, etc., to intermediate data before being processed based on `int_ready` status. The module's control flow is governed by two primary always blocks: one that handles the pipeline and data stages resetting or progression based on the `int_ready` signal status, and another that manages the output readiness and data transition based on buffer stages to synchronize with the readiness of the downstream modules. This setup ensures smooth data flow across differing processing speeds and data rates in a controlled and reliable manner."
