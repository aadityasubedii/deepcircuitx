Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_mult_cell.
Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_mult_cell is a Verilog module designed for multiplying two 32-bit integers on FPGA devices, specifically optimized for the CYCLONEV family. It enhances performance by partitioning the input into smaller 16-bit sections to parallelize the computation. The input ports include A_mul_src1 and A_mul_src2, both 32-bit operands for the multiplication; a clock signal 'clk' which synchronizes operations; and a reset signal 'reset_n' which is active-low for resetting the module's state. The sole output port, A_mul_cell_result, provides the 32-bit multiplication result. Internally, the module uses signals such as A_mul_cell_result_part_1 and A_mul_cell_result_part_2 to hold intermediate results of the multiplications. Another internal signal, mul_clr, derived from the negation of reset_n, controls internal reset operations. The module comprises two main blocks each configured via the 'altera_mult_add' instantiation: the first block computes the product of the lower 16 bits of both inputs, and the second block computes the product of the upper 16 bits of the first input and the lower 16 bits of the second input. The final output is calculated by combining these intermediate results. The detailed configuration parameters for these blocks ensure that the multiplications adhere to the required precision and operational specifications.
