Module-level comment: The TERASIC_CLOCK_COUNT module manages external clock signals CLK_1 and CLK_2 using a system clock. It features input controls for resets, read/write operations, and data handling, with outputs showing counted clock edges. Internally, it uses registers for counting, data output, and detecting state transitions to handle operations like resetting, initializing counts, and data I/O based on user commands. This design ensures precise clock signal management and data accessibility.
