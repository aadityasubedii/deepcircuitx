Module name: alt_vipswi130_common_stream_output.

Module specification: The 'alt_vipswi130_common_stream_output' module is designed for managing synchronized data transfer in a streaming environment, particularly attentive to packet boundaries signified by start of packet (sop) and end of packet (eop) conditions. It operates on a parameterizable data width, managing data integrity across internal and external interfaces. The module takes several input signals, including a reset (rst), a system clock (clk), a data ready signal from downstream (dout_ready), data validity (int_valid), the data itself (int_data), and signals marking the start (int_sop) and end (int_eop) of internal data packets, as well as an enable signal (enable). The outputs include a validation of outgoing data (dout_valid), the data stream (dout_data) with its own sop and eop markings (dout_sop, dout_eop), a ready signal for internal data acceptance (int_ready), and a synchronization status (synced). Internally, the module uses several registers (image_packet, synced_int, enable_synced_reg, int_valid_reg, int_ready_reg) and wires (image_packet_nxt, synced_int_nxt, enable_synced, eop, sop) to manage the state and control flow of the data processing, aligning packet boundaries and maintaining synchronization between incoming and outgoing streams. The Verilog code is structured in two main always blocks mainly responsible for dynamically updating internal states based on system resets or changes detected on incoming signals, and assigning computed values to outputs through continuous assignments. This structured approach ensures that internal states are updated correctly with regard to the clock and reset operations and that data integrity and packet boundaries are maintained across the data transmission process.
