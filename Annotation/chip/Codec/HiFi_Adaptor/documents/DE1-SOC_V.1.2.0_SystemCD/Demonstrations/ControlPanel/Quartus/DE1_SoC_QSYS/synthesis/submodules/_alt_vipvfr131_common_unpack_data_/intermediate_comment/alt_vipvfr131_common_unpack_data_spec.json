    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipvfr131_common_unpack_data. \nModule specification: The 'alt_vipvfr131_common_unpack_data' module is designed to handle the transition of data between two interfaces of different widths, processing input data of DATA_WIDTH_IN bits and adapting it to an output of DATA_WIDTH_OUT bits. Key **input ports** include `clock` (drives module's timing), `reset` (initializes or clears module's state), `data_in` (carries incoming data to be unpacked), `stall_in` (pauses data acceptance when high), `stall_out` (indicates readiness of downstream component to receive data), and `clear` (discards the data under specific conditions). Its **output ports** are `read` (signals when new data should be read), `write` (indicates when data is being written out), and `data_out` (carries adapted data to downstream components). Internally, it utilizes signals `need_input` to determine whether new data is needed based on output buffer availability and stall states, and `ena` as an enable signal that allows processing when `stall_in` is low. \n\nThe module includes an internal instance of the `alt_vipvfr131_common_pulling_width_adapter` sub-module, configured for the specified input and output widths, which efficiently handles the data width adaptation according to the control signals (like pull and discard enables). The module's logic is controlled through sequential processes activated on the positive edge of the `clock` or the `reset`. The process manages the `write` signal according to `reset` and `stall_out` conditions to ensure synchronized and controlled data flow. This complete arrangement makes the module effective for interfacing and controlling data between variable-width data pipeline stages, ensuring data integrity and smooth data traffic management.",

It facilitates the process by reading input data (data_in) when it's not stalled (enabled by ena, which is true when not stalled by stall_in), adapting it from a width of DATA_WIDTH_IN to DATA_WIDTH_OUT using an internal module (fu_inst), and forwarding it to the output (data_out) while managing control signals like write and read based on stall conditions from both input (stall_in) and output (stall_out) sides. The module also responds to a reset condition by setting write to low and handles data discard driven by a clear signal."
