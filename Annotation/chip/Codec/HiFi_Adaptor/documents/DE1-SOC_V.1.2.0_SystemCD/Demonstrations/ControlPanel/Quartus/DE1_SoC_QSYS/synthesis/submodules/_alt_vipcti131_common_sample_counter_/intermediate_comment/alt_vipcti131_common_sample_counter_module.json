    "module": "Module-level comment: The alt_vipcti131_common_sample_counter module manages sample counting across color planes in video processing settings. It offers input handling for reset, clock, sample clear, count cycles, and high-definition shutdown with outputs for sample count, initiation, and tick duration. Internally, it leverages a conditional generation pattern and internal state registers to adjust for different operational modes based on whether it handles single or multiple color planes, ensuring appropriate synchronization and precision in sample counting."
