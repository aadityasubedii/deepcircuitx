    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block defines the signal 'sop' as a logical AND result of two signals: 'dout_valid' and 'dout_sop'. The signal 'sop' will be high (true) only when both 'dout_valid' (data output is valid) and 'dout_sop' (start of packet indicator) are high, indicating the start of a valid packet transmission."
