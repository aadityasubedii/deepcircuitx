    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_timer is a Verilog module serving as a configurable timer/counter for embedded applications, with functionalities for start, stop, and reset controlled via external signals. This module handles its operations using a 32-bit internal counter, supports read/write operations to timer registers through specific addresses, and generates interrupts upon timeout events. Internally, the module includes condition-based control signals and strobes to manage counter states, load values, and interrupt triggering, ensuring precise timing and event handling."
