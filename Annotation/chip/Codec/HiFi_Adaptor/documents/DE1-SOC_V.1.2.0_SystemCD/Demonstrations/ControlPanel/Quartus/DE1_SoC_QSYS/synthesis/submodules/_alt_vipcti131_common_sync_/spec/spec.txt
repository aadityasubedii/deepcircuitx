Module name: alt_vipcti131_common_sync. 
Module specification: The alt_vipcti131_common_sync module is designed for signal synchronization across different or the same clock domains, using a dual D-type flip-flop approach. This module handles the synchronization of an input vector `data_in` towards `data_out`. The input port `rst` is an asynchronous reset that clears the state of synchronization, `sync_clock` is the controlling clock for the synchronization process, and `data_in` provides the data bits to be synchronized with a width specified by the parameter WIDTH. The output `data_out` delivers the vector consisting of synchronized data bits. Internally, `data_out_sync0` and `data_out_sync1` are registers capturing data at two consecutive edges of `sync_clock`, effectively mitigating the risk of metastability. The module uses a conditional generate statement to alter its behavior based on the parameter `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME`. If clocks are the same, `data_out` directly mirrors `data_in`. Otherwise, data passes through the two flip-flops with potential resets controlled by `rst`. The use of specific `altera_attribute` settings guides synthesis tools on handling synchronization correctly, emphasizing its criticality in asynchronous interfaces. This architectural approach ensures robust data transfer across clock boundaries or within the same clock domain, providing a stable and safe output.
