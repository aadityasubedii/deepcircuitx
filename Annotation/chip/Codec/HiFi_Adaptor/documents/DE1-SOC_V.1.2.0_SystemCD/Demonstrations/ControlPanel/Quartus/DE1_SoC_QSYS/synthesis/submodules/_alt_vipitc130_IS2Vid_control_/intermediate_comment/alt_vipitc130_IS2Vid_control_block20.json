    "block_comment": "This block conditionally assigns a value to `is_mode_match_output` using concatenation to adjust the bit-width. If the previous condition is not met, it extends `is_mode_match` by prefixing zeros, ensuring the total bit-width matches 16. The number of prefixed zeros is calculated as `16-NO_OF_MODES_INT`."
