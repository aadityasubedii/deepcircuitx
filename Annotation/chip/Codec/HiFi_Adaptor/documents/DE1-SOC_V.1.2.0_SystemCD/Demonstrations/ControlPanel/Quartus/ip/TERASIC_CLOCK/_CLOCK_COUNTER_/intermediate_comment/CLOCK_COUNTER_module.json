    "module": "Module-level comment: The CLOCK_COUNTER is a 32-bit up-counter using an LPM_COUNTER component. It increments with each clock cycle when enabled by `clk_en` and resets with `aclr`. Internally, `sub_wire0` transfers counts to the output `q`. The module operates solely in UP mode, controlled via the LPM configuration, streamlining its counting functionality for any sync-based applications."
