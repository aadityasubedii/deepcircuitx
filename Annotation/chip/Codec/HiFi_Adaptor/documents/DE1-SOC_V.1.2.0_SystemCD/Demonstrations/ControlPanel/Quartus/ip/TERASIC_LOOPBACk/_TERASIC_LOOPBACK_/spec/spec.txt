Module name: TERASIC_LOOPBACK. 

Module specification: The TERASIC_LOOPBACK module is specifically designed for testing loopback functionalities on signal pairs, utilizing a Verilog-based structure to manage a sequence of tests involving error detection and reporting mechanisms. The module operates on a synchronous clock (`clk`) and utilizes an active-low reset (`reset_n`) for initializing and maintaining the correct operation states. It handles operations through control signals including chip select (`s_cs`), read enable (`s_read`), write enable (`s_write`), and write data (`s_writedata`). The main outputs include error status or loopback test results (`s_readdata`) and the loopbacked signals (`lb_out`). Internally, the module features a set of signals such as `test_mask`, `test_in`, and `test_out` that support the administration of loopback paths and the determination of errors in the loopback process, where errors are captured in `lb_error`. The logic blocks within the code manage writing operations, reading results out, configuration of test conditions (`test_case`, `test_dir_invert`, `test_value_invert`), and a sequential testing process that iterates through signal pairs and configurations to evaluate the loopback functionality comprehensively. Signal pairs can be selectively tested, inverted, or bypassed as dictated by the test scenarios, giving versatility in the moduleâ€™s use for various test conditions.
