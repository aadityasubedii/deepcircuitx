    "block_comment": "This block of code conditionally assigns a subset of bits from `is_mode_match` to `is_mode_match_output`. If the integer `NO_OF_MODES_INT` is 16 or greater, the lower 16 bits of `is_mode_match` are assigned to `is_mode_match_output`. This selective bit assignment helps in handling configurations or modes based on the value of `NO_OF_MODES_INT`."
