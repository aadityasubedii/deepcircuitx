    "block_comment": "This block interfaces a control module for video processing, managing settings and status updates. It handles clock signals, resolution changes, interlacing, counts for active samples and lines, and overflow conditions through specific inputs and outputs. Further, it supports video standard synchronization, enabling and genlock control, and interfaces with an Avalon memory-mapped bus for status and configuration data exchange."
