Module name: alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_embedded_sync_extractor. Module specification: The alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_embedded_sync_extractor is a Verilog module designed to extract embedded synchronization signals from video data streams. It receives the video data through the input port `vid_data_in` and uses the clock signal `clk` and reset signal `rst` for timing and initializing operations. Other input signals include `vid_locked` marking the stability of incoming video, `vid_enable` to enable processing, and `vid_hd_sdn` to specify the video format (HD or SD). The outputs are `vid_f`, `vid_v_sync`, `vid_h_sync`, `vid_datavalid`, `vid_anc_valid`, and `vid_data_out`, which respectively indicate field indicators, vertical/horizontal sync signals, data validity, ancillary data validity, and the output video stream. Internal signals like `trs`, `anc_nxt`, `data_count`, and delay-related signals (`f_delay`, `h_delay`, `v_delay`) handle the timing and state management necessary for sync and ancillary data extraction. The code includes a finite state machine to manage states of ancillary data processing, and separate conditions handle SD and HD data formats. The module essentially processes incoming video, detects specific data sequences, and outputs synchronized video data, making it vital in video processing systems.
