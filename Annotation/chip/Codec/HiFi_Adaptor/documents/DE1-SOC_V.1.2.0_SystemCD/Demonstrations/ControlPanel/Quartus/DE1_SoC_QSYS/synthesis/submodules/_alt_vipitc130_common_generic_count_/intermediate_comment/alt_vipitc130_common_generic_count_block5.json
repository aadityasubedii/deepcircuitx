    "block_comment": "This block functions as a tick counter in a digital system. On each positive edge of the clock or negative edge of the reset (`reset_n`), it determines the value of `ticks`. If `reset_n` is low, indicating a reset condition, it sets `ticks` to zero using bit concatenation for the specified `TICKS_WORD_LENGTH`. If not in reset, it evaluates if `restart_count` is true, then sets `ticks` to zero; otherwise, it allows `ticks` to increment by one until it reaches `TICKS_PER_COUNT - 1`, after which it resets to zero again, provided `enable` is high; if `enable` is low, `ticks` maintains its current value."
