If the 'CLOCKS_ARE_SAME' parameter is true, it will directly pass the 'data_in' to 'data_out'. Otherwise, it applies a two-stage synchronization scheme on the data to protect against metastability when the data is passed between two different clock domains. The module checks if the reset signal 'rst' is high and if it is, all bits in 'data_out_sync0' and 'data_out_sync1' are set to 0 and if not, it's synchronizing 'data_in' to 'data_out_sync0' and 'data_out_sync0' to 'data_out_sync1'. The output 'data_out' will be taken from 'data_out_sync1'. It also employs Altera attributes for handling forced asynchronous synchronization and false path assignment."
