It uses dual D-type flip-flops (data_out_sync0 and data_out_sync1) to synchronize an input data signal 'data_in' to the output 'data_out' based on the clock signal 'sync_clock'. When the reset signal 'rst' is asserted, both flip-flops are reset to zero. If the clocks of the input and output are the same (controlled by the parameter CLOCKS_ARE_SAME), the output directly follows the input to avoid unnecessary synchronization. Otherwise, 'data_in' is synchronized through the cascaded flip-flops to mitigate metastability risks in asynchronous interfaces. The module also utilizes specific attributes (altera_attribute) to guide synthesis tools on handling synchronization correctly."

It is used for clocking the dual flip-flops through which data synchronization across possibly different clock domains is managed.\n- data_in: The data input which needs to be synchronized. It is a vector with a width defined by the parameter WIDTH. This input provides the actual data bits that are intended to be synchronized from the source clock domain to the target clock domain defined by sync_clock.\n\nOutput ports: data_out. \nExplanation: \n- data_out: The synchronized output data which is assumed to be stable and safe to use in the target clock domain after passing through the dual flip-flop synchronization scheme.
