This block of code controls the output displayed on a 7-segment display. Depending on the `LOW_ACTIVE` signal, it conditionally inverts the data from `reg_file`. If `LOW_ACTIVE` is high, it negates `reg_file` using the bitwise NOT operator (~), making the display active low; otherwise, it passes `reg_file` directly, maintaining an active high configuration. This enables flexibility in interfacing with different 7-segment display types by simply altering the `LOW_ACTIVE` control signal.
