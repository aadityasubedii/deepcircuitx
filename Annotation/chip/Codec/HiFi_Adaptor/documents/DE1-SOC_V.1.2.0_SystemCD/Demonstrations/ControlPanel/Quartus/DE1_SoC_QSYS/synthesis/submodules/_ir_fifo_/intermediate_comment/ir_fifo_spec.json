    "spec": "Module name: ir_fifo. \n\nModule specification: The \"ir_fifo\" module is designed as a dual-clock FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffering system for interfacing between different clock domains, specifically tailored for the Cyclone V FPGA family. It efficiently handles data transfers with asynchronous clear and clock synchronization, supporting overflow and underflow checking. This module includes several input ports: 'aclr' (asynchronous clear), 'data' (32-bit data input), 'rdclk' (read clock), 'rdreq' (read request), 'wrclk' (write clock), and 'wrreq' (write request). The output ports are 'q' (32-bit data output), 'rdempty' (indicates if FIFO is empty), 'rdusedw' (5-bit output showing count of words in the read buffer), and 'wrfull' (indicates if FIFO is full). Internally, the module uses signals such as 'sub_wire0' to 'sub_wire3' to connect the internal dcfifo_component outputs to the module's outputs, ensuring proper data flow and status indication. The code is structured around the instantiation of 'dcfifo_component', with parameter settings for FIFO management such as word count, data width, and synchronization behaviors, which are critical for reliable operation across different clock domains. Additionally, predefined settings ensure the component adheres to Cyclone V device family specifications. This setup ensures seamless data buffering, crucial for applications involving multi-clock domain operations where data integrity and synchronization are priority.",
