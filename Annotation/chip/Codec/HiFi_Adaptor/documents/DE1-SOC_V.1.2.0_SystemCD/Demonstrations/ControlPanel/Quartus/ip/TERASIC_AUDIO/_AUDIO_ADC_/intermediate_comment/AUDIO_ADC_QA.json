It operates by serially reading audio data bits synchronized with a bit clock (bclk). The bits for each audio sample are loaded into a shift register. Upon completion of receiving either half or full data width, the data is transferred to a FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer if the buffer is not full. This module supports functionalities such as reset and clear operations. Clearing the module resets the bit index and halts writing to the FIFO until the next valid data is detected, ensuring synchronization with the audio data and preventing corruption. The output from this FIFO is provided as 'readdata' whenever a read operation is triggered. This module effectively manages audio data capture and buffering for further processing or use."

It prevents overwriting the FIFO when new data cannot be stored.\n- wait_one_clk: This flag ensures there is a one clock cycle delay before processing the next set of bits.
