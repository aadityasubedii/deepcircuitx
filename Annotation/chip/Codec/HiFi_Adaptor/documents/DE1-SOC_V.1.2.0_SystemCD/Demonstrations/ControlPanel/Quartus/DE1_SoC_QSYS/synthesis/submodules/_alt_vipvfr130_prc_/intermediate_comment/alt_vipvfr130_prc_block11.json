    "block_comment": "This block defines a bit-slice assignment that extracts the number of words per packet from a concatenated register array. It assigns a specific range of bits from the 'registers' array to 'packet_words', using calculated bit-widths based on the constants 'SLAVE_DATA_REQUIREDWIDTH' and 'MAX_BURST_LENGTH_REQUIREDWIDTH' to determine the starting and ending bit positions."
