    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipcti130_Vid2IS_embedded_sync_extractor.\n\nModule Specification: The alt_vipcti130_Vid2IS_embedded_sync_extractor module is a digital logic component, implemented in Verilog hardware description language, designed for extracting synchronization signals (horizontal sync, vertical sync, and frame sync) from the incoming video data streams. It works with embedded sync signals within the video data, accounting for parameters such as data width and bits per sample (BPS), and switching between different data paths for standard definition (SD) and high definition (HD) via the 'vid_hd_sdn' signal.\n\nThe module's primary input ports include reset (rst), clock (clk), video lock signal (vid_locked), video enable signal (vid_enable), video standard definition signal (vid_hd_sdn), and video data input (vid_data_in). The outputs of this module include the frame sync signal (vid_f), vertical sync (vid_v_sync), horizontal sync (vid_h_sync), video data validation signal (vid_datavalid), the ancillary data validation signal (vid_anc_valid), and the processed video data (vid_data_out).\n\nThe module uses several important internal signals such as timing reference sequence (trs), ancillary data state machine (anc_nxt, anc_nxt_sd, anc_nxt_hd, anc_state) and data counters (data_count, data_count_next, data_count_next_sd, data_count_next_hd). These and other signals like video data shift registers (vid_data0, vid_data1, vid_data2), sync signal registers (h_next, v_next, f_next), signal delay elements (f_delay, h_delay, v_delay) and others contribute towards navigating the video data sequence, detecting sync points, managing state transitions, and preparing the final extracted outputs.\n\nThe different sections of the module include port declarations, internal signal declarations, data path assignments and signal mappings, a parameterized state machine to handle ancillary data parsing, and synchronization sequences to extract the necessary signals from the video data stream. These are embodied in distinct coding blocks and are conditioned at different stages by the video enable signal and video lock signal ensuring that the processing and sync extraction are done correctly, only when the video data is reliable and the system is ready to process it. This module encapsulates the complexities of embedded video sync extraction while efficiently handling diverse scenarios of video data formats and synchronization needs.",

It works with embedded sync signals within the video data, accounting for parameters such as data width and bits per sample (BPS), and switching between different data paths for standard definition (SD) and high definition (HD) via the 'vid_hd_sdn' signal.\n\nThe module's primary input ports include reset (rst), clock (clk), video lock signal (vid_locked), video enable signal (vid_enable), video standard definition signal (vid_hd_sdn), and video data input (vid_data_in). The outputs of this module include the frame sync signal (vid_f), vertical sync (vid_v_sync), horizontal sync (vid_h_sync), video data validation signal (vid_datavalid), the ancillary data validation signal (vid_anc_valid), and the processed video data (vid_data_out).\n\nThe module uses several important internal signals such as timing reference sequence (trs), ancillary data state machine (anc_nxt, anc_nxt_sd, anc_nxt_hd, anc_state) and data counters (data_count, data_count_next, data_count_next_sd, data_count_next_hd). These and other signals like video data shift registers (vid_data0, vid_data1, vid_data2), sync signal registers (h_next, v_next, f_next), signal delay elements (f_delay, h_delay, v_delay) and others contribute towards navigating the video data sequence, detecting sync points, managing state transitions, and preparing the final extracted outputs.\n\nThe different sections of the module include port declarations, internal signal declarations, data path assignments and signal mappings, a parameterized state machine to handle ancillary data parsing, and synchronization sequences to extract the necessary signals from the video data stream. These are embodied in distinct coding blocks and are conditioned at different stages by the video enable signal and video lock signal ensuring that the processing and sync extraction are done correctly, only when the video data is reliable and the system is ready to process it. This module encapsulates the complexities of embedded video sync extraction while efficiently handling diverse scenarios of video data formats and synchronization needs."
