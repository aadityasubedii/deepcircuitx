The input ports include clk (system clock), reset_n (active low reset), s_chipselect_n (active low chip select), s_byteenable_n (byte enable for partial data access), s_write_n (active low write control), s_read_n (active low read control), s_address (memory address bus), and s_writedata (data for SRAM during write). The output ports comprise s_readdata (data read from SRAM), SRAM_CE_n (active low chip enable), SRAM_OE_n (active low output enable), SRAM_LB_n and SRAM_UB_n (active low byte enables), SRAM_WE_n (active low write enable), SRAM_ADDR (address bus for SRAM), and SRAM_DQ (bidirectional data bus).

The Verilog code for the module assigns values to the SRAM control and data signals based on the state of the inputs, with conditional data flow control for SRAM_DQ during write operations and direct assignments for readdata and address mappings.",
