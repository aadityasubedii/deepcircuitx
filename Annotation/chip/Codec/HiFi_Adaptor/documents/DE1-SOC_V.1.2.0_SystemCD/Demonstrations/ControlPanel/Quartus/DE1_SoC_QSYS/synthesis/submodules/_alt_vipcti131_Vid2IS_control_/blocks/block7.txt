This block defines a constant signal assignment that permanently sets the `clear_overflow_sticky` signal to `0`, disabling the feature to clear an overflow sticky bit. The `assign` statement directly assigns the binary value `0` to the signal, indicating that there is no dynamic logic controlling this feature within the design context of this block.
