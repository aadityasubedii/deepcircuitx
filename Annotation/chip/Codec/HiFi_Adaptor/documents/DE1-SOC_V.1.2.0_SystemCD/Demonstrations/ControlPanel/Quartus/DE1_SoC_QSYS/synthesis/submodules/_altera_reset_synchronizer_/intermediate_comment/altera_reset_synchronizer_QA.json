It takes an asynchronous reset signal ('reset_in') and a clock signal ('clk'), and outputs a synchronized reset signal ('reset_out'). The synchronization is managed through a shift register chain of length specified by the 'DEPTH' parameter. The design can be configured to handle either asynchronous or synchronous resets based on the 'ASYNC_RESET' parameter. During asynchronous reset mode, when 'reset_in' is asserted (high), it immediately sets the entire shift register chain and the output to high. Otherwise, it shifts zero into the last register of the chain and propagates this through the registers, thus ensuring synchronous behavior relative to the clock signal. In synchronous reset mode, the shift operation directly incorporates the 'reset_in' value into the chain every clock cycle, still maintaining synchronization with 'clk'. The output 'reset_out' replicates the last state of the shift register chain, now effectively synchronized with the clock, minimizing the risk of metastability in downstream logic triggered by the reset."
