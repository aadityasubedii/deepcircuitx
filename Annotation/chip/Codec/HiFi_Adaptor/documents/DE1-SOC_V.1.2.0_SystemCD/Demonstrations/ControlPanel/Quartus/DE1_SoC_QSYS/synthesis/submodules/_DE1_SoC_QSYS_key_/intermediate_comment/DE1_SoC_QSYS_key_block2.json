    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is responsible for data synchronization and double buffering. On a negative edge reset, the registers `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in` are reset to 0. If the `clk_en` signal is enabled, the incoming data `data_in` is sequentially shifted through these two registers on each positive edge of the clock, thus implementing a pipelining mechanism. This structure helps in managing data skew and timing issues in digital circuits."
