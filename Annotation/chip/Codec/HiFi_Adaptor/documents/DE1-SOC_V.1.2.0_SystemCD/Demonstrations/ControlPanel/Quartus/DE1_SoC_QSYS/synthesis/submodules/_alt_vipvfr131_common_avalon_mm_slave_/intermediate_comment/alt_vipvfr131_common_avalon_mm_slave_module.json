    "module": "Module-level comment: The alt_vipvfr131_common_avalon_mm_slave module serves as a configurable Avalon MM slave interface for managing registers and handling interrupts in FPGA designs. It supports parameterizable address/data widths and number of registers/interrupts. The module processes read/write operations on the Avalon bus, manages internal register updates, and handles interrupts based on external and dynamic conditions, all synchronized to the system clock and external reset."
