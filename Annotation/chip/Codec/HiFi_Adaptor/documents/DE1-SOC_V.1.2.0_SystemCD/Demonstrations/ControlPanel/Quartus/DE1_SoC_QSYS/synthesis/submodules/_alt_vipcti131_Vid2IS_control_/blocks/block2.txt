Comment: 
This Verilog block defines a signal assignment for `is_std`. It assigns the lower 16 bits of the `vid_std` signal to `is_std`, effectively extracting a portion of the `vid_std` signal for use elsewhere in the design. The implementation utilizes the Verilog bit-slice notation to select the specific bits from `vid_std`.
