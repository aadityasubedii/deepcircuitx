Module name: alt_vipcti130_common_sync_generation.

Module specification: The alt_vipcti130_common_sync_generation module is integral to a video processing system, designed to synchronize the Start of Frame (SoF) signals in line with input video format specifications. It operates based on various input signals such as reset (rst), clock (clk), and controls like clear_enable and enable_count, which manage internal counters and states ensuring accurate synchronization. The inputs include signals representing vertical synchronization start (start_of_vsync), high-definition signal status (hd_sdn), interlaced video flag (interlaced), and various counts and validations (like total_sample_count and total_sample_count_valid) which are crucial for precise timing operations. It provides sof and sof_locked as outputs indicating the start of a frame and its stability, with div signaling further synchronization adjustments. Internally, the module utilizes signals like enable_next, sof_next, and count_div to manage state transitions and operations based on conditions like stable input signals and valid count states. The module contains embedded instances of alt_vipcti130_common_frame_counter configured for managing total and divider counts, thereby aligning horizontal and vertical counts with input specifications. Additionally, various parameters allow customization for different operational conditions such as color planes and sequential-to-parallel conversion needs. This module demonstrates a complex but structured approach to ensuring video frame synchronization in diverse processing scenarios.
