    "block_comment": "This block of code functions as a signal assignment in a Verilog module. It assigns the value of the signal `vid_clk` to the signal `vid_clk_int`, effectively making `vid_clk_int` a mirror or replica of `vid_clk`. This is typically done to ensure signal integrity or to simplify connections within a larger design by using more descriptively named signals."
