    "module": "Module-level comment: The altera_avalon_mm_clock_crossing_bridge module ensures synchronous data communication across different clock domains using FIFOs. It accepts varied inputs such as clock, reset, and control signals to manage read/write operations and address handling. Internally, command and response FIFOs store and synchronize transactions, prevent overflow, and enable robust data transfers between the master and slave sides, accommodating dynamic burst counts and clock discrepancies."
