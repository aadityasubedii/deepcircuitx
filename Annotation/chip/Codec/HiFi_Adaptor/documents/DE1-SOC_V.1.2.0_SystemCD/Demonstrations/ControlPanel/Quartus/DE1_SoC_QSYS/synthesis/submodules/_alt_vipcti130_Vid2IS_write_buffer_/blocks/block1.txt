Comment: 
This block generates the output packet signal by combining the `write_buffer_packet` and `early_eop` signals using a bitwise OR operation. The `write_buffer_packet` likely contains the data from a write buffer, whereas `early_eop` indicates an early end-of-packet scenario. This combination is essential for handling cases where the packet completion can be signaled either from stored data or preemptively.
