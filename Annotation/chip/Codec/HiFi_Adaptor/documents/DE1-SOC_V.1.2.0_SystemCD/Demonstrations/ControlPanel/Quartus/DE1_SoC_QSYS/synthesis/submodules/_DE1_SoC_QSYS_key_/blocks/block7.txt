Comment: 
The block generates a write strobe signal for edge capture based on specific conditions. It checks if the chip is selected, if it is a write operation (not write_n, which implies active low write), and if the specific target address is 3. If all conditions are met, the output signal 'edge_capture_wr_strobe' is asserted high.
