It takes in different PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) clock inputs which include `pll_hr_clk`, `pll_dq_clk`, and `pll_dqs_clk`. Within the module, depending on a parameter `IS_HHP_HPS`, it either directly assigns these PLL clock signals to various internal clock signals or uses a clock buffer  (`cyclonev_phy_clkbuf`) to generate them. Additionally, it uses components like `cyclonev_leveling_delay_chain` and `cyclonev_clk_phase_select` to manipulate delay and phase settings of these clocks to produce the required output clocks such as `afi_clk`, `avl_clk`, `adc_clk`, and `hr_clk`. These outputs are likely used to drive other parts of the SDRAM system, ensuring appropriate synchronization and operational timing."

It is utilized to generate or buffer a high-resolution clock (`phy_clk_hr`) critical for the timing within the SDRAM system.\n- `pll_dq_clk`: This clock input is related to the data queue of the SDRAM. It is used for buffering or generating a clock signal (`phy_clk_dq`) intended for use with data handling in SDRAM.\n- `pll_dqs_clk`: This is a DQS (data strobe) clock input from a PLL. This clock is crucial for timing the data strobe actions in SDRAM and is used to generate or buffer the clock signal (`phy_clk_dqs`).\n- `dll_phy_delayctrl`: This input provides delay control for a DLL (Delay-Locked Loop), used in leveling delay chains to fine-tune the clocks being forwarded to SDRAM.\n\nOutput ports: `afi_clk`, `avl_clk`, `adc_clk`, `adc_clk_cps`, `hr_clk`.\nExplanation:\n- `afi_clk`: This output clock is derived from `phy_clk_dqs` after it is passed through a leveling delay chain. It is specifically processed to be used within the SDRAM system for managing front-end interactions.\n- `avl_clk`: Derived from `phy_clk_hr`, this clock undergoes delay adjustments and is then used typically for address and command verification within the SDRAM.\n- `adc_clk`: This SDRAM-specific clock is generated from `phy_clk_dqs` after passing through conditional inversion based on the `ADC_INVERT_PHASE` parameter. It serves precise adjustment needs in the address/command domain.\n- `adc_clk_cps`: Generated by selecting phases from `leveled_dqs_clocks` using `cyclonev_clk_phase_select`, this clock is critical for commands and addresses in the SDRAM, providing specific phase alignment as per the module settings.\n- `hr_clk`: A sequence-controlled clock generated and output for potentially wide-ranging uses within the SDRAM system, ensuring timely sequencing as dictated by requirements.
