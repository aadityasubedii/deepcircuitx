    "block_comment": "This block defines a local parameter for specifying the required width of a memory address in a system. By setting `MM_ADDR_REQUIREDWIDTH` to 32, it determines that the address width for handling memory addresses is 32 bits, which is commonly used in many computing systems for addressing up to 4GB of memory space. This parameter is used throughout the Verilog code to standardize the size of memory addresses utilized in various modules or blocks within the design."
