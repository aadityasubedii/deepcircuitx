    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block manages register access and internal control logic based on address decoding for read and write operations. When reset (rst) is asserted, it initializes `master_enable`, `output_switch`, and `av_readdata` to zero. If not in reset, it conditionally modifies `master_enable` based on the `av_write` signal and the specified address; it specifically utilizes the first bit of `av_writedata`. Meanwhile, `output_switch` is updated based on both the write operation and address checking against certain conditions with `global_synced`. For read operations (`av_read`), the block outputs values from `master_enable` or `output_switch` or the negation of `global_synced` based on the input address, with all cases handling the data width dynamically. This setup allows for effective module configuration and state querying via specific address interactions based on incoming signals."
