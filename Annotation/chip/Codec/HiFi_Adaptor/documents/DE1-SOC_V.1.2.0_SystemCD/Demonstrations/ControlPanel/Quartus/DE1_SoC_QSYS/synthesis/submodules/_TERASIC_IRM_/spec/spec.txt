Module name: TERASIC_IRM. 
Module specification: The TERASIC_IRM module is designed to interface with an infrared data communication device, specifically the IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic, to handle signal processing of IR communications within a larger system. The module's inputs include the `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `s_cs_n` (active-low chip select for module communication), `s_read` (signal for read operation request), `s_write` (signal for write operation request), `s_writedata` (32-bit input data from master), and `ir` (IR signal from the receiver). The outputs are `irq` (interrupt request signal set when data is ready and reset during certain write operations) and `s_readdata` (32-bit data output to the master from the IR receiver). Internally, the module uses `data_ready` (flag from the IR receiver indicating data availability) and `pre_data_ready` (stores previous state of `data_ready` to detect new data availability). The module includes two main always blocks: one to update `pre_data_ready` at each positive clock edge or reset, and another to manage the `irq` signal based on data availability and write operations. An instance of the IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic receives the IR signal and indicates data readiness while also handling data output.
