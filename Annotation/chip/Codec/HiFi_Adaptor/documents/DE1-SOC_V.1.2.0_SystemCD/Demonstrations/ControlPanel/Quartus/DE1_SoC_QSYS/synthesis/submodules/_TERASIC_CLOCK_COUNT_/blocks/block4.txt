Comment: 
This Verilog block implements a synchronous reset mechanism for a binary state. On the positive edge of either the system clock (`s_clk_in`) or reset signal (`s_reset_in`), the block checks if the reset is active; if so, it sets the `pre_counting_now` register to a low state (`0`). If reset is not active, the register retains the value of another register `counting_now`, thus ensuring that `pre_counting_now` is updated only on the clock edge and holds its value constant through the rest of the cycle.
