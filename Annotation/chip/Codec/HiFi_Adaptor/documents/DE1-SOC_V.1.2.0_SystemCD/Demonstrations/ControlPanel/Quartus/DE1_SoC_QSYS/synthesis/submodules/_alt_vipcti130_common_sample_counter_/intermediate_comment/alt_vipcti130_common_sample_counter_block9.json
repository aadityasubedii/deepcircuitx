    "block_comment": "This Verilog block configures data sampling based on the number of color planes. If there is only one color plane, the cycle count directly equals the sample count, the start of the sample is flagged high immediately, and sample ticks are set to zero, simplifying the process. For multiple color planes, it uses a register to count valid samples and a wire to indicate when a new sample is ready, calculated when the count matches the total planes minus one, effectively managing more complex multi-plane sampling scenarios. To understand the full implementation, see how `count_valids` is incremented and utilized further in the code."
