The module reads a 10-bit input signal ('in_port'), detects edges between consecutive clock cycles, and uses specific addresses to control and access interrupt masks, edge capture registers, and input data. It features an interrupt signal output ('irq') which is asserted when a registered edge matches the interrupt mask conditions. It also provides functionality to reset the edge capture register under certain conditions, offering direct handling and control over input-related events in real-time applications."

It is monitored to detect changes that might generate interrupts or require action.\n- `reset_n`: An active-low reset signal that resets the internal state and registers of the module when asserted (low).\n- `write_n`: An active-low write enable signal, used to determine when the data in `writedata` should be written to the selected register.\n- `writedata`: A 32-bit input data bus used for writing data into registers within the module based on the address and `chipselect` inputs.\n\nOutput ports: irq, readdata.\nExplanation:\n- `irq`: An output interrupt signal that goes high when an edge is detected on any of the `in_port` inputs that have corresponding bits set in the `irq_mask` register. It communicates interrupt events to other components of the system.\n- `readdata`: A 32-bit output that provides the data from internal registers or states based on the address input. It allows external components to read the current settings or statuses like the IRQ masks or captured edges.\n"

It permits the propagation of certain clock-dependent processes in the module, specifically where gating with `clk_en` controls the operation.\n- `d1_data_in`: A register that captures the value of `data_in` at a given clock edge.

This shifting allows the detection of changes (edges) between consecutive clock cycles.\n- `data_in`: A wire that simply passes the `in_port` value internally for processing. It acts as the main input path for the switch data into the detection and register sections of the logic.\n- `edge_capture`: A register array representing individual edge detection statuses for each bit of `in_port`. It latches high (sets) when an edge is detected and matches the conditions set by the `irq_mask`.\n- `edge_capture_wr_strobe`: A wire signal that indicates when a write operation specifically to the `edge_capture` register should be recognized and processed. It ensures that the `edge_capture` register is only modified under appropriate command conditions.\n- `edge_detect`: A wire derived from the bitwise XOR (`^`) between `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in`. It generates a '1' for any bit position where a change (edge) between two consecutive sampling points has occurred.\n- `irq_mask`: A register that sets or clears mask bits which enable or disable edge detection interrupts on a per-bit basis. Only masked bits will contribute to the `irq` signal when their edges are captured.\n- `read_mux_out`: A wire that multiplexes output data based on the `address` input. It selects between the `data_in`, `irq_mask`, and `edge_capture` for reading operations, effectively acting as a data output selector based on the contextual address provided."
