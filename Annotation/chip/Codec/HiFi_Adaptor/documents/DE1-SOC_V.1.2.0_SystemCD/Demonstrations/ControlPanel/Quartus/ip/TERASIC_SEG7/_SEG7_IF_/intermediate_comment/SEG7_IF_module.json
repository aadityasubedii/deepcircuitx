    "module": "Module-level comment: The SEG7_IF module interfaces with a 7-segment display, managing data exchange between system memory and display segments. It handles initialization, and data write/read operations governed by the `s_reset`, `s_write`, and `s_read` signals. Data writes and reads are manipulated within an `always` block, responding to negedge `s_clk`, with segment states stored in `reg_file`. Outputs, conditioned by `LOW_ACTIVE`, reflect segment activity through `SEG7` and `s_readdata`."
