Module-level comment: The alt_vipcti130_Vid2IS_resolution_detection module detects video resolution by counting active and total video samples and lines. It leverages input signals to update counters dynamically and outputs stability, interlace status, and resolution validity. It integrates a sample_counter instance, conditional assignments, and sequential logic in always blocks to manage and reflect video resolution changes effectively. This module serves critical in adapting processing based on the detected resolution parameters.
