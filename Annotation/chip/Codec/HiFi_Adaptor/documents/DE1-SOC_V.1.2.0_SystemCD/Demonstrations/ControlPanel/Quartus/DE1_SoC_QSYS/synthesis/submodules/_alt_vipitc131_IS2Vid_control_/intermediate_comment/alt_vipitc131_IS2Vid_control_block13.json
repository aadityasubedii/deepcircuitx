    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block updates a system status. It performs a logical OR operation between two status registers: `status_update_int_reg` and `genlocked_int_reg`, resulting in `status_update_int`. This approach allows the system to determine an updated status based on either of the input conditions being true, enhancing the responsiveness and state monitoring of the system."
