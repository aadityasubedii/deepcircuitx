    "block_comment": "This block manages the sequential input data buffering for a digital system. When reset is active (low), it initializes two data input registers `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in` to zero, ensuring a known start state. Upon each positive clock edge where clock enable (`clk_en`) is high, it latches the incoming `data_in` into `d1_data_in`, and the previously-stored `d1_data_in` into `d2_data_in`, thus achieving a two-stage data pipeline to process or delay the input data synchronously with the clock."
