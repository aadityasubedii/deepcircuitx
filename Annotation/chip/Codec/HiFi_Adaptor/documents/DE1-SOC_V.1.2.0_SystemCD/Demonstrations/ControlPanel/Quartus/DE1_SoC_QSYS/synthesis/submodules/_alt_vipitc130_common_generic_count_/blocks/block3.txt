Comment: 
This code block controls a counter's enable signal based on timing conditions. It assigns the `enable_count` signal, allowing the count operation to proceed when `enable` is active and either the number of `ticks` has reached a preset threshold (`TICKS_PER_COUNT - 1`) or the `enable_ticks` signal is inactive.
