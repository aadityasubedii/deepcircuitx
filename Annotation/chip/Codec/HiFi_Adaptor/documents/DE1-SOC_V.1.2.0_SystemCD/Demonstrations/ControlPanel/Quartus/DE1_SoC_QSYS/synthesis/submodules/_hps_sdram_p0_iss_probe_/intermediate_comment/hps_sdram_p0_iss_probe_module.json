    "module": "Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_iss_probe` module incorporates a logic analyzer probe (`altsource_probe`) for signal debugging in FPGA designs. It routes the parameterized input `probe_input` directly to the analyzer for observation, with no outputs or internal signal processing. Properties like ID and probe width are configured via `defparam` to optimize debug interfacing."
