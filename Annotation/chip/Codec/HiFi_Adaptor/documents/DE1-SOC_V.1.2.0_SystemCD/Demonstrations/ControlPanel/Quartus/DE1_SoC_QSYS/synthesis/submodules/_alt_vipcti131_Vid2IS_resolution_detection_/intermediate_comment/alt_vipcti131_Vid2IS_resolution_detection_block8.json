    "block_comment": "The block assigns a logical AND operation result to `field_1`. It performs the operation based on the current value of `reset_line_count` and `f`, indicating that `field_1` will only be set when both `reset_line_count` and `f` are high, typically used for conditional signal control within synchronous designs or control logic."
