This block of code handles conditional assignment for the `count_sample` signal based on the state of the `hd_sdn` signal. If `hd_sdn` is true, `count_sample` is assigned the value of `count_cycle`. If `hd_sdn` is false, `count_sample` is assigned the value resulting from a bitwise AND operation between `count_cycle` and `new_sample`. This implementation allows `count_sample` to adapt based on the control signal `hd_sdn`, effectively integrating control flow into signal assignment.
