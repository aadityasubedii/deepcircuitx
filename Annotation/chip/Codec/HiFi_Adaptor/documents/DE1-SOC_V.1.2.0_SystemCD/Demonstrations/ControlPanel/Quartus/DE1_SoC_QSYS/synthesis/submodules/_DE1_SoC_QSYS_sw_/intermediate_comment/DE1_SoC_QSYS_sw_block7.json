    "block_comment": "This block manages the capture of edge-triggered events for a specific signal line. Upon a negative reset or when enabled by `clk_en`, it checks and updates the `edge_capture[5]` register. If `reset_n` is low, the register is cleared to 0. Under the clock enable condition (`clk_en`), if an edge write strobe (`edge_capture_wr_strobe`) is asserted, it also clears the register. However, if an edge is detected on the signal line (`edge_detect[5]`), it sets `edge_capture[5]` to -1, effectively recording the edge event."
