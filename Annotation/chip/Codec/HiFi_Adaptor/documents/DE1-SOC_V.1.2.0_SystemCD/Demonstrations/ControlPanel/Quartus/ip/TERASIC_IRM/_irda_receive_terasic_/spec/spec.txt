Module name: IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic. 
Module specification: The IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic module is designed for receiving and decoding IRDA (Infrared Data Association) signals. It processes these signals through state transitions: IDLE, GUIDANCE, and DATAREAD, to detect, synchronize, and decode the incoming data packets based on signal durations. Input ports include iCLK (clock input), iRST_n (active low reset), iIRDA (IRDA data input), and iREAD (data read command). Output ports comprise oDATA_REAY (indicates data readiness), and oDATA (32-bit output data port). Internally, the module utilizes signals such as DATA_REAY (signals data readiness), idle_count and state_count (counters for measuring signal durations in respective states), data_count (counter for data bits duration), bitcount (bit counter for the data packet), and state (tracks the current state of the machine). The module's operations are orchestrated across various blocks handling resets, state transitions, data reading and output generation, where each block manipulates specific counters and flags to control the flow and decoding of IRDA signals, ensuring synchronized data processing and output readiness based on input conditions and internally tracked state.
