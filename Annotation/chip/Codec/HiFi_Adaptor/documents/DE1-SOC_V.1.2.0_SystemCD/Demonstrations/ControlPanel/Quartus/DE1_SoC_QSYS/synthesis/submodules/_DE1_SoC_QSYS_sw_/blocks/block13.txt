Comment: 
This Verilog block generates a write strobe signal for edge capture. The `edge_capture_wr_strobe` signal is activated when the `chipselect` is high, the `write_n` is low (indicating a write operation), and the `address` is specifically set to 3, indicating that the operation targets the edge capture register.
