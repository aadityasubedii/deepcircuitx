    "module": "Module-level comment: This module converts video data with embedded synchronization to a format with explicit control signals (SOP/EOP). It processes input video data and sync signals, extracts timing information, handles interlaced video, and outputs formatted data with associated control signals. The module uses FIFOs for data buffering, implements resolution detection, and supports various video formats and clock domains. It also includes overflow protection and status reporting features."
