If CLOCKS_ARE_SAME is set to 1, the input data is directly assigned to the output as they are in the same clock domain. If CLOCKS_ARE_SAME is 0, which implies different clock domains, it uses a double register synchronization technique to safely pass the data signal 'data_in' to 'data_out'. This helps prevent possible metastability issues arising from clock domain crossing. The registers, 'data_out_sync0' and 'data_out_sync1', are used in series to synchronize the data, with specific synthesis attributes assigned to guide the synthesis tool's behavior for these registers."

Data is synchronized to this clock domain if CLOCKS_ARE_SAME is 0 (indicating different clock domains).\n- data_in: This is the input data signal which needs to be synchronized either within the same clock domain or across different clock domains based on the CLOCKS_ARE_SAME parameter.
