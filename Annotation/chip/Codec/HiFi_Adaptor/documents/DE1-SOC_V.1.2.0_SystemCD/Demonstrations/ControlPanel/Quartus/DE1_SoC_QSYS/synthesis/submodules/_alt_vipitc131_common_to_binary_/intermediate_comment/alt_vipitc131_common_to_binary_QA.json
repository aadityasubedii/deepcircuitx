In a one-hot encoding system, only one bit is high (1) at a time, and this module identifies the position of that high bit and translates it into its binary representation. The parameters `NO_OF_MODES` and `LOG2_NO_OF_MODES` define the size of the input and output, respectively. The module uses nested generate loops to create combinational logic for the conversion."

The position of the '1' in this vector corresponds to the mode being represented.\n\nOutput ports: [binary]. Explanation: The 'binary' is an output port which provides the binary encoded equivalent of the input one-hot encoded signal. This binary output represents the position of the '1' in the one-hot vector in binary form, compressed to a size determined by `LOG2_NO_OF_MODES`, which is the log base 2 of the number of modes, effectively representing the number of bits needed to encode the mode information in binary."

Explanation: The `binary_values` internal signal is a wide wire array that stores intermediate binary values for each one-hot input possibility. Each segment of the `binary_values` corresponds to a specific one-hot input position (one_hot_pos) and is used to hold the binary representation of that position if the respective one-hot signal is high. The role of this signal is to hold preliminary binary outputs for each one-hot input before consolidating into the final binary output. The `binary_values_by_bit` signal further processes the `binary_values` by rearranging bits according to their significance across all preliminary binary outputs. This restructuring assists in the final assignment to the `binary` output port by simplifying the aggregation of relevant bits using the bitwise OR operation. This signal ensures that for each bit position in the final binary output, the correct bits from `binary_values` are collectively ORed to determine the final output bit state."
