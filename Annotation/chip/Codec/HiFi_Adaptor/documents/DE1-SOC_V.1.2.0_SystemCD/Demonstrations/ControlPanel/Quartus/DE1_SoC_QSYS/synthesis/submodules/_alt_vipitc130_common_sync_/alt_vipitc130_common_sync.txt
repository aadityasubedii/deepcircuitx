Module-level comment: The alt_vipitc130_common_sync module synchronizes multi-bit data across different clock domains to handle metastability. It uses a two-stage flip-flop synch scheme controlled by `sync_clock` for differing clocks, directly passing data otherwise. It features reset initialization and stages `data_out_sync0` & `data_out_sync1` for reliable data transfer, with FPGA-specific attributes to aid in synthesis tool handling.
