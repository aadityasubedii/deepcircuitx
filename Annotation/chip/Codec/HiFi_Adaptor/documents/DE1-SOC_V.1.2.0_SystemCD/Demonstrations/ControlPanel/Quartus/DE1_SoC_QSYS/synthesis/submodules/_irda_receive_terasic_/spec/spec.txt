Module name: IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic. 
Module specification: The IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic module is designed to receive and decode infrared signals transmitted over an IRDA interface, converting them into a 32-bit digital data output. This module operates based on inputs such as the system clock (`iCLK`), a negative logic reset (`iRST_n`), the IRDA signal itself (`iIRDA`), and a read control signal (`iREAD`). It provides outputs indicating the data readiness (`oDATA_REAY`) and the actual data (`oDATA`). The internal operation is managed through various internal signals including `DATA_REAY`, `idle_count`, `idle_count_flag`, `state_count`, `state_count_flag`, `data_count`, `data_count_flag`, `bitcount`, `state`, `DATA`, `DATA_BUF`, and the output data register `oDATA`. The module processes data in sequential states: IDLE, where it waits for a signal; GUIDANCE, where it validates the signal's presence; and DATAREAD, where actual data bits are read and assembled into the `oDATA`. The transitions between these states are controlled by monitoring signal durations using the counters (`idle_count`, `state_count`, and `data_count`). Error checking is performed in the final stages of the DATAREAD state by comparing parts of the received data before setting the data ready signal (`oDATA_REAY`). This modular approach ensures accurate data handling and a clear transition through different phases of IRDA data reception, leverage signal-specific durations to synchronize data encoding shifts appropriately.
