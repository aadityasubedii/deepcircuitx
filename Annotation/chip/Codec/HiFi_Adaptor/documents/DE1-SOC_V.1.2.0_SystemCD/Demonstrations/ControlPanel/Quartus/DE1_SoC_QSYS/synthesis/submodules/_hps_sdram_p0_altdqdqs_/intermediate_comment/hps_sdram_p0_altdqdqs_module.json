    "module": "Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_altdqdqs` module interfaces FPGA core logic with SDRAM, managing data I/O and timing interactions. Key inputs include clocks and data lines, with outputs for strobe and data feedback. Internally, it uses `altdq_dqs2_acv_connect_to_hard_phy_cyclonev` for detailed signal handling and phase alignment, supported by extensive parameter configurations for optimal SDRAM operation, focusing on data integrity and synchronization."
