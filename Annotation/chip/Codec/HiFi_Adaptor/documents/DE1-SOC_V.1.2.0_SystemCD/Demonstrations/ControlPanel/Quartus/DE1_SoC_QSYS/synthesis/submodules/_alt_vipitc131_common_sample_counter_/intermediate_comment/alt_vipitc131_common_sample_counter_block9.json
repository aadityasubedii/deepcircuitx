    "block_comment": "This Verilog code manages pixel sampling based on the color planes specified. If there is only one color plane, it directly maps the cycle count to sample count and signifies the start of a sample; no additional ticks are marked for sampling. For configurations with multiple color planes, it maintains a register to count valid color samples and determines when a new sample is started through a comparison mechanism. This is achieved using a condition that triggers a new sample when the count matches the number of color planes minus one."
