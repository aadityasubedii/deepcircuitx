    "block_comment": "This block handles asynchronous reset and conditional data updating of a register. When the asynchronous reset (`reset_n`) is low, it clears the `readdata` register to zero. Conversely, if the clock enable (`clk_en`) signal is active, it updates `readdata` with the value from `read_mux_out` sign-extended to 32 bits. The update occurs at the positive edge of the clock (`posedge clk`)."
