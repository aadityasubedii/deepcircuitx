Module name: alt_vipvfr130_common_stream_output.
Module specification: The `alt_vipvfr130_common_stream_output` module is crafted to interface and synchronize streaming image data packets between components in a system, ensuring data integrity and flow control based on the 'enable' and synchronization states. It receives input signals: `rst` (reset, active high), `clk` (clock signal), `dout_ready` (downstream readiness indicator), `int_valid` (validity of incoming data), `int_data` (incoming image data), `int_sop` (start of the incoming packet), `int_eop` (end of the incoming packet), and `enable` (stream processing control). The module outputs `dout_valid` (validity of outgoing data), `dout_data` (processed image data), `dout_sop`, `dout_eop` (start and end markers of the outgoing packet), `int_ready` (ready to accept more data), and `synced` (synchronization status). Internal signals like `image_packet`, `synced_int`, `enable_synced_reg`, `sop`, and `eop` manage packet processing stages, synchronization, and transitional states of the data flow. The module consists of several critical sections; two primary always blocks handle state updates and data transfer, based on clock and reset events, with conditions to ensure only synchronized and validated data packets are transferred, influenced by both upstream data availability and downstream readiness. Assign statements are used to define next-state conditions and to pass status flags and synchronization states throughout the module, knitting the control logic tightly with the system's operational requirements and enabling conditions.
