Comment: 
This block extracts specific bits from a register array to form `packet_samples`. The assignment slices bits from a larger register array `registers`, using calculated bit positions derived from constants `SLAVE_DATA_REQUIREDWIDTH` and `PACKET_SAMPLES_REQUIREDWIDTH`, spanning from the product of twice the `SLAVE_DATA_REQUIREDWIDTH` plus the `PACKET_SAMPLES_REQUIREDWIDTH` minus one to twice the `SLAVE_DATA_REQUIREDWIDTH`.
