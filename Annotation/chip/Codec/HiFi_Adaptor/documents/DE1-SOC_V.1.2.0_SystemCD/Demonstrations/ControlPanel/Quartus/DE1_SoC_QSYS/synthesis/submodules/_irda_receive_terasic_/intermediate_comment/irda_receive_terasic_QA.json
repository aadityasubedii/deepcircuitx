It operates by detecting and interpreting infrared signals received through the `iIRDA` input, handling different states such as idle, guidance, and data reading. The module utilizes various duration parameters to manage state transitions and to decode the received bits into a 32-bit data output (`oDATA`), which is made available when the data is ready (`oDATA_REAY`). The system operates based on clock (`iCLK`) and reset (`iRST_n`) signals and reads input (`iREAD`). It ensures data integrity by comparing parts of the received data and toggling the data ready status accordingly.\n"

When `oDATA_REAY` is high (`1'b1`), it signals that the corresponding `oDATA`, which holds the decoded 32-bit data received from the IRDA interface, is reliable and can be read."

It's set high when the data meets the necessary conditions and is valid for use.\n- `idle_count`: A counter used to measure the duration the IRDA signal `iIRDA` remains in the low state during the IDLE phase, helping to determine transitions to the GUIDANCE state.\n- `idle_count_flag`: A flag that controls whether to increment the `idle_count`. It's set high when the system is in the IDLE state and `iIRDA` is low, ensuring accurate counting of idle time.\n- `state_count`: A counter used to measure durations in various states, such as the duration the IRDA signal remains high during the GUIDANCE state, important for transitioning to the DATAREAD state.\n- `state_count_flag`: Controls the incrementing of `state_count`. It's set high during the GUIDANCE state when `iIRDA` is high, to count the duration of high IRDA signal in this state.\n- `data_count`: Used in the DATAREAD state to measure the duration between data bits or the overall time the data is being read, facilitating correct bit decoding and state transition.\n- `data_count_flag`: A flag that indicates whether to increment `data_count`. It's set during the DATAREAD state when `iIRDA` is high, meaning active data reading is in progress.\n- `bitcount`: Counts the number of bits that have been read successfully during the DATAREAD state, crucial for managing the correct position when assigning bits to the `DATA` register.\n- `state`: A state register that indicates the current operating state of the module (IDLE, GUIDANCE, DATAREAD). It orchestrates the behavior of the module based on the state transitions determined by the other counters and flags.\n- `DATA`: A register that temporarily holds the data bits being read in the DATAREAD state, before they are confirmed and stored into `oDATA`.\n- `DATA_BUF`: This register serves as a buffer (though not used in the provided code segment), typically to temporarily store data that must be processed or verified before being sent to the output.\n- `oDATA`: An internal register directly connected to the output port `oDATA`, holding the validated 32-bit decoded data ready to be sent out when `DATA_REAY` is high."
