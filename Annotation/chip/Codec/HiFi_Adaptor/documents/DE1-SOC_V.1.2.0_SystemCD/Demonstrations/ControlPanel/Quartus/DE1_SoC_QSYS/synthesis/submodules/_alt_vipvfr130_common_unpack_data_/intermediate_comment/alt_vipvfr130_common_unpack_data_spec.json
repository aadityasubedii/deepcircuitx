    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipvfr130_common_unpack_data. \nModule specification: The `alt_vipvfr130_common_unpack_data` module processes and adapts an input data stream of varying bit-width (`DATA_WIDTH_IN`) into an output stream with a specified different width (`DATA_WIDTH_OUT`). It operates within a system defined by a `clock` and `reset` signal for synchronization and resetting, respectively. The module takes `data_in`, which is the data to be processed. It deals with flow control through `stall_in` and `stall_out` signals; the `stall_in` pauses reading new data, whereas `stall_out` manages the module's data output flow. The `clear` signal is used to reset or discard the data under specific conditions. The core outputs are `read`, which signals when the module wants to ingest new input data, `write`, which manages the data output readiness, and `data_out`, which is the adapted output data stream. Internally, `need_input` and `ena` signals control data flow based on stall conditions and data availability; `need_input` directs the reading operations, and `ena` is activated when there is no input stall. In the module, an instantiation of the `alt_vipvfr130_common_pulling_width_adapter` submodule adapts the input data width to the output data width, manages the interface logic for pulling and discarding data using control signals like `pull`, `pull_en`, `discard`, and `discard_en`, and operates based on the clock and enable conditions managed by `ena`. An always block handles the logic for the `write` signal, ensuring it is properly reset and managed according to the `stall_out` condition and `ena` status. This module provides an essential functionality in systems requiring dynamic data width adaptation and flow control management.",

It takes in a data stream of a width defined by `DATA_WIDTH_IN` and outputs a transformed data stream of `DATA_WIDTH_OUT` width. The module uses an instance of `alt_vipvfr130_common_pulling_width_adapter` to adapt the data width while also managing back-pressure through `stall_in` and `stall_out` signals. It reads input data only when there is a need (`need_input`) and accommodates for system pauses via the `stall_in`, and clears or discards data conditionally with the `clear` signal. The output enable (`write`) is controlled by both the absence of output stall and the input data availability. The module ensures proper resetting and synchronization with the system clock."

It is the data that needs to be processed or adapted to a different width.\n- `stall_in`: Input stall control signal. When asserted, it signals the module to pause reading new input data, used to manage flow control coming into the module.\n- `stall_out`: Output stall signal observed as an input inside this module. When asserted, it indicates that downstream elements are not ready to accept more data, controlling the flow of the adapted output data.\n- `clear`: Input signal used to discard or clear the current data or state under certain conditions, typically utilized in error or specific control scenarios.\n\nOutput ports: `read`, `write`, `data_out`.\nExplanation:\n- `read`: Output signal that indicates whether new data should be read from the input.
