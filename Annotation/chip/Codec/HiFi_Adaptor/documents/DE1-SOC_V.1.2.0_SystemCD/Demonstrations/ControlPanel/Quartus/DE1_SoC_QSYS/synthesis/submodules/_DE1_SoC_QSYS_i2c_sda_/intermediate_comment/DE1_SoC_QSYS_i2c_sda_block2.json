    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of the bidirectional port, `bidir_port`, to the input signal `data_in`. This assignment ensures that the data received from the bidirectional port is forwarded internally as an input, allowing for efficient data communication and manipulation within the system. This signal assignment is typically used in interfacing scenarios where data flow direction can vary."
