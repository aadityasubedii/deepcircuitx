    "module": "Module-level comment: The alt_vipcti130_Vid2IS_sync_polarity_convertor module conditionally inverts an input sync signal based on a data-valid signal. It utilizes internal state-holding registers, edge detection, and XOR logic to dynamically manage sync signal polarity, responding to changes detected on the falling edge of the data-valid signal. The module operates synchronously with provided clock and reset signals, ensuring stable and predictable output."
