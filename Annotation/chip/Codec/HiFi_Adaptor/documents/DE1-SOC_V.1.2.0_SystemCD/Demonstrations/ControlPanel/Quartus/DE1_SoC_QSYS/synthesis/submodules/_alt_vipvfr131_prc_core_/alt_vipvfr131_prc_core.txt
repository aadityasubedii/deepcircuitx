Module-level comment: The 'alt_vipvfr131_prc_core' module processes data packets for reading operations using a state machine with IDLE, WAITING, RUNNING, and ENDING states. It handles synchronization, command execution, and data flow using internal signals and control structures, interacting through various I/O ports to align with system-level operations and data exchanges.
