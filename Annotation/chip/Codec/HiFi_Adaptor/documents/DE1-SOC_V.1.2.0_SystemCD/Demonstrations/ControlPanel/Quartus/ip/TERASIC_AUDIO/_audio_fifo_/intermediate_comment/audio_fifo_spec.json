    "spec": "Module name: audio_fifo. Module specification: The \"audio_fifo\" is a Verilog module designed as a dual-clock FIFO buffer specifically for managing audio data across different clock domains, ensuring data integrity and synchronization in digital systems. It features input ports including `aclr` for asynchronous reset, `data` a 32-bit input bus for audio data, `rdclk` and `wrclk` for read and write clock inputs respectively, along with `rdreq` and `wrreq` for corresponding read and write requests. The output ports consist of `q`, a 32-bit output data bus, and two indicators: `rdempty` and `wrfull` signaling if the FIFO is empty or full. Internally, the module uses signals such as `sub_wire0`, `sub_wire1`, and `sub_wire2` to respectively handle FIFO empty status, FIFO full status, and transferring data to the output. The core component within the module is `dcfifo_component`, configured for use in Cyclone IV E FPGAs, handling the main FIFO functionality with specific parameters for word size, capacity, and synchronization behavior. It includes overflow and underflow checks, and it utilizes embedded array blocks (EABs) for efficient data storage. The module structure is clearly defined with proper initialization of ports and integration of the dcfifo component dealing with necessary FIFO operations and parameter settings.",
