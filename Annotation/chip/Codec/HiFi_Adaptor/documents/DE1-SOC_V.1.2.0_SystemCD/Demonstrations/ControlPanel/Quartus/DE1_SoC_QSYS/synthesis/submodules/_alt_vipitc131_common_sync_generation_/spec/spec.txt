Module name: alt_vipitc131_common_sync_generation. 

Module specification: The alt_vipitc131_common_sync_generation module is designed for synchronizing video signals in a video processing environment, especially handling Start of Frame (SOF) and divider signal generation based on various counts and conditions. It takes numerous input signals such as reset (rst), clock (clk), clear and enable signals for various functionalities, high-definition control signals (hd_sdn), vertical synchronization (start_of_vsync), field predictions, interlace indications, as well as sample and line counts along with their validity flags. The outputs from this module include the SOF, a locked SOF flag (sof_locked) indicating stability, and a divided signal for timing or control (div). Internally, the module uses several signals such as enable_next, enable_reg, sof_next, div_next to manage the flow and logic of frames and synchronization conditions. The module includes key blocks such as frame counters configured for both standard operation and divider operation, controlled by a series of parameters that adjust based on the input signals regarding color processing requirements and video stability. The sof signal management is accomplished with counters like sof_count handling the generation and duration of SOF signals based on configuration defined by the signals sof_sample, sof_line, and sof_subsample, accounting for color plans and high-definition control. This module is crucial for ensuring accurate synchronization in video processes by dynamically adjusting its operations according to the input conditions and the internal logic defined within.
