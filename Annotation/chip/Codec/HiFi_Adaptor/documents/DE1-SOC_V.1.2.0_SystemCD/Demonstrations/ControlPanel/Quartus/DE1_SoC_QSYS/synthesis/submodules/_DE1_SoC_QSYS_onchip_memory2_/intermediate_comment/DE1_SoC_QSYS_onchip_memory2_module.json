    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_onchip_memory2 module implements a single-ported RAM utilizing an altsyncram block. It supports operations using initialized data from a hex file, allowing specific byte-wise read and write access controlled via address, byteenable, chipselect, and write signals under a clk. Internal logic ensures operations only proceed under appropriate conditions set by clocken0 and wren signals."
