    "block_comment": "This block controls the reset signal and manages data read operations based on control signals. During a positive edge of the clock, if both the chip select (s_cs) and write enable (s_write) signals are active, the reset signal (test_reset_n) is updated based on the least significant bit of the write data (s_writedata[0]). Alternatively, if the chip select (s_cs) and read enable (s_read) are active, the read data register (s_readdata) is loaded with the value of lb_error. This implementation uses conditional statements to selectively update signals based on the state of control lines."
