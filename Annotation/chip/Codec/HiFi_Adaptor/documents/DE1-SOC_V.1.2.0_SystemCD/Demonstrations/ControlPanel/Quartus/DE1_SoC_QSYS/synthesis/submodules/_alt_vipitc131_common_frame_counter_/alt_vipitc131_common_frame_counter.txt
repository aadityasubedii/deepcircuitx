Module-level comment: The 'alt_vipitc131_common_frame_counter' is a module designed for video frame position counting, handling horizontal and vertical counters (`h_count` and `v_count`). It reacts to input controls (`rst`, `clk`, `sclr`, `enable`, `hd_sdn`) and uses parameterized internal settings to customize behavior, such as handling different color planes. It works with a submodule (`alt_vipitc131_common_sample_counter`) for detailed timing and sample counting, and implements control logic to manage counter resets and increments based on frame boundaries and sampling events.
