It counts up to a specified maximum value based on a clock input signal and an enable signal. It can also independently manage counting ticks, where ticks are sub-counts per count that can control the counting speed. The start and enable behaviors of the counting can be adjusted through parameters and input signals. The module allows for resetting the count either globally or conditionally using the restart signal. Additionally, it interacts with external components or processes through output signals that indicate the count enable status, start count, and current tick value. This setup allows for versatile use in systems requiring timing and control based on count operations."

The `ticks` register increments every clock cycle when enabled, and resets when the `restart_count` signal is activated or when it reaches a predetermined tick count (`TICKS_PER_COUNT - 1`). This functionality aids in generating precise control over when the counting begins (`start_count`) and whether to allow counting (`enable_count`) based on the defined tick behavior.
