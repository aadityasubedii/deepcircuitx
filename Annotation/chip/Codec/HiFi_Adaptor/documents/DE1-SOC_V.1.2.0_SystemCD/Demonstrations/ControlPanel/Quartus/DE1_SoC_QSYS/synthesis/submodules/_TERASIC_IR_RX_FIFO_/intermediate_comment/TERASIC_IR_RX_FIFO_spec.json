    "spec": "Module name: TERASIC_IR_RX_FIFO. \nModule specification: The TERASIC_IR_RX_FIFO is designed to interface with an infrared (IR) receiver and manage data through a FIFO buffer system. It features input ports, including 'clk' for clock signal, 'reset_n' as an active-low reset, 's_address' for selecting registers, 's_cs_n' as a chip select, 's_read' and 's_write' for data read/write enable signals, 's_writedata' for inputting data on write operations, and 'ir' for receiving raw IR signals. The output includes 'irq' as an interrupt request signal and 's_readdata' providing data output on read operations. Internal signals such as 'fifo_clear' to clear the FIFO, 'use_dw' indicating used data words, 'writedata' and 'readdata' for handling written and read data respectively, 'data_ready' and 'pre_data_ready' for data processing readiness, along with 'read' and 'write' control signals, are crucial for its operation. The module comprises several key code blocks: a block for pre-data-ready treatment, IRQ handling, FIFO control management, read and write data management, and instances of 'ir_fifo' and 'IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic' to handle data buffering and reception from the IR source respectively. This systematic approach ensures efficient data handling, reading and writing capabilities within the IR communication system.",

It supports read and write operations, indicated by `s_read` and `s_write`. The received IR data is handled by an instance of `IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic`, which outputs processed data and a data ready signal. If new data arrives (`data_ready`), an interrupt (`irq`) is generated to notify other system components. The module supports clearing the FIFO (`fifo_clear`) and managing an IRQ based on specific control signals and addresses designated for IR data and control status. Read and write requests to/from the FIFO are managed by a sub-module `ir_fifo_inst`. Overall, the module is responsible for receiving data from an IR source, buffering this data, and providing mechanisms for external modules to access this data reliably."

It is used to synchronize the operation of the module, including timing of data reads, writes, and other internal operations.\n- `reset_n`: Active low reset signal. It is used to initialize or reset the module to a known state.\n- `s_address`: Select address for determining which register is accessed for read or write operations.\n- `s_cs_n`: Chip select active low signal. When this is low, it enables the communication interface for the module to accept read and write operations.\n- `s_read`: Read enable signal. When high, it indicates that data should be read from the selected address.\n- `s_write`: Write enable signal. When high, it indicates that data should be written to the selected address.\n- `s_writedata`: Data bus for write operations. It carries the data to be written into the module at the selected address.\n- `ir`: Infrared data input. This receives the raw signals from an infrared source for processing. \n\nOutput ports:\n- `irq`: Interrupt request signal. This outputs high to indicate that new data has been received and is ready to be processed by the external controller or processor.\n- `s_readdata`: Data bus for read operations. This carries the data output from the module when a read operation is performed on a selected address.\n\nExplanation:\nThe input ports allow the module to receive timing and control signals as well as data for processing and configuration. They support interfacing with an infrared sensor and a controlling processor, determining how the data should be accessed or modified. The output ports provide notifications and data to the rest of the system, indicating when new data is ready and allowing the system to read this data."

It is set when a write operation targets the control status register (`IR_RX_CS_REG`) and the least significant bit of the write data (`s_writedata[0]`) is high. It is reset after being set or on a reset condition.\n2. `use_dw`: This signal represents the used data words in the FIFO buffer. It is an output from the `ir_fifo` submodule, indicating how many data words are currently stored in the FIFO.\n3. `writedata`: This signal carries the data from the IR receiver to be written into the FIFO buffer. It is an output from the `IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic_inst` submodule and serves as an input to the `ir_fifo` submodule.\n4. `readdata`: This represents the data read from the FIFO buffer. It is output by the `ir_fifo` submodule and is used to set the `s_readdata` output port of the module when a read operation occurs.\n5. `data_ready`: This signal indicates that new data from the IR receiver is ready to be processed. It is generated by the `IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic_inst` submodule.\n6. `pre_data_ready`: This is a delayed version of the `data_ready` signal, used to detect the rising edge of `data_ready` to trigger the `irq` and `write` signals.\n7. `read`: This signal is set high during a read operation targeted at the data register (`IR_RX_DATA_REG`). It serves as a control signal to trigger reading from the FIFO buffer.\n8. `write`: This signal controls whether new data should be written into the FIFO buffer. It is asserted for one clock cycle after detecting the rising edge of the `data_ready` signal, indicating that new data is available and should be stored in the FIFO."
