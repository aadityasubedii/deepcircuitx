    "spec": "**Module name:** TERASIC_IR_RX_FIFO. \n\n**Module specification:** The TERASIC_IR_RX_FIFO is a Verilog module designed to receive infrared (IR) signals and manage them through an internal FIFO buffer. This module captures data from an IR receiver and utilizes a FIFO to store the data, generating interrupts when the data is ready and managing data communication with a processor. \n\n**Input ports** include: \n- **s_address** (selects internal registers for read/write operations), \n- **clk** (clock signal for synchronization), \n- **reset_n** (active-low reset signal), \n- **s_cs_n** (active-low chip select), \n- **s_read** (triggers data read operations), \n- **s_writedata** (data bus for incoming write data), \n- **s_write** (activates write operations), \n- **ir** (infrared data input signal).\n\n**Output ports** include:\n- **irq** (interrupt request signal),\n- **s_readdata** (data bus that outputs the data being read).\n\n**Internal signals** utilized are:\n- **fifo_clear** (controls the clearing of the FIFO),\n- **use_dw** (indicates the number of words stored in the FIFO),\n- **writedata** (data intended to be written into the FIFO), \n- **readdata** (data retrieved from the FIFO),\n- **data_ready** (status signal indicating the availability of new data),\n- **pre_data_ready** (stores the previous value of data_ready for edge detection),\n- **write** (triggers FIFO write operations), \n- **read** (activates FIFO data read operations).\n\n**Code sections include:**\n1. **Edge Detection logic:** Updates pre_data_ready and manages interrupt signaling based on data availability.\n2. **FIFO Control logic:** Manages fifo_clear signal based on s_write and resets.\n3. **Data Read and Write control:** Manages data movement to and from FIFO via read and write signals using register address checks.\n4. **Instance of ir_fifo:** Manages the FIFO operations including data writing and reading.\n5. **Instance of IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic:** Manages IR data reception and sets status signals accordingly.\n\nThe module essentially captures, processes, and manages the flow of data from an infrared source, interfacing efficiently with system processors by utilizing interrupts and providing controlled read and write access through its dedicated FIFO system.",

It interfaces with an IR data receiver and facilitates data communication with a system processor. The module is responsible for capturing data from an IR receiver, storing it in FIFO, generating interrupts when data is ready, and allowing the processor to read from or write to specific registers (Data and Control/Status Registers). The module uses signals to manage FIFO operations (clear and data writing), handles read/write requests from the processor, and ensures that data is ready before it is processed or retrieved. The design includes mechanisms to reset FIFO state and generate interrupts based on the data readiness, enhancing communication efficiency and reliability in a system."

This input determines when the module should respond to read or write commands from the processor.\n- s_read: Read signal that triggers the module to perform data read operations from the selected register when asserted (high).\n- s_write: Write signal that triggers the module to write data to the selected register when asserted (high).\n- s_writedata: Data bus for write operations. It carries the data that needs to be written into the module's registers.\n- ir: Infrared input signal received from an external IR receiver which represents the captured data.\n\nOutput ports: [irq, s_readdata]. \nExplanation:\n- irq: Interrupt request output.

It is set when a write operation to the control/status register requests a FIFO clear and is reset in the subsequent cycles to manage FIFO state.\n- use_dw: This signal holds the value representing the number of data words currently stored in the FIFO.

It passes the FIFO data out to be sent to the processor through the s_readdata output port.\n- data_ready: A status signal from the IRDA receiver indicating that new data has arrived and is ready to be processed or stored.\n- pre_data_ready: This signal is used to store the previous state of the data_ready signal. It helps in edge detection to determine the change in the data_ready status from 'not ready' to 'ready.'\n- write: Controlled by the edge detection logic using pre_data_ready and data_ready, this signal triggers the writing of data to the FIFO whenever new data is signaled as ready.\n- read: This signal is controlled based on processor read requests specifically targeting the data register.
