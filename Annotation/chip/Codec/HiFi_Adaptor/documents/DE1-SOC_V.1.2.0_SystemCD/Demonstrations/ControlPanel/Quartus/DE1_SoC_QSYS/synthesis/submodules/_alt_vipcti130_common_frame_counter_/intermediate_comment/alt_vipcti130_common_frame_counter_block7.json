    "block_comment": "This Verilog block conditionally adjusts horizontal and vertical total values based on the `TOTALS_MINUS_ONE` flag. If `TOTALS_MINUS_ONE` is set to true, it directly assigns `h_total_int` and `v_total_int` with `h_total` and `v_total` respectively. If false, it subtracts 1 from both `h_total` and `v_total` before the assignment, specifically using 14-bit and 13-bit subtraction for `h_total` and `v_total`, respectively."
