Module-level comment: The `alt_vipitc131_common_sample_counter` module counts data samples in video/image processing based on color planes. It inputs reset, clock, clear signals, a counter trigger, and a mode selector, outputting sample counts, start flags, and tick counts. Supports both single and multi-plane configurations, dynamically adjusting counters and output through combinational and sequential logic blocks within conditional constructs based on the number of color planes.
