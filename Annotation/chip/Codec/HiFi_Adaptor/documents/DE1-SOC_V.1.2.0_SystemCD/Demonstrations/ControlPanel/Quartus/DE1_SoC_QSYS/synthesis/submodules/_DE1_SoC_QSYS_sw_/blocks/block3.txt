Comment: 
This block handles edge detection and capture for a specific signal line (line 9). It operates asynchronously with respect to system reset and synchronously on clock events. Upon a negative reset, the edge capture register for line 9 is cleared to 0. If the clock is enabled and the edge capture write strobe is active, it also clears the edge capture register. Conversely, if an edge is detected on line 9, the register is set to a high value (-1 in Verilog represents a bit-wise inversion of 0, which means all bits set to 1).
