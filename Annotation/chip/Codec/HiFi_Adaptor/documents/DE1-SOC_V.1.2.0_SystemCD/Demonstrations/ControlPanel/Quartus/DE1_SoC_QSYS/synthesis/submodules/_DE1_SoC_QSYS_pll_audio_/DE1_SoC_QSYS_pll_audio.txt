Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll_audio module configures an Altera PLL for audio applications, generating a precise 18.432 MHz clock from a reference clock (`refclk`). It uses a reset signal (`rst`) for reinitialization. The module outputs the PLL-generated clock (`outclk_0`) and a lock status (`locked`). Only essential PLL parameters are set, focusing on delivering a single reliable output for audio processing needs.
