Module name: hps_sdram_p0_reset. 
Module specification: The `hps_sdram_p0_reset` module is designed for generating synchronized reset signals across various clock domains within an SDRAM system interfaced with an FPGA or SoC. It handles incoming reset and clock signals, as well as a clock lock signal from a PLL, to create stable reset outputs for different system components including memory controllers and data capture logic. The module receives inputs such as `seq_reset_mem_stable`, multiple clock signals (`pll_afi_clk`, `pll_addr_cmd_clk`, etc.), `pll_locked`, `global_reset_n`, and `soft_reset_n`. It outputs reset signals like `reset_n_scc_clk`, `reset_n_avl_clk`, and arrays of reset signals for AFI clock domains and read capture operations. Internal signals include `phy_reset_n` and `phy_reset_mem_stable_n` for primary reset generation and synchronization with memory stability. The module incorporates several instances of `hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync` blocks, each configured for different reset synchronization tasks associated with specific clock domains. These blocks are parameterized for different numbers of reset output stages and are used to ensure reliable operation by aligning the reset signals with the respective clock domains. The module utilizes generate statements to handle multiple instances dynamically based on the `MEM_READ_DQS_WIDTH` parameter, specifically for read capture functionalities.
