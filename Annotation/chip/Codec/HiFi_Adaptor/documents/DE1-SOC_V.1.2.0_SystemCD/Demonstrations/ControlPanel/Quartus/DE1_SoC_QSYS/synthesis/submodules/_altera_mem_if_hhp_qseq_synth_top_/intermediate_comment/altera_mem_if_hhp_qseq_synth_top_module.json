    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"altera_mem_if_hhp_qseq_synth_top\" module is designed for synthesizing configurable high-performance memory interfaces, tailored for Altera solutions. It uses parameterization to define key attributes such as data and address widths for APB and Avalon interfaces, along with memory-specific signal widths (DQS, DQ, DM, CS), facilitating flexible memory system design without predefined IO ports or internal signals in the provided code snippet."
