    "block_comment": "This Verilog block implements an edge capture mechanism for a specific bit in a register array. The block works by monitoring changes at clock edges or reset conditions. On a negative reset, the `edge_capture[8]` is cleared to 0. When the clock is enabled (`clk_en`), `edge_capture[8]` is conditionally reset if a write strobe (`edge_capture_wr_strobe`) is active; otherwise, if an edge detection for `edge_capture[8]` occurs (`edge_detect[8]`), it sets `edge_capture[8]` to -1, effectively signaling a detected edge event."
