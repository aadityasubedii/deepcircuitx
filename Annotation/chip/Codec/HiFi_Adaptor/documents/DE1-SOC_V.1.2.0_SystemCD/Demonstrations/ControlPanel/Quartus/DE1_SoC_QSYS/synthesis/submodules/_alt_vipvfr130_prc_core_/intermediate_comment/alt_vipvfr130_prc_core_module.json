    "module": "Module-level comment: The alt_vipvfr130_prc_core manages burst-based data read operations for structured packets using a state machine with IDLE, WAITING, RUNNING, and ENDING states. It synchronizes input data through shift registers, issues read commands, and maintains data integrity. Inputs control operation modes and data flow, while outputs signal operation status and data transfer completeness, ensuring effective packet handling and data processing."
