Module-level comment: The AUDIO_ADC module captures audio data from an ADC, handling serial input for left and right channels synchronized with a bit clock (bclk). Internally, it uses registers and a FIFO, controlling data acquisition and buffering via bit-indexing and synchronization flags. It ensures proper channel separation and overflow protection, facilitating the efficient management of audio data for further processing.
