Module-level comment: The CLOCK_COUNTER is a Verilog module designed to count clock cycles. It uses inputs 'aclr' for asynchronous reset, 'clk_en' for enabling counting, and 'clock' for the timing signal. The 32-bit output 'q' represents the count. The internal logic for counting and processing is implied but not detailed in the provided code snippet, requiring further implementation for practical use.
