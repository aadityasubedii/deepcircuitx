    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipvfr130_vfr_controller.\nModule specification: The alt_vipvfr130_vfr_controller is a Verilog module designed to manage video frame reading operations. It handles data flow between a master interface and video processing hardware, specifically managing video packets settings in two banks. Input ports include `clock` (system clock signal), `reset` (resets module's state to IDLE state), `master_interrupt_receive` (signal from the master for end-of-frame processing), `go_bit` (starts video frame processing), `next_bank` (selects control settings bank), `ctrl_packet_width_bankX`, `ctrl_packet_height_bankX`, `ctrl_packet_interlaced_bankX` (control settings for width, height, and interlacing for video packets in bank X), and `vid_packet_base_address_bankX`, `vid_packet_samples_bankX`, `vid_packet_words_bankX` (video data configurations in bank X). Output ports include `master_address`, `master_write`, `master_writedata` (master interface for data writing), `running` (indicates active processing), `frame_complete` (signals completion of video frame processing), and outputs for the width, height, and interlaced status of the next video packet to be processed. Internal signals consist of a `state` register representing the current state of the FSM, and `bank_to_read`, which selects video packet configurations based on the input from `next_bank`. The code implements various FSM states like IDLE, SENDING_ADDRESS, SENDING_SAMPLES, SENDING_WORDS, SENDING_TYPE, SENDING_GO_AND_ENABLE_INTERRUPT, and WAITING_END_FRAME to coordinate the initialization, data transport, and completion signaling in video frame processing.",

It manages the flow of data related to video packets between an unspecified master interface and video data handling hardware. The module interacts with external inputs such as control signals and settings for video packets in two designated banks (0 and 1), using these settings to determine the address and size of video data to process. The module operates in several state-machine stages such as IDLE, SENDING_ADDRESS, SENDING_SAMPLES, SENDING_WORDS, SENDING_TYPE, SENDING_GO_AND_ENABLE_INTERRUPT, and WAITING_END_FRAME. It handles transitioning between these states based on input signals and internal conditions, progressing through stages of setting up video packet transactions and handling interrupts that represent the completion of frames. The module supports functionality like initiating video packet transactions based on input go signals and switching between banks of video data. It also features resetting to an IDLE state upon receiving a reset signal, signifying its readiness for subsequent operations."

It moves through various states (IDLE, SENDING_ADDRESS, SENDING_SAMPLES, SENDING_WORDS, SENDING_TYPE, SENDING_GO_AND_ENABLE_INTERRUPT, WAITING_END_FRAME) to manage the process cycle of video frame reading and processing based on the provided inputs and internal logic.\n- `bank_to_read`: A binary signal used to select which bank's video packet configuration (bank 0 or bank 1) will be used for the ongoing or next video processing cycle. It is updated based upon the `next_bank` input each time the module transitions out of the IDLE state when initiated by the `go_bit`. This selection directly affects values like video packet addresses, samples, and other pertinent parameters necessary for configuring video data handling."

It handles data flow between a master interface and video processing hardware, specifically managing video packets settings in two banks. Input ports include `clock` (system clock signal), `reset` (resets module's state to IDLE state), `master_interrupt_receive` (signal from the master for end-of-frame processing), `go_bit` (starts video frame processing), `next_bank` (selects control settings bank), `ctrl_packet_width_bankX`, `ctrl_packet_height_bankX`, `ctrl_packet_interlaced_bankX` (control settings for width, height, and interlacing for video packets in bank X), and `vid_packet_base_address_bankX`, `vid_packet_samples_bankX`, `vid_packet_words_bankX` (video data configurations in bank X). Output ports include `master_address`, `master_write`, `master_writedata` (master interface for data writing), `running` (indicates active processing), `frame_complete` (signals completion of video frame processing), and outputs for the width, height, and interlaced status of the next video packet to be processed. Internal signals consist of a `state` register representing the current state of the FSM, and `bank_to_read`, which selects video packet configurations based on the input from `next_bank`. The code implements various FSM states like IDLE, SENDING_ADDRESS, SENDING_SAMPLES, SENDING_WORDS, SENDING_TYPE, SENDING_GO_AND_ENABLE_INTERRUPT, and WAITING_END_FRAME to coordinate the initialization, data transport, and completion signaling in video frame processing."
