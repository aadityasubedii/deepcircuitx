    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog RTL code is responsible for assigning the variable ready_out with the value from the dout_ready variable. The \"assign\" keyword in Verilog is used for continuous assignment declarations, which means the value for ready_out will be dynamically updated according to the changes in dout_ready. Thus, the main function of this line is to actively link the ready_out signal to the data output readiness signal, dout_ready."
