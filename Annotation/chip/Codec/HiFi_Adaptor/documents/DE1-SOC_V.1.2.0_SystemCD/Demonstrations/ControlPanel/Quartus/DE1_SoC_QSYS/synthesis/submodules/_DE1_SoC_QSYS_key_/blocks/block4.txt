Comment: 
This block manages the edge capture process for a specific signal line indexed [2]. On a negative reset, it clears the edge capture register to 0. Under normal conditions, if the clock is enabled and write strobe is active, it resets the capture register. If an edge is detected without a write strobe, it sets the capture register to the maximum negative value to denote an edge event.
