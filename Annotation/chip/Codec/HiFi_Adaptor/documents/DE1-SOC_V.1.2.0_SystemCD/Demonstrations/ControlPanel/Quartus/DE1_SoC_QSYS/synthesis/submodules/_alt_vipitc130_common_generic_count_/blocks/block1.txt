This block is a counter with reset and restart functionality. On a negative edge of reset or a positive edge of the clock, the counter either resets to a predefined value when a reset signal is active, or conditionally increments if enabled until a maximum count is reached, after which it rolls over to zero; it can also be restarted to a different predefined value when the restart signal is active.
