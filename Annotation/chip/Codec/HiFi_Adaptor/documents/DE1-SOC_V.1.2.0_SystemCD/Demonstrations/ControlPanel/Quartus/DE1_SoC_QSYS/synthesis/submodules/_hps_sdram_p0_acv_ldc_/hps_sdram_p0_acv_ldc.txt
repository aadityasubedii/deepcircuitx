Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc` module manages SDRAM clocking on HPS platforms by regulating multiple PLL inputs (`pll_hr_clk`, `pll_dq_clk`, `pll_dqs_clk`) and configurable delays (`dll_phy_delayctrl`). It adapts clock behavior using parameters `IS_HHP_HPS` and `ADC_INVERT_PHASE` to either assign directly or generate clocks through buffers and selective chains, producing outputs (`afi_clk`, `avl_clk`, `adc_clk`, `adc_clk_cps`, `hr_clk`) for optimal SDRAM synchronization and performance.
