    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for managing the count of valid data entries depending on different signal conditions in a synchronous system. Initially, on system reset (`rst` edge), it sets `count_valids` to zero. If not in reset, the block checks if `sclr` (synchronous clear) is active; if true, it resets the `count_valids` to zero but retains `count_cycle` in the least significant bit. If `sclr` is not active, it increments `count_valids` only if both `count_cycle` and `new_sample` are true, otherwise, it retains the current value of `count_valids`. This setup enables conditional count management based on system signals, supporting efficient tracking of valid data entries in varying operational states."
