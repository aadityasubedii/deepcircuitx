    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_key. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_key module is designed for detecting and processing edge-triggered signals from physical key presses in FPGA systems, specifically intervening in interrupt signal generation. This is done through synchronous clocked logic to interface effectively with external key inputs and internal system registers. The input ports include address, chipselect, clk, in_port, reset_n, write_n, and writedata. 'address' selects internal registers; 'chipselect' enables module operation; 'clk' is the synchronization clock; 'in_port' registers button states; 'reset_n' is the asynchronous reset; 'write_n' enables write operations; 'writedata' holds data to be written into the registers. The outputs are 'irq', the interrupt request signal, and 'readdata', the output data from internal registers based on the address input. Internal signals such as clk_en (clock enable), d1_data_in and d2_data_in (delay elements for edge detection), data_in (direct key inputs), edge_capture (registers capturing edge events), edge_capture_wr_strobe (write strobe for edge captures), edge_detect (computed edge detection), irq_mask (interrupt activation mask), and read_mux_out (data multiplexer for output), facilitate the module\u2019s operation. The code includes initialization blocks under reset conditions, data capturing on the clock's rising edge with clock enable, conditional processing of input key states to determine rising or falling edges, and the managing of interrupt masks and captured edge data. Edge detection is computed via XOR between consecutive delayed values of input signals, ensuring accurate edge capture and interrupt triggering based on the setup irq_mask.",

It interfaces with an external key input (in_port) and generates an interrupt (irq) signal when a key press event (edge) is detected, considering the mask settings (irq_mask). The module provides features such as edge capture for different keys, which are reset when instructed through specific addresses. It handles asynchronous resets, clock enablement for synchronous processing, and supports reads from and writes to the internal registers based on address mapping.

This input is used to detect changes and trigger corresponding actions.\n- **reset_n**: Asynchronous reset signal that initializes all registers and state machines to a defined state when set to low.\n- **write_n**: When this signal is low, it indicates write operations are enabled, allowing data on the writedata input to be written to specific registers within the module.\n- **writedata**: Data bus for write operations, holding the data to be written into the registers when a write operation is initiated.\n\nOutput ports: [irq, readdata].\nExplanation:\n- **irq**: Interrupt request output.

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_key module is designed for detecting and processing edge-triggered signals from physical key presses in FPGA systems, specifically intervening in interrupt signal generation. This is done through synchronous clocked logic to interface effectively with external key inputs and internal system registers. The input ports include address, chipselect, clk, in_port, reset_n, write_n, and writedata. 'address' selects internal registers; 'chipselect' enables module operation; 'clk' is the synchronization clock; 'in_port' registers button states; 'reset_n' is the asynchronous reset; 'write_n' enables write operations; 'writedata' holds data to be written into the registers. The outputs are 'irq', the interrupt request signal, and 'readdata', the output data from internal registers based on the address input. Internal signals such as clk_en (clock enable), d1_data_in and d2_data_in (delay elements for edge detection), data_in (direct key inputs), edge_capture (registers capturing edge events), edge_capture_wr_strobe (write strobe for edge captures), edge_detect (computed edge detection), irq_mask (interrupt activation mask), and read_mux_out (data multiplexer for output), facilitate the module\u2019s operation. The code includes initialization blocks under reset conditions, data capturing on the clock's rising edge with clock enable, conditional processing of input key states to determine rising or falling edges, and the managing of interrupt masks and captured edge data. Edge detection is computed via XOR between consecutive delayed values of input signals, ensuring accurate edge capture and interrupt triggering based on the setup irq_mask."
