Comment: 
This block of code designates that the wire 'dout_endofpacket' takes the value of 'eop_out'. It's a simple assignment operation in Verilog, and is used here to map the end-of-packet indicator from 'eop_out' to 'dout_endofpacket'. The 'assign' keyword indicates a continuous assignment statement, which means the assignment is active as long as the code is running. Thus, whenever 'eop_out' changes its value, 'dout_endofpacket' will immediately reflect that change.
