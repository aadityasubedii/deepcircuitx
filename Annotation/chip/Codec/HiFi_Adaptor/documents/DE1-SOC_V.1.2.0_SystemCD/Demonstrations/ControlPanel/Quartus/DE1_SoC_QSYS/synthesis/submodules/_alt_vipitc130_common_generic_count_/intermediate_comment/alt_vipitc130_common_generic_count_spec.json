    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipitc130_common_generic_count. Module specification: The alt_vipitc130_common_generic_count is a Verilog module primarily designed as a configurable counter with enhanced control capabilities. The module's essential functionality includes counting clock cycles or ticks, influenced by multiple input signals and parameters. It captures inputs such as `clk` (clock signal), `reset_n` (active-low reset signal), `enable` (enables counting), `enable_ticks` (controls tick-based counting), `max_count` (the upper limit for the counter), `restart_count` (signal to restart the counting), and `reset_value` (value for resetting the counter). The outputs include `count` (the current counter value), `enable_count` (indicates if counting is active), `start_count` (signals the beginning of a counting process), and `cp_ticks` (current tick status). Internally, the module utilizes a register `ticks` to track the number of tick cycles since the last increment, crucial for controlling when the counter increments, governed by the `TICKS_PER_COUNT` parameter. The code utilizes condition-based logic encapsulated within a `generate` block to manage differing behaviors when TICKS_PER_COUNT is set to 1 versus other values, affecting outputs like `enable_count`, `start_count`, and `cp_ticks`. The main counter logic handled outside the `generate` block adjusts the `count` based on the combination of enable signals, reset conditions, and whether the count has reached its maximum value. This module provides a robust framework for various counting and timing functions in digital systems, where precise control and flexible configuration are required.",

It enables counting based on clock cycles, but with additional control mechanisms like enabling, restarting the count, and managing count ticks based on the parameters provided. The counter can be set to increment each clock cycle, or according to a specified number of ticks which is controlled by tick-related parameters. The outputs from the module include the current count, a signal indicating when counting is enabled, and a signal to indicate the start of a count, along with ticks per count configuration. Further, the module features an ability to reset the count to a given reset value under specific conditions such as upon a restart signal. This makes the module versatile for use in systems needing a configurable and controllable counting mechanism."
