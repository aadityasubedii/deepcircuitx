    "spec": "Module name: ir_fifo. Module specification: The \"ir_fifo\" module is designed as a dual-clock FIFO buffer that facilitates data management between processes running at different clock frequencies, primarily using a \"dcfifo_component\" tailored for the Cyclone V device family. It incorporates input ports like 'aclr' (asynchronous clear), 'data' (32-bit input bus), 'rdclk' (read clock), 'rdreq' (read request), 'wrclk' (write clock), and 'wrreq' (write request); each port serves distinct functions like resetting the FIFO, providing data for storage, and controlling read-write operations based on clock signals. The output ports include 'q' (32-bit data output), 'rdempty' (indicates FIFO emptiness), 'rdusedw' (a 5-bit output showing the count of used words in FIFO), and 'wrfull' (indicates FIFO fullness). Internally, the module uses signals such as 'sub_wire0' to 'sub_wire3' to interface between the dcfifo component and the external ports, carrying status and data across the module. The primary block of the code, the 'dcfifo_component', handles data synchronization and queuing, controlled through various parameters like FIFO depth and data width, ensuring overflow and underflow checks are in place to maintain the integrity of data transactions. Additionally, settings related to asynchronous clear and synchronization delay pipelines are configured to align with system requirements and device specifications.",
