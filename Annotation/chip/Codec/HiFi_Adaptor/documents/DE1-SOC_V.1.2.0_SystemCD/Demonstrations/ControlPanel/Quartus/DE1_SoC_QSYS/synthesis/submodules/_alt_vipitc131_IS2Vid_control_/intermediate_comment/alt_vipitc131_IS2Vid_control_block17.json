    "block_comment": "This code block controls the wait request signal for a bus interface during write operations. It assigns the `av_waitrequest` signal to be active (logic high) when there is a write operation (`av_write`) and neither an acknowledgment (`av_write_ack`) nor side register actions (`is_side_registers`) are occurring. This effectively prevents bus transaction completions when writes are unacknowledged or when specific register operations are in progress, ensuring data consistency and flow control."
