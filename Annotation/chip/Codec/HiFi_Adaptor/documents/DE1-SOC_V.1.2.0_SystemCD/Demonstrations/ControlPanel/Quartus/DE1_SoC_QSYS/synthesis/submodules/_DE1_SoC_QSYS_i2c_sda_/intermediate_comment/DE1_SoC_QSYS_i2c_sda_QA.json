It manages both read and write operations over a bi-directional port. The module operates depending on input control signals such as `chipselect`, `write_n`, and `address`. Specifically, the `data_dir` register determines the direction of the data flow (input or output on the bi-directional port `bidir_port`). When writing, the `data_out` register holds the data to be transmitted if `address` is 0, while `data_dir` is set based on `writedata` when `address` is 1. For reading, the output `readdata` captures either `data_in` or `data_dir` based on the `address`. The functionality is clocked on the rising edge of `clk` and is reset using the active-low `reset_n` signal."
