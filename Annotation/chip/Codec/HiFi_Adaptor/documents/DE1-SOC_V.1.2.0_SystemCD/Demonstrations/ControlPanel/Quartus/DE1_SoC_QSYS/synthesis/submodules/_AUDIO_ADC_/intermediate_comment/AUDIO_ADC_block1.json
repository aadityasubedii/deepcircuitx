    "block_comment": "This block defines an audio FIFO buffer for handling audio data between different clock domains. It is instantiated from the `audio_fifo` module and operates with two separate clocks: `bclk` for write operations and `clk` for read operations. Write operations are enabled by `adcfifo_write`, and data is input via `adcfifo_writedata`. The FIFO buffer signals when it is full using `adcfifo_full`. The read operation is controlled by `read` and outputs data on `readdata`, with `empty` indicating the empty status. Reset is accomplished through `clear`."
