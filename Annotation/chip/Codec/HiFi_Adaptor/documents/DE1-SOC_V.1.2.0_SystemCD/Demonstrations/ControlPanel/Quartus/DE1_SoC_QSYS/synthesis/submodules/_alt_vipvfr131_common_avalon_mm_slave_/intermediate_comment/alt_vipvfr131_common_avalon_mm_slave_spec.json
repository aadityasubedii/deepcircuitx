    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipvfr131_common_avalon_mm_slave.\nModule specification: The alt_vipvfr131_common_avalon_mm_slave is a Verilog module designed as a configurable Avalon memory-mapped (MM) slave interface, suitable for FPGA designs that need to manage internal registers and handle interrupts. The module is parameterized to adjust to various configurations including data and address widths, and the number of outputs, interrupts, and registers. It features input ports such as `rst` (reset), `clk` (clock), and `av_address`, `av_read`, `av_write` (Avalon bus signals), along with `av_writedata` for incoming data, `clear_enable` for disabling certain functionalities, `registers_in` and `registers_write` signals for external control of internal registers, `interrupts`, and `stopped` to monitor stop conditions. Outputs include `av_readdata` for sending read response data, `av_irq` for interrupt requests, `enable` generally reflecting module enable state, `triggers` for marking register updates, and `registers` for exposing internal register states externally. Internal signals like `global_stopped`, `clear_interrupts`, `triggers_nxt`, `internal_registers`, `interrupt_register`, and `interrupt_enables` control operations like global stop conditions, interrupts clearing and registering, and toggling of triggers upon register modifications. The module code includes sections for handling resets and setting initial states, responding to Avalon interface operations, managing interrupts, and updating or accessing internal registers based on real-time transactions. This comprehensive integration allows the module to efficiently handle data operations and signal processing synchronized to the input clock with robust reset capabilities.",

The module is parameterized to adjust to various configurations including data and address widths, and the number of outputs, interrupts, and registers. It features input ports such as `rst` (reset), `clk` (clock), and `av_address`, `av_read`, `av_write` (Avalon bus signals), along with `av_writedata` for incoming data, `clear_enable` for disabling certain functionalities, `registers_in` and `registers_write` signals for external control of internal registers, `interrupts`, and `stopped` to monitor stop conditions. Outputs include `av_readdata` for sending read response data, `av_irq` for interrupt requests, `enable` generally reflecting module enable state, `triggers` for marking register updates, and `registers` for exposing internal register states externally. Internal signals like `global_stopped`, `clear_interrupts`, `triggers_nxt`, `internal_registers`, `interrupt_register`, and `interrupt_enables` control operations like global stop conditions, interrupts clearing and registering, and toggling of triggers upon register modifications. The module code includes sections for handling resets and setting initial states, responding to Avalon interface operations, managing interrupts, and updating or accessing internal registers based on real-time transactions. This comprehensive integration allows the module to efficiently handle data operations and signal processing synchronized to the input clock with robust reset capabilities."
