    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of the internal register `write_trigger_ack_reg` to the output signal `write_trigger_ack`. By using the `assign` statement, the block establishes a continuous assignment, ensuring that any change in the `write_trigger_ack_reg` is immediately reflected on the `write_trigger_ack` output, facilitating real-time signaling or acknowledgement in response to write triggers. This direct mapping simplifies tracking and updating the status of write operations."
