Module-level comment: The `alt_vipitc131_IS2Vid_sync_compare` module synchronizes video frame starts between input and output interfaces by comparing SOF events. Using internal counters and state machines, it dynamically adjusts sync settings based on edge detections and lock statuses of SOF signals. It manages synchronization states, resets, and genlock conditions, facilitating minimal frame discrepancies. The module integrates a frame counter submodule for precise tracking, emphasizing synchronization reliability in video processing applications.
