Module-level comment: The `CLOCK_COUNTER` module implements an upward counter using the `lpm_counter` component. It utilizes input signals `aclr` for asynchronous reset, `clk_en` for enabling the counter, and `clock` for the main timing signal. The counter's 32-bit output, `q`, is driven by internal wire `sub_wire0`, directly mapping the `lpm_counter`'s output. The module is configured to count up on the rising edge of the clock, provided the enable signal is active and reset is not asserted.
