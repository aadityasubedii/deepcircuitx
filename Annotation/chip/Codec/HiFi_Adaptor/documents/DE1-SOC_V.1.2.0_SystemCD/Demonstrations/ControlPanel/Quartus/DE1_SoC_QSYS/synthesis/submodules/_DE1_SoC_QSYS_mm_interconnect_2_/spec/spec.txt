Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_mm_interconnect_2. Module specification: This module implements a memory-mapped interconnect fabric for a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, facilitating communication between various components. It has input ports for clock and reset signals, address and control signals from the clock crossing IO slow master, and read data from slave components. Output ports include control signals for the master and various slave components. Internal signals handle bus transactions, addressing, and data routing between master and slave interfaces. The module consists of several key components: address routers, command and response demultiplexers, arbiters, and pipeline stages. These components work together to manage address decoding, data routing, and arbitration between multiple master and slave interfaces. The interconnect supports data transfers between different clock domains and handles bus protocols for efficient system integration. The module uses a variety of internal signals to manage communication between different blocks
