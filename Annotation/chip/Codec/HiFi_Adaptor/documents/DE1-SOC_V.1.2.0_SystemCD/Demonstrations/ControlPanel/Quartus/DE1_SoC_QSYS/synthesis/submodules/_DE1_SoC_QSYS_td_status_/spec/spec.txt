Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_td_status. 

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_td_status module handles data output based on input conditions suitable for FPGA-based designs. It reads a 2-bit input from `in_port` and a 2-bit `address` to selectively output a 32-bit value `readdata`. The module uses the following input ports: `address` which selects output data mode based on its value; `clk`, a clock signal for timing synchronization; `in_port`, the primary data input; and `reset_n`, an active-low reset signal that resets `readdata` to zero when active. The sole output port, `readdata`, outputs either zero or a zero-extended version of `in_port` based on the `address` input. Internally, the module employs `clk_en`, a constant enabled clock signal; `data_in`, a direct assignment from `in_port` for potential additional processing; and `read_mux_out`, which gates the output between zero or `data_in` based upon the `address`. The Verilog implementation features an always block that resets `readdata` on a negative reset and updates `readdata` based on the `clk_en` and `address` conditions. The signal manipulations and decision logic are efficiently encapsulated within wire assignments and conditional statements to ensure clear and responsive output behavior.
