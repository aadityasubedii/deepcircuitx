This Verilog code block defines a synchronous reset for multiple signal registers in a digital system. At every positive edge of the clock signal (`posedge clk`), it resets the registers `genlock_enable`, `sof_sample`, `sof_subsample`, `sof_line`, and `refclk_divider_value` to their default values. The `genlock_enable` is set to zero, effectively disabling it, while the sample, subsample, line, and divider values are reinitialized to zero. This setup ensures that each cycle starts with a clean state, which is crucial for timing and synchronization purposes in digital circuit operations.
