    "block_comment": "This block of code generates the `cp_ticks` signal which is a masked version of the `ticks` signal based on the `enable_ticks` control signal. The masking is achieved by ANDing `ticks` with a replicated version of `enable_ticks` across the entire width defined by `TICKS_WORD_LENGTH`."
