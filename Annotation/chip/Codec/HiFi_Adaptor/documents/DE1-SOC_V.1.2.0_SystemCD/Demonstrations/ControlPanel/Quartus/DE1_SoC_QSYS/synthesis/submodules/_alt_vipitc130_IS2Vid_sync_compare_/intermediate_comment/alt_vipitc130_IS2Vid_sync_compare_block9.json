    "block_comment": "This block generates a clear signal (sclr_state) based on the synchronization of two input signals. The implementation uses a logical AND operation between the start-of-frame signals for input (sof_cvi_int) and output (sof_cvo_int) video interfaces, assigning the result to sclr_state. This logic likely serves to identify when both input and output frames are aligned, potentially triggering a reset or synchronization event in the larger system."
