The module takes two input ports: `refclk`, the reference clock whose frequency serves as the baseline for generating the output clocks, and `rst`, which resets the PLL to a known state when activated. It provides five output clocks (`outclk_0` to `outclk_4`), each with configurable frequency, phase shift, and duty cycle, alongside an additional output `locked` that indicates the PLL's locking status. Internally, the module lacks user-defined signals, as it directly maps input signals to output through the `altera_pll` instantiation, which handles all configuration internally.

It has one input reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset signal (`rst`). It produces five different output clocks (`outclk_0` to `outclk_4`) each with specific frequencies, duty cycles, and phase shifts as configured. There's also an output signal (`locked`) which indicates whether the PLL has successfully synchronized to the input clock. The `altera_pll` instantiation configures various parameters like the number of clocks, frequency, phase, and duty cycle for each output clock using a predefined IP core tailored for general purposes. This configuration is crucial for applications requiring multiple clocks with precise timings and relationships, typical in digital circuits and systems for synchronization and timing control purposes."

The entire functionality of the PLL, which includes generating multiple synchronized output clocks, depends on this clock. It serves as the baseline frequency from which the output frequencies are derived.\n- `rst`: This is the reset input, which is used to reset the PLL.

Each clock output can be configured to have a specific frequency, phase shift, and duty cycle relative to the reference clock. These outputs provide the necessary clock signals for various components or systems that require synchronized clock inputs with specific timing requirements.\n- `locked`: This output indicates the locking status of the PLL.
