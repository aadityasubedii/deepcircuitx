Module name: alt_vipitc130_common_sync_generation.
Module specification: The `alt_vipitc130_common_sync_generation` module is designed to generate synchronization signals including the Start of Frame (SOF) and a division signal for timing control within video processing applications. It handles inputs like reset (`rst`), clock (`clk`), various control signals like `clear_enable`, `enable_count`, vertical synchronization start (`start_of_vsync`), interlacing indicators (`interlaced`), and several sample and line count variables. The outputs of the module are the SOF signal (`sof`), a SOF locked signal (`sof_locked`) indicating stability, and a division signal (`div`). Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `enable_next` and `start_of_vsync_f0` for conditional logic, `count` and `count_div` for controlling counters, and `sof_next` to determine the SOF signal state. The code integrates two instances of a submodule `alt_vipitc130_common_frame_counter` for managing frame dimensions and timing, which uses internal counters to provide `h_count` and `v_count` values important for the SOF generation and division logic. Parameters and flag signals manage enabling conditions and the reset state. This module is crucial in ensuring synchronization accuracy in video processes, adapting to different video standards and input conditions, thus maintaining the frame alignment throughout the video processing pipeline.
