    "block_comment": "This block of code generates an output signal, `dout_valid`, which indicates the validity of data output. The signal is derived by performing a bitwise AND operation between `int_valid_reg` and `int_ready_reg`. This implementation ensures that `dout_valid` is asserted only when both the internal validity and readiness conditions are met, facilitating controlled data flow or handshake mechanisms in digital systems."
