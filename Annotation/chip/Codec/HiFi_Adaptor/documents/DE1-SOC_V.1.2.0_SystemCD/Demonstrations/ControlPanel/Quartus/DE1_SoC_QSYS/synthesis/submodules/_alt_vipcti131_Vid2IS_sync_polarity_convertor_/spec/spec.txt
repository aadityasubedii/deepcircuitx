Module name: alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_sync_polarity_convertor. 
Module specification: The alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_sync_polarity_convertor is a digital logic Verilog module that handles the dynamic inversion of a synchronization signal based on the input conditions. The module reads a synchronization input (`sync_in`) and a data validity flag (`datavalid`), converting the polarity of `sync_in` by potentially inverting it to produce an output signal (`sync_out`). This inversion is controlled by the internal logic that monitors the negative edge transitions of `datavalid`. The input ports include `rst` (reset), `clk` (clock), `sync_in` (synchronization input), and `datavalid` (data validity indicator). Output includes `sync_out` (resulting synchronization output). Internally, the module uses several signals: `datavalid_negedge` to detect negative edges of `datavalid`, `datavalid_reg` to hold the previous state of `datavalid`, `needs_invert_nxt` and `needs_invert` to decide on the necessity of inversion in subsequent cycles, and `invert_sync_nxt` and `invert_sync` to control the inversion of `sync_in`. The Verilog code integrates sequential logic in an always block triggered on positive edges of `rst` or `clk` to manage state updates, and combinational logic outside this block to handle signal assignments and output computation. This setup ensures that the inversion decision updates and applies stably, driven by clock cycles and reset conditions.
