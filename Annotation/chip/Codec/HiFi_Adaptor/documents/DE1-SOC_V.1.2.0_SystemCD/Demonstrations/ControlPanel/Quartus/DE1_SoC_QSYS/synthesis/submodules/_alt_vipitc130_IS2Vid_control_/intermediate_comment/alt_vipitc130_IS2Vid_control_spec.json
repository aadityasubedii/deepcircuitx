    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipitc130_IS2Vid_control.\nModule specification: The alt_vipitc130_IS2Vid_control is a Verilog HDL module designed to manage and configure video processing operations through dynamic settings adjustments. It operates based on input control signals like mode changes, write acknowledgements, and underflow conditions, interfacing with other hardware through read and write operations for control registers. The module supports multiple input signals including a reset (rst), clock (clk), AV write acknowledgements (av_write_ack), mode change notifications (mode_change), current mode match (mode_match), words used (usedw), underflow condition (underflow_sticky), resynchronization requests (enable_resync), genlock status (genlocked), and address and data lines for AV operations (av_address, av_readdata, av_writedata). The outputs namely include enable, clear underflow sticky notification (clear_underflow_sticky), write triggers (write_trigger), acknowledgements (write_trigger_ack), genlock enabling (genlock_enable), and AV operation waiting requests (av_waitrequest), alongside the status update interrupt (status_update_int).\n\nInternally, the module utilizes several registers and signals such as enable_reg, write_trigger_ack_reg, and genlock_enable_reg to control the operational modes and outputs based on the inputs. A special block handles the AV data reading and writing operations based on specific addresses, facilitating register configuration by external commands. There are also signal processing blocks to manage and format the data for the register outputs based on the module's current state and operations, while also handling various synchronization, interrupt, and error conditions through flags and statuses maintained within internal registers. The use of conditional compilation allows certain parts of the module to be included only if specific features are needed, enhancing modularity and configurability for different use cases. Overall, the alt_vipitc130_IS2Vid_control balances dynamic video processing management with stability and synchronization features to maintain optimal video quality and operational reliability.",

It operates based on input control signals like mode changes, write acknowledgements, and underflow conditions, interfacing with other hardware through read and write operations for control registers. The module supports multiple input signals including a reset (rst), clock (clk), AV write acknowledgements (av_write_ack), mode change notifications (mode_change), current mode match (mode_match), words used (usedw), underflow condition (underflow_sticky), resynchronization requests (enable_resync), genlock status (genlocked), and address and data lines for AV operations (av_address, av_readdata, av_writedata). The outputs namely include enable, clear underflow sticky notification (clear_underflow_sticky), write triggers (write_trigger), acknowledgements (write_trigger_ack), genlock enabling (genlock_enable), and AV operation waiting requests (av_waitrequest), alongside the status update interrupt (status_update_int).\n\nInternally, the module utilizes several registers and signals such as enable_reg, write_trigger_ack_reg, and genlock_enable_reg to control the operational modes and outputs based on the inputs. A special block handles the AV data reading and writing operations based on specific addresses, facilitating register configuration by external commands. There are also signal processing blocks to manage and format the data for the register outputs based on the module's current state and operations, while also handling various synchronization, interrupt, and error conditions through flags and statuses maintained within internal registers. The use of conditional compilation allows certain parts of the module to be included only if specific features are needed, enhancing modularity and configurability for different use cases. Overall, the alt_vipitc130_IS2Vid_control balances dynamic video processing management with stability and synchronization features to maintain optimal video quality and operational reliability."
