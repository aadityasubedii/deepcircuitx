    "module": "Module-level comment: The `alt_vipitc130_common_sync_generation` module generates synchronization signals such as SOF and a division signal for video processing. Utilizing input signals like `start_of_vsync` and `interlaced`, and harnessing internal counters managed through `alt_vipitc130_common_frame_counter` submodules, it ensures precise timing and frame alignment. Key operations are controlled by sequences of enabling signals and actual count comparisons, managed across different states of the video frames."
