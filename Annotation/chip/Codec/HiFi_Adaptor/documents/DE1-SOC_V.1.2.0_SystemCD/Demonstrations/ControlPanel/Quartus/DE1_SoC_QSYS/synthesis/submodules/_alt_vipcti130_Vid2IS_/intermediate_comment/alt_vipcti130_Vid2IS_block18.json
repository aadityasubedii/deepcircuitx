    "block_comment": "This block defines a combinational logic assignment for a signal named 'packet'. It logically ORs the two signals 'last_sample' and 'early_eop' to produce the output signal 'packet'. The operation suggests that 'packet' should be asserted when either the last sample is being processed or an early end-of-packet condition is detected. This construct allows 'packet' to quickly respond to either condition without the need for any sequential processing or additional logic gates."
