This line of code assigns the output flag 'dout_startofpacket' to the signal value of 'sop_out'. The assignment using the 'assign' keyword ensures that the value of 'sop_out' is continuously driven to 'dout_startofpacket'. This is typically used to indicate the start of a packet transmission in communication systems or protocols.
