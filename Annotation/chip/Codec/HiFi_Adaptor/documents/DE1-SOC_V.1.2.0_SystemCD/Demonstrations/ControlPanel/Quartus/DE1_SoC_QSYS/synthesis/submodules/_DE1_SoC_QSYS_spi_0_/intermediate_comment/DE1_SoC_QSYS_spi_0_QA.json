It facilitates serial data communication between the FPGA and an external SPI-enabled device. The module handles SPI protocol details like clock management (`SCLK`), master output/slave input (`MOSI`), master input/slave output (`MISO`), and slave select (`SS_n`). It supports various configurations and status checks through a set of control registers. Features include handling of standard SPI transactions, detecting end-of-packet scenarios, managing read/write operations, reporting status via interrupt (`irq`), and ensuring data integrity and availability through handshaking signals. Various internal registers are used to store and manage transmission data, status flags, and control settings to coordinate these activities effectively."

It is used to receive data from the external SPI device.\n- clk: Clock signal for synchronizing the operations within the module.\n- data_from_cpu: A 16-bit input data bus from the CPU that provides data to be written to an SPI enabled device.\n- mem_addr: A 3-bit memory address signal that specifies the register or memory block to access during read or write operations.\n- read_n: An active-low read command signal. When low, it indicates a read operation is requested.\n- reset_n: An active-low reset signal that resets the module when low.\n- spi_select: A signal used to select the SPI peripheral.
