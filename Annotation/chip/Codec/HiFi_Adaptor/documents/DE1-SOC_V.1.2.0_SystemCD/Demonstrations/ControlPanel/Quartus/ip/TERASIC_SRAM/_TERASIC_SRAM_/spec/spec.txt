Module name: TERASIC_SRAM. Module specification: The TERASIC_SRAM module serves as an interface between a generic system and an SRAM, enabling the translation of system commands and data protocols for managing read and write operations, address mapping, and control of SRAM operational signals such as chip enable (CE), output enable (OE), write enable (WE), and byte enables (UB, LB). The input ports include clk (system clock), reset_n (active low reset), s_chipselect_n (active low chip select), s_byteenable_n (byte enable for partial data access), s_write_n (active low write control), s_read_n (active low read control), s_address (memory address bus), and s_writedata (data for SRAM during write). The output ports comprise s_readdata (data read from SRAM), SRAM_CE_n (active low chip enable), SRAM_OE_n (active low output enable), SRAM_LB_n and SRAM_UB_n (active low byte enables), SRAM_WE_n (active low write enable), SRAM_ADDR (address bus for SRAM), and SRAM_DQ (bidirectional data bus). The internal signals used include SRAM_DQ (bidirectional data flow control during read/write), s_readdata (holds read data from SRAM), and other control lines like SRAM_ADDR, SRAM_WE_n, SRAM_OE_n, SRAM_CE_n, SRAM_UB_n, SRAM_LB_n which map directly to corresponding system signals, effectively managing data transactions and module operations based on system inputs. The Verilog code for the module assigns values to the SRAM control and data signals based on the state of the inputs, with conditional data flow control for SRAM_DQ during write operations and direct assignments for readdata and address mappings.
