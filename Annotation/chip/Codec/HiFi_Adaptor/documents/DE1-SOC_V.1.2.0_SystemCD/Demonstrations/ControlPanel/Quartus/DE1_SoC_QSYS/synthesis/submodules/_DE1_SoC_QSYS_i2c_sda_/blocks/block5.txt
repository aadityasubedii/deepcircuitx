Comment: 
This block handles synchronous data reading based on clock and reset signals. On a negative reset signal, it clears the `readdata` register to zero. If the reset signal is not asserted and the clock enable signal (`clk_en`) is active, it updates `readdata` with the output from `read_mux_out`, zero-extended to 32 bits.
