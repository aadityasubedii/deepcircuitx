Module-level comment: The `alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_write_buffer` module serves as a video data buffering system, accommodating multiple color planes. It operates with reset (`rst`) and clock (`clk`) synchronization, handling inputs for data writes (`wrreq_in`), conversion (`convert`), and HD mode (`hd_sdn`). Internally, it manages data across registers (`write_buffer_data`) based on validity flags (`write_buffer_valid`) and packet status (`write_buffer_packet`), supporting conditional data outputs and updates.
