Module-level comment: The 'alt_vipitc130_common_generic_count' module is a configurable counter, primarily counting clock cycles, managed by input controls like enable, reset, and tick-based counting setups. It supports dynamic counting behaviors via parameters, handling outputs based on tick thresholds and reset conditions using a combination of conditional generation and sequential logic blocks to regulate counting, reset, and output signals effectively, ensuring adaptable timing and counting operations.
