Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_i2c_sda module simulates an I2C bi-directional SDA line, managing both read and write operations. It utilizes input controls like `address` and `chipselect` to direct operations. Internal states `data_out`, `data_dir`, and `readdata` are managed by synchronous blocks triggered by `clk` and `reset_n`, with `bidir_port` acting as the interface for data exchange. The module ensures proper I2C protocol adherence with dynamic data flow directionality.
