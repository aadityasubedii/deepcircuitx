    "module": "Module-level comment: The AUDIO_IF module interfaces with audio hardware, managing data I/O for DAC and ADC via FIFOs. It synchronizes with incoming clocks and utilizes internal signals for FIFO control. Key operations include data writes to DAC and reads from ADC based on FIFO status, facilitated by sub-modules AUDIO_DAC and AUDIO_ADC configured for 32-bit data handling, ensuring efficient audio data management and synchronization."
