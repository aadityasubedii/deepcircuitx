Module name: TERASIC_IR_RX_FIFO. 
Module specification: The TERASIC_IR_RX_FIFO is designed to interface with an infrared (IR) receiver and manage data through a FIFO buffer system. It features input ports, including 'clk' for clock signal, 'reset_n' as an active-low reset, 's_address' for selecting registers, 's_cs_n' as a chip select, 's_read' and 's_write' for data read/write enable signals, 's_writedata' for inputting data on write operations, and 'ir' for receiving raw IR signals. The output includes 'irq' as an interrupt request signal and 's_readdata' providing data output on read operations. Internal signals such as 'fifo_clear' to clear the FIFO, 'use_dw' indicating used data words, 'writedata' and 'readdata' for handling written and read data respectively, 'data_ready' and 'pre_data_ready' for data processing readiness, along with 'read' and 'write' control signals, are crucial for its operation. The module comprises several key code blocks: a block for pre-data-ready treatment, IRQ handling, FIFO control management, read and write data management, and instances of 'ir_fifo' and 'IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic' to handle data buffering and reception from the IR source respectively. This systematic approach ensures efficient data handling, reading and writing capabilities within the IR communication system.
