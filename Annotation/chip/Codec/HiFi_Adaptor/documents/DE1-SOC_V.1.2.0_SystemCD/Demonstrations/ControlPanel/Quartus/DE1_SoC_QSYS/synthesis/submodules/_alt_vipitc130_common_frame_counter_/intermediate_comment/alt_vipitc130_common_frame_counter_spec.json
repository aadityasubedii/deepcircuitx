It employs a set of input and output ports crucial for its function: 'rst' resets the counters, 'clk' is the primary clock signal, 'sclr' sets counters to specific reset values, 'enable' authorizes counter increment, 'hd_sdn' manages horizontal count-related conditions, 'h_total' and 'v_total' set boundaries for resetting, and 'h_reset' and 'v_reset' define starting offsets for respective counters. The outputs include 'new_line' indicating a new line start, 'start_of_sample' which engages at the beginning of sample processing, 'sample_ticks' conveying sample timings, and 'h_count' & 'v_count' for current horizontal and vertical counts respectively. Internally, 'count_sample' sourced from a submodule determines when horizontal counting occurs, while 'h_total_int' and 'v_total_int' serve as internally adjusted total counts affecting when counters reset based on the parameter 'TOTALS_MINUS_ONE'.

The module counts the horizontal (h_count) and vertical (v_count) positions in a video frame based on the provided total counts (h_total and v_total) and control signals (enable, sclr, hd_sdn). It features parameters for adjusting behavior based on color plane configurations and the presence of parallel color plane information. The module also interacts with a sample counter submodule (alt_vipitc130_common_sample_counter) to determine when to increment the counts and to issue flags such as 'new_line' and 'start_of_sample' based on the current pixel/sample processing position. This is part of a larger system likely used in video image transport and control applications. The proper functioning of counts and resets makes it adaptable for different frame rates and resolutions by receiving dynamic signals for each video frame dynamically processed."
