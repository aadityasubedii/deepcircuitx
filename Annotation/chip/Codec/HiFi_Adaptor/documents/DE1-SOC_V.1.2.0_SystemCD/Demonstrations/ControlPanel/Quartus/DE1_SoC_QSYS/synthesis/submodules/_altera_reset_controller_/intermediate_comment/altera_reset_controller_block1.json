    "block_comment": "This Verilog block outputs synchronized and early reset signals. It utilizes continuous assignment within an always block to directly map the internal register values `r_sync_rst` and `r_early_rst` to the outputs `reset_out` and `reset_req`, respectively, ensuring that the reset signals are updated with the state of these registers at all times."
