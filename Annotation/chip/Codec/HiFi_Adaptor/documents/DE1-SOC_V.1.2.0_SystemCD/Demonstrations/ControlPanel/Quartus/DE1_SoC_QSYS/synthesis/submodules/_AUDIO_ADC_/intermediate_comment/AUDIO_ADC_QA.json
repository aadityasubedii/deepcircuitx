The module operates with a left and right channel distinction controlled by the `adclrc` signal, capturing data on positive edges of the `bclk` (bit clock). It sequences through bits of each audio sample, recognizing channel transitions and ensuring data is correctly aligned and stored for each channel separately. If the FIFO buffer isn't full, the processed data is stored, ready for retrieval. This process is managed with various flags and counters to handle synchronization, data integrity and flow control, resetting conditions via `reset` or `clear`, and responding to external read requests."

Its value is decremented with each bit processed and is used to correctly align the bits in the `reg_adc_serial_data` register.\n- **valid_bit:** A flag that indicates when the module is in the process of receiving valid data bits that can be stored into the `reg_adc_serial_data`. This flag helps manage when data should be captured or when the module should wait.\n- **reg_adc_left:** This register stores the state of the `adclrc` at the beginning of data capture for a channel, signifying whether the data belongs to the left or right channel.\n- **reg_adc_serial_data:** A register array where the serial bits from `adcdat` are stored temporarily as they are received. Once all bits of a channel are received, this data can be pushed to the FIFO.\n- **adcfifo_writedata:** This register holds the complete audio data sample ready to be written into the FIFO.\n- **adcfifo_write:** A control signal used to trigger a write operation into the FIFO when valid data is ready.\n- **wait_one_clk:** A flag used to introduce a one-clock delay in the data capturing process, ensuring timing accuracy and stability in storing the incoming bit into `reg_adc_serial_data`.\n- **adcfifo_full:** A feedback signal from the FIFO indicating that it is full. This signal is used to control the data write operations to prevent overflow.\n- **is_left_ch:** A derived signal indicating the current channel being received based on `adclrc`; it uses logic to invert the `adclrc` to correctly align timing for processing. This helps in toggling and checking between left and right channel data processing."
