The core functionality is to ensure that the trigger signal is carried over safely from one clock domain to another, handling the metastability that can occur due to the differences in clock domains. The module includes a synchronization mechanism and an optional direct pass-through if both clocks are the same, as indicated by the parameter `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME`. It makes use of a toggle mechanism to detect changes in the trigger signal and uses an async reset for both the input and synchronization sections. The output (`trigger_out`) will reflect the synchronized state of the input trigger signal across clock boundaries, toggling in response to detected input changes that are acknowledged."

It's used for capturing and processing the `trigger_in` signal within the input domain.\n- `rst`: Asynchronous reset for the synchronization domain, used to reset the synchronized toggle signal in the sync clock domain.\n- `sync_clock`: Clock signal for the synchronization domain, where the signal needs to be synchronized to avoid metastability issues when handling across different clock domains.\n- `trigger_in`: The trigger signal to be synchronized from the `input_clock` domain to the `sync_clock` domain. This input is the actual data signal that needs safe transfer across clock boundaries.\n- `ack_in`: Acknowledgement input that is used in the toggle mechanism to acknowledge the handling of a change in the trigger signal, contributing to the correct toggling behavior for synchronization.\n\nOutput ports: `trigger_out`.\nExplanation:\n- `trigger_out`: The output trigger signal that represents the synchronized version of `trigger_in` in the `sync_clock` domain.

It is used to detect edges in the `trigger_in` signal by comparing its current and previous states.\n- `toggle`: A signal that toggles whenever a significant change (an edge) is detected in the `trigger_in` signal and when the change is acknowledged via `ack_in`.
