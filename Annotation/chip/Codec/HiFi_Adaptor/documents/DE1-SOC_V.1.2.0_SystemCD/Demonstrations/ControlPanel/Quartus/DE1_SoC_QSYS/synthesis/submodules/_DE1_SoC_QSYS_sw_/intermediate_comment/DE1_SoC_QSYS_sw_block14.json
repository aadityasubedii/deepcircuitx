    "block_comment": "This block of code generates an interrupt request (`irq`) signal based on specific conditions. The `irq` signal is assigned the result of a bitwise OR operation (`|`) between `edge_capture` and `irq_mask`. This means that an interrupt request is generated whenever any bit in the `edge_capture` register that has a corresponding enabled bit in the `irq_mask` register is set to 1. Thus, the block effectively filters and acknowledges interrupts based on configurable conditions outlined by `irq_mask`."
