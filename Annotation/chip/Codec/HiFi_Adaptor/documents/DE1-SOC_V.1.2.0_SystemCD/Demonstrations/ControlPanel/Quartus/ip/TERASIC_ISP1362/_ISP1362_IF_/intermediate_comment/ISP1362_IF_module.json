    "module": "Module-level comment: The ISP1362_IF module interfaces host and device controllers with a USB, managing data, controls, and interrupts. It selectively routes data between controllers using USB_DATA based on chip select and read/write signals. The module uses internal logic to set addresses and control lines for USB operations, ensuring correct data flow and synchronization, while also handling interrupt signaling to the appropriate controller."
