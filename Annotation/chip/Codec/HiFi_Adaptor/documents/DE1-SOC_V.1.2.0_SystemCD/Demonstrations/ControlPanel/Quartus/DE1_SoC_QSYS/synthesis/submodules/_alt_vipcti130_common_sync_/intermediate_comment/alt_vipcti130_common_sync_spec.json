    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipcti130_common_sync. Module specification: The 'alt_vipcti130_common_sync' is a Verilog module designed to synchronize an input data signal, 'data_in', across either the same or different clock domains based on the 'CLOCKS_ARE_SAME' parameter. If 'CLOCKS_ARE_SAME' is set to 1, the module directly assigns 'data_in' to 'data_out', indicating synchronization within the same clock domain. In contrast, when 'CLOCKS_ARE_SAME' is 0, it indicates different clock domains, activating a two-stage synchronization using double register synchronization technique to handle the data safely and mitigate potential metastability issues. This module includes input ports: 'rst' (a reset signal that initializes the synchronization registers to zero), 'sync_clock' (the clock signal used for synchronization), and 'data_in' (the data signal to be synchronized with a parameterized width defined by 'WIDTH'). The sole output port is 'data_out', which outputs the synchronized data. Internally, the module uses two registers, 'data_out_sync0' and 'data_out_sync1', each annotated with synthesis attributes to guide synthesis tools regarding their purpose in synchronization and metastability prevention. The module leverages a 'generate' block to conditionally implement the logic for direct assignment or double-register synchronization based on the 'CLOCKS_ARE_SAME' parameter's value, with each internal register initialized or updated on positive edges of 'sync_clock' or when 'rst' is high, ensuring robust data synchronization across clock domains.",

If CLOCKS_ARE_SAME is set to 1, the input data is directly assigned to the output as they are in the same clock domain. If CLOCKS_ARE_SAME is 0, which implies different clock domains, it uses a double register synchronization technique to safely pass the data signal 'data_in' to 'data_out'. This helps prevent possible metastability issues arising from clock domain crossing. The registers, 'data_out_sync0' and 'data_out_sync1', are used in series to synchronize the data, with specific synthesis attributes assigned to guide the synthesis tool's behavior for these registers."
