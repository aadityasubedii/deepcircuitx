    "block_comment": "This Verilog code defines a local parameter named `SLAVE_ADDRESS_REQUIREDWIDTH` and assigns it a value of 5. The block is used to establish a constant width for slave addresses within a digital system, ensuring uniformity and simplifying address handling. The use of `localparam` indicates that this parameter is local to the module, preventing alterations and enhancing the stability and predictability of the address configuration."
