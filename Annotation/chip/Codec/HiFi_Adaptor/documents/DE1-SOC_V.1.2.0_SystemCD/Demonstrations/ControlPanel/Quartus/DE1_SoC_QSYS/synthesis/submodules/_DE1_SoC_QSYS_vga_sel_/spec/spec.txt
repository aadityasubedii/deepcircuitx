Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_vga_sel. 
Module specification: The "DE1_SoC_QSYS_vga_sel" module operates as a basic I/O interface designed for VGA selection functionality within a system-on-chip environment. It manages data operations through control signals, including chip select, write enable, and address targeting. Inputs to the module include a 2-bit `address` for selecting the memory location, a `chipselect` for enabling the module, a system `clk` for synchronous operations, an active-low `reset_n` for initializing internal registers, an active-low `write_n` for enabling write operations, and a 32-bit `writedata` for input data. The outputs consist of a `out_port` that reflects the state of internal `data_out` register and a 32-bit `readdata`, which provides a zero-filled output except potentially the LSB reflecting `data_out`. Internal signals include `clk_en`, which is statically set high and does not contribute to functionality in this code, and `read_mux_out` used to select `data_out` when `address` is 0. The code includes blocks to reset `data_out` on a low `reset_n`, and write to it upon write conditions (specific address, chip select active, write enable low), as well as assignments to pass `data_out` to both `out_port` and `readdata`. This module effectively handles selective data writing and outputting in conditions tailored for interfacing within controlled environments.
