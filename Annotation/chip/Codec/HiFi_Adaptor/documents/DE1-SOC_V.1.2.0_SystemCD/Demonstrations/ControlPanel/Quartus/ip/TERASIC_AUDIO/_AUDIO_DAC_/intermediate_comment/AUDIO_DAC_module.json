    "module": "Module-level comment: The AUDIO_DAC module manages the interface with an audio DAC by converting digital audio data to an analog bit stream. It handles data synchronization using a FIFO buffer, controlled by signals like clk, reset, and daclrc. The module processes audio bits according to the bclk timing, toggling between left and right channels, and shifts detailed bit information through internal mechanisms to accurately output through dacdat."
