    "block_comment": "This block synchronously resets or updates video processing registers. Under a reset signal (`rst_vid_clk`), the block initializes all video-related registers to zero, effectively resetting the state. Otherwise, it conditionally updates the `valid_reg` and `convert` flags based on overflow conditions, maintaining current values if an overflow occurs, or incorporating `valid_nxt` and `vid_enable_int` signals otherwise. Additionally, it transfers video data (`vid_data_int`) and control signals (`vid_f_int`, `vid_h_sync_int`, `vid_v_sync_int`, `vid_datavalid_int`, `vid_anc_valid_int`) to corresponding registers, allowing the video processing logic to maintain synchronization and video signal integrity. The use of edge-triggered flip-flops ensures glitch-free, stable output signals in response to the positive edge of `vid_clk_int` or the reset signal."
