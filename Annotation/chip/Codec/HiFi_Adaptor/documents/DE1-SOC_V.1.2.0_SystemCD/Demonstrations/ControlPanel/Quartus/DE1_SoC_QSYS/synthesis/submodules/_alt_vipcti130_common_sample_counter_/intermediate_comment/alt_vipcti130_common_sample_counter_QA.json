It operates differently based on the number of color planes specified. If only one color plane is used, it simply outputs the count cycle as the sample count and marks every cycle as the start of a new sample. For more than one color plane, it uses a more complex logic to calculate when a new sample starts and how many ticks (count cycles) occur for each sample. The module handles both reset conditions and an optional clear signal, and incorporates logic to deal with high definition shutdown signaling through its `hd_sdn` input, which influences the sample counting behavior."

When asserted, it initializes internal counters and sets the module to its initial state.\n- clk: Clock signal, controls the timing for the module's operations, serving as the base for synchronous logic within the module.\n- sclr: Synchronous clear, active high. When asserted, it resets internal counters but unlike rst, it only resets under the clock's timing control.\n- count_cycle: Control signal which, when high, indicates that the current clock cycle should be counted as a sample.\n- hd_sdn: High Definition Shutdown signal, it influences the sample count behavior based on the HD operation.\n\nOutput ports: [count_sample, start_of_sample, sample_ticks].\nExplanation:\n- count_sample: Output signal indicating a counted sample in the current cycle; its behavior can change based on the number of color planes and hd_sdn status.\n- start_of_sample: Output signal that marks the beginning of a new sample. The condition for this signal varies if using single or multiple color planes.\n- sample_ticks: Number of ticks (count cycles) for each sample, expressed in the number of bits determined by LOG2_NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES.

It is derived based on the equality comparison between the `count_valids` register and the total number of color planes minus one. When `count_valids` has counted up to this value, `new_sample` indicates the end of one sample cycle and the start of another, influencing both `count_sample` and `start_of_sample` outputs under conditions of multiple colour planes.\n\n- count_valids: A register signal used to count valid sample cycles up to a certain threshold determined by the number of color planes. Its width is set by `LOG2_NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES`. It increments every cycle where `count_cycle` is asserted, or resets to zero when a new sample is indicated by `new_sample`. This signal helps in keeping track of the number of cycles counted for each sample when handling multiple color planes. It is also directly used to determine when a new sample should start and feeds directly into the `sample_ticks` output, indicating the ticks per sample count in multi-plane mode."
