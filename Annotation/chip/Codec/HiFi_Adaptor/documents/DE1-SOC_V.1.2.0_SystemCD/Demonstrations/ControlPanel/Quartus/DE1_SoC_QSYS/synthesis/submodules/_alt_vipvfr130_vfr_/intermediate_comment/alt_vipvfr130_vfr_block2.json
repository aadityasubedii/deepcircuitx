    "block_comment": "This Verilog block configures an encoder for video frame rate control packets. It initializes an instance of `alt_vipvfr130_vfr_control_packet_encoder` with parameters specifying bits per symbol and symbols per beat, tailored to the color plane bit depth and the number of channels processed in parallel. Connections include clock and reset signals, and interfaces for data stream control (ready and valid signals) and video frame specifics (start/end of packet, width, height, and interlacing control). This setup enables the encoding of control packets based on incoming video processing data, ensuring synchronized handling of video streams in hardware implementations."
