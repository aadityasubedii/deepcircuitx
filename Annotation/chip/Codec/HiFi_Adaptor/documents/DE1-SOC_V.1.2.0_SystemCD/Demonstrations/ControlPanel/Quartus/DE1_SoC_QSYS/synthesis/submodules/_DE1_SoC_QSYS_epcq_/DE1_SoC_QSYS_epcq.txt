Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_epcq module serves as an interface controller for EPCQ devices, managing data read and write operations. It handles input signals such as address, chipselect, and data from the CPU, using internal logic and submodules (DE1_SoC_QSYS_epcq_sub and tornado_DE1_SoC_QSYS_epcq_atom) to perform timed data transfer and status handling, all synchronized by the system clock. This module ensures efficient memory operation via well-coordinated signal manipulation and submodule interaction.
