This block defines an Avalon-ST compliant streaming data output interface with configurable READY latency. If `READY_LATENCY` is set to 1, it instantiates `alt_vipvfr130_common_stream_output` with the width of `BPS * CHANNELS_IN_PAR`, handling the interface protocol with signal assignments for ready, valid, data, SOP, and EOP. Otherwise, it directly assigns outputs to intermediates, bypassing additional latency stages.
