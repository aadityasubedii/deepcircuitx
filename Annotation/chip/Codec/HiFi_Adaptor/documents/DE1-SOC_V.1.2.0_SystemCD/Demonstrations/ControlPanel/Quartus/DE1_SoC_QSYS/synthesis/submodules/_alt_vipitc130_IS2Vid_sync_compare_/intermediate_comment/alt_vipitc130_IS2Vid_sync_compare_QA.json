It compares the synchronization between input (CVI) and output (CVO) video signals, likely for the purpose of genlock (generator locking) in video systems. The module tracks start-of-frame signals, counts lines and samples, and generates control signals to adjust synchronization. It manages different states (IDLE, CVI, CVO) based on the incoming start-of-frame signals, and calculates whether to add or remove lines and samples to achieve synchronization. The module also outputs signals indicating whether the system is genlocked and provides reset values for horizontal and vertical synchronization comparisons."
