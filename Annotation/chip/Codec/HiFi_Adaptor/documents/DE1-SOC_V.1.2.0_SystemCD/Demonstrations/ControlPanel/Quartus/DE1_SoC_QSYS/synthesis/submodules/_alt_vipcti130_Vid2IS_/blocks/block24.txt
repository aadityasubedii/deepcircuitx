This block detects the rising edge of the signal 'ap'. It achieves this by implementing a bitwise AND operation between 'ap' and the inverse of 'ap_reg', which is the registered or delayed version of 'ap'. Essentially, 'start_of_ap' will be high (1) if 'ap' transitions from low (0) to high (1) between two consecutive clock cycles.
