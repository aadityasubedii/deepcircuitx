This block of code handles the horizontal synchronization for a video display by assigning the value of `vid_h_sync_reg` to `h_sync`. The implementation simply uses a continuous assignment statement in Verilog, directly mapping the register value to the horizontal sync signal. This is essential for synchronizing the timing of horizontal display scanning.
