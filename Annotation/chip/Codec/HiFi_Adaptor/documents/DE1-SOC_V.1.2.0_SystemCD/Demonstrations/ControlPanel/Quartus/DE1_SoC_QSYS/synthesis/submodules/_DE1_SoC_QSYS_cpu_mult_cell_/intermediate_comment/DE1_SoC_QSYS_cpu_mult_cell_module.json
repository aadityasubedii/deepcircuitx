    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_mult_cell is a Verilog module for multiplying two 32-bit integers using dedicated FPGA multipliers, optimized for CYCLONEV devices. It splits inputs into 16-bit segments, calculating separate partial products via 'altera_mult_add' instances. The final 32-bit result is composed by combining these partial products, managed by synchronous control logic for operational and reset synchronization."
