Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_alt_vip_swi_0 module routes data between two input streams and one output stream based on control signals. Incorporating `alt_vipswi130_switch_control` for dynamic input selection and synchronization, it uses `alt_vipswi130_common_stream_input` and `alt_vipswi130_common_stream_output` blocks for managing data flow, ensuring stream readiness and integrity. Control settings are modified through an addressable interface, enabling flexible data path configuration.
