Module-level comment: The alt_vipitc131_common_to_binary module converts a one-hot encoded input ('one_hot') to a binary encoded output ('binary'). Utilizing nested generate loops and two internal signal arrays, 'binary_values' and 'binary_values_by_bit', it identifies the high bit's position in 'one_hot' and translates this position into binary form. The module relies on a bitwise OR operation in the final stage to synthesize the binary output efficiently.
