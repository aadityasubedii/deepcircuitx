Module name: alt_vipvfr131_vfr_control_packet_encoder. 
Module specification: The `alt_vipvfr131_vfr_control_packet_encoder` module is designed to encode control packets for video frame information, including dimensions and interlacing details. It is parameterized by `BITS_PER_SYMBOL` and `SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT` to manage data width and processing rates. The module's inputs include a clock (`clk`), reset signal (`rst`), data input attributes (`din_ready`, `din_valid`, `din_data`, `din_sop`, `din_eop`), control signal for packet mode (`do_control_packet`), and video frame attributes (`width`, `height`, `interlaced`). Outputs consist of a data input ready signal (`din_ready`), data output valid signal (`dout_valid`), start and end of packet signals for output (`dout_sop`, `dout_eop`), and the data output bus (`dout_data`). Internal signals include a state register (`state`), control data storage (`control_data`), control packet validity (`control_valid`), among others, facilitating the control flow and data packet encoding. Key sections in the code manage setting up control packet details, the state machine transitions for packet encoding, and conditional processing for output based on internal states. This module efficiently handles both video data and control packet encoding, ensuring proper signal and data flow between input and output according to the configured video parameters.
