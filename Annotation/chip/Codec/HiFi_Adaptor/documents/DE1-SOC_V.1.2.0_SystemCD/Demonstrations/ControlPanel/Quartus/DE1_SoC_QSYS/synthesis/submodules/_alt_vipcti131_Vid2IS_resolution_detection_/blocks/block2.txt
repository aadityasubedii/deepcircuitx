Comment: 
This block computes the condition to update the total line counter for field 1. It evaluates to true when field_1 is active, the next total line count differs in the upper bits or the least significant bit of the current count isn't set, and it's the first start of a new field. This conditional assignment ensures that the line total is updated correctly in sync with field 1 timing and boundaries.
