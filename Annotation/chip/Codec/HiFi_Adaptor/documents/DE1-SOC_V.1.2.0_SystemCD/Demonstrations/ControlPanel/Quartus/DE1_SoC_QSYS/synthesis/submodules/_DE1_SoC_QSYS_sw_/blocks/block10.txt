Comment: 
This block manages the capture of edge-detection events for a specific signal line. On a rising clock edge or a falling reset, it first checks for a reset condition to clear the corresponding capture register `edge_capture[2]`. If not resetting and if clock enable `clk_en` is active, it then checks if there's a write strobe `edge_capture_wr_strobe`; if true, it clears the register. If no write strobe but an edge is detected on `edge_detect[2]`, it sets the register to -1 to indicate the detection of the edge.
