This block handles the synchronous reset and state update of a system managing image packet data. Upon reset (rst), it initializes the `image_packet` to 0, `synced_int` to 1, and disables `enable_synced_reg`. Otherwise, it updates these signals to their respective next state values (`image_packet_nxt`, `synced_int_nxt`, `enable_synced`) at every positive edge of the clock (clk), ensuring the system state is consistently refreshed based on new procedural conditions.
