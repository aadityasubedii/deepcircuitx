Module name: SEG7_IF. Module specification: The SEG7_IF module is designed to interface with a 7-segment display array, catering specifically to handling read, write, and reset operations. It facilitates data writing and reading concerning individual segments of a display. The inputs to this module include a clock signal `s_clk` for synchronization, an address input `s_address` specifying the target segment address, a read signal `s_read` to enable segment state reading, a write signal `s_write` enabling data writing, a data input `s_writedata` representing the information to be written, and a reset input `s_reset` that initializes the segment states. The outputs are `s_readdata`, outputting the data read from the specified segment, and `SEG7`, which drives the entire 7-segment display. Internal signals such as `base_index`, `write_data`, `read_data`, and `reg_file` respectively calculate the target bit within the register, temporarily store the write data, hold the read segment data, and maintain the state of the display segments. The code executes different operations based on signals: reset initializes all segments either to `1` or `0`, controlled by `DEFAULT_ACTIVE`; write operation transfers data from `s_writedata` to the specific segment in `reg_file`; and read operation fetches segment data into `s_readdata`. Additionally, the `SEG7` output can invert the stored values before output based on `LOW_ACTIVE`. This modular setup ensures efficient control and configuration of a multi-segment 7-segment display, powered by straightforward and robust synchronous logic blocks responding to real-time input signals.
