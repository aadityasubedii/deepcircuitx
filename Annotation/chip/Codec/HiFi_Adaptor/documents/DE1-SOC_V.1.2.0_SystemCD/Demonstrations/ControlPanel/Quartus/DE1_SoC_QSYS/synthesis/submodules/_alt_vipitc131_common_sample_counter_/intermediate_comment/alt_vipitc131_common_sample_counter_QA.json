It uses a parameterized design based on the number of color planes (NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES). The module generates signals such as `count_sample`, `start_of_sample`, and `sample_ticks`. When there's only one color plane, the counters simply pass through the `count_cycle` signal. For multiple color planes, the module counts the valid cycles and marks the start of new samples, adjusting the counters and outputs according to the control signals (`sclr`, `hd_sdn`) and the clock `clk`. The counters are reset on a system reset `rst`. The behavior of the counting and sample tracking changes based on whether color planes are handled sequentially or in parallel, which is determined by the parameter `COLOUR_PLANES_ARE_IN_PARALLEL` and the number of color planes involved."

Essential for setting the module to a known state.\n- `clk`: Clock input that drives the sequential logic and timing of the module. Ensures that the module operates synchronously.\n- `sclr`: Synchronous clear input that resets counters when high, without waiting for a system reset.\n- `count_cycle`: Input signal that indicates a count event in each clock cycle. Used to increment or manage internal counters.\n- `hd_sdn`: Input signal that selects between different modes of counting based on its high or low state.\n\nOutput ports: `count_sample`, `start_of_sample`, `sample_ticks`.\nExplanation:\n- `count_sample`: Output signal that indicates a sample has been counted. It changes based on `hd_sdn` state and internal counting conditions.\n- `start_of_sample`: Output signal that indicates the start of a new sample. It helps synchronize other modules to the start of processing a new color plane or data block.\n- `sample_ticks`: Output bus of width `LOG2_NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES-1:0` that outputs the current count of valid data units processed.

It is used to determine when to reset `count_valids` or to signal the system that a new sample counting cycle should begin.\n- `count_valids`: This internal register holds the current count of valid cycles for the color planes. Its value is incremented based on the `count_cycle` signal unless a new sample is detected via `new_sample`. When `sclr` is high, or a new sample cycle begins, `count_valids` is reset.
