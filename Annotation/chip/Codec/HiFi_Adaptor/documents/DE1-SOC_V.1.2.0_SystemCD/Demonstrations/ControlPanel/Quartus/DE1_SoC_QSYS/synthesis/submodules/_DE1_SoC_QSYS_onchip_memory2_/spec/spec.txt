Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_onchip_memory2.

Module specification: 

The DE1_SoC_QSYS_onchip_memory2 module acts as a single-ported RAM with a storage capacity of 40000 words, each of 32 bits length, initialized from a separate hex file. 

Inputs to the module include address (16-bit wide signal to point to the memory location), byteenable (4-bit wide signal for specifying byte read/write operations), chipselect (signal to enable entire operations of the module), clk (the main clock signal), clken (signal to pause or resume operations), reset (signal to reset the memory module), reset_req (signal to request a reset operation), write (signal indicating a write operation), and writedata (32-bit wide signal with the data to be written). 

The single output port is readdata, a 32-bit wide signal holding the data read from memory. 

Internal signals comprise of clocken0 (signal that enables clock operations), readdata (connecting to the q_a port of the altsyncram instance to hold the data read from memory) and wren (enable signal for write operation). 

The first part of the code declares parameters, inputs, outputs, and internal signals. The second part comprises of an assign block defining the conditions for enabling write and clock operations. This is followed by the instantiation of the altsyncram module, which is the part that houses the primary functionality of the memory operations. In the end, the parameters for the altsyncram module are identified including its size, operation mode, output registration etc. It gives an overall view of the significance and operation of the module.
