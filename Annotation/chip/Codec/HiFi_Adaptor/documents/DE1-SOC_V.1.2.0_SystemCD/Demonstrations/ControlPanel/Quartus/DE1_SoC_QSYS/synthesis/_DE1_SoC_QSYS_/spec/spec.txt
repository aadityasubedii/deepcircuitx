Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS. Module specification: This module is a top-level system integration module for a DE1-SoC FPGA board, implementing a complex system-on-chip design. It interconnects various hardware components and IP cores, including an ARM processor (HPS), memory interfaces (SDRAM, on-chip memory), peripherals (UART, SPI, I2C, GPIO), video processing components (VIP modules for scaling, mixing, etc.), audio interfaces, and clock management (PLLs). The module has numerous input and output ports for interfacing with external components, including clocks, resets, video signals, memory interfaces, and various peripheral I/O. Internal signals facilitate communication between different components, handling data transfer, control, and synchronization. The code is organized into sections for instantiating individual components (e.g., CPU, memory, peripherals, video processing
