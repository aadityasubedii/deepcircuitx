Module-level comment: The alt_vipvfr130_common_avalon_mm_master module serves as an Avalon MM master for managing data transfers and control within FPGA systems. It interfaces through specified clocks, resets, and data/command ports, integrating a sub-module for burst operations and FIFO management. This structure enables efficient, synchronized read/write transactions adhering to the Avalon protocol, with parameters to adjust data and address widths, burst sizes, and FIFO depths.
