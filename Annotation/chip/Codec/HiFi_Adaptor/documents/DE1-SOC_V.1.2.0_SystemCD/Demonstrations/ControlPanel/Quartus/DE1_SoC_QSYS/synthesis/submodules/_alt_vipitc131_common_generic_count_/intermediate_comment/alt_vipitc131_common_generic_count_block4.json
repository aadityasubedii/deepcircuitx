    "block_comment": "The block assigns the Boolean flag `start_count` that determines either the starting or stopping of a counter based on tick values. It sets `start_count` to true either when `ticks` equals zero, indicated by `{TICKS_WORD_LENGTH{1'b0}}` (a comparator generating a zero with a word length of `TICKS_WORD_LENGTH`), or when `enable_ticks` is false, effectively disabling the tick counting feature."
