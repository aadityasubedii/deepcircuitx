Module name: alt_vipitc131_IS2Vid_calculate_mode.

Module specification: The alt_vipitc131_IS2Vid_calculate_mode module is designated for computing various critical parameters related to video timing and synchronization for upcoming video frames, based on whether the video input is interlaced or progressive. The module utilizes a collection of inputs such as trs (Timing Reference Signals), is_interlaced (video type indicator), is_serial_output (output serialization flag), several counts and lengths related to video sample, line, sync, and blanking for two fields (e.g., is_sample_count_f0, is_sample_count_f1, is_h_sync_length, etc.), to generate outputs including interlaced_nxt, serial_output_nxt, h_total_minus_one_nxt, v_total_minus_one_nxt, among others. These outputs provide critical parameters like total pixels per line, the total number of lines, sync positions, etc., required by downstream video processing systems.

Internal signals such as v_active_lines, v_total, v1_rising_edge, and f1_v_sync play significant roles in determining active lines, vertical sync positions, and rising edge calculations vital for the interlaced video phases. The code structure comprises sections handling the determination of active video lines and total count, calculation blocks for sync positions, and assignments for both vertical and horizontal output parameters based on the input conditions. Each section resolves specific timing computations crucial for maintaining the integrity of video frame outputs corresponding to the detected video type (interlaced or progressive) ensuring synchronization and formatting compatibility with connected video systems.
