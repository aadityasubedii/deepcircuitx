It manages synchronization by comparing the start-of-frame events from input video (Camerain Video Interface - CVI) and output video (Cameraout Video Interface - CVO), aligned with genlock enable signals. The module contains mechanisms to handle the resetting and counting of horizontal and vertical sync measures. If the conditions are met (controlled by parameters like genlock enable and end states), it attempts to adjust and generate new sync settings to ensure the output video is genlocked with the input video, ensuring minimal video frame discrepancies. The process involves dynamic regulation of counters and state transitions to handle synchronization seamlessly. Additionally, the module integrates with the `alt_vipitc131_common_frame_counter` sub-module for detailed frame counting operations adjusted by synchronization state success across video frames."
