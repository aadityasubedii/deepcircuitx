Module name: TERASIC_STREAM_SOURCE. Module specification: The TERASIC_STREAM_SOURCE module is designed for generating a video data stream based on selectable patterns and scales, primarily used in video streaming simulations within hardware designs. The input ports include `clk` (system clock), `reset_n` (active low module reset), signals `s_cs`, `s_read`, `s_write` and `s_writedata` for managing read/write operations to control registers, `src_ready` indicating downstream readiness for new data, and `user_mode` allowing dynamic pattern changes. The output ports consist of `s_readdata` delivering data read from the module, `src_valid` signalling video data validity, `src_data` carrying the video pixel data, `src_sop` indicating the start of data packet, and `src_eop` signalling the end of a packet. Internal signals include `stream_active` managing the video streaming state, `pat_id` storing selected pattern ID, position tracking registers `x` and `y`, and `is_send_video_data` controlling the data sending status. The module has key sections: setting pattern ID and stream activation, pixel position management, data output control, and pattern-based color generation for pixel data. Each section is aimed at coordinating frame sequencing, pattern generation, and interfacing with external controls and downstream modules, ensuring the dynamic and adjustable video streaming based on predefined or user-selected patterns.
