    "module": "Module-level comment: \n\nThis module, Altera_Avalon_St_Handshake_Clock_Crosser, serves as a handshaking mechanism for data transfer across multiple clock domains, maintaining data integrity. It ingests various inputs including signals for data, validity, reset, error, and packets, processing them internally using parameters like 'PAYLOAD_WIDTH' to bundle the data and flags into payloads. An instance of the 'altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser' component is used for synchronization across clock domains. Output data is then calculated and grouped, ready for use in other modules. The module's functionality is customizable with optional configurations like channel information and error flags."
