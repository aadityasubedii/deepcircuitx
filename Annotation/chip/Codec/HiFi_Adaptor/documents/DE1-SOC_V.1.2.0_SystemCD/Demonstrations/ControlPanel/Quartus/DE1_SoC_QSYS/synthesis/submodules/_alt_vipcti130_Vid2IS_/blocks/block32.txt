This block implements a synchronization and state update process for a video signal interface. The block resets internal counters and status registers to their initial state upon a reset (`rst_vid_clk`) or updates them based on the current video locking and overflow conditions otherwise. It latches video signal attributes (h_sync, v_sync, ap) and manages an overflow flag with a sticky behavior. The `sync_count` is managed conditionally, and a prediction for the field (`field_prediction`) is updated based on the `field_prediction_nxt` signal.
