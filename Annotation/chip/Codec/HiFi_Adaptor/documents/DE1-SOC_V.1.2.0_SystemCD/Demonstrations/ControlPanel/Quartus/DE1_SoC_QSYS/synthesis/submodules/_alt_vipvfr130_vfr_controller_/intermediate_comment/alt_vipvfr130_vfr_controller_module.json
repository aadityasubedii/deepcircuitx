    "module": "Module-level comment: The `alt_vipvfr130_vfr_controller` module controls video frame reading by interfacing with video processing hardware and a master controller. It uses an FSM that transitions through states like IDLE, SENDING_ADDRESS, and WAITING_END_FRAME based on control signals and master interrupts to manage and toggling between two banks for data settings. The FSM coordinates read/write operations and signals to process video frames effectively."
