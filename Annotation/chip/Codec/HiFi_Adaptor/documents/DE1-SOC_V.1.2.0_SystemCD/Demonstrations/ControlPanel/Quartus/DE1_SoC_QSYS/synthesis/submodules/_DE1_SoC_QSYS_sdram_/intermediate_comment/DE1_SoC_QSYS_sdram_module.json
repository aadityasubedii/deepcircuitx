    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements an SDRAM controller for DE1-SoC board, interfacing between Avalon bus and SDRAM. It manages initialization, read/write operations, and refresh cycles using state machines. The controller utilizes a FIFO for data buffering, handles command processing, and maintains proper SDRAM timing. It includes logic for address multiplexing, bank management, and data masking to ensure efficient memory access and data integrity."
