Comment: 
This block of code assigns the value of the `enable` signal to the `enable_count` signal. The implementation simply passes the state of `enable` directly to `enable_count` without any modifications, indicating that `enable_count` is effectively a duplicate or proxy of `enable`, potentially used elsewhere in the design for clarity or modularity.
