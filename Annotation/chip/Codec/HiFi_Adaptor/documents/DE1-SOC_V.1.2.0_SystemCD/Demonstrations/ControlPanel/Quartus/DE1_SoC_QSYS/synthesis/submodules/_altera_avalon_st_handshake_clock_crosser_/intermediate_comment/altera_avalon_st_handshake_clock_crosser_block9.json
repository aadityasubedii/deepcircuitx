    "block_comment": "The block assigns start and end packet flag values based on part of the `out_payload` value. The signals `out_startofpacket` and `out_endofpacket` are constructed from the `out_payload` sub-vector starting from `DATA_WIDTH` to `DATA_WIDTH + PACKET_WIDTH - 1`. The slice of `out_payload` determines the states of 'start of packet' and 'end of packet' flags."
