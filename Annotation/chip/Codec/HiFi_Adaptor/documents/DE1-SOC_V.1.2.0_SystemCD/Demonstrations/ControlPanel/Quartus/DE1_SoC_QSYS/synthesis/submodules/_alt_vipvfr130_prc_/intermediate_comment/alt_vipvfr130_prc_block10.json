    "block_comment": "This block selects the appropriate master clock signal based on a configuration parameter. If the `CLOCKS_ARE_SEPARATE` parameter is set to true, the `master_av_clock` is used as the `master_clock`; otherwise, the common `clock` signal is used. This conditional assignment helps in managing clock signals efficiently in designs where clock domains might differ."
