    "block_comment": "This block performs a conditional data manipulation for a select portion of `rmw_temp` based on the status of `dqm[1]`. If `dqm[1]` is high, it assigns the bits from 15 to 8 of `mem_bytes` to the corresponding bits in `rmw_temp`; if `dqm[1]` is low, it assigns those from `zs_dq` instead. This conditional assignment effectively allows selective data masking or preservation based on the control signal `dqm[1]`."
