It handles read operations, taking in command signals that specify the address, operation type (read or write, although this module focuses on reads), burst configurations, and burst lengths. The module leverages an internal FIFO structure for managing read data transactions and queues up read requests. Output data is then managed and width-adjusted through a pulling width adaptor block. This setup essentially helps manage read data flow from a memory-mapped interface, ensuring efficient and orderly data handling and supporting burst-read operations."
