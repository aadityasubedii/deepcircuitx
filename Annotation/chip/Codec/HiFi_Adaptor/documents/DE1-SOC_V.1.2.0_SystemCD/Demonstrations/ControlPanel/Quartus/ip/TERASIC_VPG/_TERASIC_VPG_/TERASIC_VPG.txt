Module-level comment: The TERASIC_VPG is a Verilog module designed as a VGA video pattern generator. It inputs commands via SPI-like interface to select patterns such as colors and gradients and generates VGA signal outputs (sync signals and RGB data). It includes a VGA timing generator sub-module to manage display timings and internal logic that processes pattern generation based on pixel coordinates to produce the desired visual effects. This design provides configurable visual outputs for VGA displays.
