Module name: AUDIO_IF. 
Module specification: The AUDIO_IF module is designed to interface with audio hardware to manage the data transfer between DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) and ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) components. It utilizes the main clock input (`avs_s1_clk`) for synchronization and includes a reset (`avs_s1_reset`) for clearing internal states and FIFOs. Specific register or FIFO access is provided through a 3-bit address input (`avs_s1_address`). Signals to indicate read (`avs_s1_read`) and write (`avs_s1_write`) operations are included, along with 16-bit data inputs (`avs_s1_writedata`) and outputs (`avs_s1_readdata`). The module supports synchronization signals for DAC and ADC like `avs_s1_export_BCLK`, `avs_s1_export_DACLRC`, and `avs_s1_export_ADCLRC`, along with audio data transfer (`avs_s1_export_DACDAT` and received `avs_s1_export_ADCDAT`). It also supplies external clock output (`avs_s1_export_XCK`). Internally, the module uses flags for FIFO full (`dacfifo_full`) and empty (`adcfifo_empty`), controls (`fifo_clear`, `dacfifo_write`, `adcfifo_read`), and maintains data registers (`reg_readdata`, `dacfifo_writedata`, `adcfifo_readdata`, `data32_from_adcfifo`, `data32_from_adcfifo_2`) for executing operations based on incoming commands and managing DAC/ADC data buffering. The code is structured into several always blocks and instantiations of DAC and ADC modules, which manage the writing and reading to/from FIFOs, handle reset and clear operations, and ensure synchronized data transfer and handling as per the specific addresses accessed. This module also sets parameters (`DATA_WIDTH`) for the DAC and ADC instances to facilitate proper operation and configuration.
