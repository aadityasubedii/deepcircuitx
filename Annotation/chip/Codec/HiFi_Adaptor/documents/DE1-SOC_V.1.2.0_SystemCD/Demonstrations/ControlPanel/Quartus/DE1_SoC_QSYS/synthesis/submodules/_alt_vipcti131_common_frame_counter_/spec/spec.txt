Module name: alt_vipcti131_common_frame_counter. 

Module specification: The module 'alt_vipcti131_common_frame_counter' is designed for frame counting in video processing, leveraging both horizontal (`h_count`) and vertical (`v_count`) counters to track the current position in a video frame based on different external and internal signals. It handles inputs including a reset signal (`rst`), a clock signal (`clk`), a synchronous clear signal (`sclr`), an enable signal (`enable`), and a horizontal synchronization signal (`hd_sdn`). Additionally, it takes configuration inputs for total horizontal (`h_total`) and vertical (`v_total`) dimensions, and reset positions (`h_reset`, `v_reset`). The output signals comprise of `new_line`, `start_of_sample`, and `sample_ticks`, which indicate the start of a new line, the start of a color sample, and the count of sampling ticks respectively, along with `h_count` and `v_count`. Internal signals such as `count_sample`, `h_total_int`, and `v_total_int` play a crucial role in adjusting the counters and integrating with a sub-module `alt_vipcti131_common_sample_counter` that refines the horizontal count and synchronizes the color sampling. Featuring parameters to control its behavior, the module integrates conditional adjusting of totals (`TOTALS_MINUS_ONE`), resulting in either direct assignment of total values or decrement-adjusted values to handle edge conditions. The primary logic blocks consist of the generation block to define adjusted totals, and a sequential block responding to edge-triggered resets and clocks to manage the core counting logic, conditionally resetting and incrementing counters based on module inputs and internal conditions.
