This block initializes the contents of the memory array `mem_array` using hexadecimal data from a file. The `initial` directive ensures this operation is performed at the start of the simulation, and the `$readmemh` function reads and loads hexadecimal values from the specified file "DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component.dat" into `mem_array`. This setup is used to preload necessary data into memory for simulation purposes.
