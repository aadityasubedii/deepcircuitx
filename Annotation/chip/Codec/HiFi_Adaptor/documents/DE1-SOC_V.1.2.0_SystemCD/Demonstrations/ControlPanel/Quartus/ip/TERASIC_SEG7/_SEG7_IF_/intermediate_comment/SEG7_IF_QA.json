It manages the data exchange between system memory and the display segments. The module's logic includes initialization, data writing to specific segments, and reading data back for verification or processing. It primarily operates on negative edge clock cycles; during a reset, it initializes the segments to a default active state. If write is enabled, it writes input data to specified segments while a read operation allows reading the current state of the segments. The output to the 7-segment display is determined by the LOW_ACTIVE parameter, which handles whether the segment display is active high or low."

The module operates on the negative edge of this clock.\n- s_address: This input specifies the address of the segment within the 7-segment display array where data is to be written or from where data is to be read.\n- s_read: This is a control signal. When high, it enables the module to read data from the display segment specified by the s_address.\n- s_writedata: This carries the data that is to be written to the segment specified by s_address when a write operation is performed.\n- s_write: This is a control signal. When high, it enables the module to write data to the segment specified by s_address.\n- s_reset: This is the reset input which, when high, initializes all the segments to a default state determined by the module parameter DEFAULT_ACTIVE.\n\nOutput ports: s_readdata, SEG7.\nExplanation:\n- s_readdata: This output carries the data read from the display segment specified by the s_address when a read operation is performed. It provides the current state of the segment for verification or further processing.\n- SEG7: This is the aggregated output port which sends data to the actual physical 7-segment display. The status of each segment (on/off) is determined by the logic within the module, and this output reflects whether each segment of the display is active or inactive based on the LOW_ACTIVE parameter."

It is calculated by shifting the s_address input left by 3 (multiplying by 8), thus aligning the address with the 8-bit segment groups in the reg_file.\n- write_data: This internal register temporarily stores the data from the s_writedata input, which is to be written into the reg_file. This register aids in transferring input data to the appropriate segment bits during a write operation.\n- read_data: This register is utilized to store data fetched from the reg_file during a read operation. This data is then output through the s_readdata port to provide the current state of the specified segment for further processing or verification.\n- reg_file: This is a large register array designed to hold the state of each bit (total 8 bits) of every segment (total SEG7_NUM segments) of the 7-segment display. It acts as the memory map of all the segments and is manipulated during read and write operations. The content of this register is directly related to the actual display outputs, controlled through the SEG7 port, influenced by the LOW_ACTIVE setting."
