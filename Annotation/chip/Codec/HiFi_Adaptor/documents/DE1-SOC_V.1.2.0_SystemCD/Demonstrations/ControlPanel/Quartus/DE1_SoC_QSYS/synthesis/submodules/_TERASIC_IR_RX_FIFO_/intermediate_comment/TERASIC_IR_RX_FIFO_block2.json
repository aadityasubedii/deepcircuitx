    "block_comment": "This block instantiates an FIFO buffer used for intermediate data storage between write and read operations. The FIFO, named `ir_fifo_inst`, clears with `fifo_clear`, writes data on `writedata` when `write` is asserted synchronized to `clk`, and reads data into `readdata` upon `read` request, also synchronized to `clk`. The FIFO usage width and read empty status are output on `use_dw` and an unconnected pin, respectively."
