    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block assigns the high bits of a register array to a control packet signal. Specifically, it extracts a slice from the `registers` array starting from the product of `SLAVE_DATA_REQUIREDWIDTH` and 7 up to the sum of this product and `CONTROL_PACKET_INTERLACED_REQUIREDWIDTH` minus 1. This slice represents interlaced control packet bits from bank 0 of a slave that are being sent to a controller."
