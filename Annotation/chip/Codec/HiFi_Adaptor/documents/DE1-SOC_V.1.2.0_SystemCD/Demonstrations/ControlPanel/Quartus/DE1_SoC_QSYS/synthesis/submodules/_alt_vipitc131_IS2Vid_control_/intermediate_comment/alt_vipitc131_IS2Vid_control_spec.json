    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipitc131_IS2Vid_control.\n\nModule specification: The alt_vipitc131_IS2Vid_control is a Verilog-based digital logic module designed predominantly for video signal handling in configurable systems. It supports a parameterized architecture, enabling adaptation based on user-defined properties like the number of modes and word width. Core functionalities are driven by input signals including a reset (rst), clock (clk), video-related flags like mode_change, and data management signals like underflow_sticky. The output signals such as enable, status_update_int, and genlock_enable facilitate control over external or subsequent operations in a video system, responding to various internal signal states and conditions.\n\nInput signals like rst, clk, av_write_ack, and others serve to manage operations flow, data writes, and synchronization elements like genlocked. Outputs such as enable, clear_underflow_sticky, and av_readdata provide operational status feedback, error handling mechanisms, and data for read operations respectively.\n\nInternally, the module uses registers and wires such as enable_reg and is_side_registers to temporarily store and manage conditions and decisions based on input parameters and operational context. The operational logic is categorized into blocks based on conditions set by the USE_CONTROL parameter. This conditionally includes registers for genlock synchronization, status updates, and mode management with transition-handling logic defined in always blocks responding to clock and reset events.\n\nThe module distinctly handles write operations and read responses through conditional expressions and assignments that integrate external commands with internal logic states. The use of generate constructs allows conditional compilation, enabling or bypassing entire sections of logic depending on the parameterization, significantly enhancing the module\u2019s flexibility and applicability across different video processing scenarios.",

It incorporates a parameterized design that allows for customization based on the user's requirements (e.g., number of modes, word width). The module processes input signals such as reset, clock, various data modes, read/write commands, and synchronization signals, and provides outputs for enabling or triggering specific states or transitions in a video system. It handles read and write operations with address checking, enables synchronous operation through a genlock mechanism, and manages status updates and interrupts based on the changing conditions of the inputs (mode change, underflow, etc.). It uses a combination of sequential and combinational logic driven by clock or reset signals within a `generate` construct to either instantiate the necessary control logic or default to a basic non-operative state if the `USE_CONTROL` parameter is disabled."

It supports a parameterized architecture, enabling adaptation based on user-defined properties like the number of modes and word width. Core functionalities are driven by input signals including a reset (rst), clock (clk), video-related flags like mode_change, and data management signals like underflow_sticky. The output signals such as enable, status_update_int, and genlock_enable facilitate control over external or subsequent operations in a video system, responding to various internal signal states and conditions.\n\nInput signals like rst, clk, av_write_ack, and others serve to manage operations flow, data writes, and synchronization elements like genlocked. Outputs such as enable, clear_underflow_sticky, and av_readdata provide operational status feedback, error handling mechanisms, and data for read operations respectively.\n\nInternally, the module uses registers and wires such as enable_reg and is_side_registers to temporarily store and manage conditions and decisions based on input parameters and operational context. The operational logic is categorized into blocks based on conditions set by the USE_CONTROL parameter. This conditionally includes registers for genlock synchronization, status updates, and mode management with transition-handling logic defined in always blocks responding to clock and reset events.\n\nThe module distinctly handles write operations and read responses through conditional expressions and assignments that integrate external commands with internal logic states. The use of generate constructs allows conditional compilation, enabling or bypassing entire sections of logic depending on the parameterization, significantly enhancing the module\u2019s flexibility and applicability across different video processing scenarios."
