Comment: 
This block assigns a value to `zs_dq` based on the condition provided by `read_valid`. If `read_valid` is true, `zs_dq` is assigned the value of `read_temp`; otherwise, it defaults to a 16-bit high-impedance state (`1'bz`). This implementation ensures that `zs_dq` either holds a valid read value or remains in a high-impedance state to avoid driving the bus when not reading.
