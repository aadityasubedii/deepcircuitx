Module-level comment: The alt_vipitc131_common_generic_count module is a versatile configurable counter with parametric control over its behavior. It handles up to a set maximum and manages counts with optional tick-based sub-counting for enhanced control. The functionality is implemented through a combination of sequential and combinational logic, using a generate block for conditional tick management and tick-based counting which allows the module to adapt counting based on enabled conditions and tick settings.
