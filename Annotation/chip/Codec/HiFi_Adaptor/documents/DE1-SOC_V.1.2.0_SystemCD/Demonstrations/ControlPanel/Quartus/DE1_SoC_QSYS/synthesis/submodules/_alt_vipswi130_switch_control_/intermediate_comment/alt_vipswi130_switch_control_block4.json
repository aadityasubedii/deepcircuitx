    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block defines a generate loop intended to create multiple instances based on the constant NO_OUTPUTS. Each iteration configures or controls specific hardware behavior dynamically, where 'i' acts as the index to individual instances named 'control_loop'. This structure allows for scalable module instantiation, adapting to different numbers of outputs as defined by NO_OUTPUTS."
