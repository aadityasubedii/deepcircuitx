It is divided into two parts using smaller 16-bit sections of the inputs to parallelize the computation. The first part multiplies the lower 16 bits of both inputs, and the second part multiplies the upper 16 bits of the first input with the lower 16 bits of the second input. The results are then combined to form the final 32-bit multiplication result. The module operates with synchronous reset and clock signals. Specifically designed for use in FPGA devices from the CYCLONEV family, it uses the dedicated multiplier blocks provided by this family for optimized performance."

The module splits these operands into lower and upper 16-bit sections to perform partial multiplications.\n- clk is the clock input which synchronizes the operation of the module, ensuring that all operations happen in a coordinated manner at each clock cycle.\n- reset_n is the active-low reset signal. If this signal is set low, the module's internal states and outputs will be reset, effectively clearing any ongoing operations and preparing the module for a fresh start.\n\nOutput ports: A_mul_cell_result.\nExplanation: \n- A_mul_cell_result is the 32-bit output port where the final result of the multiplication operation is provided.
