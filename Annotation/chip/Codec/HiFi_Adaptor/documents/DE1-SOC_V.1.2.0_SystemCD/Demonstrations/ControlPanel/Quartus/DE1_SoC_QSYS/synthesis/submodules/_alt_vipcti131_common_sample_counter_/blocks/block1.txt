The block assigns the value of `count_valids` to `sample_ticks`. This operation simply passes the count of valid signals directly to a sample ticker register or variable. The `assign` statement in Verilog is used for continuous assignment, ensuring that any changes in `count_valids` are immediately reflected in `sample_ticks`. This is commonly used for synchronization or tracing signal values in real-time applications.
