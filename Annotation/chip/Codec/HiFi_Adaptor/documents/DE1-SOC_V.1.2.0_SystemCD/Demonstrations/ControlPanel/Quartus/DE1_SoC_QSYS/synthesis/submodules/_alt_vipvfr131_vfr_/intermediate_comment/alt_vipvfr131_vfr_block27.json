    "block_comment": "This function calculates the minimum number of bits required to represent a given value. It initializes the required width to 512 and iteratively checks if 2 to the power of 'i' is greater than the input value, decrementing 'i' from 512 down to 1. If the condition is true, it updates the required width to 'i'."
