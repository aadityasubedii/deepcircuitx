It supports configurable symbol sizes and quantities per data beat. The pipeline manages data flow through dual registers (`data0` and `data1`) acting as buffers, controlling the readiness and validity of incoming and outgoing data. The `PIPELINE_READY` parameter determines whether the pipeline uses registered or unregistered ready signaling to synchronize inbound data acceptance and outbound data transmission relative to system clock and reset events. This flexibility allows the pipeline to handle varying data processing rates and to synchronize efficiently with different stages of data handling in a larger system design."

If true, the module will attempt to accept the data into its internal buffer if there's space.\n- **in_data:** The actual data input to the pipeline. The width of this data is dependent on the `DATA_WIDTH`, which is determined by `SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT` and `BITS_PER_SYMBOL`.\n- **out_ready:** An external signal indicating whether the downstream component is ready to receive data. This signal helps to manage the flow control by informing the module whether the next stage of the pipeline can handle more data.\n\n**Output ports:** in_ready, out_valid, out_data.  \n**Explanation:**  \n- **in_ready:** An output signal that indicates whether the module is ready to accept new `in_data`. This readiness is determined by the internal buffer status.\n- **out_valid:** A signal that signifies whether the `out_data` is valid, i.e., it tells external components that the data on `out_data` is valid and ready to be read.\n- **out_data:** The data output from the pipeline.
