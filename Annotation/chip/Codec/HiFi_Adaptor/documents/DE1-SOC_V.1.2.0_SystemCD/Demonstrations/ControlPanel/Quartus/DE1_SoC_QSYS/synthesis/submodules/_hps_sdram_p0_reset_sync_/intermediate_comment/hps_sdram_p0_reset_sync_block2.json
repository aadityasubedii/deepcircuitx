    "block_comment": "This block implements a reset synchronization logic for multiple stages. On a negative reset or a positive clock edge, the logic checks if the system is under reset, in which case it initializes the first stage of the reset register to '0'. If not under reset, it sequentially propagates the reset signal through up to `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` stages, with each stage taking the value of the previous one, except for the last stage which holds the value of the second to last stage to maintain the reset state across multiple clock cycles."
