It takes in a data stream of a width defined by `DATA_WIDTH_IN` and outputs a transformed data stream of `DATA_WIDTH_OUT` width. The module uses an instance of `alt_vipvfr130_common_pulling_width_adapter` to adapt the data width while also managing back-pressure through `stall_in` and `stall_out` signals. It reads input data only when there is a need (`need_input`) and accommodates for system pauses via the `stall_in`, and clears or discards data conditionally with the `clear` signal. The output enable (`write`) is controlled by both the absence of output stall and the input data availability. The module ensures proper resetting and synchronization with the system clock."

It is the data that needs to be processed or adapted to a different width.\n- `stall_in`: Input stall control signal. When asserted, it signals the module to pause reading new input data, used to manage flow control coming into the module.\n- `stall_out`: Output stall signal observed as an input inside this module. When asserted, it indicates that downstream elements are not ready to accept more data, controlling the flow of the adapted output data.\n- `clear`: Input signal used to discard or clear the current data or state under certain conditions, typically utilized in error or specific control scenarios.\n\nOutput ports: `read`, `write`, `data_out`.\nExplanation:\n- `read`: Output signal that indicates whether new data should be read from the input. It becomes asserted when the module is ready and needs new input data.\n- `write`: Output signal that indicates data availability for downstream consumption; it is controlled based on input and output stall conditions and reset status.\n- `data_out`: Output data stream with a width defined by the parameter `DATA_WIDTH_OUT`. This is the processed or adapted data generated by the module, ready to be sent downstream."

It indicates when the module needs to ingest more input data. Essentially, this signal helps in managing when the `read` operation should occur based on the availability of space or the processing capability of the module.\n- `ena`: Short for 'enable', this wire signal determines the readiness of the module to handle new input data. It is driven by the negation of the `stall_in` signal. When `stall_in` is low (i.e., no stall), `ena` is high, signifying that the module is ready for new data.
