Module name: alt_vipvfr131_common_avalon_mm_master. 
Module specification: The `alt_vipvfr131_common_avalon_mm_master` is a Verilog module that functions as an Avalon memory-mapped master interface, facilitating read and write memory operations, including burst transactions, based on input commands and conditions. It interfaces through clocks such as `clock` and `av_clock`, and reset signals `reset` and `av_reset` to synchronize internal and Avalon-specific operations. The input ports include `addr`, `command`, `is_burst`, `is_write_not_read`, `burst_length`, `writedata`, `write`, and `read` to receive command and data from the CPU; while output ports such as `av_address`, `av_burstcount`, `av_writedata`, `av_write`, `av_read`, and `readdata` ensure proper address and data handling in memory operations. Internal signals like `ena`, `stall`, `cenable`, `cenable_en`, `wenable`, `wenable_en`, `renable`, and `renable_en` support flow control and enable state-driven operations inside the FIFO-based master sub-module to efficiently manage data transactions and synchronization with memory response times. The main sub-module `alt_vipvfr131_common_avalon_mm_bursting_master_fifo` within the code is instantiated with parameterizations that affect burst sizes, FIFO depths, and synchronization options, handling the detailed logic for managing memory reads, writes, and bursts based on the synchronized clocks and conditions laid out by inputs and internal logic. This modular approach ensures organized handling of memory operations, adhering to the Avalon interface protocol and efficiently managing data flow and command execution.
