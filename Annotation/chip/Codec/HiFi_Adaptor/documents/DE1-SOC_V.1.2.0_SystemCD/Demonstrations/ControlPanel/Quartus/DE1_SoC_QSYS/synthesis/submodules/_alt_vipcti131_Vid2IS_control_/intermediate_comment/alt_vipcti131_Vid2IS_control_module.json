    "module": "Module-level comment: The `alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_control` module manages video stream processing control and configuration, adapting dynamically to resolution changes and video standards. It supports interlaced video handling, interfaces with the Avalon MM Slave for configurations, and maintains internal state based on input signals. Verilog `generate` constructs parameterize the module's functionality, while internal registers and edge-detection logic manage status updates, interrupts, and Avalon-based read/write operations."
