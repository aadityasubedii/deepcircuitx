Module name: TERASIC_CLOCK_COUNT. 

Module specification: The TERASIC_CLOCK_COUNT module is designed for counting and managing external clock signals, CLK_1 and CLK_2, using the system clock (s_clk_in). This module is equipped to handle different operations based on input signals such as reading from and writing to internal registers, and counting the edges of external clocks. The input ports are s_clk_in (system clock input), s_reset_in (system reset), s_address_in (address selector for reading/writing), s_read_in (enables reading operations), s_write_in (enables writing operations), s_writedata_in (data to be written), CLK_1 and CLK_2 (external clocks to be counted). The sole output port, s_readdata_out, outputs the data from the internal registers depending on the read operations triggered. The important internal signals include counting_now (indicates active counting), cnt_down (holds and decrements the countdown value), clk1_cnt and clk2_cnt (count the clock edges of CLK_1 and CLK_2, respectively), and pre_counting_now and trigger_send (used for detecting state transitions and initializing counts). The Verilog code is structured into several blocks: reset and setup operations triggered by system reset or respective clocks; data I/O handling based on user commands for read and write operations; and edge detection for the external clocks, which increments the edge counters during counting periods. Each block serves a specific purpose, ensuring the module operates correctly for its intended counting and data handling functionalities.
