Parameters such as address width, data width, number of inputs, and number of outputs are configurable. The module uses various registers to handle settings such as master enable (`master_enable`) and output switch (`output_switch`). It processes read and write operations from the Avalon interface, where writes to specific addresses modify the internal control states, and reads from these addresses retrieve the state of control bits. The module also handles synchronization signals, using them to update the output selectors (`select`) based on the synchronized configuration stored in `output_control`. There is also a global synchronization check that affects some internal operations and an enable signal that is derived from the control bits. In essence, this module acts as a switch controller, managing output routing and enabling based on the provided input commands and synchronization status."

This is used internally to generate a global synchronization signal that can affect output control state.\n\n**Output ports**: `av_readdata`, `enable`, `select`.\n**Explanation**:\n- `av_readdata`: Data output that holds information read from the module based on `av_address` when `av_read` is active. This can carry the state of internal control bits like `master_enable` or `output_switch`.\n- `enable`: Output signal derived from the internal states (`master_enable` and `output_switch`). This controls the general operational state of the module, enabling or disabling functionality.\n- `select`: This is an array of output selector bits that manage routing from inputs to outputs. The values are determined by internal configurations and are influenced by the synchronization status (`synced` signals).\n\nThis well-defined input and output structure allows the module to interact dynamically with external commands while managing internal configurations for data routing and module control."
