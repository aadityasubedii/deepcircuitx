It is designed to accept serialized data along with control signals (start and end of packet indicators), buffer the incoming data across multiple stages, and synchronize output data controlled by readiness signals from a downstream module. The module implements dual-edge triggering on the rising edge of a clock or a global reset for state management and data flow control. By utilizing internal buffer registers and ready signals, it ensures reliable data forwarding whilst verifying the readiness of subsequent components to receive the data. Output is managed dynamically based on the readiness of subsequent processing stages, ensuring smooth data transfer in situations with varied processing speeds or varying data arrival rates."

Explanation: A synchronous reset signal that initializes all internal registers to their default state, ensuring the system starts from a known condition after being reset.\n- `clk`: Clock signal. Explanation: The primary clock signal for the module, used to drive the synchronous logic for data processing and state transitions.\n- `din_valid`: Data input valid. Explanation: Indicates the validity of data on the `din_data` port. When high, it signifies that valid data is present.\n- `din_data`: Data input. Explanation: Carries the serial input data that is to be buffered and processed. The width of this port is dynamic, defined by the `DATA_WIDTH` parameter.\n- `din_sop`: Start of packet. Explanation: A signal that indicates the beginning of a data packet at the `din_data` input.\n- `din_eop`: End of packet. Explanation: A signal that indicates the end of a data packet at the `din_data` input.\n- `int_ready`: Interface ready. Explanation: Signifies the readiness of the downstream component or next stage in processing to accept data. It helps in synchronizing the data flow and avoiding data loss.\n\nOutput ports: \n- `din_ready`: Data input ready. Explanation: An output signal that indicates if the module is ready to accept new data. It is used for flow control, ensuring that the sender does not transmit when the module cannot receive more data.\n- `int_valid`: Interface valid. Explanation: Indicates if the data being presented on the `int_data`, `int_sop`, and `int_eop` ports are valid. Used to control data flow to downstream modules.\n- `int_data`: Interface data. Explanation: Output data port carrying the processed data stream towards the next stage or module.\n- `int_sop`: Interface start of packet. Explanation: Indicates the beginning of a data packet on the output side.\n- `int_eop`: Interface end of packet. Explanation: Marks the end of a data packet on the output, coordinating packet-based data handling in subsequent stages.\n\nThese ports facilitate structured and controlled data transfer, ensuring synchronized operations between module interactions in a digital system or processing pipeline.\n"
