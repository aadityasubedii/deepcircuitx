Module name: alt_vipcti130_common_fifo. 
Module specification: The `alt_vipcti130_common_fifo` is a Verilog module designed to implement a configurable FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer that manages data flow either within the same clock domain or across different clock domains. The module accommodates variable data widths and depths and supports both single-clock and dual-clock FIFO configurations through the parameter `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME`. Input ports include `wrclk` (write clock), `rdreq` (read request), `aclr` (asynchronous clear), `rdclk` (read clock), `wrreq` (write request), and `data` (data to be stored). Output ports consist of `rdusedw` (read words used), `rdempty` (read empty indicator), `wrusedw` (write words used), `wrfull` (write full indicator), and `q` (output data). The module employs an internal signal `input_fifo`, which serves as the FIFO buffer, configurable as either `scfifo` or `dcfifo` based on the clock configuration. The module features blocks for FIFO configuration which include parameter settings for FIFO type, data width, depth, and operational hints aimed at performance maximization. Depending on the `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME` value, appropriate FIFO architecture (single or dual-clock) is instantiated and configured, with special parameters tailored for each type's optimal functionality.
