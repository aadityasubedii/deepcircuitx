Module-level comment: The `alt_vipcti130_common_frame_counter` module serves as a video frame and line counter, managing the counting of horizontal and vertical pixels within a video stream. It utilizes `rst`, `clk`, `sclr`, `enable`, and other signals to control counters. A submodule, `alt_vipcti130_common_sample_counter`, assists in managing detailed sample counting. The internal logic adjusts count bounds based on parameters, and processes synchronous resets and clock-triggered updates to maintain and reset counts accurately during video processing.
