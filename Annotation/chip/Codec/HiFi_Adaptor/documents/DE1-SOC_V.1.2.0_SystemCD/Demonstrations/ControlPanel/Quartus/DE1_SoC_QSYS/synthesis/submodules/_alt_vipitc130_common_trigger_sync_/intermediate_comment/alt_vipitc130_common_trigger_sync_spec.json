    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipitc130_common_trigger_sync. Module specification: The 'alt_vipitc130_common_trigger_sync' module is designed to synchronize a trigger signal (`trigger_in`) across different clock domains using `input_clock` and `sync_clock`. This process helps in handling the metastability caused by clock domain differences. The module has parameters to handle the scenarios where clocks are the same, using the `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME` parameter. When clocks differ, it deploys a toggle mechanism and synchronization blocks to manage signal changes across the clock domains effectively. The input ports include `input_rst` (asynchronous reset for input domain), `input_clock` (captures `trigger_in`), `rst` (asynchronous reset for synchronization domain), `sync_clock` (manages synchronization), `trigger_in` (trigger signal to be synchronized), and `ack_in` (acknowledgement of signal change). The output of the module is `trigger_out`, which represents the synchronized trigger signal in the `sync_clock` domain. Internally, the module uses `trigger_in_reg` to store the trigger signal, `toggle` as a change indicator signal, and `toggle_synched` to bring the `toggle` into the synchronization domain. It employs `alt_vipitc130_common_sync` for robust synchronization and `toggle_synched_reg` for output generation stability. The synchronization process involves catching the `trigger_in` on the `input_clock`, detecting changes using a toggle mechanism which fold in acknowledgment via `ack_in`, synchronizing the toggle, and finally stabilizing the output signal to prevent glitches ensuring reliable operation across the intended clock domains.",

The core functionality is to ensure that the trigger signal is carried over safely from one clock domain to another, handling the metastability that can occur due to the differences in clock domains.
