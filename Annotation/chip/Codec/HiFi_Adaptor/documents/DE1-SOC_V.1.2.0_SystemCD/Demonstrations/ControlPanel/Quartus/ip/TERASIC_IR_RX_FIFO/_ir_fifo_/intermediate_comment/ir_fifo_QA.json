This module specifically uses an instance of the \"dcfifo\" component tailored for the Cyclone V device family. The FIFO handles input data, synchronizing and queuing it to be read under different clock domains to prevent data loss or corruption. It also provides status signals such as \"wrfull\" to indicate when the FIFO is full, \"rdempty\" to indicate when the FIFO is empty, and \"rdusedw\" to show how many words are used within the FIFO currently, aiding in effective data management between producer and consumer tasks operating at disparate frequencies."
