The module counts the horizontal (h_count) and vertical (v_count) positions in a video frame based on the provided total counts (h_total and v_total) and control signals (enable, sclr, hd_sdn). It features parameters for adjusting behavior based on color plane configurations and the presence of parallel color plane information. The module also interacts with a sample counter submodule (alt_vipitc130_common_sample_counter) to determine when to increment the counts and to issue flags such as 'new_line' and 'start_of_sample' based on the current pixel/sample processing position. This is part of a larger system likely used in video image transport and control applications. The proper functioning of counts and resets makes it adaptable for different frame rates and resolutions by receiving dynamic signals for each video frame dynamically processed."
