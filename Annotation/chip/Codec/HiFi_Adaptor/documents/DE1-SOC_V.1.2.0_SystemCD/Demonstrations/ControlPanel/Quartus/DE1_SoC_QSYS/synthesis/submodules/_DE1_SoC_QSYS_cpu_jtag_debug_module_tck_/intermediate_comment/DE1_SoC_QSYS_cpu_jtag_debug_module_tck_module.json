    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_tck is designed for JTAG debugging of a CPU, managing data registers and breakpoints based on JTAG protocols. It synchronizes input signals like `debugack` and `monitor_ready` using the JTAG clock (`tck`) and adjusts internal scan register (`sr`) dynamics based on input commands (`ir_in`). This module also serially outputs processed data (`tdo`) and uses various signal synchronizers to ensure stable operation within the CPU debugging framework."
