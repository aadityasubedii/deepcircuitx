This block extracts a specific segment of data from a larger register array and assigns it to the `vid_packet_words_bank1_bits_FROM_slave_TO_controller` signal. Specifically, it calculates the starting index using the constant `SLAVE_DATA_REQUIREDWIDTH` multiplied by 9, and the ending index by adding the width (`SLAVE_DATA_REQUIREDWIDTH`) and subtracting one. This ensures that exactly one width of data is selected from the array `registers` starting from a calculated offset.
