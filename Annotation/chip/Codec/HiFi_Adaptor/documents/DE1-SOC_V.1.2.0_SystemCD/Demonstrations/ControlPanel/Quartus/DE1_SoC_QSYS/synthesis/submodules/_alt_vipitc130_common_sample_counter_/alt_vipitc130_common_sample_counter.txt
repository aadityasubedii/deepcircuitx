Module-level comment: The `alt_vipitc130_common_sample_counter` module manages sample counting for video processing with configurable support for color planes. It uses inputs like reset (`rst`), clock (`clk`), and conditional signals to manage outputs indicating the sample status. For single color plane, outputs are constant, while for multiple planes, internal counters (`count_valids`) and conditions (`new_sample`) dynamically adjust the outputs based on cycle counts and transitions, adapting to changes signaled by `hd_sdn`. This module efficiently handles diverse video sampling needs through parameter-driven logic encapsulated in a generate block.
