    "spec": "Module name: hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc.\nModule specification: The `hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc` module is designed for clock management in an SDRAM system on an HPS platform, coordinating multiple clock signals with varying degrees of complexity. It accepts four input ports: `pll_hr_clk`, a high resolution PLL clock; `pll_dq_clk`, a data queue PLL clock; `pll_dqs_clk`, a data strobe PLL clock; and `dll_phy_delayctrl`, a signal providing delay control from a DLL. These inputs are used to manage various internally generated clock signals like `phy_clk_hr`, `phy_clk_dq`, and `phy_clk_dqs`, as well as to provide output clocks `afi_clk`, `avl_clk`, `adc_clk`, `adc_clk_cps`, and `hr_clk` essential for SDRAM operations. Internally, the module leverages a conditional structure controlled by the parameter `IS_HHP_HPS` to switch between direct signal assignment and using a clock buffer (`cyclonev_phy_clkbuf`) to derive the necessary internal clocks. Clocks are further manipulated through components like `cyclonev_leveling_delay_chain` for delay adjustments and `cyclonev_clk_phase_select` for phase selection, impacting how outputs such as `afi_clk` and `hr_clk` are generated. Conditional logic also handles inversion settings for `adc_clk` based on the `ADC_INVERT_PHASE` parameter setting. Each segment of the module is purposefully structured to optimize the clocking requirements specific to the operational demands of the embedded SDRAM system within the HPS platform.",

It takes in different PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) clock inputs which include `pll_hr_clk`, `pll_dq_clk`, and `pll_dqs_clk`. Within the module, depending on a parameter `IS_HHP_HPS`, it either directly assigns these PLL clock signals to various internal clock signals or uses a clock buffer  (`cyclonev_phy_clkbuf`) to generate them. Additionally, it uses components like `cyclonev_leveling_delay_chain` and `cyclonev_clk_phase_select` to manipulate delay and phase settings of these clocks to produce the required output clocks such as `afi_clk`, `avl_clk`, `adc_clk`, and `hr_clk`.

It is utilized to generate or buffer a high-resolution clock (`phy_clk_hr`) critical for the timing within the SDRAM system.\n- `pll_dq_clk`: This clock input is related to the data queue of the SDRAM. It is used for buffering or generating a clock signal (`phy_clk_dq`) intended for use with data handling in SDRAM.\n- `pll_dqs_clk`: This is a DQS (data strobe) clock input from a PLL. This clock is crucial for timing the data strobe actions in SDRAM and is used to generate or buffer the clock signal (`phy_clk_dqs`).\n- `dll_phy_delayctrl`: This input provides delay control for a DLL (Delay-Locked Loop), used in leveling delay chains to fine-tune the clocks being forwarded to SDRAM.\n\nOutput ports: `afi_clk`, `avl_clk`, `adc_clk`, `adc_clk_cps`, `hr_clk`.\nExplanation:\n- `afi_clk`: This output clock is derived from `phy_clk_dqs` after it is passed through a leveling delay chain.

It serves precise adjustment needs in the address/command domain.\n- `adc_clk_cps`: Generated by selecting phases from `leveled_dqs_clocks` using `cyclonev_clk_phase_select`, this clock is critical for commands and addresses in the SDRAM, providing specific phase alignment as per the module settings.\n- `hr_clk`: A sequence-controlled clock generated and output for potentially wide-ranging uses within the SDRAM system, ensuring timely sequencing as dictated by requirements.

They contribute to the creation of `afi_clk` and can be used conditionally to generate `adc_clk`.\n- `leveled_hr_clocks`: Result from passing `phy_clk_hr` through another leveling delay chain (`cyclonev_leveling_delay_chain_hr`).

Clocks are further manipulated through components like `cyclonev_leveling_delay_chain` for delay adjustments and `cyclonev_clk_phase_select` for phase selection, impacting how outputs such as `afi_clk` and `hr_clk` are generated. Conditional logic also handles inversion settings for `adc_clk` based on the `ADC_INVERT_PHASE` parameter setting. Each segment of the module is purposefully structured to optimize the clocking requirements specific to the operational demands of the embedded SDRAM system within the HPS platform."
