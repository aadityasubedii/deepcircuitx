Module name: CLOCK_COUNTER. Module specification: The CLOCK_COUNTER is a Verilog module intended to function as a 32-bit up-counter utilizing the LPM_COUNTER component from a library of parameterized modules (LPM). This module increments its count on every clock cycle when enabled by the `clk_en` signal, and the counting resets immediately whenever the `aclr` (asynchronous clear) signal is asserted. The primary input ports include `aclr` for asynchronously resetting the counter to zero, `clk_en` for enabling the count operation upon clock pulses, and `clock` which is the primary driving clock signal. The module's output is a 32-bit signal `q`, representing the current count value. Internally, the `sub_wire0` wire captures the count from the LPM_COUNTER component before forwarding it to the output `q`, essentially serving as a conduit for the count value. The configuration parameters of the LPM_COUNTER component enforce that the counter operates in an "UP" mode only, with various counter controls like `aload`, `aset`, and `updown` set to complement this counting mode. This module effectively provides a simple, parameterizable up-counting mechanism suited for numerous applications requiring counting capabilities synchronized with a clock signal.
