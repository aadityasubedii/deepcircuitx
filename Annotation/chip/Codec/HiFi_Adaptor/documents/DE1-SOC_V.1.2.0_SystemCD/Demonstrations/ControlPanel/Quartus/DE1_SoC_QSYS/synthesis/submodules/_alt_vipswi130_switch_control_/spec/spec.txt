Module name: alt_vipswi130_switch_control. 
Module specification: The `alt_vipswi130_switch_control` is a Verilog module designed to control input and output routing based on commands received over an Avalon interface, with provisions for synchronization. The module features parameterized address and data widths, and configurable numbers of inputs, outputs, and synchronization signals. The primary input ports include `rst` (reset), `clk` (clock), `av_address` (Avalon interface address), `av_read` and `av_write` (read and write enables), `av_writedata` (data for writing operations), and `synced` (synchronization signals array). The output ports are `av_readdata` (data output for state information), `enable` (operational state control), and `select` (output selector bits). Internal signals such as `master_enable`, `output_switch`, `output_control`, and `global_synced` manage the enabling of output, toggle specific output state, control routing from inputs to outputs, and compute global synchronization, respectively. The code is structured into multiple sections, including initialization under reset conditions, handling Avalon interface writes to update internal configurations, handling reads to provide state information, and synchronization logic to update routing configurations controlled by `output_control`. The combination of these elements allows the module to function as a dynamic switch controller within a hardware system, managing data flow based on external control inputs and synchronization status.
