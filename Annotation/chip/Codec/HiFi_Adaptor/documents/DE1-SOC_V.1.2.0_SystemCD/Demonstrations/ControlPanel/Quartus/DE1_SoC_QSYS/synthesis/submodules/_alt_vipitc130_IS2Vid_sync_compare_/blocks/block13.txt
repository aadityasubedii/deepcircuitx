Comment: 
This block generates an internal start-of-frame (SOF) signal for the CVO interface. It achieves this by performing a bitwise AND operation between the current SOF signal (sof_cvo) and the inverse of the previous SOF signal (sof_cvo_reg), effectively detecting the rising edge of the SOF signal and creating a single-cycle pulse for frame synchronization.
