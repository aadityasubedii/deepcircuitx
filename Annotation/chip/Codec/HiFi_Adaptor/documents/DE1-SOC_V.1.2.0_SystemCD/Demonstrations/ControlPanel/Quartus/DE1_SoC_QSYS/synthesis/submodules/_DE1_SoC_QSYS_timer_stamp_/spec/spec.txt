Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_timer_stamp. 
Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_timer_stamp module operates as a configurable timer suitable for FPGA or SoC environments, aimed at controlling timing events and generating interrupts. It accepts inputs through address, chipselect, clk, reset_n, write_n, and writedata. These inputs facilitate internal register selection, module activation, clock synchronization, module resetting, write operations, and data inputting respectively. The module outputs an interrupt request (irq) and the data read from internal registers (readdata). Critical internal signals include the internal_counter used for the countdown process, various strobes such as control_wr_strobe indicating a write to the control register, and status indicators like timeout_occurred signifying the occurrence of a timeout. Blocks within the code handle counter operations, interrupt handling, data reading, and control including start and stop functions of the timer. The timer can be set for either continuous operation or a single-time run, determined by the control_continuous signal. Each segment of the code is thoroughly labeled and performs dedicated tasks such as counter decrementing, status resetting, and output managing to ensure robust module functionality.
