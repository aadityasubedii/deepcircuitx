    "block_comment": "This block selects a counting method based on the status of `hd_sdn`. When `hd_sdn` is high, it directly assigns `count_cycle` to `count_sample`. However, if `hd_sdn` is low, it assigns the bitwise AND of `count_cycle` and `new_sample` to `count_sample`, combining these conditions to determine the final count value."
