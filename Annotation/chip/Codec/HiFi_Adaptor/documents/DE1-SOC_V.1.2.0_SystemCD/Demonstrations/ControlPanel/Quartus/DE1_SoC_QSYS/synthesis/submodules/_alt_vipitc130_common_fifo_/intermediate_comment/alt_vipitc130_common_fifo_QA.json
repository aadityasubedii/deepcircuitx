The module can support different configurations based on whether the write and read clock signals are the same or not. It provides interfaces to write data into and read data from the FIFO. The FIFO's depth and data width are parameterized. It also has outputs that indicate the number of used words in the FIFO and whether the FIFO is empty or full. Based on the `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME` parameter, it uses either a single-clock FIFO (scfifo) or a dual-clock FIFO (dcfifo)."
