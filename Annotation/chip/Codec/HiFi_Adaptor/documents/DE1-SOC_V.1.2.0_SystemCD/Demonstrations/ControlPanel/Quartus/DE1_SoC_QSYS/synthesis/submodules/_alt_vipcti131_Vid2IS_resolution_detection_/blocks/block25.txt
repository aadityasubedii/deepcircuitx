This block determines if a video resolution configuration is valid. It achieves this by performing a bitwise AND operation on flags that indicate the validity of the next frame's sample and line counts for both fields, as well as checking if interlaced resolution is valid. The block also handles non-interlaced video by including a conditional check that disregards the second field counts if interlacing is not used.
