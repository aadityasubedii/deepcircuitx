    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'alt_vipswi130_common_stream_output' manages synchronized data streaming with attention to packet boundaries. It interfaces through inputs like data validity, packet start/end markers, and a data ready signal, and outputs processed data with its own packet markers. Internally, the module leverages registers and combinational logic to handle state transitions, maintain synchronization, and ensure data integrity between input and output streams, driven by system clocks and reset conditions."
