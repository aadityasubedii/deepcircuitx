Comment: 
This function calculates the ceiling of the logarithm base 2 of an input value. It initializes a return integer ‘alt_clogb2’ to 32 and iteratively checks from 31 downwards to find the highest value 'i' such that 2 raised to 'i' is greater than or equal to the input 'value'. If such 'i' is found, 'alt_clogb2' is updated to this 'i'.
