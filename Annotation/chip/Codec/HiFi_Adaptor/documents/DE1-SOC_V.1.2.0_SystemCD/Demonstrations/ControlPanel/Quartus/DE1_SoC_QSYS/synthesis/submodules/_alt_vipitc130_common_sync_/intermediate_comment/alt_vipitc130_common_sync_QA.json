It handles the potential metastability issues through a two-stage flip-flop synchronization scheme if the input and output are not clocked by the same signal (CLOCK_ARE_SAME = 0). The module accepts a parameterized input `data_in` and outputs a synchronized version `data_out` across potentially different clock domains. If the input and output clocks are the same, it directly assigns the input to the output. If not, it uses a generate block to construct synchronization logic where `data_in` gets synchronized through intermediate registers `data_out_sync0` and `data_out_sync1` with the `sync_clock`, thus safely transferring the data between different clock domains. Additional FPGA-specific attributes are set for the registers to ensure correct handling by synthesis tools regarding their treatment as synchronizers and to ignore timing checks between these registers."

It's crucial for setting up a stable initial state and resolving any potential issues from power-up or undesired mid-operation states.  \n- sync_clock: This is the clock input with respect to which `data_in` will be synchronized when the clocks are not the same (CLOCK_ARE_SAME = 0). It can be a different clock domain than the one `data_in` originates from, and it controls the timing of the synchronization stages within the module.  \n- data_in: This is the multi-bit input data signal that needs to be synchronized to the `sync_clock` domain if the input and output clocks are different. Its width is parameterized by the `WIDTH` parameter, allowing for flexibility in data size.\n\nOutput ports: data_out.  \nExplanation:  \n- data_out: This is the multi-bit output data signal that has been synchronized to the `sync_clock` clock domain if the input and output clocks are different, or directly forwarded from `data_in` if they are the same. The width of `data_out` is also determined by the `WIDTH` parameter and matches the width of `data_in`. This output ensures that data passes safely between different timing domains, reducing the risk of metastability issues."

It captures `data_in` at the rising edge of `sync_clock` when the input and output clocks are not the same (CLOCK_ARE_SAME = 0). This register helps reduce the possibility of metastability by providing a buffer stage before the data reaches the final output.  \n- data_out_sync1: This is the second and final synchronization stage register.
