    "module": "Module-level comment: The `AUDIO_ADC` module interfaces with an ADC to receive and store digital audio data into a FIFO buffer, managing data for left and right audio channels. It processes serial input (`adcdat`) on the `bclk` edge, toggles channels with `adclrc`, and aligns data using internal registers and flags. Data is written to the FIFO unless full, with operations controlled by `reset`, `clear`, and `read` signals. The module incorporates sequential logic for synchronization and data integrity, ensuring efficient audio data handling."
