Module-level comment: This module performs video synchronization comparison for genlock functionality. It compares input (CVI) and output (CVO) video signals, tracking start-of-frame, line, and sample counts. Using a state machine and counters, it calculates synchronization adjustments, manages different states based on incoming signals, and generates control signals to add or remove lines and samples for achieving synchronization. The module also outputs genlock status and reset values for horizontal and vertical synchronization comparisons.
