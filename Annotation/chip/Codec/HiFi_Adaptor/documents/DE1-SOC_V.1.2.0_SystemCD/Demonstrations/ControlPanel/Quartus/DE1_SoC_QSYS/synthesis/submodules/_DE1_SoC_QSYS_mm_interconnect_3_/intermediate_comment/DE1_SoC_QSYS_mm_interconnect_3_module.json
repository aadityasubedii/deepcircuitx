    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_mm_interconnect_3 module facilitates memory-mapped communications between a master module and a slave SPI control interface. It handles synchronization using clocks and resets, and manages data flow with translators that bridge different address and data formats, ensuring proper data transmission and signal integrity in transactions. Input/output ports manage signals for addressing, data transfers, and control, with internal signals coordinating handshaking and data validity between master and slave interfaces."
