This block of code handles byte masking for a memory operation. It decides between data from memory or zero-stored data based on the mask bit. If the least significant mask bit `dqm[0]` is set, it selects and assigns the byte from `mem_bytes[7 : 0]` to `rmw_temp[7 : 0]`; otherwise, it assigns `zs_dq[7 : 0]` to `rmw_temp[7 : 0]`. This conditional assignment is used for read-modify-write operations in memory interfaces, allowing selective data modification.
