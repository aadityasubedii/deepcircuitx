    "spec": "Module name: altera_dcfifo_synchronizer_bundle. \n\nModule specification: The altera_dcfifo_synchronizer_bundle module is designed for synchronizing individual bits of a data signal (din) across different clock domains from an input to an output while using a set of internal instances of altera_std_synchronizer components, ensuring each bit is safely and stably transferred. To mitigate potential metastability issues often encountered in digital circuits due to multi-clock domain interfacing, this module inputs data through the `din` port (which is a parameterizable vector with width defined by the WIDTH parameter) and employs a generate block to instantiate a synchronizer for each bit based off a template (altera_std_synchronizer). Each of these synchronizers is driven by the same clock (`clk`) input and utilizes the active-low reset signal (`reset_n`) to reset the internal states during initialization or under error conditions. The processed, synchronized data appears on the `dout` output which mirrors the width of the `din`. Internally, this module does not define its signals but rather leverages direct connections and parameter-passing into each synchronizer instance within the generate-loop which iterates based on the WIDTH parameter to create each required synchronizer instance, one per bit of the `din` array, directly connecting input bits to their corresponding output bits through these synchronizers. As reflected in the Verilog code, a `genvar` named `i` is used to control this iteration in the generate block, which forms the crucial part of this module laying out the instantiation pattern for needed synchronizers based on the defined depth (DEPTH parameter).",
