    "block_comment": "This block of code assigns the value of `read_data` to `s_readdata`. Essentially, it functions as a data forwarding mechanism, ensuring that the data being read is passed onwards through the signal `s_readdata`. This is typically used to facilitate data flow in designs where data read from one module needs to be accessible in another module, simplifying connectivity and enhancing modularity."
