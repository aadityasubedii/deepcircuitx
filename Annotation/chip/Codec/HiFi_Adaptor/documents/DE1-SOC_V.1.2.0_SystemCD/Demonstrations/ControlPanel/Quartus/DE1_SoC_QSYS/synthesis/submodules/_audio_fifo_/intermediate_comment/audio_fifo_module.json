    "module": "Module-level comment: The `audio_fifo` module implements a dual-clock FIFO buffer for audio data handling, utilizing a `dcfifo_component`for asynchronous read/write operations across different clock domains. It interfaces with 32-bit audio streams, managed by separate clocks for reading and writing. `aclr`, `rdclk`, `wrclk` control reset, read, and write operations, while `rdreq` and `wrreq` manage data transactions. Internal wire signals connect component outputs to module ports, ensuring data and status signal integrity. Configuration parameters are optimized for Cyclone IV E FPGA."
