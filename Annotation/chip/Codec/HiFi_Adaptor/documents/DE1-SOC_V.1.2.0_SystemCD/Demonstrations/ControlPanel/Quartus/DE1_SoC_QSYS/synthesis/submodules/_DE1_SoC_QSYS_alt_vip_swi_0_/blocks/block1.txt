Comment: 
This block acts as a multiplexer, routing data from two input interfaces to one output interface based on a selection signal. Depending on the values of the 2-bit signal `select`, the block assigns values from either `input_int_0` or `input_int_1` to `output_int_0`. When `select` is `2'd1`, data, validity, start of packet (SOP), and end of packet (EOP) from `input_int_0` are assigned to corresponding outputs, and `input_int_ready0` is set based on `output_int_ready0`, while `input_int_ready1` is deactivated. Conversely, for `select` `2'd2`, input parameters from `input_int_1` are mapped to the output, and the readiness flags are adjusted accordingly. If `select` is neither `2'd1` nor `2'd2`, all outputs are set to zero, indicating no valid data passes through, with both input interfaces marked as not ready.
