It accepts digital audio data, manages the timing and control signals necessary for DAC operation, and outputs the analog signal via a digital bit stream. The module includes components for receiving audio data in a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer and processes this data to generate a bit stream synchronized with the audio clock signals bclk and daclrc. The output bit stream is produced on the dacdat line, and the process ensures correct timing for left and right audio channels based on channel distinction provided by the daclrc signal. This module handles audio data synchronization and bit-stream generation for playback on the audio DAC hardware."
