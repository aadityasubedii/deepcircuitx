    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block configures video data synchronization based on conditional use of embedded syncs. If `USE_EMBEDDED_SYNCS` is set, the block assigns video data validity directly and uses a sync extractor module to process incoming video signals including format detection and synchronization, employing parameters like data width and bits per sample. Otherwise, it conditionally sets video enable and uses sync polarity converters for horizontal and vertical sync signals, directly passing other signals through. This ensures adaptable interfacing with different video processing paths based on the configuration."
