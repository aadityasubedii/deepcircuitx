    "module": "Module-level comment: The credit_producer module manages credit accounting in data systems by tracking symbol and packet credits essential for data transmission control. It processes inputs (clock, reset, data validation, readiness, end-of-packet signals) to output symbol and packet credits. The module uses internal logic with conditional structures (based on parameters like SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT) to compute credits either directly per beat or via running counts and rollovers, enhancing the control over data flow and resource management in high-throughput environments."
