    "module": "Module-level comment: The TERASIC_LOOPBACK module performs dynamic loopback testing for signal integrity using configurable inversion and direction options. It employs `clk` for timing, `reset_n` for state initialization, and processes reads/writes signaled by `s_read`/`s_write`. Signals are manipulated and compared through `test_mask`, `test_in`, `test_out`, with errors logged via `lb_error`. Block-wise, the code alternates setup and control under clock edges and tests signals and error conditions through mask shifts and conditional checks."
