Comment: 
This Verilog block generates an interrupt request (irq) signal. It does this by performing a bitwise AND operation between 'edge_capture' and 'irq_mask', then takes the OR reduction of the resulting vector to produce a single-bit output, 'irq'. This single-bit output indicates if any interrupts, as defined by edge events captured in 'edge_capture' and permitted by 'irq_mask', have occurred.
