    "module": "Module-level comment: The `alt_vipvfr131_vfr_controller` module handles the control of video frame reading operations. It employs a finite state machine (FSM) for sequenced processing of video data across two selectable data banks. The module accepts inputs to start processing, select the data bank, and set video packet parameters, using internal states to manage reading addresses, samples, and words. Outputs indicate ongoing operation, frame completion, and provide next video packet details. Internal and output signals are dynamically managed based on state transitions triggered by external and internal conditions."
