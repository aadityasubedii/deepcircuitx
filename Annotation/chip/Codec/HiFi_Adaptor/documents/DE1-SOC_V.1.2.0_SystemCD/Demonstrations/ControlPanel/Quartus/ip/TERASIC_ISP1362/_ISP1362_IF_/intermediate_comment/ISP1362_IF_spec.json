Module specification: The ISP1362_IF module serves as an interface to manage data transfer, control signals, and interrupts between host and device controllers (HC and DC) and a USB. It comprises bidirectional data ports, address ports, read, write, chip select, and reset controls, as well as clock inputs and interrupt signals for both host and device controllers. The module specifically handles inout for the USB_DATA, a 16-bit bidirectional bus, and directs it either to the host or device controller based on the active chip select signal. The internal signals include USB_DATA for data handling, USB_ADDR for addressing, USB_RD_N, USB_WR_N for read and write controls, USB_CS_N for chip select, USB_RST_N for resets, and output data signals avs_hc_readdata_oDATA and avs_dc_readdata_oDATA for host and device controllers. The code logic assigns the USB bus based on which controller is selected and whether the operation is a read or write. It also routes interrupts from the USB to the appropriate controller. Overall, the module ensures efficient data handling, proper addressing, and synchronization between two types of controllers and the USB interface.",

It can either carry data from controllers to USB during a write operation or from USB to controllers during a read operation, based on control signals.\n2. **USB_ADDR**: This 2-bit output signal specifies the address space within the USB where data is either read from or written to. It is determined by which controller (host or device) has the active chip select.\n3. **USB_RD_N**: Read control signal for USB. It instructs the USB interface whether to set the USB_DATA bus in a state where data can be read by the controllers.\n4. **USB_WR_N**: Write control signal for USB. It commands the USB interface to accept data from the USB_DATA bus when a controller writes data.\n5. **USB_CS_N**: Chip select control for USB. This active low signal enables the USB interface when either the host or device controller is interfacing with the USB.\n6. **USB_RST_N**: Reset signal to USB. This initiates a hardware reset in the USB interface, controlled by the reset states of either the host or device controller, depending on their active selection.\n7. **avs_hc_readdata_oDATA**: This is a 16-bit output data bus for the host controller.

Module specification: The ISP1362_IF module serves as an interface to manage data transfer, control signals, and interrupts between host and device controllers (HC and DC) and a USB. It comprises bidirectional data ports, address ports, read, write, chip select, and reset controls, as well as clock inputs and interrupt signals for both host and device controllers. The module specifically handles inout for the USB_DATA, a 16-bit bidirectional bus, and directs it either to the host or device controller based on the active chip select signal. The internal signals include USB_DATA for data handling, USB_ADDR for addressing, USB_RD_N, USB_WR_N for read and write controls, USB_CS_N for chip select, USB_RST_N for resets, and output data signals avs_hc_readdata_oDATA and avs_dc_readdata_oDATA for host and device controllers. The code logic assigns the USB bus based on which controller is selected and whether the operation is a read or write. It also routes interrupts from the USB to the appropriate controller. Overall, the module ensures efficient data handling, proper addressing, and synchronization between two types of controllers and the USB interface."
