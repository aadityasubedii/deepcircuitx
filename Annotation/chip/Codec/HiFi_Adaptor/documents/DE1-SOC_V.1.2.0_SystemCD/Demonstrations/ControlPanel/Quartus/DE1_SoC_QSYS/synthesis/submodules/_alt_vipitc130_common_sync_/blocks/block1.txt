This block assigns the value of `data_out_sync1` to `data_out`. This is typically used in digital circuits for data synchronization purposes, ensuring that `data_out` reflects a stable version of the input data after passing through synchronization stages, with `data_out_sync1` likely being an intermediate synchronized signal.
