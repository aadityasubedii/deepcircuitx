    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block performs data reordering for bit-wise manipulations. It remaps a one-dimensional binary array `binary_values` into another array `binary_values_by_bit`, arranging bits based on mode settings and positions. The reordering is determined through calculated index values which use `binary_pos` to select the bit position and `one_hot_pos` combined with `NO_OF_MODES` to distribute the bit across different modes based on `LOG2_NO_OF_MODES`, ensuring that bits are aligned correctly for further processing."
