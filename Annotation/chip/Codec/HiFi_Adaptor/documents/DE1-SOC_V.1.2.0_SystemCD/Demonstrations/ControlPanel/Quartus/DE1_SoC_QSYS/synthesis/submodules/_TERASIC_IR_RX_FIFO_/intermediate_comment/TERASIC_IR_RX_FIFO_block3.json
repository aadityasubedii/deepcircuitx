    "block_comment": "This Verilog block controls a write enable signal based on data readiness and reset conditions. On a negative reset, the `write` signal is set to 0, disabling write operations. When there is a transition from data not being ready to ready (`pre_data_ready` to `data_ready`), the `write` is enabled by setting it to 1. If the `write` signal is already high, it's reset to 0 in the subsequent cycles to prepare for the next potential write operation. The control logic operates synchronously with the system clock (`clk`)."
