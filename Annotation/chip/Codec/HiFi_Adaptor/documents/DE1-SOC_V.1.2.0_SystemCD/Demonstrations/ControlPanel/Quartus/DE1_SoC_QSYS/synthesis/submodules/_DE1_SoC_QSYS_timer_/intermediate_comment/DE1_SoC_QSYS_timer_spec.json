    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_timer. \nModule specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_timer is a Verilog module designed to act as a configurable timer/counter suited for embedded systems, featuring control over its starting, stopping, and reset functionalities through external commands. Its inputs include a 3-bit `address` to select internal registers, `chipselect` to enable read or write operations, `clk` as the clock signal, `reset_n` as an active-low reset signal, `write_n` as an active-low write enable, and a 16-bit `writedata` for data to internal registers. Outputs consist of a 16-bit `readdata` bus to output data based on input address and `irq` for interrupt requests on timeout events. Critical internal signals include `control_continuous` and `control_interrupt_enable` derived from the control register, `counter_is_zero` to detect when the counter hits zero, `counter_load_value` indicating the load value for the timer, and `timeout_event` signaling occurrence of a timeout. The internals also manage several strobes like `period_h_wr_strobe` and `snap_h_wr_strobe` for writing operations. Additionally, the module divides its functionality into blocks that manage reading and writing to registers, counter operation and timeout management, and handling start/stop requests. These blocks use a combination of assignment statements and always blocks, reacting to the positive edge of the clock or negative edge of the reset, to ensure the counter's correct operation in regard to its setup configuration and dynamic control inputs during runtime.\n",

It features programmable start, stop, and reset functionalities, allowing for fine control over counting operations. The timer can be set to run continuously or to generate interrupts on timeout events, supporting both simple elapsed time tracking and more complex event-driven behaviors. The timer operates on a 32-bit internal counter with separate registers for the high and low parts of the period value, which can be set and read through specified addresses. It also includes functionality for snapshotting the current value of the timer, which can be read back and used, for example, to measure exact intervals or monitor timer status without stopping the counter. The module outputs an interrupt (IRQ) signal when a timeout occurs, if interrupts are enabled. The timer is versatile, designed for generic use across various applications that require precise timing and scheduling capabilities."

Its inputs include a 3-bit `address` to select internal registers, `chipselect` to enable read or write operations, `clk` as the clock signal, `reset_n` as an active-low reset signal, `write_n` as an active-low write enable, and a 16-bit `writedata` for data to internal registers. Outputs consist of a 16-bit `readdata` bus to output data based on input address and `irq` for interrupt requests on timeout events. Critical internal signals include `control_continuous` and `control_interrupt_enable` derived from the control register, `counter_is_zero` to detect when the counter hits zero, `counter_load_value` indicating the load value for the timer, and `timeout_event` signaling occurrence of a timeout. The internals also manage several strobes like `period_h_wr_strobe` and `snap_h_wr_strobe` for writing operations. Additionally, the module divides its functionality into blocks that manage reading and writing to registers, counter operation and timeout management, and handling start/stop requests. These blocks use a combination of assignment statements and always blocks, reacting to the positive edge of the clock or negative edge of the reset, to ensure the counter's correct operation in regard to its setup configuration and dynamic control inputs during runtime.\n"
