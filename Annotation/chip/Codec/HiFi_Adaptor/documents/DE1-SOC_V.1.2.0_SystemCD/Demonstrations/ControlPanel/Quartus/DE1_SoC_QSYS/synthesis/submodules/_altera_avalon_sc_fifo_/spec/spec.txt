Module name: altera_avalon_sc_fifo. Module specification: This module implements a parameterizable single-clock FIFO buffer designed for data streaming with optional packet support. It features configurable data widths, FIFO depths, and additional functionalities such as error handling and multi-channel data support. The module uses either memory blocks or shift registers for storage based on parameter settings. Key inputs include clk (clock), reset, in_data (input data), in_valid (data validity flag), and various packet-related signals. Outputs include out_data (output data), out_valid (output validity flag), and corresponding packet signals. Internal signals manage FIFO operations, such as mem (data storage), wr_ptr and rd_ptr (write and read pointers), and fill_level (FIFO occupancy). The module implements full and empty state control, read and write operations, and optional features like store-
