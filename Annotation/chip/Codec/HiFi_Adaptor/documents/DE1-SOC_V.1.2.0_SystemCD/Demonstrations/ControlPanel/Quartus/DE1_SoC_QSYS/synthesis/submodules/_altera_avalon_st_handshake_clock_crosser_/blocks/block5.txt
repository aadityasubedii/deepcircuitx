This block is responsible for assigning the output of the 'out_empty' signal. It does this by indexing into the 'out_payload' array from a calculated starting index to an ending index. These indices are derived from constants, namely DATA_WIDTH, PACKET_WIDTH, PCHANNEL_W, and EMPTY_WIDTH. Therefore, the 'out_empty' signal reflects a specific section of the 'out_payload' content.
