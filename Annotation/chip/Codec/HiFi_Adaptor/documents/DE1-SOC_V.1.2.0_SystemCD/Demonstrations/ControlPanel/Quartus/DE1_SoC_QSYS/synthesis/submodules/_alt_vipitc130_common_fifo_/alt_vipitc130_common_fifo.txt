Module-level comment: The alt_vipitc130_common_fifo module implements a configurable FIFO buffer supporting both single-clock and dual-clock operations. Its functionality is managed through parameters such as data width and FIFO depth, adapting for different synchronization scenarios. Depending on the CLOCKS_ARE_SAME parameter, it instantiates either scfifo for single-clock or dcfifo for dual-clock operation, optimizing data handling with sub-module configurations like buffer size and speed settings.
