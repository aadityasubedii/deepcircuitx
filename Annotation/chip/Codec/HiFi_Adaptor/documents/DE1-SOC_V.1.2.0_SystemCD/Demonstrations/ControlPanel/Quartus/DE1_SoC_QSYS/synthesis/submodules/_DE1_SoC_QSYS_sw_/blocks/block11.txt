This block manages the capturing of edge-triggered events. On a positive clock edge or negative reset, it conditionally resets or updates a capture register `edge_capture[1]`. If `reset_n` is low, indicating a reset condition, `edge_capture[1]` is set to 0. During normal operation (when `clk_en` is high), if an edge write strobe signal (`edge_capture_wr_strobe`) is active, `edge_capture[1]` is cleared; otherwise, if an edge detection signal (`edge_detect[1]`) is asserted, `edge_capture[1]` is set to -1, effectively capturing the detected edge.
