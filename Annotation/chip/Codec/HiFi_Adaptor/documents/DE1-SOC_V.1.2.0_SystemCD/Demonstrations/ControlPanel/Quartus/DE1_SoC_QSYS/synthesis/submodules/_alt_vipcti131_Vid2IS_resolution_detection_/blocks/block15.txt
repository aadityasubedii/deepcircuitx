Comment: 
This line of code defines a combinational logic signal that generates a reset condition for a sampling process. It assigns `reset_sample` a value based on a logical AND operation between the `update_active_sample` signal and the least significant bit of the `active_sample_count` binary counter. If both `update_active_sample` is high (asserted) and the least significant bit of `active_sample_count` is high, indicating an odd count, `reset_sample` is set high, otherwise, it remains low.
