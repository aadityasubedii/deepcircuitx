It works with embedded sync signals within the video data based on the parameters set for data width and bits per sample (BPS). The module handles different data path scenarios for standard definition (SD) and high definition (HD) based on the 'vid_hd_sdn' signal. It extracts and outputs additional video synchronization signals and validates video data and ancillary data, aiding in video signal processing operations typically used in video interface or transmission systems.\n"
