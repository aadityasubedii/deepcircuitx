    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipvfr131_common_stream_output. \n\nModule specification: The `alt_vipvfr131_common_stream_output` is a Verilog module designed to manage the output stream for video-like data packets. It processes incoming data streams by checking for data validity and packet start/end flags, aiming to synchronize and output the data when conditions are met and the downstream is ready to accept it. The input ports include `rst` (reset signal), `clk` (clock signal), `dout_ready` (downstream readiness signal), `int_valid` (validity of the incoming data), `int_data` (incoming data with width determined by `DATA_WIDTH`), `int_sop` (start of packet signal for incoming data), `int_eop` (end of packet signal for incoming data), and `enable` (enables data processing). The output ports consist of `dout_valid` (data output validity), `dout_data` (synchronized output data), `dout_sop` (start of packet for outgoing data), `dout_eop` (end of packet for outgoing data), `int_ready` (module readiness for new data), and `synced` (synchronization status). Internally, it uses signals like `image_packet, synced_int, enable_synced_reg` for managing state across clock cycles and `image_packet_nxt, synced_int_nxt, enable_synced` for next-state logic. The design incorporates two main blocks: one for managing states and synchronous transfer of data controlled by a clock and reset conditions, and another for output data validity and readiness determination, all while maintaining proper flow and synchronization. This module exemplifies structured handling of packet-based data in a synchronized, efficient manner.",

It accepts incoming data (int_data) along with signal flags indicating the start (int_sop) and end (int_eop) of a packet. The data stream is controlled based on an enable signal and synchronization conditions. The module outputs the data (dout_data) when it's valid (dout_valid) and the output is ready (dout_ready), handling the start (dout_sop) and end (dout_eop) of data packet flags. It ensures synchronization with an incoming stream based on internal logic that checks the end and start of packets and maintains a synchronized state (synced) for data handling efficiency."
