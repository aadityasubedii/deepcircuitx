    "spec": "Module name: TERASIC_CLOCK_COUNT. Module specification: The TERASIC_CLOCK_COUNT module is engineered to manage and count clock cycles from two external clock inputs, CLK_1 and CLK_2. It operates using an internal system clock (s_clk_in) and facilitates controlled counting based on specific commands. The input ports include s_clk_in (system clock), s_reset_in (reset signal), s_address_in (register address), s_read_in (read command), s_write_in (write command), s_writedata_in (input data for write operations), and the clock inputs CLK_1 and CLK_2. The output includes s_readdata_out, a 32-bit data port that conveys current counting status or cycle counts based on the read operations. Internally, the module employs several signals: counting_now (indicates active counting), cnt_down (countdown register), pre_counting_now (previous counting state), trigger_send (trigger for reset), and clk1_cnt/clk2_cnt (counters for CLK_1 and CLK_2). The code is structured into several blocks: a block handling the resetting, countdown and counting control based on user command (s_write_in); another for managing output data depending on read commands; and two more blocks, each responsible for counting cycles of CLK_1 and CLK_2, resetting counters whenever required. The entire functionality supports starting, stopping, and resetting counting processes, making it versatile for applications needing precise clock cycle tracking.",

It tracks the counts separately for each clock signal and provides an interface to read these counts. The module uses a central clock signal, s_clk_in, and includes functionality to start counting based on a command received (by writing a non-zero value to a specific address). The counting can be stopped by writing zero or reaching a countdown limit. The module also supports functionality to reset the counts and stop counting based on a reset signal or an internal trigger mechanism that reacts to state changes in the counting process. The output gives the status of whether it is currently counting and the counts of CLK_1 and CLK_2 cycles."
