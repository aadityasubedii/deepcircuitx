Module name: altera_reset_synchronizer. Module specification: The `altera_reset_synchronizer` module is a fundamental component used in FPGA designs to synchronize reset signals across different clock domains, ensuring they are stable and glitch-free. It features input ports `reset_in` (a reset signal that can be either asynchronous or synchronous, used to initiate the resetting of internal states) and `clk` (the clock signal used to synchronize the reset process). The output port `reset_out` delivers a synchronized reset signal suitable for use in downstream logic. Internally, the module utilizes a shift register array `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain`, which, depending on the `DEPTH` parameter, adjusts its size to manage multiple stages of reset synchronization. An additional internal signal, `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out`, captures the state of the first bit of the shift register to output a stable reset signal. The module operates in two modes determined by the `ASYNC_RESET` parameter: In asynchronous reset mode, managed by an `always` block sensitive to both `posedge clk` or `posedge reset_in`, the reset signal immediately sets the entire chain and its output to high upon `reset_in` assertion, and for clearing, zeroes are introduced and shifted through. In the synchronous reset mode, the `always` block, only sensitive to `posedge clk`, continuously shifts the state of `reset_in` into the chain, updating the output accordingly. Both configurations use `generate` constructs to control the behavioral logic based on the mode specified, thereby providing flexibility and robustness in handling various synchronization scenarios in FPGA applications.
