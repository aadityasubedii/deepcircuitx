    "block_comment": "This block assigns the next value of `total_line_count_f0`. It conditionally resets, updates, or maintains the count depending on control signals. On `reset_total_f0`, it left-shifts and zeroes the LSB; on `update_total_line_f0`, it sets the count to `next_total_line_count` with the LSB set; otherwise, it holds the current value."
