    "block_comment": "This block defines an Avalon memory-mapped slave interface for a component, which allows it to communicate with other components in a system-on-chip (SoC) architecture. It is parameterized with address and data width, indicating how much data can be read from or written to the slave. The component operates by receiving inputs such as the system clock, reset, address, data, and control signals for reading and writing operations. Outputs from the module include read data and interrupt signals. The module is designed to enable interaction with a controller through certain control and status signals like go_bit, triggers, registers, and interrupts, ensuring synchronized data handling and operation status reporting."
