    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code is used for managing a counter `count_valids` that tracks the number of valid color planes in a cycle. The counter is synchronized to the system clock `clk` and can be reset with `rst`. On a reset signal, the counter is cleared to zero, initialized by setting all bits to zero. If not resetting, the block checks the `sclr` signal; if set, it resets the counter, preserving the count of the current cycle with the least significant bits. If `sclr` is not set and `count_cycle` is true, the counter increments if `new_sample` is false, allowing to accumulate counts across cycles, otherwise resets if `new_sample` is true. This precise increment or reset mechanism helps in managing the count of valid color planes effectively depending on the sampling state and cycle progression."
