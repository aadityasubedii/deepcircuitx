    "module": "Module-level comment: The alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_embedded_sync_extractor extracts embedded sync signals from video streams. Utilizing input controls like reset, clock, video lock, and enable signals, it processes HD/SD video data. The implementation involves internal state machines for ancillary data detection, synchronization signal extraction, and managing sequence-based transitions. Outputs include processed video data and indicators for video sync and data validity, essential for interfacing in complex video systems."
