Comment: 
This block conditionally assigns input data to output based on clock similarity. If the `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME` condition is true, it directly assigns `data_in` to `data_out` using a continuous assignment statement, enabling data transfer under the same clock conditions. For different clocks, the `else` branch (not shown) presumably handles alternative synchronization methods.
