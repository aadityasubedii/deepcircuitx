    "block_comment": "This block handles edge detection and capture for a specific signal within a system. On the rising edge of the clock or falling edge of the reset signal, the block checks for reset conditions or clock enable signals. If reset is active (low), it clears the edge capture register for bit 3. If the clock is enabled and the write strobe signal is active, it similarly clears the bit, ensuring edge capture data remains consistent. Conversely, if an edge is detected on bit 3 during the enabled clock, it sets the edge_capture register for that bit to indicate a captured edge.\n"
