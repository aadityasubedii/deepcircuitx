    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is designed to manage reset conditions for video clock signals. On either the rising edge of a global reset (`rst`) or an internal video clock signal (`vid_clk_int`), the block initiates. If a reset is detected, it sets `rst_vid_clk_reg` and `rst_vid_clk_reg2` to high (1), ensuring both registers signal a reset condition. If there is no reset, `rst_vid_clk_reg` is cleared (set to 0), while `rst_vid_clk_reg2` latches the previous state of `rst_vid_clk_reg`, allowing a one clock cycle delay in the reset condition's propagation through the system."
