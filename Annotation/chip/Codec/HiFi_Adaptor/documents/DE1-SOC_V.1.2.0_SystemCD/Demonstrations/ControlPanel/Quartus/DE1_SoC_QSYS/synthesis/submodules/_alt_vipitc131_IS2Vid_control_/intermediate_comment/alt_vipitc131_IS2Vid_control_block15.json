    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the activation of a write operation. The `write_trigger` signal is assigned a value based on the logical AND of `av_write` with the negation of `is_side_registers`. This implies that `write_trigger` is enabled (set to high) when `av_write` is active and concurrently, `is_side_registers` is inactive, thereby preventing write operations to side registers."
