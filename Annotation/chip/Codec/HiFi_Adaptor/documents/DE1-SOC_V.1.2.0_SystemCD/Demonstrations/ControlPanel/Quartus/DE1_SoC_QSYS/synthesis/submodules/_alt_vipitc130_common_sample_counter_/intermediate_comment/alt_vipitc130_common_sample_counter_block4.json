    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog code handles the counting of valid color planes based on specific control signals in a synchronous system. It operates primarily on the rising edge of either the reset (rst) or the clock (clk). On a reset event, the count of valid color planes, represented by `count_valids`, is reset to zero using a specified number of bits (LOG2_NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES). If no reset is active and the clear signal (sclr) is asserted, `count_valids` is reset to zero, but with the least significant bit set to the state of `count_cycle`. If neither reset nor clear is asserted, `count_valids` is either incremented or maintained based on the states of `count_cycle` and a new sample indicator (`new_sample`). Thus, the block manages count adjustments dynamically based on system control flags and internal states."
