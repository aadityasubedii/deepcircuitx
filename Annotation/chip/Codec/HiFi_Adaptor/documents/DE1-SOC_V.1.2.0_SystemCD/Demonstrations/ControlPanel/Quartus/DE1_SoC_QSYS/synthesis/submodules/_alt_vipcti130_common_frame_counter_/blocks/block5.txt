Comment: 
This Verilog code block assigns the value of `v_total` to `v_total_int`. This simple operation is done using an assign statement, which continuously assigns the value from the right-hand side (`v_total`) to the left-hand side (`v_total_int`) ensuring `v_total_int` always reflects the current value of `v_total`.
