Module name: alt_vipcti130_Vid2IS. Module specification: The alt_vipcti130_Vid2IS module is a video interface converter that transforms video input streams into internal streams (IS) based on specific configuration parameters. It handles functionalities such as sync extraction, resolution detection, signal conversions, and managing various input and output controls. The module accepts input signals including reset (rst), video clock (vid_clk), video data (vid_data), data enable (vid_de), sync signals (vid_v_sync, vid_h_sync), and others. It produces output signals like internal stream clock (is_clk), data (is_data), start/end of packet (is_sop, is_eop), and various status signals. Internally, it utilizes signals for FIFO management, overflow detection, synchronization, and data conversion. The module is composed of several key blocks: a control
