It interfaces with an external key input (in_port) and generates an interrupt (irq) signal when a key press event (edge) is detected, considering the mask settings (irq_mask). The module provides features such as edge capture for different keys, which are reset when instructed through specific addresses. It handles asynchronous resets, clock enablement for synchronous processing, and supports reads from and writes to the internal registers based on address mapping. The outputs include the interrupt signal and the read data which reflects the state of the keys, mask status, or edge capture status, based on the provided address."

This input is used to detect changes and trigger corresponding actions.\n- **reset_n**: Asynchronous reset signal that initializes all registers and state machines to a defined state when set to low.\n- **write_n**: When this signal is low, it indicates write operations are enabled, allowing data on the writedata input to be written to specific registers within the module.\n- **writedata**: Data bus for write operations, holding the data to be written into the registers when a write operation is initiated.\n\nOutput ports: [irq, readdata].\nExplanation:\n- **irq**: Interrupt request output. It goes high to signal to the processor that an edge has been detected on one of the inputs, considering the mask settings defined by irq_mask.\n- **readdata**: Output data bus used to read data from the module's internal registers or states like current key status, irq_mask status, or edge captures, based on the provided address input. This allows the processor or controlling entity to infer the state or modify behavior based on this readout."

It acts as a delay element, creating the first level of data required for edge detection.\n- **d2_data_in**: Another register that latches the data from `d1_data_in`, creating a second level of delay. This staged latching helps in generating edge detection by comparing these two consecutively latched values.\n- **data_in**: Directly wired to `in_port`, this signal represents the current state of inputs (key press statuses) fed directly into the module.\n- **edge_capture**: A set of registers that captures and holds the edges detected for each bit of the `in_port`. It is cleared either by a reset or when it is explicitly written with zeros through specific write operations.\n- **edge_capture_wr_strobe**: A control signal which is asserted (high) when the module is set to clear the edge capture registers, as dictated by the address bus and write enable signals.\n- **edge_detect**: This wire carries the results of the XOR operation between `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in`, essentially detecting any transition (edge) based on differences between the two aforementioned delayed input states.\n- **irq_mask**: A register holding the mask data which determines whether interrupts should be generated for corresponding input edges detected. It allows selective ignoring of edges based on the mask settings.\n- **read_mux_out**: A multiplexer output that varies depending on the `address` input. It selectively outputs either current input states, interrupt mask status, or edge captures for reading operations; this allows the external system to access different types of state data through a unified read interface."
