    "block_comment": "This Verilog block handles edge detection and status capture for a specific signal. On a positive edge of the clock or a negative edge of the reset, if the reset is low, the edge capture register is reset to 0. During clock enable, if a write strobe is received, the capture register resets; otherwise, if an edge is detected, it sets the register to a high state indicating an active edge detected."
