Comment: 
The block generates an output signal which is the result of an exclusive-OR operation between an input signal and a next-state invert signal. By applying the XOR gate, it conditionally inverts the 'sync_in' signal based on the 'invert_sync_nxt' signal, allowing for synchronous signal manipulation. This is typically used for edge detection or signal inversion with conditional logic.
