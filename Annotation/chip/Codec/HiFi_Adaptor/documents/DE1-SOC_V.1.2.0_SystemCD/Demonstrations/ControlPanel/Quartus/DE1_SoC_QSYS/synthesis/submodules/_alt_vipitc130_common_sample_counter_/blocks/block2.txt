This block assigns a signal indicating the start of a sample. It uses a conditional assignment based on the `hd_sdn` signal; if `hd_sdn` is high, `start_of_sample` is set to 1 otherwise, it checks if `count_valids` equals zero (considering the log-base-2 number of color planes) to set `start_of_sample`.
