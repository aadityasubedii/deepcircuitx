    "block_comment": "This block of code sets the `enable` signal to a constant high value (`1`). By using an `assign` statement, the code continuously assigns the value `1'b1` to the signal `enable`, ensuring it remains active or enabled throughout the operation of the circuit. This implementation detail indicates that the `enable` signal does not depend on conditional logic or other variables within the system, implying its critical role in consistently allowing certain operations or functionalities to proceed in the design."
