    "module": "Module-level comment: The `alt_vipcti131_Vid2IS_resolution_detection` module evaluates video stream resolution by counting active/total video samples and lines, detecting interlacing, stability, and changes in resolution. It integrates a sub-module for counting samples, utilizes internal registers for state tracking, and updates outputs synchronously with video sync signals, adjusting to both interlaced and progressive video inputs."
