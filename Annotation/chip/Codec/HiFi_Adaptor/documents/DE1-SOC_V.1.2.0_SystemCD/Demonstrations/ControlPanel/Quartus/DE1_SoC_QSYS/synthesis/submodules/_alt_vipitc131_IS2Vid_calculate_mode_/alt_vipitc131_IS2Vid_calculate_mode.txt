Module-level comment: The `alt_vipitc131_IS2Vid_calculate_mode` module computes video timing parameters for output synchronization, handling both interlaced and progressive video input types. It leverages input signals like timing references and field-specific metrics to generate outputs such as pixel and line counts minus one, and sync positions. Internal computations determine sync edges and total line counts aiding in precise video frame configuration for subsequent processing stages. The implementation orchestrates these through signal assignments and arithmetic operations based on video type and format requirements.
