    "block_comment": "The block assigns the 'ready_out' signal based on the 'dout_ready' signal. Implementation is achieved through an assign statement for direct signal mapping, indicating that 'ready_out' reflects the readiness of data output. Refer to the original code for context on how 'dout_ready' is determined."
