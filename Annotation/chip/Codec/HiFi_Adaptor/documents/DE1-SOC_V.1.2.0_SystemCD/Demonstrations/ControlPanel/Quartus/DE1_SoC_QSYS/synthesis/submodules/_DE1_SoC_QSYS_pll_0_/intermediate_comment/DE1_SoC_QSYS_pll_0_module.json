    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll_0 is a Verilog module that configures a phase-locked loop (PLL) using the `altera_pll` instance for generating multiple clocks from a single reference clock (`refclk`). It accepts a reset signal (`rst`) and provides five different output clocks (`outclk_0` to `outclk_4`), adjustable by frequency, phase, and duty cycle. The module ensures stable clock outputs with a `locked` signal indicating PLL stability."
