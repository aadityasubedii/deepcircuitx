    "block_comment": "This block of code conditionally configures clock reset signals based on whether two clocks are the same. If the `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME` condition is true, it directly assigns the main reset signal `rst` to `rst_vid_clk` and the input signal `is_clk` to `vid_clk_int`. If the clocks are not the same, it declares two internal registers `rst_vid_clk_reg` and `rst_vid_clk_reg2` for further processing, presumably for synchronization purposes, though details beyond the snippet's scope are incomplete."
