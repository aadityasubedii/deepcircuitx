    "block_comment": "This Verilog block is a synchronous process that initializes and updates video processing parameters on each clock edge or reset. When a reset (`rst`) is detected, it initializes various control flags, counts, and registers to predefined states, ensuring the system starts in a consistent state. On a clock edge, if not reset, the block updates these parameters based on the video signal status and transitions detected (such as `vid_locked`, `end_of_vsync`, `ap`, etc). This includes managing data for current and previous fields, counting active and total samples and lines, and handling state changes with respect to active video lines, interlacing effects, and resolution changes, ensuring synchronization and stability within the video processing pipeline."
