    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for updating an internal status by logically combining two registers. It achieves this by performing a bitwise OR operation between `status_update_int_reg` and `stable_int_reg`, with the result assigned to `status_update_int`. This operation ensures that the status is flagged true if either of the registers has a true value, effectively merging their status signals."
