    "block_comment": "This block extracts a specific control packet from an array of registers and assigns it to a signal going from a slave to a controller. It achieves this by indexing into the `registers` array using calculated bit positions based on constants defined for slave data width and required control packet width, effectively slicing out the relevant segment of data."
