This code block manages conditional generation based on reset control inputs. It checks for the states of `RESET_REQUEST_PRESENT` and `ADAPT_RESET_REQUEST` to decide whether to include specific logic: if there is no reset request or the adaptive reset request is inactive, or if the adaptive reset request is active and output reset synchronization is not set to "deassert", then the enclosed logic will be generated. This conditional inclusion helps in customizing the reset behavior of the design dynamically based on configuration parameters.
