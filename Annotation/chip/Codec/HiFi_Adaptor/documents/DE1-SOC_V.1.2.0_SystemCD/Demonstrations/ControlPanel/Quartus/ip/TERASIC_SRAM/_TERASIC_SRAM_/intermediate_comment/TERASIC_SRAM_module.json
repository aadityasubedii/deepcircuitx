    "module": "Module-level comment: The TERASIC_SRAM module interfaces with SRAM to handle system commands for read/write operations, managing control signals such as CE, OE, WE, and byte enables based on inputs. It translates system address, data, and control protocols into SRAM compatible signals, using assignments to control bidirectional data flow, enable signals, and address mapping, synchronizing interactions via the system clock."
