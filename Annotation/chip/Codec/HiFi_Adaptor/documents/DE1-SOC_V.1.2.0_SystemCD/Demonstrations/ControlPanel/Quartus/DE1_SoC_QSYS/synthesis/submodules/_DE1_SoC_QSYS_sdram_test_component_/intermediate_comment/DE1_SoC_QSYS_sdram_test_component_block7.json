    "block_comment": "This block determines the read address based on the current index. It uses a conditional (ternary) operator to assign `read_addr` from one of three different sources (rd_addr_pipe_0, rd_addr_pipe_1, rd_addr_pipe_2) depending on whether `index` is 0, 1, or another value, respectively."
