    "block_comment": "This block assigns a specific segment of data from a registers array to `ctrl_packet_height_bank1_bits_FROM_slave_TO_controller`. It extracts a slice of bits related to the control packet height for bank 1 by dynamically calculating the start and end indices using predefined constants `SLAVE_DATA_REQUIREDWIDTH` and `CONTROL_PACKET_RESOLUTION_REQUIREDWIDTH`. This assignment is crucial for communicating control parameters between the slave module and the controller."
