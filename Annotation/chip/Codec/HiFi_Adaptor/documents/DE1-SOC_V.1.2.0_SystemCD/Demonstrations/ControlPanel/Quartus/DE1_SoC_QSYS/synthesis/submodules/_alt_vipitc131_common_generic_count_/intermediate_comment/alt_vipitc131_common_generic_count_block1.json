    "block_comment": "This block implements a counter that can be reset or restarted. The counter operates on the rising edge of the clock or the falling edge of the reset signal. When the reset signal is active low, the counter is set to a predefined `RESET_VALUE`. Otherwise, if the `restart_count` signal is high, the counter is reset to `reset_value`. If `enable_count` is high and the counter has not reached `max_count`, it increments by 1; otherwise, it resets to 0. The counter holds its value if neither reset nor enable conditions are met."
