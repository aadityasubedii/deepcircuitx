It works in four main states: IDLE, WAITING, RUNNING, and ENDING. \n\nIn the IDLE state, the module is ready to receive data packets for processing. When the 'enable' is active and data is ready to be processed, it moves into the WAITING state. \n\nIn the WAITING state, the module prepares to read the packet data (setting up commands and addresses, among other things). When all preparations are complete, it transitions to the RUNNING state.\n\nIn the RUNNING state, the module starts reading the data packet as clock cycles occur, and handles the data word by word until all packet data has been read. If the data read is completed, the module transitions to the ENDING state.\n\nIn the ENDING state, the module finishes up the remaining tasks, such as clearing relevant variables for the next cycle, and transitions back to the IDLE state.\n\nThis module communicates with other modules/systems via various input and output ports, so it can integrate with a larger system in different configurations."
