This block of code determines the start of a sample in a digital image processing context. It uses a conditional assignment to set `start_of_sample` based on the state of `hd_sdn`. If `hd_sdn` is high, `start_of_sample` is immediately set to high (1'b1). If `hd_sdn` is low, it checks if `count_valids` equals zero (using a comparison to a vector of zeros sized by `LOG2_NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES`) and sets `start_of_sample` based on this condition.
