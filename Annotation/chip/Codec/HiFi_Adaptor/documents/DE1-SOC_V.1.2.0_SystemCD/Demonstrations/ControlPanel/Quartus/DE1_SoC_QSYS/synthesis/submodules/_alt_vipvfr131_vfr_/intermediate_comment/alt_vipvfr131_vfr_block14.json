    "block_comment": "This line of Verilog code initializes the `registers_write` signal to a zero value for all entries. It uses replication (`{NO_REGISTERS{1'b0}}`) to create a concatenated string of zeros where the width of the string equals `NO_REGISTERS`, signifying the number of registers. Each register is set to `0`, configuring all registers to a write-disabled state initially."
