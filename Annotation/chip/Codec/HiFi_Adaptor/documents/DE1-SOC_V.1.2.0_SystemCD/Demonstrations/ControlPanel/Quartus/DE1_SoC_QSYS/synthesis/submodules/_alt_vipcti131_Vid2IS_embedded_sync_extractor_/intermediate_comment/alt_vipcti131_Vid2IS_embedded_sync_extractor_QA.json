It supports handling input video data which can optionally contain ancillary data in addition to the synchronous signals. The module identifies the start of ancillary data, data count, and processes synchronous signals (horizontal sync, vertical sync, and field indicator) based on input transitions and control flags. The parameters such as data width and bits per sample (BPS) are configurable. It outputs the synchronized video data, valid data indication, and sync signals. The module operates based on the received video clock and reset signals, adjusting its state and output based on the presence of video lock and enable signals."

It is used to initialize or reset the internal states and outputs of the module to their default values when it is asserted.\n- `clk`: This is the clock signal. It dictates the timing of all operations within the module, synchronizing data processing and state transitions.\n- `vid_locked`: This signal indicates whether the incoming video data is stable and locked. The module uses this to decide when to process the incoming video data.\n- `vid_enable`: This signal enables the processing of the incoming video data when asserted. If not enabled, the module will ignore the incoming data and maintain its current state.\n- `vid_hd_sdn`: This signal determines the format of the incoming video data (standard definition or high definition) and thus influences how ancillary data is detected.\n- `vid_data_in`: This is the incoming video data stream input. The module processes this data to detect synchronization signals and ancillary data based on the current state and control signals.\n\n**Output ports:** \n- vid_f\n- vid_v_sync\n- vid_h_sync\n- vid_datavalid\n- vid_anc_valid\n- vid_data_out\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `vid_f`: This output flag indicates the field indicator signal, which distinguishes between different video fields.\n- `vid_v_sync`: This is the vertical synchronization signal. It indicates the beginning of a new video frame.\n- `vid_h_sync`: This is the horizontal synchronization signal. It indicates the beginning of a new line within the video frame.\n- `vid_datavalid`: This signal indicates whether the current video data is valid for processing and display based on the synchronization signals.\n- `vid_anc_valid`: This signal indicates whether the current data includes ancillary data, which is data other than the main video pixel data. It becomes valid when ancillary data is being processed.\n- `vid_data_out`: This is the output video data stream. It represents either the processed incoming video data or the buffered previous state based on the control and status signals.\n\nThese inputs and outputs allow the module to interface effectively with other components in a video processing system enabling the extraction and synchronization of video data."
