Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_mm_interconnect_4. Module specification: This module serves as an interconnect component for a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, managing communication between an Avalon master interface (likely from a video frame reader) and an AXI slave interface (connected to a Hard Processor System). It features input ports for clock signals, reset signals, and various control and data signals from both interfaces. Output ports include control and data signals for the AXI slave interface and response signals for the Avalon master interface. Internally, the module utilizes numerous wire signals for translators, routers, arbiters, multiplexers, demultiplexers, burst adapters, and clock crossers. The module is structured into several functional blocks, including address translation, burst adaptation, arbitration, and clock domain crossing. It implements components such as Avalon-to
