    "spec": "Module name: hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync. \nModule specification: The `hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync` module is employed for synchronizing an asynchronous active-low reset signal (`reset_n`) with a clock signal (`clk`), primarily for stable operations in SDRAM interfaces within FPGAs. The module has two input ports: `reset_n`, the asynchronous reset triggering system initialization when low, and `clk`, the clock signal directing the timing of synchronization. There is one output port, `reset_n_sync`, which delivers the synchronized reset signal suitable for synchronous system circuits, driven by `clk`. The internal register array `reset_reg` is pivotal, serving as a chain of flip-flops, determined by `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` and `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT`, to sequentially filter the reset signal, hence safeguarding against metastability. The Verilog code constructs this synchronization chain using a `generate` block and a `genvar` for sequential instantiation of synchronization stages. Each stage updates on the rising edge of `clk` or the falling edge of `reset_n`, propagating the reset signal through the register stages or resetting them to 0. The synchronization logic is encapsulated within `always` blocks, defining the sequential behavior. Finally, the `assign` statement manages the extraction of the synchronized reset output from the internal shift register chain, ensuring that the reset signal is synchronized across the specified number of stages.",
