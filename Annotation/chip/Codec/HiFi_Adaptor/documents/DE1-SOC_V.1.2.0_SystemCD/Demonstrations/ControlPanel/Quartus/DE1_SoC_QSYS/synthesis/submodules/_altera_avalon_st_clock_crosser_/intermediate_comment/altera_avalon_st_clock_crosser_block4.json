    "block_comment": "This block is a conditional hardware pipeline for output data processing. If `USE_OUTPUT_PIPELINE` is set to 1, an `altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base` module is instantiated to buffer the output data, interfacing with system timing using clock signals, and handling flow control with ready/valid signals. Otherwise, direct assignments link the internal signals to the output, bypassing pipelining for simpler, faster connections."
