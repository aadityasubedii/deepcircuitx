This Verilog block converts a one-hot encoded signal to its corresponding binary representation using nested generate-for loops. It first creates a mapping of each one-hot position to its respective binary value, checks for active bits, and assigns the result if the condition is true. Then, it rearranges these binary values bit by bit into a new wire and performs a bitwise OR operation across appropriate segments to consolidate the full binary output. This implementation uses parameterized widths to handle different sizes of input signals dynamically, ensuring flexibility in various usage scenarios.
