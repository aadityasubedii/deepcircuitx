Module-level comment: The TERASIC_CLOCK_COUNT module counts cycles from external clocks CLK_1 and CLK_2, controlled by a system clock s_clk_in. It uses command-driven input ports for read/write operations and a countdown mechanism for controlled counting. The internal logic includes status registers, clock cycle counters, and trigger mechanisms to manage start, stop, and reset actions, ensuring accurate cycle tracking and data provision based on register address queries.
