    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a DDR3 SDRAM memory controller for a Hard Processor System (HPS). It manages memory operations through clock generation (PLL), initialization, calibration, and data transfer. The module integrates sub-components for PLL, memory interface, controller, OCT, and DLL. It handles address, data, and control signals, interfacing between the processor and external SDRAM, while managing timing parameters and signal integrity for efficient memory access and data transfer."
