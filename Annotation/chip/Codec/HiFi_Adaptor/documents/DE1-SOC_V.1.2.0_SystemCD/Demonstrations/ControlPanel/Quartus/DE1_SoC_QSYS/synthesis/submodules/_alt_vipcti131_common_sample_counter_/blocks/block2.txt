This block assigns a value to `start_of_sample` based on the condition of `hd_sdn` and `count_valids`. If `hd_sdn` is high, `start_of_sample` is set to 1; otherwise, it checks if `count_valids` equals zero (when all bits are zero in a bit width defined by `LOG2_NUMBER_OF_COLOUR_PLANES`) to assign `start_of_sample` accordingly. This determines the starting point of a new sample in a multi-plane color system, facilitating synchronization or initialization in signal processing tasks.
