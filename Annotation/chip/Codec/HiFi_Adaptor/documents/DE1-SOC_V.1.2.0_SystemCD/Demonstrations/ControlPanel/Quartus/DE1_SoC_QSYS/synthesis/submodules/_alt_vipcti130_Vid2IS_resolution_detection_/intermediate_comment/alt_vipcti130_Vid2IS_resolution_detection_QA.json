It interlaces and updates various counters for the total number of sample counts, active sample counts, total line counts across two fields (F0, F1), and active line counts in both fields. It handles changes in video field starting, syncs on new lines or fields, and identifies video resolution changes based on synchronized counters. Furthermore, it outputs whether the input resolution is stable and valid. The module also considers different scenarios such as locked/unlocked video signals and interlaced/non-interlaced video formats. This detection operation assists in adapting processing modules downstream according to the detected video resolution dynamically."
