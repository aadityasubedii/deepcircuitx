It uses parameters and a component from an FPGA library, specifically targeting the Cyclone V device family, ensuring proper synchronization between read (rdclk) and write (wrclk) operations while managing data flow between different clock domains. This FIFO handles data signals, control signals like read and write requests (rdreq, wrreq), and outputs the status of the FIFO such as full (wrfull) and empty (rdempty) flags, as well as the number of used words in the read domain (rdusedw). The FIFO supports overflow and underflow checking, and uses embedded array blocks (EAB) for storage."
