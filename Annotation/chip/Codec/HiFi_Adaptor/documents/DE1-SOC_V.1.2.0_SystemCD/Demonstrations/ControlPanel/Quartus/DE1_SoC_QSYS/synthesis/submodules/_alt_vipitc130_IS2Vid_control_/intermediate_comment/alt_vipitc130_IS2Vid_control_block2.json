    "block_comment": "This block of code is responsible for initializing the read data bus in a system. It achieves this by assigning a 16-bit zero value to the `av_readdata` signal, effectively setting the bus to a default state of zero. This operation ensures that there is a known, stable value on the data bus when read operations begin."
