    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser` handles data transfer across clock domains using toggling buffers and synchronization registers. It ensures reliable exchange through Altera synchronizers and conditional logic, with optional output pipelining. This allows for seamless clock domain crossings while preventing data corruption within Avalon stream interfaces."
