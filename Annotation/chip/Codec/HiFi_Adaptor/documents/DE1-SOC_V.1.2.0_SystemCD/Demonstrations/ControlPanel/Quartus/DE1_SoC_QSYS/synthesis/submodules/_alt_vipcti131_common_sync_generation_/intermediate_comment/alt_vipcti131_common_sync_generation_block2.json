    "block_comment": "This block defines an instance of a frame counter, specifically for counting frames based on horizontal and vertical sync signals. The counter instance named `divider_counter` is part of a larger system that likely includes handling video signals, as indicated by parameters like `h_total` and `v_total`. The block utilizes several input signals such as `rst` for reset, `clk` for the clock input, and `sclr` for synchronous clear. The functionality is controlled by the `enable` signal which is driven by `count_div`. Important to note, the counter is set to not increment vertically (`v_total` set to 0) and to not reset horizontally or vertically as `h_reset` and `v_reset` are set to 0. The output `div_next` indicates the completion of a counting cycle, which suggests this counter may be used to manage timing or coordinate events within a video processing context. This setup facilitates precise counting operations synced with video handling requirements, using the divider value for horizontal synchronization. To understand how the frame counter specifically interacts with video and timing, further inspection of the surrounding code and system architecture would be necessary."
