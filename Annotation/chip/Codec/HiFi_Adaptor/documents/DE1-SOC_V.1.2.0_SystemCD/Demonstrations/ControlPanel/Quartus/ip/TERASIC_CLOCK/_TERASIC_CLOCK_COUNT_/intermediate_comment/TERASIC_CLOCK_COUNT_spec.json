    "spec": "Module name: TERASIC_CLOCK_COUNT. \n\nModule specification: The TERASIC_CLOCK_COUNT module is designed for counting and managing external clock signals, CLK_1 and CLK_2, using the system clock (s_clk_in). This module is equipped to handle different operations based on input signals such as reading from and writing to internal registers, and counting the edges of external clocks. The input ports are s_clk_in (system clock input), s_reset_in (system reset), s_address_in (address selector for reading/writing), s_read_in (enables reading operations), s_write_in (enables writing operations), s_writedata_in (data to be written), CLK_1 and CLK_2 (external clocks to be counted). The sole output port, s_readdata_out, outputs the data from the internal registers depending on the read operations triggered. The important internal signals include counting_now (indicates active counting), cnt_down (holds and decrements the countdown value), clk1_cnt and clk2_cnt (count the clock edges of CLK_1 and CLK_2, respectively), and pre_counting_now and trigger_send (used for detecting state transitions and initializing counts). The Verilog code is structured into several blocks: reset and setup operations triggered by system reset or respective clocks; data I/O handling based on user commands for read and write operations; and edge detection for the external clocks, which increments the edge counters during counting periods. Each block serves a specific purpose, ensuring the module operates correctly for its intended counting and data handling functionalities.",

It processes two external clock signals, CLK_1 and CLK_2, as well as a system clock (s_clk_in) and a reset signal (s_reset_in). The module features a start register that can be written to begin a counting operation, with the countdown value supplied via an input bus (s_writedata_in). When counting is active, the module increments separate counters (clk1_cnt and clk2_cnt) with each rising edge of CLK_1 and CLK_2 respectively. If the counting completes or is stopped, the counters hold the tallied number of clock pulses counted during the active period. The result of these counts can be read through the s_readdata_out output by specifying the appropriate address matching either the first or second clock counter. Furthermore, the module supports resetting both the clock edge counters and internal states whenever required by an external reset command."

It is used as a reference clock for the internal operations of the module, including data reading, writing, and counting control.\n- s_reset_in: System reset input. A signal to reset the module, clearing all the counters and internal states.\n- s_address_in: Bus address input. A 2-bit input used to select the specific register for either reading or writing operations.\n- s_read_in: Read control input. When asserted, it allows data from the selected address (via s_address_in) to be read to s_readdata_out.\n- s_write_in: Write control input. When asserted, it enables writing the data from s_writedata_in to the register specified by s_address_in.\n- s_writedata_in: Write data input. This 32-bit input bus is used to provide data to be written into the registers when s_write_in is asserted.\n- CLK_1: First external clock input. This clock signal is counted by the module when the counting is activated.\n- CLK_2: Second external clock input. This clock signal is also counted by the module during the counting operation.\n\nOutput ports: [s_readdata_out].\nExplanation: \n- s_readdata_out: Read data output. This 32-bit output bus presents the data from the addressed internal register of the module when a read operation is performed (`s_read_in` is high), depending on the address specified in `s_address_in`. It can output status or result of the counts of CLK_1 or CLK_2."

It is set to 1 when counting starts and set to 0 when counting is stopped or when the countdown reaches zero.\n- cnt_down: This register holds the countdown value. It starts with the initial count value written to it and decrements with each clock cycle until it reaches 1, after which `counting_now` is set to 0.\n- clk1_cnt: This register counts the number of rising edges of the external clock CLK_1 during the active counting period specified by `counting_now`.\n- clk2_cnt: Similar to `clk1_cnt`, this register counts the rising edges of another external clock CLK_2, also during the active counting period.\n- pre_counting_now: This signal is used to capture the state of `counting_now` from the previous cycle. It helps in detecting a transition or change in the state from not counting to counting.\n- trigger_send: This signal is set when there's a transition from not counting to counting based on the detected change by comparing `pre_counting_now` and `counting_now`.
