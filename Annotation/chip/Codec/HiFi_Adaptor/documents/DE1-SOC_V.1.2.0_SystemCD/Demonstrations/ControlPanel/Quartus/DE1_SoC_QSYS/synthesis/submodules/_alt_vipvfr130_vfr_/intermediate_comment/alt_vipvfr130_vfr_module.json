    "module": "Module-level comment: The `alt_vipvfr130_vfr` module manages video frame processing in FPGA systems, interfacing with both master and slave devices via Avalon-MM. It handles video data input, synchronization, processing control commands, and outputs processed video. Implementation includes signal management for data flow control, parameterized settings for video characteristics, and internal blocks for encoding, handling control packets, and managing slave interactions, ensuring robust, synchronized video outputs."
