Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_sw. 

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sw is a Verilog module designed for edge detection and interrupt handling based on the input from switches or digital signals. It interfaces with external input through a 10-bit input port 'in_port' and detects rising and falling edges in these signals across clock cycles. Input and output ports include: 'address' and 'chipselect' for selecting internal registers, 'clk' for synchronizing the module operations, 'reset_n' for resetting the module, 'write_n' and 'writedata' for handling write operations, along with 'irq' for outputting interrupt signals and 'readdata' for outputting register data. Internally, it utilizes signals such as 'data_in' for passing the 'in_port' values, 'd1_data_in' and 'd2_data_in' for capturing data across clock cycles to detect edges, 'edge_capture' for storing edge detection statuses, 'irq_mask' for managing interrupt conditions, and several control signals like 'clk_en' and 'edge_capture_wr_strobe'. The code is organized into several blocks handling specific operations such as reset conditions, data capturing and edge detection, register writes, and output preparations. The 'irq' signal is managed based on the masked conditions matched by detected edges, and the read operations are multiplexed based on the selected address. This module is effective for implementing realtime hardware event management in digital systems.
