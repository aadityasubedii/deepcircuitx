    "block_comment": "This block generates a pulse signal at the start of a vertical synchronization (vsync) interval in a video signal. It uses an edge detection mechanism, where the output `start_of_vsync` is asserted high for one clock cycle when the `v_sync` signal transitions from low to high, as detected by the logical AND of `v_sync` with the inverted delayed version `v_sync_reg`."
