    "block_comment": "This block manages the capture and reset of an edge detection flag for a specific signal line. On a negative reset or when instructed via a strobe signal, the edge detection register (`edge_capture[6]`) is cleared. Conversely, if an edge is detected on the monitored line (`edge_detect[6]`), the register is set to -1, indicating an active edge detection event. The process is synchronized to the positive edge of the clock signal and conditional on a clock enable signal (`clk_en`)."
