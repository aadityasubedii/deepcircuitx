    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of `test_mask` to `test_out`, effectively making `test_out` a mirror of the `test_mask`. This operation is implemented by utilizing the Verilog `assign` statement, which establishes a continuous assignment, ensuring that any change in `test_mask` is directly reflected in `test_out`."
