    "block_comment": "This block is responsible for managing the interrupt mask register based on input conditions. When the reset signal is low (`reset_n == 0`), the interrupt mask is cleared (`irq_mask <= 0`). If a chip is selected (`chipselect` high), write is enabled (`~write_n`), and the targeted address is 2 (`address == 2`), the lower four bits of `writedata` are stored in `irq_mask`."
