The module accepts a parameterized width for the input and output data signals and uses a generate block to instantiate the required number of synchronizers, one for each bit of the data signal. Each synchronizer stabilizes and safely transfers the state of each bit from the source domain (input) to the destination domain (output), reducing metastability issues in digital circuits."

It is used to reset the internal states of the module to a known state, typically during initialization or critical errors.\n- din: This is the data input port. It is a vector with a width defined by the parameter WIDTH. This port provides the digital signals (data bits) that need to be synchronized across clock domains.\n\nOutput ports: dout. \nExplanation: \n- dout: This is the data output port.

Each iteration of the loop instantiates a `altera_std_synchronizer`, which uses passed parameters and signals (`clk`, `reset_n`, `din[i]`, `dout[i]`) directly. Since these synchronizers are instantiated within the loop and directly reference the module's inputs and outputs without any intermediate internal signals, the module itself does not have additional internal signals defined for holding or manipulating data within its scope.
