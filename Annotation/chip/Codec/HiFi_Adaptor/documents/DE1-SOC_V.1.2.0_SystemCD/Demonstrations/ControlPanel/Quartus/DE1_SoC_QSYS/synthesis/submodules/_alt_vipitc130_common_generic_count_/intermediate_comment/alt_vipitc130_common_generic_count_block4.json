    "block_comment": "This block initializes the `start_count` signal when certain conditions are met. It specifically sets `start_count` to high when `ticks` equals zero (all bits are '0' which is checked using a concatenation of '0's the length of `TICKS_WORD_LENGTH`) or when `enable_ticks` is low, effectively starting the counting process when either the tick count resets or ticking is disabled."
