    "module": "Module-level comment: The alt_vipitc131_IS2Vid_statemachine manages video and ancillary data through controlled state transitions driven by input flags and operational parameters. It implements a state machine that transitions based on video packet start indicators, data validity, synchronization needs, and system errors, using registers to hold current and next states, updated by clocked and combinatorial logic for real-time processing responsiveness."
