It manages various operations such as data transmissions, handling statuses, and processing end-of-packet signals. To facilitate the data exchange between the CPU and the EPCQ, it uses sub-modules like `DE1_SoC_QSYS_epcq_sub` and `tornado_DE1_SoC_QSYS_epcq_atom`, which handle specific signal manipulations and selections based on the chip's select lines and address decoding. Overall, the module provides necessary interfaces and control logic to interact with the EPCQ memory in a structured and efficient manner, mainly used for data storage operations in a system."
