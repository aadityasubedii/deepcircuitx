    "spec": "Module name: alt_vipitc131_common_trigger_sync.\nModule specification: The alt_vipitc131_common_trigger_sync module handles the synchronization of a trigger signal across different clock domains. It operates differently based on whether the clocks in both domains are the same or different, specified by the parameter `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME`. If the clocks are the same, the output trigger (`trigger_out`) directly mirrors the input trigger (`trigger_in`). If they differ, the module uses a toggle-based synchronization technique. The input ports include `input_rst` and `input_clock` for the incoming trigger's clock domain, and `rst` and `sync_clock` for the synchronization clock domain. `trigger_in` is the incoming trigger signal, and `ack_in` is an acknowledgment signal. The single output port, `trigger_out`, provides the synchronized trigger signal. Internal signals used are `trigger_in_reg` (register for `trigger_in` signal), `toggle` (signal that toggles based on input trigger changes and `ack_in`), `toggle_synched` (synchronized version of `toggle`), and `toggle_synched_reg` (register holding the last cycle state of `toggle_synched`). The module incorporates an `always` block that updates `trigger_in_reg` and `toggle` based on the input clock and another `always` block that synchronizes the toggle signal to the synchronization clock using a sub-module `alt_vipitc131_common_sync`. The output `trigger_out` is generated by XORing `toggle_synched` with `toggle_synched_reg`, ensuring accurate trigger signal synchronization across different clock domains.",
