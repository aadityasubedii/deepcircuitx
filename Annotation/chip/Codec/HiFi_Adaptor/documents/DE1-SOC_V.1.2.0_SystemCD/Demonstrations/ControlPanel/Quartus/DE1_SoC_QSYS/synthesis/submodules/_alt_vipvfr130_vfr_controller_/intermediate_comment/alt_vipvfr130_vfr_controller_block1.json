    "block_comment": "This Verilog block controls a state machine for managing video packet transmission. Initially, it resets all output states and parameters on a reset signal. If not in reset, it operates through states like IDLE, SENDING_ADDRESS, SENDING_SAMPLES, and others to orchestrate the loading of video packet data into a master bus interface. In IDLE, it awaits a go-bit to start sending data. In SENDING_ADDRESS and other sending states, it sets specific addresses and data determined by the bank read. The state transitions ensure the sequential progress of loading and sending data, handling end-frame operations, and interrupts for processing complete frames. This structured and sequential handling ensures systematic data write and read via the master bus interface."
