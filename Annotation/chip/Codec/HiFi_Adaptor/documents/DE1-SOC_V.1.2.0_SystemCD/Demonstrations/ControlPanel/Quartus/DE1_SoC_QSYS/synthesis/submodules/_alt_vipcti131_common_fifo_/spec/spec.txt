Module name: alt_vipcti131_common_fifo. 
Module specification: The alt_vipcti131_common_fifo is a Verilog module designed to implement a configurable first-in-first-out (FIFO) memory buffer with support for different operational settings based on the clocks for read and write operations. This module, flexible in nature, uses parameterized FIFO depth and data width, equipped with logic to dynamically configure address bit-widths using the internal ‘alt_clogb2’ function. This function calculates the minimum bit-width needed to address the FIFO depth. The module offers functionality for both single-clock FIFO (scfifo) when read and write operations share the same clock, and dual-clock FIFO (dcfifo) when separate clocks control the operations, dictated by the `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME` parameter. It includes input ports such as `wrclk` (write clock), `rdreq` (read request), `aclr` (asynchronous clear), `rdclk` (read clock), `wrreq` (write request), and `data` (data to be written), and output ports like `rdusedw` (read used words), `rdempty` (read empty indicator), `wrusedw` (write used words), `wrfull` (write full indicator), and `q` (data output). The module efficiently handles data transfer and storage operations, managing data overflow and underflow scenarios. Different sections in the code set up the module as an scfifo or a dcfifo with parameters that optimize operations such as speed and synchronization, additionally leveraging embedded array blocks (EAB) for optimized usage depending on the configuration.
