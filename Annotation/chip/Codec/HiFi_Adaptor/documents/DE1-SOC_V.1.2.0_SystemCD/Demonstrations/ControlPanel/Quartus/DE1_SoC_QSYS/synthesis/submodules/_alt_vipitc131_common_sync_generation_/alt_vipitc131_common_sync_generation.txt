Module-level comment: The alt_vipitc131_common_sync_generation module generates synchronization signals for video processing, particularly the Start of Frame (SOF) and divider signals. It processes inputs like reset, clock, video stability flags, and frame and line counts to manage synchronization and counters effectively. The module uses internal registers and wires, like enable and sof_next, and specialized sub-modules for frame counting, ensuring dynamic, stable video signal synchronization based on configured parameters and input conditions.
