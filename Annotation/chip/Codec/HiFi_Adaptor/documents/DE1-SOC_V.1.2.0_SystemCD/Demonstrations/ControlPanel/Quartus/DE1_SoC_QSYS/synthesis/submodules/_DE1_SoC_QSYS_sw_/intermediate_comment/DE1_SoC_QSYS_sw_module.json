    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sw module interfaces with digital inputs for edge detection and interrupt generation. It manages edge detection by sampling inputs each clock cycle, comparing consecutive samples to identify edges. It controls interrupts using an irq_mask and outputs status via readdata. The module handles multiple internal operations synchronized by the clock, including resetting states, writing data, and processing the output based on selected conditions using multiplexers."
