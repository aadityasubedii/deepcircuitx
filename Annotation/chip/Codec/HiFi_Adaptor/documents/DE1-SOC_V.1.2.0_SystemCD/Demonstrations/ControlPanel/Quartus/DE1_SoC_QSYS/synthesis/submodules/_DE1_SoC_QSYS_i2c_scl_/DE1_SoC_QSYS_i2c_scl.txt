Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_i2c_scl module manages I2C serial clock line operations. It processes data writes on the rising clock edge when addressed specifically (address 0), chipselect is active, and write enable is low. Data held in `data_out` is output through `out_port` and part of `readdata`. The module resets `data_out` on a falling edge of `reset_n`. Designed for synchronized data interaction within hardware systems.
