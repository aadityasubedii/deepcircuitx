    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sysid module outputs a 32-bit ID based on the input 'address'. It has three inputs: 'address', 'clock', and 'reset_n', and one output 'readdata'. The 'readdata' is conditionally set to '525D2B41' if 'address' is high, otherwise, it outputs 0. This functionality is realized using a simple 'assign' statement, efficiently mapping the address to the output without utilizing 'clock' or 'reset_n'."
