Comment: 
[Function of the block]: This block generates a synchronous clear signal. [Implementation details of the block]: It combines the enable and restart_count signals using logical operations. The clear signal (sclr) is asserted when either the enable signal is low (inactive) or the restart_count signal is high, effectively resetting or stopping the associated counter or process.
