It takes a reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset signal (`rst`) as inputs. The PLL outputs a clock signal (`outclk_0`) and a lock status signal (`locked`). The PLL is set to operate in a normal mode with a fractional VCO multiplier enabled, and it only uses one output clock tailored to a frequency of 18.432 MHz suitable for audio processing. Other parameters like phase shift and duty cycle are also specified for precision clock management, but only the first output clock frequency is utilized. The additional configuration parameters for other output clocks are set to zero and are not used in this configuration."

It provides the base frequency from which the PLL generates the needed output clock frequencies. Typically, this clock would come from an external oscillator or another clock source on the system.  \n- `rst`: This is the reset input. It is used to reset the internal state of the PLL. When asserted, the PLL re-initializes and starts its operational cycle anew, ensuring that the PLL starts from a known state.  \n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `locked`.  \nExplanation:  \n- `outclk_0`: This is the primary output clock of the PLL. In this module, it is configured to output a frequency of 18.432 MHz, which is specifically selected to match requirements for audio processing tasks.  \n- `locked`: This is a status signal output that indicates whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the desired frequency. A high (1) signal on `locked` means the PLL is stable and the output clocks are at correct frequencies, while a low (0) means the PLL has not yet achieved or lost lock."

It is used to reset the PLL, forcing it to reinitialize its internal states.\n- `altera_pll_i.outclk`: This signal array collects output clocks from the PLL.

Here, it is statically assigned to a constant low (`1'b0`), indicating non-utilization in this configuration.\n- `altera_pll_i.refclk`: This signal is connected to the `refclk` input port of the module, serving as the reference clock input for the PLL.
