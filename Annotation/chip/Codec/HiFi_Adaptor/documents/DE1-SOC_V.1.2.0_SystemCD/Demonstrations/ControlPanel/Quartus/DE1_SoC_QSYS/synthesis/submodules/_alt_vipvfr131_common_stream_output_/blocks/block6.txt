Comment: 
This code block is responsible for generating the next state of the `synced_int` signal based on specific conditions within a data packet transfer. It determines `synced_int_nxt` by setting it high when either the end of a packet (`eop`) coincides with an `image_packet` being true, or the current `synced_int` is high and start of packet (`sop`) is not active. This setup ensures that the `synced_int` remains high throughout the duration of a packet transfer, except at the start, thereby synchronizing packet transfer processes effectively.
