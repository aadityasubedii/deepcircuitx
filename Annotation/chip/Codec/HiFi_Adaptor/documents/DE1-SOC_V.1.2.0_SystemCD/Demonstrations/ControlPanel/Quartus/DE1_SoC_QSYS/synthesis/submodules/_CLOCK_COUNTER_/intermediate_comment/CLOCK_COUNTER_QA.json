It counts upwards as specified by the configuration parameter. Inputs to the module include 'aclr' (asynchronous clear), 'clk_en' (clock enable), and 'clock' (clock input). The current count value is presented on the 32-bit output 'q'. The counter increments each time the input clock is ticked, given that the clock is enabled and the asynchronous clear is not active."

The counter only ticks forward if this signal is high, enabling controlled operation of the counter.\n- 'clock' is the main clock input to the counter.
