Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_hps_0. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_hps_0 module is designed to interface between an FPGA and a Hardware Processing System (HPS), facilitating communication through various AXI buses and peripheral interfaces. It manages data transfer between the FPGA fabric and HPS, handling memory operations, communication protocols, and general-purpose I/O. The module features numerous input and output ports for AXI bus communications (f2h_*, h2f_*, h2f_lw_*), memory interfaces (mem_*), and various peripheral connections (hps_io_*) including Ethernet, QSPI, SDIO, USB, SPI, UART, I2C, and GPIO. It also includes interrupt handling capabilities (f2h_irq_p0,
