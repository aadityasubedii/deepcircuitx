    "block_comment": "This block conditionally synchronizes or resets the video standard signal based on a compile-time configuration. If the `USE_STD` flag is set, it uses a synchronization module `alt_vipcti130_common_sync`, configured for either the same or different clock domains as specified by `CLOCKS_ARE_SAME`, and for a certain standard width `STD_WIDTH`. The module receives the `vid_std` input and outputs to `vid_std_sync1`, with reset and clock signals provided. If `USE_STD` is not set, `vid_std_sync1` is directly reset to zero. The implementation ensures that `vid_std_sync1` is either synchronized or cleared based on the configuration, facilitating flexible integration in varied operational environments."
