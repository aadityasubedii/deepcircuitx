    "block_comment": "This block defines the total data width for each parallel channel based on pixel and color plane information. It calculates `DATA_WIDTH` by multiplying the number of bits per pixel per color plane (`BITS_PER_PIXEL_PER_COLOR_PLANE`) with the number of channels processing data in parallel (`NUMBER_OF_CHANNELS_IN_PARALLEL`), forming a parameter used universally in the design requiring this specific width measurement."
