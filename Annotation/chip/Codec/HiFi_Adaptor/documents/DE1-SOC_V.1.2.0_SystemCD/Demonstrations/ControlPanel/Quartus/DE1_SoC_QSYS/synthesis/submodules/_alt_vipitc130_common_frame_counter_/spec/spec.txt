Module name: alt_vipitc130_common_frame_counter.
Module specification: The module "alt_vipitc130_common_frame_counter" operates in the context of video processing, primarily to count frames and coordinate synchronous operations across video frames. It employs a set of input and output ports crucial for its function: 'rst' resets the counters, 'clk' is the primary clock signal, 'sclr' sets counters to specific reset values, 'enable' authorizes counter increment, 'hd_sdn' manages horizontal count-related conditions, 'h_total' and 'v_total' set boundaries for resetting, and 'h_reset' and 'v_reset' define starting offsets for respective counters. The outputs include 'new_line' indicating a new line start, 'start_of_sample' which engages at the beginning of sample processing, 'sample_ticks' conveying sample timings, and 'h_count' & 'v_count' for current horizontal and vertical counts respectively. Internally, 'count_sample' sourced from a submodule determines when horizontal counting occurs, while 'h_total_int' and 'v_total_int' serve as internally adjusted total counts affecting when counters reset based on the parameter 'TOTALS_MINUS_ONE'. The code structure includes an instantiated submodule for counting samples, parameter assignments to tailor submodule operation, conditional assignments based on parameter values, and sequential logic within an always block to dynamically update counts and reset conditions per input signals and internal logics. This organization ensures robust synchronization and frame delineation critical for higher-level video processing tasks.
