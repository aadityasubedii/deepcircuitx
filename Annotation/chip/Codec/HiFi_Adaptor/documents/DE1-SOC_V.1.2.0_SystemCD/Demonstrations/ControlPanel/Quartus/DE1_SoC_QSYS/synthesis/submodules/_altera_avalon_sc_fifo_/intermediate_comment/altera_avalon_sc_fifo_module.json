    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable single-clock FIFO buffer for data streaming with optional packet support. It uses parameterizable data widths, depths, and features like error handling and multi-channel support. The FIFO operates using memory blocks or shift registers, manages read/write pointers, and implements full/empty state control. Optional functionalities include store-forward mode, almost full/empty indicators, and packet-based operations, making it versatile for various system requirements."
