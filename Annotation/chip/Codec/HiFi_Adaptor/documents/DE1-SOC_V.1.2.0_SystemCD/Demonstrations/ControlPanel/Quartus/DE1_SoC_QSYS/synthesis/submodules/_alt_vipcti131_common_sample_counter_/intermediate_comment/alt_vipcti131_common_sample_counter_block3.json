    "block_comment": "This Verilog code block conditionally assigns a value to `count_sample` based on the status of `hd_sdn`. If `hd_sdn` is high, `count_sample` is assigned the value of `count_cycle`; otherwise, it is assigned the result of a bitwise AND operation between `count_cycle` and `new_sample`. This mechanism efficiently toggles `count_sample` based on the control signal and operational state represented by `new_sample`."
