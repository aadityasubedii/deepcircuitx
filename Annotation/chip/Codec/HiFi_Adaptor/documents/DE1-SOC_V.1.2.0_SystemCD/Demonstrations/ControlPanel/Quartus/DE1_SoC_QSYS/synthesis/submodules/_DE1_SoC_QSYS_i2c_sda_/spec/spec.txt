Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_i2c_sda. 
Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_i2c_sda module is designed to simulate the behavior of an I2C bi-directional serial data line interface, capable of managing read and write operations. Input ports include `address` (2-bit for selecting registers or operations), `chipselect` (activates module operations), `clk` (provides timing for operations), `reset_n` (an active-low reset), `write_n` (an active-low write enable), and `writedata` (32-bit data for write operations). The output ports are `bidir_port` (a bi-directional port for I2C data communication), and `readdata` (32-bit, outputs data read from the module). Internal signals include `clk_en` (clock enable, perpetually high), `data_dir` (registers the data flow direction), `data_in` (captures incoming data), `data_out` (holds outgoing data), and `read_mux_out` (part of multiplexer logic determining output to `readdata`). The code comprises distinct always blocks for reactive state updates, including data direction and output logic based on clock and reset conditions, alongside combinational logic to assign `bidir_port` and conditionally output data through `readdata`. These blocks orchestrate the coherent functioning of the module supporting dynamic data directionality and reliable data handling compliant with the I2C communication protocol.
