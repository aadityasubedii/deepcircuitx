    "module": "Module-level comment: The IRDA_RECEIVE_Terasic module decodes IRDA signals through state management (IDLE, GUIDANCE, DATAREAD) and signal timing analysis. Using inputs iCLK, iRST_n, iIRDA, and iREAD, and outputs oDATA_REAY, oDATA, it handles signal transitions, data decoding, and readiness indication based on duration-based state transitions and internal counters like idle_count, state_count, and data_count. This implementation ensures synchronized data reception and processing."
