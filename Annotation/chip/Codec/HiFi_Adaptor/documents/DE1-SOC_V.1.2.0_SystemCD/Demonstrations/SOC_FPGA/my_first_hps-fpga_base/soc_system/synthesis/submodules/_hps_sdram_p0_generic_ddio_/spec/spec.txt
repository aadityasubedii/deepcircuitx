Module name: hps_sdram_p0_generic_ddio. 
Module specification: The `hps_sdram_p0_generic_ddio` module is crafted to handle double data rate input/output (DDIO) operations tailored for SDRAM usage in high-performance systems. It efficiently processes data via three main blocks for each pin defined by the parameter WIDTH. The module receives a vector `datain` that consists of 4 bits for each WIDTH, influenced by a half-rate and a full-rate clock vector (`clk_hr` and `clk_fr`), and a control signal `halfratebypass` to optionally bypass half-rate processing. The output `dataout` emerges as a WIDTH-sized vector, with each bit reflecting the output from the DDIO operations, suitable for direct SDRAM interfacing. Two internal signals, `fr_data_hi` and `fr_data_lo`, store intermediary data from half-rate processed input bits. These signals are utilized by the full-rate DDIO block to finalize the data rate conversion efficiently. The Verilog code utilizes a generate loop to instantiate two half-rate DDIO output blocks, `hr_to_fr_hi` and `hr_to_fr_lo`, for separating and processing the high and low parts of the input data, followed by a full-rate DDIO output block `ddio_out`. Each of these blocks configures their operations based on the clock signals and the `halfratebypass` status, effectively bridging the gap between data input and SDRAM-compatible output.
