Module name: hps_sdram. Module specification: The hps_sdram module is a Hardware Processor System (HPS) SDRAM controller for a Cyclone V FPGA, designed to interface with DDR3 SDRAM memory. It manages memory operations and timing, utilizing components such as PLL for clock generation, PHY for SDRAM interfacing, OCT for signal integrity, and DLL for timing adjustments. The module has input ports for clock (pll_ref_clk), reset signals (global_reset_n, soft_reset_n), and OCT calibration (oct_rzqin). Output ports include various SDRAM signals like address (mem_a), bank address (mem_ba), clock (mem_ck, mem_ck_n), and control signals (mem_cke, mem_cs_n, mem_ras_n, mem_cas
