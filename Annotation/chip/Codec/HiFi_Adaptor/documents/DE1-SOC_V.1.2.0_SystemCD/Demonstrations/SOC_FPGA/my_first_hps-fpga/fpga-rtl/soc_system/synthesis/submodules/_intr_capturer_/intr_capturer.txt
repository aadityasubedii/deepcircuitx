Module-level comment: The intr_capturer module captures interrupts from the `interrupt_in` vector and outputs them via `rddata` based on `addr` and `read` inputs. It employs registers `interrupt_reg` and `readdata_with_waitstate` to manage and delay interrupt data. It handles up to 32 or more interrupts, with conditional logic in a `generate` block to accommodate configurations exceeding 32 interrupts, dividing data into lower and higher segments for efficient handling and output.
