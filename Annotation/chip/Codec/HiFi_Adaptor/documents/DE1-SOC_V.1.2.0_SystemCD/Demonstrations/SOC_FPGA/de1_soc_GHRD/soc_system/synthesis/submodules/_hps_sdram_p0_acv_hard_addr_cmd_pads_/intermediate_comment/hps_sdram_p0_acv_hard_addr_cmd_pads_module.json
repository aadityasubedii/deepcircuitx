    "module": "Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_addr_cmd_pads` module interfaces with SDRAM by generating and processing address, command, and control signals. It manages inputs such as multiple clock signals, DDR parameters, and reset conditions, outputting synchronized signals that comply with memory operation specifications. Internally, it uses sub-modules for phase and delay control, DDR I/O handling, and clock synchronization, ensuring all signals meet timing requirements for reliable memory operations."
