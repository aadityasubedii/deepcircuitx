Module name: altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface. 
Module specification: The `altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface` module serves as a configurable interface for JTAG communication, toggling between normal and PLI (Programming Logic Interface) modes as determined by the `USE_PLI` parameter. The moduleâ€™s input ports include `clk` (the clock input for synchronization), `reset_n` (an active-low reset signal for internal reset), `source_ready` (signal indicating downstream readiness to accept data), `sink_data` (data received from the sink), and `sink_valid` (indicates valid incoming sink data). The output ports consist of `source_data` (data sent upstream), `source_valid` (indicates valid outgoing source data), `sink_ready` (signaling readiness to receive more data from the sink), `resetrequest`, `debug_reset`, `mgmt_valid`, `mgmt_data`, and `mgmt_channel` (management-related signals and data paths). Internal signals used within the module, such as `clk`, `resetrequest`, `source_data`, `source_valid`, `sink_data`, and `sink_valid`, facilitate data flow management, synchronization, and system reset functionalities. The module comprises two main conditional blocks: "normal" and "pli_mode". In "normal" mode, it configures data streaming using an `altera_jtag_dc_streaming` sub-module, tailored to the specified FIFO sizes and management channel widths. In "pli_mode," it employs the `altera_pli_streaming` sub-module configured to a specific PLI port, adjusting its operations based on `PURPOSE` and `PLI_PORT` parameters. This dynamic configuration allows for efficient data handling and error management in different operational modes, making it versatile for various system integration needs.
