The module accepts up to 16 reset inputs and up to 16 reset request inputs. It combines these signals and synchronizes them to a given clock 'clk' using parameters-defined logic and configurations. The merging of resets and reset requests result in a single output reset and request signal. The output signals can either be directly assigned or go through a synchronization process which prevents metastability issues in the system. The module highly configurable with parameters controlling various aspects like the number of reset inputs, behavior of reset synchronize edges, and reset request handling, offering adaptability to various design requirements."

Each reset input is logically OR-ed to generate a single merged reset signal.\n- `reset_req_in0` to `reset_req_in15`: Similarly, these are the reset request inputs, up to sixteen as well. The module allows configuration of which reset request inputs are active and merges the active ones into a single signal that indicates a request for a reset. This can be used to signify controlled or graceful resets separately from immediate resets.\n- `clk`: This is the clock input to which the resets are synchronized. It ensures that output signals are stable and synchronized, preventing issues like metastability in the system.\n\nOutput ports: `reset_out`, `reset_req`.\nExplanation:\n- `reset_out`: The synchronized output reset signal. This is used as the reset across other modules or systems that are clock synchronized to `clk`. It is produced by processing the input reset signals as defined by the parameters for edge behaviors and depth of synchronization.\n- `reset_req`: The synchronized output reset request signal. It outputs the processed reset request signal which can control the handing of resets in terms of system readiness and can trigger controlled resets when system conditions permit."

It might be synchronized or directly assigned, based on the module configuration.\n- `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain`: A shift register used to debounce and stabilize the `reset_out_pre` signal internally within the module, providing timing alignment with the clock.\n- `r_sync_rst_chain`: Another shift register chain used to ensure proper setup for assertion time of the reset signal (`reset_out`) ensuring it meets certain timing constraints.\n- `r_sync_rst`: This is a register holding the final synchronized reset output. It may change its value based on conditions checked against `r_sync_rst_chain` and other synchronization logic.\n- `r_early_rst`: This register holds the final output for the reset request (`reset_req`).
