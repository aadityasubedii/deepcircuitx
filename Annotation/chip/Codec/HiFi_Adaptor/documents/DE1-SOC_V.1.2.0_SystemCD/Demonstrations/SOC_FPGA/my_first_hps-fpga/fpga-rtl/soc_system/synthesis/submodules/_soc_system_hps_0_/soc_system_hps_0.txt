/**
 * soc_system_hps_0: Hardware bridge between HPS and FPGA
 * 
 * Interfaces HPS with various peripherals and hardware interfaces.
 * Manages AXI transactions, resets, memory, and I/O interfaces.
 * Uses two sub-modules (fpga_interfaces and hps_io) to handle 
 * FPGA-side and HPS-side interfaces respectively. Includes 
 * parameter checking for correct instantiation.
