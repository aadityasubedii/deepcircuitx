    "spec": "Module name: altera_pli_streaming. \n\nModule specification: The 'altera_pli_streaming' module manages streaming data transactions between a JTAG interface and a processor through a Programming Language Interface (PLI) port. It synchronizes data flow by handling valid data signals, readiness signals, and managing data transfers based on the availability of source and sink. Key input ports include 'clk' (a clock signal for synchronization), 'reset_n' (an active low reset signal for internal state initialization), 'source_ready' (indicates downstream component's readiness to accept data), 'sink_valid' (indicates validity of upstream data), and 'sink_data' (8-bit data from the upstream component). Output ports are 'source_valid' (shows data readiness for downstream transmission), 'source_data' (8-bit output data for downstream), 'sink_ready' (indicates module's readiness to receive data), and 'resetrequest' (requests a system reset, used for debugging/error handling). Internal signals such as 'pli_out_valid', 'pli_in_ready', and 'pli_out_data' serve within PLI transactions to handle the validity and readiness of outgoing and incoming data, respectively. The code includes integration with 'altera_jtag_dc_streaming' instantiated as 'jtag_dc_streaming', facilitating further data processing and control operations. Specific operations conditioned on 'MODEL_TECH' define manage PLI-based transactions using procedural calls like `$do_transaction`. The waveform properties are governed by a `timescale directive, and the module falls back to basic source and sink management when PLI is not initiated. This integration, along with conditional compilation, showcases an advanced utilization of hardware interfacing in FPGA programming for streaming data handling.",
