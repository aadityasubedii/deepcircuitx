It features parameterization to support different numbers of interrupts (specified by NUM_INTR). The module handles up to 32 or more interrupts, employing separate registers for interrupts beyond the initial 32 if necessary. On a read command combined with a specified address, the module outputs the stored interrupt data, potentially delayed due to added wait states for synchronization with the system's reading processes. The operation is responsive to clock edges and reset conditions, ensuring that it initializes correctly on a reset and updates the output with new interrupt data across clock cycles."

It carries the interrupt signals that need to be captured and processed.\n- `addr`: Address input used to select which portion of the interrupt data to read. It determines if the lower or higher part of the interrupt register is accessed based on its value.\n- `read`: Read control signal used to enable the reading of data, allowing the module to output the stored interrupts when asserted.\n\n**Output ports:** `rddata`.\n**Explanation:**\n- `rddata`: Read data output, a 32-bit bus that carries the interrupt data that has been requested through the `addr` and `read` inputs. It provides the result of the read operation, reflecting either the lower or higher set of interrupt data stored in the internal registers."
