Module name: altera_reset_synchronizer. Module specification: The `altera_reset_synchronizer` module, employed in Verilog, is specifically designed to synchronize an asynchronous reset signal (`reset_in`) to a specified clock (`clk`). The functionality of the module revolves around ensuring safe usage of reset signals within synchronous designs, achieved by means of a shift register mechanism. The input ports include `reset_in`, an asynchronous reset input, and `clk`, the clock signal to which the reset is to be synchronized. The module offers a single output port, `reset_out`, which delivers the synchronized reset signal appropriate for use within the specified clock domain. Internally, the module utilizes a register array `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain`, sized according to a configurable depth parameter (`DEPTH`), to debouncethe reset signal. The output of this synchronization process is then held in `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out`. The module code includes a conditional generate block that distinguishes two operational modes based on the `ASYNC_RESET` parameter: 1) When `ASYYNC_RESET` is enabled, the synchronization is sensitive to both the clock's and reset inputâ€™s positive edges, initializing all bits in the shift register to 1 upon reset activation, thereby enabling immediate response to reset conditions. 2) When disabled, the synchronization updates based only on the clock's positive edge, capturing the reset input state directly into the shift register, this mode omits the immediate reset responsiveness, likely suiting environments where the input reset is already partially stable. Both paths utilize procedural blocks (`always` blocks) to update the shift register content and output synchronized signal accordingly.
