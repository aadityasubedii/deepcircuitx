The main features include detecting button presses and generating interrupts. The module monitors input from buttons (`in_port`), detects changes (rising edges), and manages interrupt signals based on these changes depending on the irq mask settings. It provides options to read the button state, irq mask, and edge capture status via specific addresses while allowing configuration of irq masks and edge capture settings. The system uses edge detection to trigger interrupts when designated conditions specified by irq mask are met, providing a method to handle asynchronous button press events efficiently within a digital system design."

Each bit corresponds to the state (pressed or unpressed) of a different button.\n- `reset_n` (1 bit): Asynchronous reset input, active low. Resets the internal states of the module when low.\n- `write_n` (1 bit): Write enable signal, active low. Determines whether the operation is a read (high) or a write (low).\n- `writedata` (32 bits): Data to be written into the module during write operations, such as configuring irq masks or resetting edge captures.\n\nOutput ports: [irq, readdata].\nExplanation: \n- `irq` (1 bit): Interrupt request output. Goes high to signal an external controller that an interrupt condition has been met based on button presses and irq mask settings.\n- `readdata` (32 bits): Outputs data from the module in response to read operations, such as current button state, irq mask, or status of edge captures depending on the address accessed."
