Module-level comment: The 'altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter' module processes data streams by managing special characters (idle `0x4A` and escape `0x4D`). It uses internal flags (`received_esc`) and detection signals (`idle_char`, `escape_char`) to conditionally modify the output data based on input validity and readiness signals. The implementation comprises sequential logic for status updates and combinational logic for immediate data processing, ensuring data is framed correctly for reliable transmission.
