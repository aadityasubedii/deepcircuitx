Module name: soc_system. Module specification: The soc_system module is a top-level System-on-Chip (SoC) design integrating various components including a Hard Processor System (HPS), memory interfaces, and peripheral controllers. It features input ports for clock, reset, memory calibration, and various communication interfaces (Ethernet, USB, UART, etc.), along with output ports for memory control, LED control, and 7-segment display. The module utilizes inout ports for bidirectional communication on memory data lines and interfaces like MDIO, QSPI, SDIO, USB, I2C, and GPIO. Internally, it employs AXI and Avalon interfaces for interconnecting components, with signals for address, data, and control operations. The design incorporates several key blocks: an HPS subsystem, on-chip memory, LED and 7-segment display controllers,
