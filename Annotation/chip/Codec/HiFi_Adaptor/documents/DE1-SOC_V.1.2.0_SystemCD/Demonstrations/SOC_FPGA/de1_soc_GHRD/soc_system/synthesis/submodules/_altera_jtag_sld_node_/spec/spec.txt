Module name: altera_jtag_sld_node. Module specification: The "altera_jtag_sld_node" module is designed to facilitate JTAG operations through a virtual interface, specifically tailored for FPGA debug and configuration. It handles various JTAG states and data transmission via its functionalities. Input ports include 'ir_out' ([IRWIDTH - 1:0]), which receives instruction register outputs from a JTAG TAP controller, and 'tdo', a serial data output from the JTAG chain. Output ports consist of 'ir_in' ([IRWIDTH - 1:0]), which sends instruction register inputs to control JTAG operations; 'tck' for the test clock; 'tdi' as test data input; and several outputs indicating specific JTAG states ('virtual_state_cdr', 'virtual_state_cir', etc.). Internal signals such as 'simulation_clock', 'sdrs', 'cdr', 'sdr', 'e1dr', 'udr', and 'bit_index' manage clock operations and track the state transitions and bit shifting in data handling. The module is divided into blocks conditioned by 'ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS' definitions, which include the instantiation and parameter configuration of the 'sld_virtual_jtag_basic' component if defined, and handling of state control tasks along with state transition tasks if not defined. This structure supports both simulation and operational environments, ensuring flexible JTAG state management and data manipulation necessary for effective FPGA testing and configuration.
