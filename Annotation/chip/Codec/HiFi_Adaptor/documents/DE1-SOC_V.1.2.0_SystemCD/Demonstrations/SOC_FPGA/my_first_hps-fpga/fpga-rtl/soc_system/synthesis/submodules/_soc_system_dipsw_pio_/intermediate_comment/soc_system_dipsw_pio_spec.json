    "spec": "Module name: soc_system_dipsw_pio.\n\nModule specification: The `soc_system_dipsw_pio` module is designed for interfacing with a bank of dip switches on a system-on-chip (SoC), primarily facilitating the detection of switch state changes and generating corresponding interrupts. The module comes equipped with input ports including a 2-bit `address` for selecting internal registers, `chipselect` for enabling the module, `clk` for clock synchronization, a 10-bit `in_port` representing the dip switch states, `reset_n` for resetting the module, `write_n` to determine write operations and a 32-bit `writedata` for internal register configuration. The outputs are a single `irq` signal indicating interrupt requests and a 32-bit `readdata` holding internal register data requested by external entities. \n\nInternal to the module, `clk_en` is a wire always enabled for clocked operations, `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in` are registers for capturing and debouncing switch inputs across two clock edges, `data_in` directly reflects the dip switch states, and `edge_capture` captures edge transitions. The module utilizes an `edge_detect` signal to identify changes between `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in`, and `irq` is driven by the conditions configured in the `edge_capture` and `irq_mask`. Configuration and control are obtained through selective writes to the `edge_capture` and `irq_mask` registers, facilitated by signals such as `edge_capture_wr_strobe`.\n\nThe Verilog implementation has various sections: resetting of registers is handled within blocks checking `reset_n`. Configuration blocks reacting to `writedata` at appropriate addresses, and an edge detection mechanism that updates `edge_capture` based on conditions defined by `edge_detect` and `edge_capture_wr_strobe`. Data output through `readdata` is managed by a multiplexer (`read_mux_out`), which presents selected internal data based on the `address` input. Overall, the code structure encapsulates functionality for switch state monitoring, debounce handling, interrupt management, and data interfacing, crucial for effective dip switch integration into SoC environments.",

The module comes equipped with input ports including a 2-bit `address` for selecting internal registers, `chipselect` for enabling the module, `clk` for clock synchronization, a 10-bit `in_port` representing the dip switch states, `reset_n` for resetting the module, `write_n` to determine write operations and a 32-bit `writedata` for internal register configuration. The outputs are a single `irq` signal indicating interrupt requests and a 32-bit `readdata` holding internal register data requested by external entities. \n\nInternal to the module, `clk_en` is a wire always enabled for clocked operations, `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in` are registers for capturing and debouncing switch inputs across two clock edges, `data_in` directly reflects the dip switch states, and `edge_capture` captures edge transitions. The module utilizes an `edge_detect` signal to identify changes between `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in`, and `irq` is driven by the conditions configured in the `edge_capture` and `irq_mask`. Configuration and control are obtained through selective writes to the `edge_capture` and `irq_mask` registers, facilitated by signals such as `edge_capture_wr_strobe`.\n\nThe Verilog implementation has various sections: resetting of registers is handled within blocks checking `reset_n`. Configuration blocks reacting to `writedata` at appropriate addresses, and an edge detection mechanism that updates `edge_capture` based on conditions defined by `edge_detect` and `edge_capture_wr_strobe`. Data output through `readdata` is managed by a multiplexer (`read_mux_out`), which presents selected internal data based on the `address` input. Overall, the code structure encapsulates functionality for switch state monitoring, debounce handling, interrupt management, and data interfacing, crucial for effective dip switch integration into SoC environments."
