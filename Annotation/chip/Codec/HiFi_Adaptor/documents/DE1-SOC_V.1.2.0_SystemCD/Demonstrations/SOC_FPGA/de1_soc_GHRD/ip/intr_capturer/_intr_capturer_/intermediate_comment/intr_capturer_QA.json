It is parameterized by `NUM_INTR`, which specifies the number of interrupt inputs. The module reads these interrupts from the input `interrupt_in` and stores them in a register `interrupt_reg`. Depending on the address input (`addr`), the module allows selective access to either the lower 32 bits or the higher bits (for systems with more than 32 interrupts) of the `interrupt_reg`. The read operation, triggered by the `read` signal in conjunction with `addr`, determines which part of the register is accessed and outputs the relevant bits onto `rddata`. The data output incorporates a wait state managed by `readdata_with_waitstate`, which holds the read data synchronously until the next positive edge of the clock or a reset event. The dual-register handling is managed conditionally using a generate block for systems where interrupts exceed 32 lines."
