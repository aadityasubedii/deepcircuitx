    "spec": "Module name: altera_avalon_st_idle_remover.\nModule specification: The \"altera_avalon_st_idle_remover\" module processes incoming 8-bit data streams to remove idle characters (hexadecimal \"4A\") and handle escape sequences (hexadecimal \"4D\") while managing flow control between an input and an output interface. The module's input ports include `clk` (clock) for synchronization, `reset_n` (active-low reset) for resetting internal states, `in_valid` (input valid) to indicate valid incoming data, `in_data` (input data) which is the 8-bit data stream, and `out_ready` (output ready) to check if the downstream module can accept data. The output ports are `in_ready` (input ready) indicating the module\u2019s readiness to accept data, `out_valid` (output valid) signaling that the output data is valid, and `out_data` (output data) which sends adjusted data after processing. Internally, `received_esc` is a register tracking if an escape character has been received, affecting subsequent data processing. `escape_char` signals the detection of an escape character, and `idle_char` detects if the current data is an idle character, both used for controlling data flow and transformation. The Verilog code consists of two main always blocks and assignments: one for handling the reset and state of the escape detection, and the other for assigning output signals based on the presence and processing of escape and idle characters.",

It connects between an input and an output interface, which handle data in an 8-bit format. The main functionalities include:\n- Detecting and removing any idle characters (identified as hexadecimal \"4A\").\n- Recognizing and processing escape characters (identified as hexadecimal \"4D\"). When an escape character is received, the subsequent character's value is modified by XORing with \"20\" (hexadecimal). \n- Managing the flow control between the input and output by ensuring that data is received and transmitted only when both ends are ready. The module uses the `in_ready` signal to indicate readiness to accept data if the output side is ready, and uses the `out_valid` and `out_data` signals to send out adjusted data, omitting idle characters, and transforming characters following the escape character."

This signal is used to determine whether the incoming data should be processed.\n- `in_data` (input data): 8-bit data input which the module processes.
