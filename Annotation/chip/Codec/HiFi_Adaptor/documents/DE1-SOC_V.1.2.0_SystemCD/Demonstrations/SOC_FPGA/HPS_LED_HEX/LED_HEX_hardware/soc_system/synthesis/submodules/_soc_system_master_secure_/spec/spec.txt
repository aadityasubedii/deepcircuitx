Module name: soc_system_master_secure. 
Module specification: The `soc_system_master_secure` module operates as a master controller within a system-on-chip (SoC) responsible for secure data transactions. It integrates various functionalities including JTAG interface, FIFO buffers, and packet-byte transformations to manage secure data flows through an SoC environment. The module takes two input ports: `clk_clk` as the primary clock input for synchronization of operations, and `clk_reset_reset` as the reset input to initiate or maintain a known operating state. Important output ports include `master_address` which sets the target address for read or write operations, `master_read` and `master_write` to initiate these operations, `master_writedata` for outgoing data, `master_byteenable` to specify active byte lanes during transfer, and `master_reset_reset` to reset other components based on internal conditions. Various internal signals are employed like `jtag_phy_embedded_in_jtag_master_src_valid` and `timing_adt_out_valid` that manage the validity statuses and data flows through the vital sub-modules for data conversion and transactions. Within the module, blocks such as `altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface` and `altera_avalon_sc_fifo` handle specific tasks related to data interfacing and buffering. The module also utilizes parameter checks to ensure correct configuration against predefined values such as `USE_PLI`, `PLI_PORT`, and `FIFO_DEPTHS`. These conditions are crucial for maintaining system integrity and performance consistency. Through its interconnected structure and composite functionality, this module plays a pivotal role in orchestrating secure transactional operations in a highly-configurable SoC environment.
