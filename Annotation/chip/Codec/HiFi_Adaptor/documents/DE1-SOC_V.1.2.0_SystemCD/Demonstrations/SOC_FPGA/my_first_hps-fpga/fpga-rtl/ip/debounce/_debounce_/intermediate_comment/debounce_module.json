    "module": "Module-level comment: The `debounce` module stabilizes input fluctuations on a vector `data_in`, producing a stable output `data_out`. It implements per-bit counters within a `generate` block, incrementing counters when input matches POLARITY and is consistent before the TIMEOUT threshold. Counters reset on input toggle or based on POLARITY, setting outputs when stable for defined durations."
