The module takes an active low reset signal (`reset_n`) and a clock signal (`clk`) as inputs and outputs a synchronized reset signal (`reset_n_sync`). It uses a shift register technique where each flip-flop stage in the register captures the state of the previous stage at each clock edge. This chain of flip-flops (number of stages defined by `RESET_SYNC_STAGES`) effectively delays the assertion and deassertion of the reset signal by several clock cycles, ensuring stable operation by the time the signal is used in the rest of the system. The parameter `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT` defines the width of the output synchronized reset signal. The attributes set for the register help in making optimizations and setting constraints suitable for safe synchronization of the asynchronous reset signal."

It is used to initialize or reset the system hardware, ensuring that the system starts from a known state. In this module, it is synchronized to the clock to avoid metastability issues.\n- `clk` is the clock input signal. It is used to trigger state transitions in the flip-flops within the module, effectively controlling the timing and synchronization of the reset signal (`reset_n`) across the hardware system.\n\nOutput ports: reset_n_sync.\nExplanation:\n- `reset_n_sync` is the output synchronized reset signal. It is derived from synchronizing the input reset signal (`reset_n`) with the clock (`clk`) using multiple stages. It provides a stable and synchronized reset signal to downstream digital circuits, reducing the risk of metastability due to asynchronous reset signals. The output ensures that the reset activation/deactivation aligns properly with the clock cycles, enhancing the reliability of the system operation."
