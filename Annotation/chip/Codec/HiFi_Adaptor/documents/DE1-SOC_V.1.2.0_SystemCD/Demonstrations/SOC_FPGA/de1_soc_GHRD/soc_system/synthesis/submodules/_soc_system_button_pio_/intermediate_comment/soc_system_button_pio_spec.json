    "spec": "Module name: soc_system_button_pio.\nModule specification: The 'soc_system_button_pio' is a programmable input/output controller for managing button press functionalities in a System-on-Chip (SoC). This module processes button press inputs and generates interrupts based on configured conditions. It interfaces with external systems through input ports such as 'address', 'chipselect', 'clk', 'in_port', 'reset_n', 'write_n', and 'writedata', with each serving specific roles, including selecting internal registers, enabling module operation, syncing operations to the system clock, receiving button states, providing an asynchronous reset, indicating read/write operations, and holding data for configurations respectively. The output ports 'irq' and 'readdata' are used to signal interrupts when button press requirements are met and to provide data based on read operations, respectively.\n\nInternally, the module utilizes several signals: 'clk_en' is a permanent clock enable; 'data_in' directly represents the button input states; 'd1_data_in' and 'd2_data_in' delay stages for edge detection; 'edge_capture' records detected button press edges; 'irq_mask' filters which presses can generate interrupts; 'read_mux_out' directs read output; and 'edge_detect' identifies button press edges. The code is structured into several blocks: assignment of constant values, conditional operations for setting or resetting based on 'reset_n', address-based read/write operations for irq configurations, and edge detection handling specifically designed to respond dynamically to button presses. Each block has a distinct function, from data handling and signal preparation to dynamic response to changes and configuration settings, ensuring robust handling of button inputs and interrupts within digital systems.\n",

The main features include detecting button presses and generating interrupts.

Each bit corresponds to the state (pressed or unpressed) of a different button.\n- `reset_n` (1 bit): Asynchronous reset input, active low. Resets the internal states of the module when low.\n- `write_n` (1 bit): Write enable signal, active low. Determines whether the operation is a read (high) or a write (low).\n- `writedata` (32 bits): Data to be written into the module during write operations, such as configuring irq masks or resetting edge captures.\n\nOutput ports: [irq, readdata].\nExplanation: \n- `irq` (1 bit): Interrupt request output. Goes high to signal an external controller that an interrupt condition has been met based on button presses and irq mask settings.\n- `readdata` (32 bits): Outputs data from the module in response to read operations, such as current button state, irq mask, or status of edge captures depending on the address accessed."

This module processes button press inputs and generates interrupts based on configured conditions. It interfaces with external systems through input ports such as 'address', 'chipselect', 'clk', 'in_port', 'reset_n', 'write_n', and 'writedata', with each serving specific roles, including selecting internal registers, enabling module operation, syncing operations to the system clock, receiving button states, providing an asynchronous reset, indicating read/write operations, and holding data for configurations respectively. The output ports 'irq' and 'readdata' are used to signal interrupts when button press requirements are met and to provide data based on read operations, respectively.\n\nInternally, the module utilizes several signals: 'clk_en' is a permanent clock enable; 'data_in' directly represents the button input states; 'd1_data_in' and 'd2_data_in' delay stages for edge detection; 'edge_capture' records detected button press edges; 'irq_mask' filters which presses can generate interrupts; 'read_mux_out' directs read output; and 'edge_detect' identifies button press edges. The code is structured into several blocks: assignment of constant values, conditional operations for setting or resetting based on 'reset_n', address-based read/write operations for irq configurations, and edge detection handling specifically designed to respond dynamically to button presses. Each block has a distinct function, from data handling and signal preparation to dynamic response to changes and configuration settings, ensuring robust handling of button inputs and interrupts within digital systems.\n"
