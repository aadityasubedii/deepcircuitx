Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements an SoC interconnect between an HPS and a master component, 
managing AXI transactions. It uses address routers, width adapters, demultiplexers, 
multiplexers, and a traffic limiter to handle data routing, protocol conversions, 
arbitration, and data width adaptations. The module supports separate read and write 
channels, facilitating efficient communication between different interfaces in the system.
