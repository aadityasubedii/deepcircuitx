Module name: hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_memphy. Module specification: This module is a memory interface controller for an SDRAM system, designed for use in a Hard Processor System (HPS). It handles physical layer interactions between the SDRAM memory and the rest of the system, including address and command signals, data read/write operations, clock management, and reset control. The module has numerous input and output ports for various control signals, data, and configuration parameters. Key inputs include reset signals, PLL-related signals, AFI (Application-FPGA Interface) signals for memory operations, and configuration parameters. Outputs include memory interface signals, status signals, and data. Internal signals handle data transfer between DDIO logic and memory, control various aspects of the memory interface, and manage clock and reset signals. The module is divided into several blocks, including a reset controller, clock management, DDIO (Double Data
