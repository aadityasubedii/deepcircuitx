    "module": "Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc` module manages clock signals for SDRAM interfacing within FPGAs, deriving various operational clocks from PLL sources. It inputs four clocks, processes them through conditional buffering, delay chains, and phase selectors, and outputs five configured clock signals for different facets of memory operations. Key components include clock buffers, delay chains, and phase-select mechanisms which optimize clock phases and alignments as per configurations and operational demands."
