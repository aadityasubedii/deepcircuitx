It employs both JTAG-based streaming and a transaction-based approach facilitated through a PLI (Programming Language Interface) port. The module manages input and output data signals, handling valid signals and data presence, confirming data readiness from and to these interfaces and controlling the reset request signals. Primarily, it functions to synchronize and control data flow effectively across different communication protocols within a digital system environment."
