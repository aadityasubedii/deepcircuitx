The module generates multiple clock signals based on the input clocks (pll_hr_clk, pll_dq_clk, pll_dqs_clk) using various components like clock buffers and delay chains. It conditions these clocks \u2014 manages delays, phases, and inverts them under configurable settings \u2014 to meet the requirements of different SDRAM timing constraints. The module supports configurations for different operational modes (e.g., high-performance horizontal pass) and adapts clock signals accordingly for optimal memory interfacing."

This output could be serving specific custom operations or settings applied to the address/command clock.\n- `hr_clk`: This output, derived from the high-resolution clock input (potentially through a phase select mechanism), serves broader purposes across the system requiring precisely conditioned high-resolution signals."

It serves as a foundational clock for processes within the module that require the high-resolution clock.\n- `phy_clk_dq`: Similar to `phy_clk_hr`, this signal is derived from `pll_dq_clk` and is specifically tailored for data queue operations within the module.\n- `phy_clk_dqs`: Derived from `pll_dqs_clk`, this clock signal aligns with data strobe operations, ensuring proper timing and synchronization within the SDRAM interfacing.\n- `phy_clk_dqs_2x`: A specific doubled frequency output of the `phy_clk_dqs`, possibly used for higher operation modes or specific memory operations requiring faster clock rates. It's set to zero in certain configurations, indicating that it might be conditional or optional based on module settings.\n- `phy_clk_addr_cmd` and `phy_clk_addr_cmd_cps`: These signals are placeholders in the code and are not explicitly defined within the existing module script. They imply potential usage for addressing and command operation clocks that could be conditioned or processed separately.\n- `leveled_dqs_clocks`: This signal array is the output of a delay chain that processes `phy_clk_dqs`. It represents phase-leveled or delay-adjusted signals derived from `phy_clk_dqs` and is used to generate critical timing-specific clocks like `afi_clk`.\n- `leveled_hr_clocks`: Generated similarly to `leveled_dqs_clocks` but from `phy_clk_hr`, this array consists of clocks that have been adjusted for phase and delay, and it's primarily used to generate the `avl_clk`.\n- `hr_seq_clock`: An output from a clock phase selector module that takes `leveled_hr_clocks` as an input, this clock is finely tuned concerning phase settings and outputs as `hr_clk`, serving high precision needs in the system."
