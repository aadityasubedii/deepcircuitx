Module-level comment: The "altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface" module interfaces with Altera's JTAG for data streaming in debugging contexts. It supports communication via two streams: upstream (to the host) and downstream (from the host), operating in either normal or PLI mode based on the USE_PLI parameter. The module seamlessly manages data flow and validity using internal signals and conditional blocks, utilizing either 'altera_jtag_dc_streaming' or 'altera_pli_streaming' submodules dictated by the current mode for effective data handling.
