The module processes incoming signals like `in_valid`, `in_ready`, and `in_endofpacket` to compute symbol credits and packet credits dynamically. The symbol credits are updated based either directly per beat or based on a rollover mechanism determined by a ratio of symbols per beat to symbols per credit. Packet credits are incremented each time an end-of-packet condition occurs while the user-defined condition is met. The module operates under a synchronous reset and is parameterized to facilitate adjustments for various credit computation strategies."

The module uses this input to decide when to process data and update credits.\n- in_ready: Suggests the readiness of the module to accept data. This input is used together with 'in_valid' for handshake synchronization to control the credit calculations.\n- in_endofpacket: A flag indicating the end of a packet. This input is crucial for packet-based credit computation as it triggers the increment of packet credits when an end-of-packet condition coincides with ready and valid data signals.\n\nOutput ports: [symbol_credits, packet_credits].  \nExplanation:\n- symbol_credits: A 16-bit output that indicates the number of symbol credits available. The number of symbol credits increases based on the calculations performed per beat and affected by the ratio of symbols per beat to symbols per credit.\n- packet_credits: A 16-bit output that represents the available packet credits. This output is incremented each time an end-of-packet (EOP) condition is detected during a valid and ready data transmission, reflecting the module's ability to handle new packets."

This signal is fundamental in determining when to process incoming data and adjust credit counters.\n- eop_beat: Stands for 'end of packet beat', calculated by checking if both 'beat' and 'in_endofpacket' are true. This signal is essential for determining the timing when packet credits must be incremented, based on the reception of a complete packet.\n- sym_count: A counter used to track the number of symbols processed. This is especially relevant when the number of symbols per beat is not evenly divisible by the number of symbols per credit, requiring accumulation until a credit can be issued.\n- next_sym_count: Represents the prospective next value of 'sym_count'. This signal is used to predict and prepare the next state of 'sym_count' based on current conditions of each beat.\n- rollover: A boolean signal that indicates whether a rollover condition occurs, meaning the 'sym_count' has accumulated sufficiently to count as a complete credit or it's the end of the packet. This signal is essential for resetting 'sym_count' and incrementing 'symbol_credits' under specific conditions."
