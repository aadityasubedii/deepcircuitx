Module-level comment: The SEG7_IF module interfaces with a 7-segment display, handling data display across multiple segments. It employs input and output ports for data manipulation and control signals, alongside internal registers for data storage and retrieval. Functionality is achieved through logic blocks managing reset, write, and read operations, orchestrated by the negative edge of the system clock to ensure synchronization and data integrity. Configurable parameters allow adjustments for display properties and operation modes.
