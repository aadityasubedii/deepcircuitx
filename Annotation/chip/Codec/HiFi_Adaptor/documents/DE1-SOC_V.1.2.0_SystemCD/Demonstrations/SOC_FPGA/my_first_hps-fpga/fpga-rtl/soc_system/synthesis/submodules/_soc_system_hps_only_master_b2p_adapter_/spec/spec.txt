Module name: soc_system_hps_only_master_b2p_adapter. 
Module specification: The `soc_system_hps_only_master_b2p_adapter` acts as a straightforward pass-through adapter that efficiently transfers data while adhering to a ready-valid handshake protocol, synchronized by a clock signal. This module has multiple input ports: `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset_n` (asynchronous reset signal), `in_valid` (validity of incoming data), `in_data` (incoming data), `in_channel` (channel indication which affects data transfer), `in_startofpacket` and `in_endofpacket` (start and end indicators of data packets), and `out_ready` (readiness for accepting data on the output side). The output ports include `in_ready` (mirrors `out_ready`), `out_valid` (validity of the output data), `out_data` (output data), `out_startofpacket`, and `out_endofpacket` (which directly pass through from corresponding input signals). An internal signal, `out_channel`, holds the temporary value of `in_channel` and controls whether the outgoing data should be validated based on the channel's value, specifically suppressing `out_valid` when `in_channel` exceeds 0. The code block within `always @*` manages the direct passing of input signals to outputs, controls data suppression based on channel conditions, and ensures that `in_ready` status accurately reflects the output sideâ€™s readiness (`out_ready`).
