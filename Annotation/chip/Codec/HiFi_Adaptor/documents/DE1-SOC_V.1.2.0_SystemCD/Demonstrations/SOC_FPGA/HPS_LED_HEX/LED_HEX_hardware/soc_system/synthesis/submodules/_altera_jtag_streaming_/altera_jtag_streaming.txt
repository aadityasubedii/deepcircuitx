Module-level comment: The `altera_jtag_streaming` module facilitates JTAG data streaming for communication between JTAG and system logic. It handles data encoding, manages FIFO sizes through the `flog2` function, and operates under JTAG standards. Key inputs include clock and reset signals, while outputs handle processed data and management signals. Internally, state machines manage data transactions accompanied by synchronization mechanisms across clock domains, while conditional blocks enable management functionalities based on configuration.
