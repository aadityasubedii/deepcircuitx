Module name: hps_sdram_p0_iss_probe. 
Module specification: The hps_sdram_p0_iss_probe is designed for probing and monitoring the signals interfacing with SDRAM in a hardware design, particularly useful in debugging and analysis within a JTAG environment. The module has a single input port, `probe_input`, which is an array with a width defined by the parameter `WIDTH`. This input is essential for feeding the internal probing mechanism with data from the SDRAM interface. There are no explicit output ports; instead, output functionalities are managed internally through connections to a debugging or test suite. Internally, the module uses several signals like `clrn`, `ena`, `jtag_state_xxx`, `raw_tck`, etc., which are typical for JTAG operations but are unconnected in this module. The module includes an instance of `altsource_probe`, named `iss_probe_inst`, which connects the `probe_input` to the probe functionality of the altsource_probe; however, other usual JTAG interfacing lines such as `tdi`, `tdo`, and the various `jtag_state_xxx` signals remain unconnected. Parameter configurations for the `iss_probe_inst` are set to manage properties like metastability, instance indexing, and initial values for the source, emphasizing the moduleâ€™s role in a controlled test or debug environment devoid of direct signal output manipulation.
