Module-level comment: The `soc_system_jtag_uart` module manages JTAG UART I/O operations through FIFOs, ensuring robust data handling via checks for overflow and managing interrupts. It incorporates submodules for both reading and writing FIFOs, handles interrupt generation based on FIFO statuses, and manipulates flags that guide data transfers and system responses. This implementation facilitates effective interfacing within a system-on-chip environment.
