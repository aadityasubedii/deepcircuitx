Module name: altera_jtag_streaming. 
Module specification: The `altera_jtag_streaming` module manages JTAG streaming for coordination of data transfers between JTAG and system logic, aimed at debug transports or data communication paths. It handles various operations such as data encoding/decoding, managing FIFO buffer sizes, and adapting to JTAG operation standards. Input ports include `tck` (Test Clock), `reset_n` (active low reset), `sink_data` (data input from a source for JTAG), `sink_valid` (validity of sink_data), `sink_ready` (readiness to accept data), `clock_to_sample`, and `reset_to_sample`. Output ports are `tck`, `source_data` (processed data output), `source_valid` (validity of source data), `sink_ready`, `resetrequest`, `debug_reset`, `mgmt_valid`, `mgmt_channel`, and `mgmt_data`. Internally, the module uses a diverse range of signals such as `ir_out`, `ir_in`, `tdo`, `tdi`, `sdr`, `cdr`, `udr` for managing JTAG TAP states, and others like `write_state`, `read_state` for tracking current operational states. The internal counters and flags manage data alignment, transmission readiness, and protocol adherence. Key blocks include the JTAG SLD node, idle data inserters and removers to manage idle frames in data streams, and synchronization blocks to maintain signal integrity across different clock domains. Enhanced features like management data handling are conditionally included based on parameter settings, facilitated through conditional generation. This module is fundamental in establishing a robust communication interface leveraging JTAG standards for system debugging and management data transfer.
