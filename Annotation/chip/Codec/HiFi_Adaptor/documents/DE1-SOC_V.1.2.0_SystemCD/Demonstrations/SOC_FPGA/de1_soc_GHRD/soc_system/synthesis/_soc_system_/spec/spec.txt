Module name: soc_system. Module specification: This module implements a System-on-Chip (SoC) design that integrates a Hard Processor System (HPS) with various peripherals and memory interfaces. The module's main inputs include system clock (clk_clk), reset (reset_reset_n), and various I/O signals for Ethernet, QSPI, SD card, USB, SPI, UART, and GPIO interfaces. Its outputs comprise memory interface signals, Ethernet transmit signals, and control signals for various peripherals. Internal signals facilitate communication between different components, including AXI interconnects, memory-mapped interfaces, and interrupt handling. The module consists of several key blocks: an HPS component, onchip memory, master interfaces (secure and non-secure), peripheral controllers (LED, button, and DIP switch PIOs), a JTAG UART, and an interrupt capturer.
