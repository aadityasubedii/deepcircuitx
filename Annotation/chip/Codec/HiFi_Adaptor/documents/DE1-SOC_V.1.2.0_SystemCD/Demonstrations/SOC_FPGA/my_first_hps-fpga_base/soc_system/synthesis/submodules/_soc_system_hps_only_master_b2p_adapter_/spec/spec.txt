Module name: soc_system_hps_only_master_b2p_adapter. 
Module specification: The soc_system_hps_only_master_b2p_adapter serves as an interface adapter between different system components, facilitating data transfer while managing signal validity and packet boundaries. It features input ports including `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset_n` (active low reset signal), `in_ready` (indicates readiness to accept data), `in_valid` (validity of the input data), `in_data` (8-bit data input), `in_channel` (8-bit channel number for routing or addressing), `in_startofpacket` (signal for the start of a data packet), and `in_endofpacket` (signal for the end of a data packet). Output ports consist of `out_ready` (signals readiness to upstream components), `out_valid` (validity of the output data), `out_data` (8-bit direct pass-through data output), `out_startofpacket`, and `out_endofpacket` (mirroring input packet boundary signals). An internal signal, `out_channel`, is used as a register to hold the channel number from `in_channel`; it is critical in conditional logic where if `in_channel` is greater than zero, `out_valid` is set low, deactivating output validity. The module's operations are coordinated in an `always` block, which handles signal assignments and conditions, ensuring proper data flow and signal integrity throughout the transaction process.
