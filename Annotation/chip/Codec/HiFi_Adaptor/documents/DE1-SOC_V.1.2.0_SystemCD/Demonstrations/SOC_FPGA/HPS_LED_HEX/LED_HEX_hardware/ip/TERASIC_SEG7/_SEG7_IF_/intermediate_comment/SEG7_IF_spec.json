    "spec": "Module name: SEG7_IF. Module specification: The SEG7_IF module is designed to interface with a seven-segment display, controlling the state of each segment to display the desired output. It operates on a clock signal `s_clk`, and features input ports for address (`s_address`), read (`s_read`), write (`s_write`), data for writing (`s_writedata`), and reset (`s_reset`). The output ports include `s_readdata` for outputting data from read operations and `SEG7` for sending the segment states directly to a seven-segment display. Internal signals such as `base_index`, `write_data`, `read_data`, and `reg_file` aid in data manipulation and storage; `base_index` calculates the segment register index, `write_data` holds the write data temporarily, `read_data` stores data read from `reg_file`, and `reg_file` maintains the states of all segments across displays. The Verilog code mainly consists of three sections driven by a negative edge triggered always block: reset handling sets all segments to a default state (`DEFAULT_ACTIVE`), write operations update `reg_file` as specified by the address and data inputs, and read operations populate `read_data` from `reg_file` at the specified address. Lastly, output assignments adjust `SEG7` based on `LOW_ACTIVE` configuration and set `s_readdata` from `read_data`. This modular design effectively manages display updates and state reads with adaptable configurations for different display types.",

The module uses its inputs to either reset the display, write data to specific segments based on address input, or read the state of specific segments. Outputs include the segment data as well as the read data when requested. The behavior of the module is clocked on the negative edge of 's_clk', and includes capabilities to clear the display to a default state upon reset, and the ability to invert the output based on configuration if active low display is used."
