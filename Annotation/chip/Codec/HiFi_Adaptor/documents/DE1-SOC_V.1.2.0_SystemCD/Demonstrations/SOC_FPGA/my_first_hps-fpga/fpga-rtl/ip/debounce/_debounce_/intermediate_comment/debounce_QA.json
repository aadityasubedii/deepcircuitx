It features parameters that allow configuration of data width, input polarity, and timeout settings, which help in defining how long a signal must remain stable before it is considered as valid. The module works by using counters for each input bit. Each counter increments whenever the input line is active, as determined by the specified polarity and if the counter's current value is below a timeout threshold. If the counter reaches the timeout value and the input state persists, the corresponding output bit is set to a stable high or low value, based on the input polarity. The outputs are reset when the input toggles or when the reset signal is active."

When driven low, it resets the internal counters to 0, initializing the module to a known state.\n- data_in: This is the digital input vector, having a width defined by the parameter WIDTH. Each bit of data_in is individually monitored for stability and is debounced through respective counters.\n\nOutput ports: data_out.\nExplanation:\n- data_out: This is the output vector of the module, also having a width defined by the parameter WIDTH. Each bit in this output vector represents the debounced state of the corresponding bit in the data_in input vector.

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: counter, counter_reset, counter_enable.\nExplanation:\n- **counter**: This is an array of registers, with each register corresponding to a bit of the input vector `data_in`. Each counter in this array has a width defined by `TIMEOUT_WIDTH`. These counters are used to track the duration for which each input bit remains at a consistent logic level. If a bit in the `data_in` remains high (or low, depending on the POLARITY) consistently for a duration equal to the TIMEOUT parameter, the counter's value is used to determine if the output should be toggled or remain stable.\n- **counter_reset**: This is an array of wires, each corresponding to a counter in the `counter` array. Based on the POLARITY and the current state of the corresponding `data_in` bit, these signals determine when to reset the counter to zero. If POLARITY is \"HIGH\", the counter for a bit is reset when that bit in `data_in` goes to zero, and vice versa for \"LOW\" polarity.\n- **counter_enable**: This is an array of wires that enables the counting for each bit's corresponding counter in the `counter` array. These are activated only when the `data_in` bit is consistent with the POLARITY and the current counter value is less than the TIMEOUT. This signal ensures that the counter does not exceed the TIMEOUT value, managing when the count should increment based on the input condition and the existing count on each channel."
