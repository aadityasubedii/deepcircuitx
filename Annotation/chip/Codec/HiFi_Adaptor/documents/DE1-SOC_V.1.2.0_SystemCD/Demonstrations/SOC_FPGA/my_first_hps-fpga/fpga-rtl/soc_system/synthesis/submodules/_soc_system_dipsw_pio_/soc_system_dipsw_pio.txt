Module-level comment: The `soc_system_dipsw_pio` module interfaces with dip switches on a SoC, reading their states, detecting edges, and generating interrupts. It uses internal registers (`d1_data_in`, `d2_data_in`) for debouncing and `edge_capture` to log state changes. Configuration via `writedata` allows customization of interrupt conditions via `irq_mask`. Outputs include an interrupt signal (`irq`) and data from selected registers (`readdata`). The module ensures synchronization and operation stability by continuously checking signals like `reset_n` and `clk`.
