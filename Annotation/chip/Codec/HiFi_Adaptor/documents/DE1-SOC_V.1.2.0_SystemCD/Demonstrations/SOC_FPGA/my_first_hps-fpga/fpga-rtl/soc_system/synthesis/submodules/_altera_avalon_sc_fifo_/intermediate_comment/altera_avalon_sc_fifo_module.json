    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a parameterizable FIFO for Avalon streaming interfaces, supporting packet handling and flow control. It uses a memory array for data storage, with read and write pointers for queue management. The module handles data input/output, packet signaling, and error detection. It supports various configurations like store-and-forward, cut-through, and drop-on-error modes. The implementation includes fill level tracking, almost full/empty signaling, and a control/status register interface for runtime configuration."
