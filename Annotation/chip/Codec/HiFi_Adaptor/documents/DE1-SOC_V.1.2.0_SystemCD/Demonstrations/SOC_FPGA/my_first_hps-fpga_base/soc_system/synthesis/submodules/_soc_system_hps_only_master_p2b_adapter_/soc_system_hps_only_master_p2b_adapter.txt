Module-level comment: The 'soc_system_hps_only_master_p2b_adapter' module serves as a bridge between two bus protocols, transferring and mirroring 8-bit data packets and control signals from input to output. It utilizes simple pass-through logic in an always block where input signals like 'in_valid', 'in_data', and packet delimiters are directly assigned to their respective outputs, with readiness signaled by 'out_ready'. The 'in_channel', set to zero, defines the data packetâ€™s channel statically.
