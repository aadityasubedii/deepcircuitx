This resets subsystems like Advanced Front-Side Bus (AFI) clocks, address/command clocks, and others. The reset process does not start unless specific conditions are met, such as the PLL being locked and global and soft reset signals being inactive. Additionally, the module uses parameterized and instantiated synchronous reset modules to ensure that reset signals across different parts of the SDRAM controller are de-asserted in synchronization with the respective local clocks to avoid metastability issues."
