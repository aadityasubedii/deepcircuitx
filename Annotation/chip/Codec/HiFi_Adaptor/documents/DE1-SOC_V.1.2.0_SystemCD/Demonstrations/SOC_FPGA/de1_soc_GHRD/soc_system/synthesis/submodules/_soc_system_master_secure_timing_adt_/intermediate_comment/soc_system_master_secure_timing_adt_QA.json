When the input is valid, the data is buffered internally and then sent out as `out_data` when the receiving component (`out_ready`) is ready to accept new data. The `out_valid` signal indicates the validity of the outgoing data. The module also contains a safety mechanism to display a message when the downstream component indicates it\u2019s not ready (backpressuring), and thus upstream components cannot push more data, this is logged every time `in_ready` is negated."
