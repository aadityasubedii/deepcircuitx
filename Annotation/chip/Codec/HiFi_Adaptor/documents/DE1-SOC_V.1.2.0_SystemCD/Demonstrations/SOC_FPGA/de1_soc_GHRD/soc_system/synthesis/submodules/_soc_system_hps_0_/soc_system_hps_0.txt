Module-level comment: This module interfaces FPGA logic with a Hard Processor System (HPS) in a SoC design. It routes various communication protocols (AXI, memory, and peripheral I/O) between external ports and two sub-modules: fpga_interfaces and hps_io. The module performs parameter checks to ensure correct instantiation and acts as a top-level wrapper, connecting external signals to appropriate internal sub-modules without additional logic.
