Module-level comment: The 'credit_producer' module generates credits for symbol and packet transmissions, using inputs like `in_valid`, `in_ready`, and `in_endofpacket` to manage credit allocation. It features internal logic to handle various credit configurations, conditionally updating credits based on system-configured parameters and transmission status. Essential operations are synchronized with the clock input (`clk`) and initialized with an active-low reset (`reset_n`). The module effectively supports flexible credit strategies in data transmission systems.
