It connects between an input and an output interface, which handle data in an 8-bit format. The main functionalities include:\n- Detecting and removing any idle characters (identified as hexadecimal \"4A\").\n- Recognizing and processing escape characters (identified as hexadecimal \"4D\"). When an escape character is received, the subsequent character's value is modified by XORing with \"20\" (hexadecimal). \n- Managing the flow control between the input and output by ensuring that data is received and transmitted only when both ends are ready. The module uses the `in_ready` signal to indicate readiness to accept data if the output side is ready, and uses the `out_valid` and `out_data` signals to send out adjusted data, omitting idle characters, and transforming characters following the escape character."

This signal is used to determine whether the incoming data should be processed.\n- `in_data` (input data): 8-bit data input which the module processes. This port receives the data stream that may include escape characters and idle characters.\n- `out_ready` (output ready): Indicates whether the next stage in the data path is ready to receive data. It is used for flow control to ensure the module only outputs data when the recipient is ready.\n\nOutput ports: in_ready, out_valid, out_data.\nExplanation:\n- `in_ready` (input ready): Indicates that the module is ready to receive data. This signal is used to control the flow of data into the module, set high when the module can accept more data.\n- `out_valid` (output valid): Signifies that the data on the `out_data` port is valid and should be read by whatever module or element is downstream.\n- `out_data` (output data): 8-bit output data that has been processed to either remove idle characters or modify characters following an escape character."
