Module name: soc_system_dipsw_pio.  
Module specification: The `soc_system_dipsw_pio` module is responsible for interfacing with a set of dip switches, facilitating the reading of switch states, handling interrupts via edge detection, and managing reset conditions. The module has several input ports including `address` for selecting internal registers, `chipselect` for module enable, `clk` serving as the main clock, `in_port` reflecting the state of dip switches, `reset_n` for reset operations, `write_n` for controlling write operations, and `writedata` carrying data to be written into internal registers. Output ports include `irq` for interrupt requests and `readdata` for reading data from internal registers. Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `clk_en` for enabling clock-sensitive operations, latched dip switch states (`d1_data_in`, `d2_data_in`), `data_in` for live states of the switches, `edge_detect` for recognizing state changes, `edge_capture` for maintaining detected edges, `irq_mask` for masking interrupts, and a multiplexer output `read_mux_out` for determining the output based on address input. The code consists of several always blocks handling the synchronization and updating of these internal states based on clocks and reset signals, setting up appropriate conditions for reading and writing operations guided by the signaling and register settings within the module.
