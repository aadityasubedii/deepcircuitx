Module-level comment: The HPS_LED_HEX module interfaces with FPGA and HPS, managing data transfer and control to peripherals like LEDs and HEX displays. It processes inputs from various clocks, user interfaces, and communication devices while controlling outputs for DDR3, Ethernet, and other HPS components. Internally, it uses specific signals like clk_148_5 for custom timings and integrates complex functionalities through the `soc_system` instantiation which connects peripherals and memory interfaces to the HPS, ensuring synchronized operation and efficient data handling.
