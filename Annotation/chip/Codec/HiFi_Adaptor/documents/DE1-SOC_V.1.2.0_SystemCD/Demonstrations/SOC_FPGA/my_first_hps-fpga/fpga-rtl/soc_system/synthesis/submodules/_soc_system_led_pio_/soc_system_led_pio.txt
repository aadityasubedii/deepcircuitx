Module-level comment: The 'soc_system_led_pio' module is designed for LED data management via input and output operations synchronized with system clocks. It handles inputs through port signals for command and data control and outputs state information directly to LEDs and as data readouts. Internally, it utilizes registers for storing data states and implements conditional logic to process write operations and reset functionalities, outputting the current data states based on the selected address. This module efficiently manages and reflects external control over LED states in real time.
