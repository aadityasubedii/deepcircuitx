Module name: hps_sdram_p0_iss_probe. Module specification: The `hps_sdram_p0_iss_probe` module is designed primarily for signal integrity probing in digital system designs, specifically for debugging purposes within an FPGA context dealing with SDRAM operations. This module uses an instance of `altsource_probe` named `iss_probe_inst` to monitor the `probe_input` signal. The module accepts only one input port named `probe_input`, a digital signal of configurable width determined by the `WIDTH` parameter. There are no output ports in this module, and no internal signals are explicitly declared for additional processing; all functionality is encapsulated within the `altsource_probe` instance. In the code, apart from the instantiation of `altsource_probe`, specific parameters such as disabling metastability, setting instance ID, and configuring probe width are set using `defparam`. These parameters guide the operation of the `altsource_probe` to cater to specific requirements of probing and signal monitoring in the given digital system environment.
