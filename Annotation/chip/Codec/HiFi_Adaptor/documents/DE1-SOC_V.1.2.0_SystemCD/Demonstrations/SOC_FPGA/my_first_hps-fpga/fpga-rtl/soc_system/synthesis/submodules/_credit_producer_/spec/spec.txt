Module name: credit_producer. 
Module specification: The 'credit_producer' module is a Verilog module designed to calculate and manage credit counts for symbols and packets in a data transmission system. It relies on input signals: 'clk' (clock signal), 'reset_n' (active-low reset), 'in_valid' (data validity), 'in_ready' (readiness to accept data), and 'in_endofpacket' (indicates the end of a packet). The output registers are 'symbol_credits' and 'packet_credits', tracking the number of symbol and packet credits, respectively. Internally, the module uses signals such as 'beat' (shows data processing events), 'eop_beat' (indicates end of a packet during a beat), 'sym_count' and 'next_sym_count' (utilized for managing symbols per credit calculations), and 'rollover' (flags needing an update in credit calculations). The code is structured into several blocks: initialization of internal registers, symbol credit calculations that adjust based on the configured ratios of symbols per credit and symbols per beat, and packet credit updating based on packet terminations detected. Multiple configurations and parameters, such as 'SYMBOLS_PER_CREDIT', permit flexibility and dynamic adjustments suited for various transmission scenarios. The module is robust in maintaining credit counts synchronously with respect to the provided clock signal.
