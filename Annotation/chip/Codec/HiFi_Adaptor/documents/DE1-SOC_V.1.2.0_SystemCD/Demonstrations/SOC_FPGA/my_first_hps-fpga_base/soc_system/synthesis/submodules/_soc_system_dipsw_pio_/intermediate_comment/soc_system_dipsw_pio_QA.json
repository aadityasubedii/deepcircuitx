It monitors a 10-bit input port (in_port), detects edges (changes), and can generate interrupts based on these changes if they are unmasked. The interrupts are controlled by an IRQ mask and edge detection logic. The module supports reading of the current input port status, the IRQ mask, and the edge capture status through specific addressable registers. It offers functionality to reset edge captures when programmed through corresponding writes to the control registers. Additionally, the module is sensitive to both positive edges of the clock and a negative edge of the reset signal, ensuring proper synchronization and initial reset state respectively."

It's used in conditional checks where clock enable logic might usually be implemented, although in this particular code, it directly allows operations under clock conditions.\n- `d1_data_in`: A registered version of the `data_in`.

It represents the current status of the input port and is used as the primary signal to detect edges and manage IRQ conditions.\n- `edge_capture`: A set of registers used to capture and maintain the status of detected edges.

Detected edges are used to update the `edge_capture` registers conditionally.\n- `irq_mask`: A register holding the interrupt mask setting, which specifies which bits of the `edge_detect` results are relevant for triggering an interrupt (`irq`).\n- `read_mux_out`: A multiplexed output based on the value of the `address` input, used to select between `data_in`, `irq_mask`, and `edge_capture` values to load into `readdata` register for external reads.
