It serves as an input to the delay chain for further processing in generating the leveled DQS clocks.\n- **phy_clk_dq**: Similar to `phy_clk_dqs`, this wire is utilized for the DQ clock signal, either directly from the `pll_dq_clk` or via a clock buffer. It's utilized less explicitly in this module context but forms part of the foundational clock structure.\n- **phy_clk_hr**: Holds the high-resolution (HR) clock signal either directly from `pll_hr_clk` or buffered, and acts as an input to delay chains and phase selectors to produce leveled and sequence clocks respectively for HR applications.\n- **phy_clk_dqs_2x**: Represents a double-frequency DQS clock, derived from clock buffering but is set to `1'b0` (constant zero) when the HHP configuration is active. Its usage seems minimal or specific to certain configurations as per module design.\n- **phy_clk_addr_cmd**: Although declared, `phy_clk_addr_cmd` is not used or assigned any value in the provided module code, possibly reserved for expansion or specific conditions not covered in the snippet.\n- **phy_clk_addr_cmd_cps**: Similar to `phy_clk_addr_cmd`, this signal is declared but not utilized within the visible scope of the module.
