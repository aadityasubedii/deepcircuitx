Module-level comment: This module converts packets to Avalon-MM master transactions. It receives input packets, processes them using a FIFO buffer, and generates read/write operations on an Avalon-MM master interface. The module supports incremental and non-incremental operations, with two operational modes: a fast version using separate packet-to-FIFO and FIFO-to-packet submodules, and a simpler version directly converting packets to master transactions. The FAST_VER parameter controls the mode selection.
