It interfaces with source and sink channels, handling data flows depending on the `USE_PLI` parameter. If the `USE_PLI` is set to 0, it configures the data stream using the `altera_jtag_dc_streaming` sub-module with specific FIFO sizes and management channel widths. Meanwhile, if `USE_PLI` is set to 1, it uses the `altera_pli_streaming` sub-module configured with a specific PLI port. This interface also manages system resets and debugging through signals like `resetrequest` and `debug_reset`."
