Module name: hps_sdram_p0_reset. 
Module specification: The hps_sdram_p0_reset module is designed to handle reset synchronization for various clock domains associated with an SDRAM memory interface. It primarily takes multiple phase-locked loop (PLL) generated clock signals and reset indications to output synchronized reset signals appropriate for different parts of the memory subsystem operation. The input ports include `seq_reset_mem_stable`, multiple PLL clock inputs like `pll_afi_clk`, `pll_addr_cmd_clk` among others, a `pll_locked` signal which indicates PLL stability, and reset commands `global_reset_n`, `soft_reset_n`. The outputs include synchronized reset signals such as `reset_n_scc_clk`, `reset_n_avl_clk`, and others specific to various clock domains like `ctl_reset_n` and `reset_n_read_capture_clk` which manage controller and read capture resets. The module employs internal signals such as `phy_reset_n`, which is a combined signal ensuring global and soft resets are considered with PLL lock status. Another internal signal `phy_reset_mem_stable_n` further conditions the reset release based on memory stability. Key sections of the code utilize instances of a sub-module, `hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync`, which are parameterized to manage synchronization for specific clocks, ensuring stability and functionality across the SDRAM's operational domains. Each instance is tailored with specific synchronization stages and outputs, handling different requirements from control logic to memory read operations, thereby ensuring that all sections of the memory subsystem are aligned with their respective clock domains for stable operation.
