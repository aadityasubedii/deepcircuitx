Module-level comment: The `soc_system_master_secure_timing_adt` module is designed for synchronous data transfer in digital systems. It acts as a pass-through, mirroring input data validity directly to output while managing data buffers (`in_payload` and `out_payload`) based on input (`in_valid`, `in_data`) and output readiness (`out_ready`). The module ensures data integrity and responds to backpressure via internal signal controls (`ready`, `in_ready`) and utilizes debugging messages when backpressure is detected.
