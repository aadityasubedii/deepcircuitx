It takes a vector of interrupt signals as input and registers them on the rising edge of a clock or during a reset condition. The module operates with a parameterizable number of interrupts (NUM_INTR). Depending on the number of interrupts (exceeding 32 or not), it manages the interrupts in one or two 32-bit registers. The specific interrupt data to be read is selected based on an address input, allowing access to either the lower or higher 32 bits of the interrupt data. The output read data is presented with a wait state implemented by a register that captures the chosen interrupt data on each clock edge, ensuring data stability for the output."

When asserted (low), it resets the internal registers of the module to known default values.\n- `interrupt_in`: This is a vector of interrupt signals. Its width is defined by the parameter `NUM_INTR` and it carries incoming interrupts that need to be captured by the module.\n- `addr`: This input is used to select the address which determines whether the lower 32 bits or the higher 32 bits (if available) of the interrupt register are accessed.\n- `read`: This input signal enables the read operation. When asserted, the module outputs the data from the address specified by the `addr` input.\n\nOutput ports: rddata.\nExplanation:\n- `rddata`: This is a 32-bit output data port that presents the data read from the interrupt registers.
