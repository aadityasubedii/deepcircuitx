Module name: altera_avalon_sc_fifo. Module specification: This module implements a parameterized, synthesizable FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer memory with various configurable features. It supports standard read and write operations, packet handling with start-of-packet and end-of-packet signals, and can be configured with different depths, data widths, and additional features like error and channel handling. The module has input ports for clock (clk), reset, data input (in_data), control signals (in_valid, in_startofpacket, in_endofpacket, in_empty, in_error, in_channel), and configuration (csr_address, csr_write, csr_read, csr_writedata). Output ports include data output (out_data), status signals (out_valid, out_startofpacket, out_endofpacket,
