Module name: soc_system_onchip_memory2_0.
Module specification: The `soc_system_onchip_memory2_0` module encapsulates an Altera-specific on-chip memory subsystem using the `altsyncram` component, tailored primarily for read and write memory operations within a system-on-chip (SoC) design. It incorporates several input ports: a 13-bit `address` for memory addressing, an 8-bit `byteenable` for byte-level control during read/write operations, a `chipselect` signal enabling the device, a `clk` (clock) for synchronization of operations, a `clken` (clock enable) which activates the module based on high signals, a `reset` for asynchronous resets, a `reset_req` for synchronous resets, a `write` signal enabling data writes when high, and a 64-bit `writedata` for data to be input during writes. It outputs `readdata`, a 64-bit output delivering data from addressed memory when read operations occur. Internally, the module utilizes `clocken0`, derived from the `clken` and negated `reset_req` ensuring operations are paused during a reset for stability, and `wren`, the outcome of `chipselect` and `write`, acting as a write enable. The `altsyncram` block configures the physical memory setup, operates the functionality to configure addressing, data handling, and other memory operations as defined by multiple parameter settings such as block type, operation mode, and memory width. This module serves as a fundamental element in managing memory operations intended to interface efficiently within higher-level designs requiring robust memory handling capability.
