The module processes signals to determine when a 'beat' (a valid transaction cycle where data is acknowledged as ready) occurs and when the end of a packet is reached. Credits are generated for symbols based on a predefined number of symbols per beat and per credit, and packet credits are incremented every time an end-of-packet condition is detected. The inclusion of parameters allows for flexibility in adapting the module to different symbol and packet crediting strategies. The operation of the module hinges on the synchronous processing of these signals, governed by the clock and reset inputs."

It is essential for timing the operations within the module, allowing the synchronous logic to execute based on the clock edges.\n- `reset_n`: This active-low reset input initializes the internal states and outputs of the module upon activation, ensuring the module starts in a known state.\n- `in_valid`: Signifies the validity of the input data. When high, it indicates that the current data input should be considered for processing.\n- `in_ready`: Indicates that the module is ready to accept the data. The beat calculation considers this signal to ensure credits are generated only when data is both valid and ready to be accepted.\n- `in_endofpacket`: Denotes the end of a packet. This input is used to manage the packet credits, incrementing the count whenever an end-of-packet scenario occurs.\n\n**Output ports**: `symbol_credits`, `packet_credits`.\n\n**Explanation**:\n- `symbol_credits`: Holds the count of symbol credits generated based on the number of symbols per beat and symbols required per credit. This register is incremented or adjusted according to the configured symbol crediting method.\n- `packet_credits`: Responsible for tracking the number of packets processed by the module. It increments each time an end-of-packet condition (signified by `in_endofpacket`) is detected.\n\nThese ports collectively support the module's functionality of credit management by correlating input conditions (such as validity, readiness, and packet completion) with credit accumulations, allowing it to serve in systems where flow control and credit management are necessary."

It represents the occurrence of a valid and ready data transaction within a single clock cycle. This signal is crucial for determining when to increment or adjust the symbol credits based on the system configuration.\n- `eop_beat`: This stands for 'end-of-packet beat' and is used to indicate the end of a packet during a valid and ready transaction (`beat`).
