Module name: intr_capturer. 
Module specification: The "intr_capturer" is a parameterized Verilog module designed to handle and capture interrupt signals for system management. It accommodates a variable number of interrupt inputs, defined by the `NUM_INTR` parameter. The module's primary functionality involves capturing interrupt signals from a bus `interrupt_in` and storing them into the `interrupt_reg` register. Key input ports include `clk` (clock input for synchronization), `rst_n` (active-low reset for initializing internal states), `interrupt_in` (interrupt signals bus), `addr` (address input for segment selection), and `read` (control signal for enabling the data read process). The module outputs the read interrupt data through the `rddata` port, which holds a 32-bit wide value. Internal signals such as `interrupt_reg`, `readdata_with_waitstate`, `act_readdata`, `readdata_lower_intr`, and `readdata_higher_intr` facilitate the storage, masking, selection, and output of the interrupt data based on the address and read signals. Additional control signals `access_lower_32` and `access_higher_32` are used to determine the accessed segment of `interrupt_reg`. The module structure includes an initial block for handling the `interrupt_reg` updates, a conditional generate block to accommodate systems with more than 32 interrupts by introducing high interrupts handling, and logic to manage the output data queuing through `readdata_with_waitstate`.
This holistic approach allows `intr_capturer` module to perform efficient interrupt capturing and conditional data access in synchronous digital systems, making it adaptable to various interrupt configurations.
