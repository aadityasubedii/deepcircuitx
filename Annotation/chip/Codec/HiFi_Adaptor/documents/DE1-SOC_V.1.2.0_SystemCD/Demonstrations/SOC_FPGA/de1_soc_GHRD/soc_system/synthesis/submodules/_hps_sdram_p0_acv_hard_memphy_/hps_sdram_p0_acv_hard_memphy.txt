Module-level comment: This module implements a memory interface (PHY) for an SDRAM controller in an FPGA-based Hard Processor System. It manages the physical layer interface between the memory controller and SDRAM chips, handling address/command signals, data read/write operations, and timing/calibration functions. The module integrates sub-components like reset logic, I/O pads, and a Cyclone V memory PHY, utilizing various clock domains and configuration parameters to support different memory types and sizes. It includes interfaces for calibration and testing, ensuring proper timing and signal integrity for reliable memory operations.
