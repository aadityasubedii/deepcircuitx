Module-level comment: The 'altera_avalon_st_packets_to_bytes' module transforms packet-based data conforming to the Avalon-ST protocol into a byte stream, employing control management for start/end of packets and channel differentiation. It utilizes internal flags and conditional processing blocks driven by 'CHANNEL_WIDTH' and 'ENCODING' parameters to serialize data correctly and manage packet boundaries and channel information, ensuring proper sequence and readiness of data output.
