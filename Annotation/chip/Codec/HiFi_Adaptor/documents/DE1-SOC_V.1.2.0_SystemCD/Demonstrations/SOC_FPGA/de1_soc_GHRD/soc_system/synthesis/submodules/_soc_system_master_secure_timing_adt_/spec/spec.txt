Module name: soc_system_master_secure_timing_adt.
Module specification: The soc_system_master_secure_timing_adt is designed for secure and timed data transfers between components within a system-on-chip (SoC). Its primary function is to control data flow by ensuring data validity and matching transfer timings with component readiness. The module features several input ports: `clk` (the clock input for timing operations), `reset_n` (an active-low reset to initialize the module's internal states), `in_valid` (indicating valid input data on `in_data`), `in_data` (an 8-bit data input from upstream components), and `out_ready` (a readiness signal from downstream components). The outputs include `out_valid` (indicating the validity of outgoing data) and `out_data` (the 8-bit output data bound for downstream). Internally, the module employs `in_payload` and `out_payload` registers for buffering and managing data flow. It uses a `ready` signal to mirror the `out_ready` status and `in_ready` to handle input readiness based on downstream component conditions, aiding in backpressure management. The module encompasses several key procedural blocks: the first block monitors `in_ready` and logs any backpressuring events signaled by downstream components. Another block initializes the internal buffer with incoming valid data and assigns output data from the internal payload. The final block links the state of output readiness and data validity to ensure synchronized transfers, reflecting the readiness state back to the input side to manage data flow continuity effectively.
