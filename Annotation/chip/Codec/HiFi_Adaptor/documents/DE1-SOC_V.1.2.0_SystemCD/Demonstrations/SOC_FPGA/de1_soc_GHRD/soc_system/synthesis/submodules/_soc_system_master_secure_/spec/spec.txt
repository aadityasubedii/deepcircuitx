Module name: soc_system_master_secure. 

Module specification: The `soc_system_master_secure` module is designed for secure master operations in a System-on-Chip environment, leveraging the Avalon-ST protocol for interfacing and data handling. The module includes numerous input and output ports: `clk_clk` and `clk_reset_reset` serve as the main clock and synchronous reset respectively, `master_readdata`, `master_waitrequest`, and `master_readdatavalid` handle data reading operations from slave modules, while `master_address`, `master_read`, `master_write`, `master_writedata`, `master_byteenable`, and `master_reset_reset` manage memory or device targeting and control data flow for writing actions. Internally, several signals facilitate data manipulation and verification such as `jtag_phy_embedded_in_jtag_master_src_valid` and its corresponding data path for potential JTAG interfacing data, and `timing_adt_out_valid` and `timing_adt_out_data` for adapted timing outputs. The design integrates modules like `altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface` for potential JTAG operations, `soc_system_master_secure_timing_adt` for timing adjustments, `altera_avalon_sc_fifo` to implement FIFO buffering, `altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets` and `altera_avalon_st_packets_to_bytes` for byte and packet conversion, and a master transaction module, `altera_avalon_packets_to_master`, which controls primary reading and writing operations to the master. A reset controller, `altera_reset_controller`, ensures proper resetting across the module. The design emphasizes parameter checking to avoid erroneous configurations, employing conditions to halt operations if parameters such as `USE_PLI`, `PLI_PORT`, or `FIFO_DEPTHS` are incorrectly set, underlining the module's robust adherence to specified settings for reliable operations.
