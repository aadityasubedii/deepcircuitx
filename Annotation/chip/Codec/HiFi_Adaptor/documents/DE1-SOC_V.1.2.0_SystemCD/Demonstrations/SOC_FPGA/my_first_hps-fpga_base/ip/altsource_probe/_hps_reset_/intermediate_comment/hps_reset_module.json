    "module": "Module-level comment: The `hps_reset` module interfaces with the `altsource_probe` to process probe signals synchronized by a `source_clk`. It captures probe inputs, processes through the `altsource_probe_component`, and forwards a 3-bit status output via `source`. It utilizes internal wiring (`sub_wire0`) for signal flow and is configured for advance debugging capabilities and metastability handling."
