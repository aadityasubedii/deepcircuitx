    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'debounce' module filters spurious signals, ensuring input stability before output reflection. It employs counters for each input bit, incrementing them when stable (defines stability based on 'POLARITY') and resetting on state changes, controlled by parameterized 'TIMEOUT'. Generates debounce logic per bit, synchronizing to 'clk' and resetting with 'reset_n'."
