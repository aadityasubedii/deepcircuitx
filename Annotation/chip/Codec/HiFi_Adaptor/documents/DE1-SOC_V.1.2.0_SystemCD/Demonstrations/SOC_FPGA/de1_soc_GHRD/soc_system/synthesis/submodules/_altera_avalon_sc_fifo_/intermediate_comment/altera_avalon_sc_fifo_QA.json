It supports operations like reading and writing data, and includes options for handling packets with associated start-of-packet and end-of-packet signals. The FIFO can be configured with different depths, data widths, and additional features like error and channel handling. Furthermore, the FIFO can operate with either standard memory blocks or register-based storage, depending on the use case, and includes support for generating almost full or almost empty signals and handling configuration via control registers. The module is versatile for different hardware designs due to its parameterized nature, allowing it to be tailored to specific data bandwidth and storage requirements."
