Module name: hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_addr_cmd_pads.

Module specification: The `hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_addr_cmd_pads` module is designed to process and translate DDR signals between the PHY layer and memory components. It aligns the data rate of the memory with the hardware processing capabilities using an array of clocks, including dual data rate (DDR) and half-rate (HR) techniques. The module inputs include various reset signals (`reset_n`, `reset_n_afi_clk`), multiple clock sources (`pll_afi_clk`, `pll_hr_clk`, `pll_avl_phy_clk`, `pll_mem_clk`, `pll_write_clk`), DDR IO signals (`phy_ddio_address`, `phy_ddio_bank`, etc.), and signals from a delay-locked loop (`dll_delayctrl_in`). Its outputs are adjusted signals for direct memory interface, such as `phy_mem_address`, `phy_mem_bank`, `phy_mem_cs_n`, and so forth. Internally, the module uses a variety of signals like `ac_clk`, `addr_cmd_clk`, and `mem_ck_source` to manage synchronization and phase adjustments for the signal translations. It includes several blocks: DDR IO translation blocks (`hps_sdram_p0_generic_ddio` for different signals like address, bank, and control signals), clock management including soft logic for memory clock generation (`hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc` for adjusting the clock phase and `altddio_out` for DDR output clocks), and a clock pair generator (`hps_sdram_p0_clock_pair_generator` for outputting differential clock signals). These sections collectively ensure proper management and translation of interface signals according to the memory specifications and operational requirements.
