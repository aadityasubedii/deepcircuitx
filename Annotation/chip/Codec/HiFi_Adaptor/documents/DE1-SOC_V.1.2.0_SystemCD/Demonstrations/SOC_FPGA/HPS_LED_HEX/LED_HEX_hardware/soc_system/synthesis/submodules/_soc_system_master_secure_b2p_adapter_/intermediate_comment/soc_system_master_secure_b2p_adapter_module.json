    "module": "Module-level comment: The `soc_system_master_secure_b2p_adapter` acts as a data forwarding bridge, primarily routing data while monitoring input and output readiness. It synchronizes incoming and outgoing data signals (data, start/end of packet) based on the `out_ready` condition. Disables output validity (`out_valid`) when `in_channel` exceeds zero to control data flow based on channel conditions. This ensures integrated and controlled data transmission through its `always` block, reacting dynamically to changes in channel status and output readiness."
