It uses the input clocks and a locked status from a phase-locked loop (PLL) alongside global and soft reset signals to generate synchronized reset signals for different internal clock domains associated with the memory interface. These reset signals ensure reliable operation by aligning the reset timing with the respective clock domains, preventing issues like metastability due to asynchronous resets. The module employs several instances of a reset synchronizer sub-module for different types of clocks (e.g., afi_clk, addr_cmd_clk, seq_clk, etc.) involved in the SDRAM operation. These synchronizers standardize the reset signals to match the phase and frequency of their corresponding clocks to ensure stability and proper functionality across the SDRAM system.\n"

It is derived by combining (`&` operator) the `pll_locked`, `global_reset_n`, and `soft_reset_n` signals. The combination ensures that the physical layer reset (and hence all downstream resets that depend on it) is only de-asserted when the PLL is stable (locked), and there is no global or soft reset invoked. This coordination helps in maintaining a consistent reset state across different parts of the system tied to the physical layer operations.\n\n- `phy_reset_mem_stable_n`: This signal extends the functionality of `phy_reset_n` by incorporating the `seq_reset_mem_stable` input. It is achieved by AND-ing `phy_reset_n` and `seq_reset_mem_stable`, ensuring that the reset affecting the memory read capture operation is not released until the memory sequencer reports that the memory is stable after a reset. This addition helps in controlling resets specifically for operations that are sensitive to the state of the memory.\n\n- `reset_n_read_capture`: An array of signals used to manage the reset state of mechanisms involved in capturing read data from memory. Each bit of `reset_n_read_capture` corresponds to a bit in the `read_capture_clk`, meaning that the reset state for each individual data capture circuit can be separately managed to align with the respective clock domain, thus ensuring data integrity and the timely release of resets corresponding to each read capture clock. This granular control is critical for high-performance memory systems where data capture timing alignment is crucial."
