Module name: hps_reset. Module specification: The `hps_reset` module is a Verilog module that likely involves handling a reset function, based on its name and the presence of a `probe` and a `source_clk` input. It receives two inputs: `probe`, possibly a trigger for the reset operation, and `source_clk`, a clock signal that synchronizes the internal operations of the module. The module outputs a 3-bit signal `source`, which suggests it may provide multiple statuses or types of reset indicators, although the specific functionality is not defined within the available code. The code does not specify any internal signals or registers, nor does it contain any logic blocks or additional sections other than the module declaration and I/O definitions. Hence, without additional implementation details, the internal workings including how inputs affect the output remain unspecified. This setup implies a placeholder or a template for a reset functionality that needs to be further elaborated.
