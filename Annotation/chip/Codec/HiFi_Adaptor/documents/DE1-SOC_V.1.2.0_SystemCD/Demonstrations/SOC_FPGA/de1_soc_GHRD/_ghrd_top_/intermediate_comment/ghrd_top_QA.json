The module is configured to interface with different types of I/O (Input/Output) components such as ADC (Analog to Digital Converter), audio interfaces, DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory), GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output), HEX displays, and more including configurations specifically for an HPS (Hard Processor System) if it is enabled. This comprehensive interfacing capability is mainly aimed at facilitating communication and control between the FPGA and external devices or systems, essentially making `ghrd_top` a central management entity in the hardware design which can cater to numerous application scenarios like data acquisition, signal processing, and digital communication."
