It takes inputs such as addresses, bank select signals, control signals (like command signals for read, write, and chip select), and clock signals from a higher-level controller (often a PHY interface). Within the module, there are numerous instances of sub-modules and logic used to manipulate and correctly time these signals. The manipulated signals are then output in a format that is suitable for use with physical SDRAM memory devices. This includes generating proper clock, control, and address timing using techniques like phase shifting, delay control, and DDR IO elements. The module ensures that the signals are synchronized and meet the setup and hold times required by the SDRAM specifications."
