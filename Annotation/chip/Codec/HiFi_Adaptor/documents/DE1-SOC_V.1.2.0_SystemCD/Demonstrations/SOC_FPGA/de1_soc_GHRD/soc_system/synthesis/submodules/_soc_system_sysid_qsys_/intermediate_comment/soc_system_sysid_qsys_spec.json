    "spec": "Module name: soc_system_sysid_qsys.  \nModule specification: The `soc_system_sysid_qsys` module in Verilog is designed to output a fixed 32-bit value dependent solely on the state of its input address signal. The module features three input ports: `address`, `clock`, and `reset_n`. The `address` input directly impacts the output by switching the 32-bit `readdata` between two predefined values (1393576805 for non-zero addresses and 2899645186 for a zero address). Both `clock` and `reset_n` are present as standard design practice inputs but do not influence the module's logic or output. The `readdata`, defined internally as a wire, is the sole output port providing the conditional value based on the address. Internally, the logic of the module revolves around a simple conditional assignment that directly assigns values to `readdata` based on the `address` input. This design allows for a straightforward implementation of value output based on addressing, making the module particularly suited for systems where specific data outcomes are linked to address inputs. It is noteworthy that the module does not include any sequential logic or dependence on clock edges, signifying its use in combinatorial logic applications.",
