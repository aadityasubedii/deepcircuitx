Module-level comment: The 'soc_system_button_pio' module manages button inputs and interrupts in a SoC design. It supports reading button states, configures IRQ masks, and captures edge-triggered events from the button presses. The module leverages internal delays for edge detection, maskable interrupts controlled via specific addresses for enhanced configurability, and responsive read and write operations synchronized by a system clock. This design allows efficient monitoring and handling of asynchronous button inputs necessary for digital system interaction and control.
