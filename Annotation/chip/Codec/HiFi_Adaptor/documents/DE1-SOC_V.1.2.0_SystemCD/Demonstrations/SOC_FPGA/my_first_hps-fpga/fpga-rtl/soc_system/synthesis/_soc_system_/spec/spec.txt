Module name: soc_system. Module specification: This module implements a System-on-Chip (SoC) design integrating a Hard Processor System (HPS) with FPGA fabric. It features various interfaces including memory, Ethernet, USB, UART, SPI, I2C, and GPIO. The module has numerous input and output ports for clock, reset, memory interfacing, HPS I/O, and LED control. Key inputs include clk_clk, reset_reset_n, and memory_oct_rzqin, while outputs cover memory signals, HPS I/O, and LED control. Internal signals facilitate communication between submodules, handling memory-mapped interconnects, AXI interfaces, and various peripheral controls. The design incorporates several functional blocks: an HPS core, on-chip memory, master interfaces for FPGA and HPS, a JTAG UART, interrupt handling
