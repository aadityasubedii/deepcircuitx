Module name: debounce. Module specification: The 'debounce' module is designed to stabilize digital input signals by filtering out noise and ensuring consistent logic levels, particularly useful to counteract signal perturbations such as bouncing. It operates with configurable parameters such as signal width, polarity, and the timeout period required for stabilization. The inputs include 'clk', a clock signal that synchronizes the internal operations; 'reset_n', an active-low asynchronous reset signal to clear internal counters; and 'data_in', an array of digital signals whose stability is being assessed across a specified width ('WIDTH'). The output 'data_out' provides the debounced version of 'data_in', with each bit reflecting the stable state of the corresponding input bit. Internal signals comprise 'counter', an array of registers tracking the logic level holding time for each input bit; 'counter_reset', controlling when each counter should be reset; and 'counter_enable', determining when each counter should increment. The code features several blocks: parameter definitions for customization, signal declarations, and a generate loop that constructs a debouncing mechanism for each signal bit. Within this generate loop, condition-based logic handles the increment, reset, and stability-check of counters to produce a noise-free output signal. This module adequately provides stable outputs through defined timeout counting facilitated by the 'POLARITY' setting, offering robust data handling in noise-prone digital environments.
