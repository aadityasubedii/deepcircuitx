    "spec": "Module name: hps_reset. \nModule specification: The `hps_reset` module is crafted to interface with an `altsource_probe` component, primarily serving to process a probe input signal under the guidance of a source clock. The module has two input ports: `probe`, which is used to input a signal that requires probing or analysis, and `source_clk`, the clock signal that handles the timing of the operations inside the module. The output of the module is a 3-bit bus `source`, derived from the `altsource_probe` component, functioning to provide status or control signals relevant to the processed input probe and clock signals. Internally, the module utilizes a wire `sub_wire0` as an intermediate connection that transfers the processed data from the `altsource_probe_component` to the `source` output. In terms of code organization, the module begins with standard time scale settings, followed by the declaration of ports and the essential internal wire. The `altsource_probe_component` is instantiated with various connections like `probe` and `source_clk`, along with numerous unconnected pins likely intended for advanced functionalities such as debugging or JTAG operations. Parameters are set for the component to handle metastability and define operational characteristics like probe width and source width. This module seems well-suited for applications where signal probing with clock synchronization is critical, especially in systems needing status monitoring or signal integrity analysis.",

The primary function appears to be to route a probe signal through the `altsource_probe_component` based on a source clock (`source_clk`). The output named `source` is a 3-bit bus generated from the component, potentially providing some kind of status or control signal alignment relative to the probe and clock input. Further, numerous unconnected pins suggest configuration for a more complex operation possibly related to JTAG state control or debugging, as indicated by the presence of parameters referring to metastability and probe widths. However, without further comments or a full scope of the code, assumptions are based strictly on the observable code."
