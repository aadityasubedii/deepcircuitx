It uses a shift register mechanism where the depth of the register can be configured via the DEPTH parameter. When `ASYNC_RESET` is enabled, the module triggers a reset upon a positive edge of either the clk or reset_in signal. If the reset signal is active, it sets all bits in the shift register to 1 and outputs a reset signal. If not active, it shifts the register values, effectively debouncing the asynchronous reset input to avoid metastability issues. If `ASYNC_RESET` is disabled, it omits the reset sensitivity to update the internal shift register only on the clock's positive edge, where the last bit takes the input reset state directly. The output reset signal is derived from the first bit of the shift register."

This signal can asynchronously assert a reset condition which is then processed by the module to ensure it matches the timing of the clock domain.\n- `clk` is the clock input to which the asynchronous reset signal (`reset_in`) is synchronized.
