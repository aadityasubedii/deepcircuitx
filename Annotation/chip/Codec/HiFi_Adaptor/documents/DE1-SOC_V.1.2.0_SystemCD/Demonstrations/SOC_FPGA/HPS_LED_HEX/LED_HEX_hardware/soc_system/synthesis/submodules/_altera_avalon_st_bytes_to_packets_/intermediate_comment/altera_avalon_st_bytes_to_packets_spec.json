    "spec": "Module name: altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets. \n\nModule specification: The \"altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets\" module is designed for FPGA systems using Altera's Avalon Streaming (ST) interface, where it converts incoming byte-stream data into packetized data. It does this by detecting special characters such as start of packet (SOP), end of packet (EOP), and escape characters, and appropriately formatting the incoming byte stream into packets. Input ports include clk (clock signal), reset_n (active-low asynchronous reset), out_ready (downstream module readiness signal), in_valid (validity of incoming data), and in_data (byte-stream input data). Outputs from the module are out_valid (valid packetized data signal), out_data (packetized data), out_channel (data channel indication), out_startofpacket (signaling start of a data packet), out_endofpacket (signaling end of a packet), and in_ready (module readiness for more data). Internal signals such as received_esc, received_channel, and received_varchannel aid in handling various state conditions like receiving escape characters or channel indicators, whereas signals like escape_char, sop_char, eop_char, channel_char define the processing logic based on the specific incoming byte. The generate statements conditionally compile code based on parameter settings like CHANNEL_WIDTH and ENCODING to handle different channel behaviors and encoding methods. The module essentially manages the transformation of input data streams into properly formatted output packets while maintaining data flow synchronization and integrity through its input and output readiness and validity controls.",

It does this by detecting special characters such as start of packet (SOP), end of packet (EOP), and escape characters, and appropriately formatting the incoming byte stream into packets. Input ports include clk (clock signal), reset_n (active-low asynchronous reset), out_ready (downstream module readiness signal), in_valid (validity of incoming data), and in_data (byte-stream input data). Outputs from the module are out_valid (valid packetized data signal), out_data (packetized data), out_channel (data channel indication), out_startofpacket (signaling start of a data packet), out_endofpacket (signaling end of a packet), and in_ready (module readiness for more data). Internal signals such as received_esc, received_channel, and received_varchannel aid in handling various state conditions like receiving escape characters or channel indicators, whereas signals like escape_char, sop_char, eop_char, channel_char define the processing logic based on the specific incoming byte. The generate statements conditionally compile code based on parameter settings like CHANNEL_WIDTH and ENCODING to handle different channel behaviors and encoding methods. The module essentially manages the transformation of input data streams into properly formatted output packets while maintaining data flow synchronization and integrity through its input and output readiness and validity controls."
