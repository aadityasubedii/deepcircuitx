    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_jtag_sld_node` module simulates and manages JTAG testing for Altera FPGA devices. It uses input ports `ir_out` and `tdo` for controlling operations and outputting test data, respectively, and outputs like `ir_in` and `tck` for entering instructions and providing the JTAG clock. Internally, it leverages registers like `simulation_clock` to generate timing signals and manage state simulation through tasks that adjust module behavior according to parameters like operation mode or test data status. This module supports both direct JTAG state simulation and component-based setups, enhancing testing versatility and depth."
