It receives input data and validates it based on the input stream\u2019s readiness and validity. The module detects idle and escape characters in the data stream, using this information to manage an internal state `received_esc` and accordingly manipulate outgoing data values and control signals. If the input data contains idle or escape characters and the outgoing stream is ready but these special characters were not recently received, the module flags the `received_esc`. It ensures the transferred data alternates these special characters' representation to prevent misinterpretation. The output is valid continuously, and output data is determined based on the received escape flag and content of incoming data, either directly transferring, modifying, or replacing with an idle character."
