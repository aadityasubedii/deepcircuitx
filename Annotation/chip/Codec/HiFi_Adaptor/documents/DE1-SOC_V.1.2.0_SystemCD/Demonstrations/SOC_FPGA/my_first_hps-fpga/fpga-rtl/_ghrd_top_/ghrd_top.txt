Module-level comment: The 'ghrd_top' module orchestrates the integration of hardware interfaces and peripherals for an FPGA-based SoC, handling DDR3, Ethernet, SPI, I2C, and more. It utilizes input and output ports for receiving and transmitting data, internal signals for managing button debouncing, LED control, and reset states, and instanced subsystems like 'soc_system' for direct communication with the HPS. Edge detectors manage precise reset operations, ensuring stable system responses.
