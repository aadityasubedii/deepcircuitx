It takes input data along with control signals indicating the validity of the data, availability of the channel, and packet boundary flags. The output is generated based on the readiness of the outgoing interface and the condition of the input channel, specifically, the data transfer is halted if the input channel value is greater than 0. The module ensures synchronization between input and output by mirroring the start and end of packet indicators, along with data validity, as long as the specified conditions are met, thereby maintaining the integrity of data packets transmitted across the interfaces."
