Module name: altera_jtag_sld_node. Module specification: The altera_jtag_sld_node is a Verilog module tailored for simulating and managing JTAG-based testing for Altera FPGA devices, fostering various JTAG state manipulations and operational modes such as data, loopback, and debug. The module defines input ports: `ir_out`, a 3-bit instruction register output that controls the JTAG TAP's current operation, and `tdo`, the test data output for shifting data out of the device. The output ports include: `ir_in` (instruction register input), `tck` (JTAG Test Clock), `tdi` (Test Data Input), and a series of virtual state signals such as `virtual_state_cdr`, `virtual_state_cir`, through to `virtual_state_uir` which indicate the virtual state of various JTAG TAP controller states. Internal signals like `simulation_clock` derive the internal JTAG clock and manage data flow timing, while registers such as `sdrs`, `cdr`, `sdr`, `e1dr`, and `udr` maintain the current state of the JTAG TAP state machine. The module operates conditionally with two primary blocks separated by the `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS` define guardâ€”where the first block is directed towards simulation purposes, including several tasks for state management and data shifting, and the second block incorporates the `sld_virtual_jtag_basic` instance for component-based behavior using parameters like manufactural and type identifiers, and a configuration for virtual JTAG protocol handling, terming practical application in realistic FPGA testing scenarios.
