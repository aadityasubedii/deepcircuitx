Module name: altera_avalon_sc_fifo. Module specification: The altera_avalon_sc_fifo module implements a parameterized, synthesizable FIFO buffer designed for Avalon streaming interfaces in digital systems. It supports various configurations through parameters like data width, FIFO depth, and packet-based communication handling. The module features input ports for clock, reset, data input, control signals, and CSR operations, while output ports provide data, status signals, and CSR readback. Key internal signals include write and read pointers, memory array, and various control flags for managing data flow and packet handling. The module is structured with sections for memory management (either block-based or shift register), read/write pointer logic, empty/full status tracking, and optional features like fill level monitoring, almost full/empty signaling, and store-and-forward functionality. It implements sophisticated packet handling with error detection and optional dropping,
