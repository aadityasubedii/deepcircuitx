Module-level comment: The "soc_system_jtag_uart" module simulates a JTAG UART interface for FPGA/ASIC systems, handling data transmission and reception through FIFO buffers and interrupt management. It uses input signals for operations and control flags, and internal signaling manages FIFO states, interrupts, and data flow control. This modular implementation aids efficient UART communication by interfacing effectively with external controllers and managing data transactions seamlessly.
