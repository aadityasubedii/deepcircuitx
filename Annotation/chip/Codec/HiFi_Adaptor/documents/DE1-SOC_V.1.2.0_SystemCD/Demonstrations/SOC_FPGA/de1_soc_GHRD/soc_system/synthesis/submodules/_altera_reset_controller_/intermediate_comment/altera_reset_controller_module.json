    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_reset_controller` module manages and synchronizes reset and reset request signals across different system components. It accepts multiple reset (`reset_inX`) and request inputs (`reset_req_inX`), combining and synchronizing them through logical operations and parameter-configurable depth synchronization mechanisms. Outputs include stable reset (`reset_out`) and reset request (`reset_req`) signals, ensuring system-wide consistent and reliable reset behavior. Key internal mechanisms include merging inputs, synchronization chains, and conditional logic for tailored output control based on system configuration."
