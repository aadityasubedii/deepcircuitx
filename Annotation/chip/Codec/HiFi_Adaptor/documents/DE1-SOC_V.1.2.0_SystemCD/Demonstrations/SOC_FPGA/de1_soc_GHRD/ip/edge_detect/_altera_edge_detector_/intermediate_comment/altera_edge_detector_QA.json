It outputs a pulse 'pulse_out' when the specified edge is detected. The behavior of the module can be customized with parameters such as 'EDGE_TYPE' to select rising or falling edge detection, 'PULSE_EXT' to extend the duration of the output pulse, and 'IGNORE_RST_WHILE_BUSY' to optionally ignore reset signals while busy. The module employs a finite state machine (FSM) with states including IDLE, ARM, and CAPT to track and react to changes in the input signal, facilitating edge detection and output pulse generation."

When 'rst_n' is low, the module undergoes a reset.\n- 'signal_in' is the input signal whose edges are to be detected by the module. The reaction of the module depends on changes in this signal which are evaluated as rising or falling edges based on configuration.\n\nOutput ports: pulse_out.\nExplanation: \n- 'pulse_out' is the output signal that generates a pulse when the specified edge (rising or falling) of 'signal_in' is detected. The width of the pulse can be extended based on the 'PULSE_EXT' parameter. This output provides a discrete indication that an edge has been detected by the module."

It is set to high (1'b1) in the CAPT state when a qualifying edge is detected.\n- `busy_pulsing`: This is a wire that indicates whether the module is currently outputting a pulse and possibly should ignore reset signals depending on the `IGNORE_RST_WHILE_BUSY` parameter. It helps in managing the module's behavior when it is active, ensuring uninterrupted operation.\n- `reset_qual_n`: This signal is used to handle the reset conditions effectively by incorporating the `busy_pulsing` signal, ensuring that the module can optionally ignore reset requests during active pulsing periods, depending on configuration.\n- `extend_pulse`: This register array is used only when `PULSE_EXT` is greater than 1, for extending the duration of the output pulse. It shifts the pulse_detect signal through a series of flip-flops as specified by the `PULSE_EXT` length, effectively creating a longer pulse.\n- `pulse_reg`: This is a register used in the case when `PULSE_EXT` is less than or equal to 1. It directly holds the `pulse_detect` output, providing a single-cycle pulse output when an edge is detected."
