It is designed to interact with JTAG signals such as TDI (Test Data In), TDO (Test Data Out), TCK (Test Clock), and JTAG states for a device test and configuration. The module is potentially used for conducting various test modes, including data transfer, debugging, and hardware management via JTAG interface. It can switch between different modes and states such as data, loopback, debug, control, etc., using tasks that manipulate internal registers and outputs based on clock cycles and signal conditions."

It defines what operation or state transition should take place within the module.\n- `tdo` is the output from a device in a JTAG chain. It carries the data output after processing test or configuration data received via TDI.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `ir_in`: 3-bit output for outgoing instruction register data.\n- `tck`: Test Clock signal for coordinating JTAG operations.\n- `tdi`: Test Data In signal sent out to the connected JTAG chain.\n- `virtual_state_cdr`, `virtual_state_cir`, `virtual_state_e1dr`, `virtual_state_e2dr`, `virtual_state_pdr`, `virtual_state_sdr`, `virtual_state_udr`, `virtual_state_uir`: Outputs representing various virtual JTAG states relevant to JTAG operations; these do not correspond to actual JTAG pins but are used for simulation and testing purposes.\n\nExplanation:\n- `ir_in` functions as the instruction register data output. It sets the operation to be performed by the module and helps in controlling multiple states and modes.\n- `tck` serves as the clock signal that synchronizes the data transfer and state transitions within the JTAG interface.\n- `tdi` is the data input into the JTAG chain, carrying commands or data to be processed by devices in the chain.\n- Outputs like `virtual_state_cdr`, `virtual_state_cir`, etc., simulate various JTAG states for testing purposes.
