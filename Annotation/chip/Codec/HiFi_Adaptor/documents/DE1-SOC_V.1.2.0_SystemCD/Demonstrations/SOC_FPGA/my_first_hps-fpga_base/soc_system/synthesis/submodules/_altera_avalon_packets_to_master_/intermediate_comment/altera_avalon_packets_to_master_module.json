    "module": "Module-level comment: This module converts packets to Avalon-MM master transactions and vice versa. It processes input packets based on command types, generates corresponding Avalon-MM read/write operations, and handles the reverse conversion. The module uses a state machine to manage packet reception, command decoding, address handling, data transfer, and response generation. It supports both fast (with FIFOs) and simple versions, allowing flexible data transfer between packet-based and Avalon-MM interfaces."
