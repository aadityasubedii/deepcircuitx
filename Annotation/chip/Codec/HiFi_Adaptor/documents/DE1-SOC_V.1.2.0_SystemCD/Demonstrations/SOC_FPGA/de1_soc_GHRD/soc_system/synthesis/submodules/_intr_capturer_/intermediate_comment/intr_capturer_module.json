    "module": "Module-level comment: The intr_capturer module captures and registers multiple interrupts with adjustable width NUM_INTR. It uses a clock to synchronize interrupt capture into interrupt_reg and supports reading their state via rddata based on input addr and read signals. Internal logic facilitates handling up to 64 interrupts split between two register sets as needed, employing synchronization and selective read access logic to ensure accurate status output."
