Module specification: The 'soc_system_onchip_memory2_0' module represents an on-chip memory system designed to facilitate read and write operations via single-port access. It employs an input `address` for accessing specific memory locations, `byteenable` to define active bytes within the data, `chipselect` to enable the memory for a specific operation, `clk` as the primary timing signal, `clken` as an additional dynamic clock control, `reset` to asynchronously clear the memory, `reset_req` for conditional resets, `write` to signal writing data, and `writedata` for the data to be written. The output `readdata` provides the data read from the specified memory location. Internally, the module utilizes `clocken0` to enable memory operations based on active clock and absence of a reset request, and `wren` for enabling write operations when both `chipselect` and `write` are active. Key components of the code include parameter definitions for memory configuration, wire declarations for internal signals, assignments for internal logic operations, and an instantiation of `altsyncram` set with specific parameters to manage the memory functions like addressing, data input/output, and write enable logic.
