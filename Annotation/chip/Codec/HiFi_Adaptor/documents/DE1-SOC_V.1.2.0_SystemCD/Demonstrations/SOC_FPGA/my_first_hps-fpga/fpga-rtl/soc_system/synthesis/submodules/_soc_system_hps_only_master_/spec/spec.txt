Module name: soc_system_hps_only_master. Module specification: The "soc_system_hps_only_master" module functions primarily as a data transaction controller between a variety of interface components and a master interface, ensuring efficient data flow and protocol management in a system. The module features input ports such as `clk_clk` for synchronization of internal states, `clk_reset_reset` for system initialization, along with data-related signals like `master_readdata`, `master_waitrequest`, and `master_readdatavalid` which are related to data reading operations from the master interface. It has output ports including `master_address`, `master_read`, `master_write`, `master_writedata`, `master_byteenable`, and `master_reset_reset` which control data writing operations and manage the interface reset logic. 

Internally, the module uses several critical signals like `jtag_phy_embedded_in_jtag_master_src_valid` for managing incoming JTAG data, and `fifo_out_valid`, `fifo_out_data` for FIFO buffer operations, among others that handle various facets of packet and byte stream management within the module. Various blocks of the module include instances of byte to packet and packet to byte converters (`altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets`, `altera_avalon_st_packets_to_bytes`), FIFO buffers (`altera_avalon_sc_fifo`), and a JTAG interface (`altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface`), which are crucial for managing the conversion and flow of data streams. Other key components include the `transacto` block handling transactions to/from the master interface and `rst_controller` ensuring proper reset operations are carried out. Each block is highly integrative and serves to uphold data integrity and system stability through efficiently managed interfaces and transactional operations.
