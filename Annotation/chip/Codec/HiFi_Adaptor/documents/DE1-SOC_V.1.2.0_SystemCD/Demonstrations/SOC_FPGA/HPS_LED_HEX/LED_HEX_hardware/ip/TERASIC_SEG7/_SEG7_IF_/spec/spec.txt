Module name: SEG7_IF. Module specification: The SEG7_IF module is designed to interface with a seven-segment display, controlling the state of each segment to display the desired output. It operates on a clock signal `s_clk`, and features input ports for address (`s_address`), read (`s_read`), write (`s_write`), data for writing (`s_writedata`), and reset (`s_reset`). The output ports include `s_readdata` for outputting data from read operations and `SEG7` for sending the segment states directly to a seven-segment display. Internal signals such as `base_index`, `write_data`, `read_data`, and `reg_file` aid in data manipulation and storage; `base_index` calculates the segment register index, `write_data` holds the write data temporarily, `read_data` stores data read from `reg_file`, and `reg_file` maintains the states of all segments across displays. The Verilog code mainly consists of three sections driven by a negative edge triggered always block: reset handling sets all segments to a default state (`DEFAULT_ACTIVE`), write operations update `reg_file` as specified by the address and data inputs, and read operations populate `read_data` from `reg_file` at the specified address. Lastly, output assignments adjust `SEG7` based on `LOW_ACTIVE` configuration and set `s_readdata` from `read_data`. This modular design effectively manages display updates and state reads with adaptable configurations for different display types.
