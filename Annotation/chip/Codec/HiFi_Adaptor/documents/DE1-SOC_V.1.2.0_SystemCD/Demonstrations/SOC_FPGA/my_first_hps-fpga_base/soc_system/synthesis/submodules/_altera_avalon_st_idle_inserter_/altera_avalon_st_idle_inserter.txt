Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter` manages data streams by inserting idle (`0x4A`) and handling escape (`0x4D`) characters. This module uses registers and combinational logic to track escape sequences and control data flow, ensuring smooth handling of special characters with respect to output readiness and data validity.
