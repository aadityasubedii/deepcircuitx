    "module": "Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_reset` module generates synchronized reset signals for various clocks within an FPGA-based SDRAM system. It inputs multiple clock and reset signals, evaluates system readiness through internal signals like `phy_reset_n`, and outputs synchronized resets. The synchronization is handled by instances of the `hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync` submodule for each clock domain, ensuring stable and coherent operations across the SDRAM controller. Parameters allow configuration for different system setups."
