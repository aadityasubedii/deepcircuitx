Module name: altera_avalon_packets_to_master. Module specification: This module serves as an interface between a packet-based protocol and an Avalon Memory-Mapped (MM) master interface. It receives packets, processes them, and performs read or write operations on the Avalon MM interface accordingly. The module has input ports for clock (clk), reset (reset_n), input data (in_data), and control signals (in_valid, in_startofpacket, in_endofpacket), as well as output ports for Avalon MM interface signals (address, read, write, byteenable, writedata) and response signals (out_data, out_valid, out_startofpacket, out_endofpacket). Internal signals include FIFO-related signals (fifo_readdata, fifo_read, fifo_empty, fifo_writedata, fifo_
