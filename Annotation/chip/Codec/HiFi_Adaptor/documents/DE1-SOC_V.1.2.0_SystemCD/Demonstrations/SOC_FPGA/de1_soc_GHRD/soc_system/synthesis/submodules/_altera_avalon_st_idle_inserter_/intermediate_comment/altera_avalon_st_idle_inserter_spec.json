    "spec": "Module name: altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter. \nModule specification: The `altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter` module is designed specifically for inserting idle characters into a streaming data flow as needed. It operates on an 8-bit basis, identifying and handling special control characters, namely idle (0x4a) and escape (0x4d) characters. The primary inputs include `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset_n` (active low reset), `in_valid` (indicates valid input data), `in_data` (8-bit input data stream), and `out_ready` (shows downstream readiness to accept data). The outputs consist of `in_ready` (signals upstream readiness to accept data), `out_valid` (indicates the validity of output data), and `out_data` (the processed 8-bit data stream). Internally, the module utilizes a register `received_esc` to track whether an escape character was received in the previous cycle, and two combinational wires, `escape_char` and `idle_char`, which detect the presence of escape and idle characters in the input stream, respectively. The operational logic, contained mainly within two always blocks, firstly manages the state of `received_esc` based on current input and previous state. Secondly, it controls output readiness `out_valid`, input readiness `in_ready` and the content of `out_data` based on the received characters and the status flags. This system ensures data integrity and proper management of special characters in data streams, directly handling scenarios where no data or special characters are presented, and transforming data as specified when preceded by an escape character.",

It checks for specific control characters ('idle_char' and 'escape_char') in the input data stream. When an idle or escape character (defined as hex values 0x4a and 0x4d respectively) is detected without previously receiving an escape character, it signals `received_esc` to prepare for special handling. The output data is modified based on the presence of these conditions - if no data is valid from input, it outputs the idle character (0x4a). If an escape was previously received, it XORs the input data with 0x20 for transformation. If either an idle or escape character is received (and not after an escape), it outputs 0x4d. In normal conditions, it simply passes the input data through. The `in_ready` and `out_valid` flags manage the flow control based on input validity and output readiness. The module ensures proper synchronization and transformation of data in a streaming environment, adjusting readiness and output validity dynamically."

It drives the timing of the state updates within the module.\n2. **reset_n**: The active low reset signal; it is used to initialize or reset the module's internal states to a known state, typically during startup or upon an error.\n3. **in_valid**: A signal that indicates valid data is present on the `in_data` input. This flag helps the module decide when to read the data.\n4. **in_data**: An 8-bit input data port through which the actual data stream is received. This data is checked and potentially modified by the module based on the presence of specific control characters.\n5. **out_ready**: A signal from the downstream component indicating that it is ready to accept data.
