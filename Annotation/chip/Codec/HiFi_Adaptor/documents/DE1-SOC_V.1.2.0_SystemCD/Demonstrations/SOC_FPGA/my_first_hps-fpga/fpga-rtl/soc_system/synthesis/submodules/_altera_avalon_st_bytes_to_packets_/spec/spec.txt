Module name: altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets.
Module specification: The 'altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets' module is designed to organize byte-stream input data into packets suitable for transmission. The input ports include `clk` (clock input), `reset_n` (active low reset), `out_ready` (downstream readiness), `in_valid` (validity of input data), and `in_data` (byte-stream data input). The outputs are `out_valid` (validity of output data), `out_data` (processed data), `out_channel` (channel identifier), `out_startofpacket` (start of packet indicator), `out_endofpacket` (end of packet indicator), and `in_ready` (module's readiness for new data). Internal signals such as `received_esc`, `received_channel`, and `received_varchannel` indicate the status of escape and channel processing, while `escape_char`, `sop_char`, `eop_char`, `channel_char`, and `varchannelesc_char` assist in identifying specific data conditions. The module contains several conditional and loop blocks handling the dual mode of channel width (`CHANNEL_WIDTH`), data encoding (`ENCODING`), signal processing triggers based on input characters, and the updating of output data and channel indicators based on current processing states and configuration parameters. These modular blocks ensure the module adapts to different encoding schemes and channel configurations, essential for flexible data communication systems.
