Module-level comment: The `altera_reset_synchronizer` synchronizes reset signals to a clock domain, helping prevent metastability. It handles both asynchronous and synchronous resets based on the `ASYNC_RESET` parameter. Internally, it uses a shift register (`altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain`) to delay the reset signal, controlled by procedural blocks that load or shift values depending on the reset condition and clock edges. The resulting synchronized reset is output via `reset_out`.
