    "spec": "Module name: hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc. Module specification: The Verilog module 'hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc' is designed for clock signal generation and management in SDRAM applications within an FPGA environment, essential for proper timing and synchronization across various SDRAM operations. The module takes three input clock signals: 'pll_hr_clk', 'pll_dq_clk', and 'pll_dqs_clk', which are used for generating high-resolution, data operations, and data strobe clocks respectively; and an input 'dll_phy_delayctrl' that controls the delay applied to the DQS clocks. The output ports include 'afi_clk', 'avl_clk', 'adc_clk', 'adc_clk_cps', and 'hr_clk' which cater to data interface operations, address/control synchronization, address/command timing, phase-adjusted command timing, and high-resolution control needs respectively. Internal signals such as 'phy_clk_dqs', 'phy_clk_dq', 'leveled_dqs_clocks', and 'leveled_hr_clocks' are critical in deriving these outputs through various clock buffering, delaying, and phase selection mechanisms. Structurally, the module uses conditional compilation for simulation versus hardware-specific configurations and employs CycloneV-specific primitives like 'cyclonev_phy_clkbuf' and 'cyclonev_leveling_delay_chain' for clock buffering and delay adjustments. Additionally, 'cyclonev_clk_phase_select' blocks are utilized for phase selection and timing adjustments aligning to SDRAM's stringent timing requirements. The configurability through parameters such as 'ADC_PHASE_SETTING' and 'ADC_INVERT_PHASE' allow for fine-tuning of the clock signals based on operational needs.",

The module involves selecting and buffering different input clock signals (pll_hr_clk, pll_dq_clk, pll_dqs_clk) based on the parameter IS_HHP_HPS.
