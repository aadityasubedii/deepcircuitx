Module name: credit_producer.
Module specification: The "credit_producer" module is designed to generate credit signals dynamically, taking into consideration the numbers of symbols per beat and occurrences of end-of-packet conditions in incoming data streams. This module operates on inputs such as `clk` (clock input for synchronous operations), `reset_n` (active low reset for initializing internal states), `in_valid` (indicating the validity of incoming data), `in_ready` (module readiness to accept data), and `in_endofpacket` (flagging the end of data packets). The outputs from this module are `symbol_credits` and `packet_credits`, which provide 16-bit indications of available credits for symbols and packets, respectively. Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `beat` (active when valid data is ready to be processed), `eop_beat` (active when a packet end coincides with an active beat), `sym_count` and `next_sym_count` (for tracking and predicting the number of symbols processed across beats), and `rollover` (a boolean marking when accumulated symbols match a credit criterion or an end-of-packet condition occurs). The module includes several code blocks: generation blocks differentiate credit calculations when the ratio of `SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT` to `SYMBOLS_PER_CREDIT` is either a multiple or a divisor, handling the increment of `symbol_credits` directly in the former situation or through the use of intermediate counters in the latter. An additional always block handles the increment of `packet_credits` upon detection of end-of-packet conditions. Together, these components and functionality enable the module to accurately manage credit issuance based on configurable symbol and packet processing strategies.
