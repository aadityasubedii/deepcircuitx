    "spec": "Module name: credit_producer.\nModule specification: The \"credit_producer\" module is designed to generate credit signals dynamically, taking into consideration the numbers of symbols per beat and occurrences of end-of-packet conditions in incoming data streams. This module operates on inputs such as `clk` (clock input for synchronous operations), `reset_n` (active low reset for initializing internal states), `in_valid` (indicating the validity of incoming data), `in_ready` (module readiness to accept data), and `in_endofpacket` (flagging the end of data packets). The outputs from this module are `symbol_credits` and `packet_credits`, which provide 16-bit indications of available credits for symbols and packets, respectively. Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `beat` (active when valid data is ready to be processed), `eop_beat` (active when a packet end coincides with an active beat), `sym_count` and `next_sym_count` (for tracking and predicting the number of symbols processed across beats), and `rollover` (a boolean marking when accumulated symbols match a credit criterion or an end-of-packet condition occurs). The module includes several code blocks: generation blocks differentiate credit calculations when the ratio of `SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT` to `SYMBOLS_PER_CREDIT` is either a multiple or a divisor, handling the increment of `symbol_credits` directly in the former situation or through the use of intermediate counters in the latter. An additional always block handles the increment of `packet_credits` upon detection of end-of-packet conditions. Together, these components and functionality enable the module to accurately manage credit issuance based on configurable symbol and packet processing strategies.",

The module processes incoming signals like `in_valid`, `in_ready`, and `in_endofpacket` to compute symbol credits and packet credits dynamically. The symbol credits are updated based either directly per beat or based on a rollover mechanism determined by a ratio of symbols per beat to symbols per credit.

The module uses this input to decide when to process data and update credits.\n- in_ready: Suggests the readiness of the module to accept data. This input is used together with 'in_valid' for handshake synchronization to control the credit calculations.\n- in_endofpacket: A flag indicating the end of a packet. This input is crucial for packet-based credit computation as it triggers the increment of packet credits when an end-of-packet condition coincides with ready and valid data signals.\n\nOutput ports: [symbol_credits, packet_credits].  \nExplanation:\n- symbol_credits: A 16-bit output that indicates the number of symbol credits available. The number of symbol credits increases based on the calculations performed per beat and affected by the ratio of symbols per beat to symbols per credit.\n- packet_credits: A 16-bit output that represents the available packet credits.

This signal is fundamental in determining when to process incoming data and adjust credit counters.\n- eop_beat: Stands for 'end of packet beat', calculated by checking if both 'beat' and 'in_endofpacket' are true. This signal is essential for determining the timing when packet credits must be incremented, based on the reception of a complete packet.\n- sym_count: A counter used to track the number of symbols processed. This is especially relevant when the number of symbols per beat is not evenly divisible by the number of symbols per credit, requiring accumulation until a credit can be issued.\n- next_sym_count: Represents the prospective next value of 'sym_count'. This signal is used to predict and prepare the next state of 'sym_count' based on current conditions of each beat.\n- rollover: A boolean signal that indicates whether a rollover condition occurs, meaning the 'sym_count' has accumulated sufficiently to count as a complete credit or it's the end of the packet.
