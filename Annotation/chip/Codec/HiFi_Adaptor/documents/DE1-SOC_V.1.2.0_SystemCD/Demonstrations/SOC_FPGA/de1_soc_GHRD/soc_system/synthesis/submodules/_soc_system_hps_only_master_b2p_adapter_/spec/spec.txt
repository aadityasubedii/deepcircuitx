Module name: soc_system_hps_only_master_b2p_adapter. Module specification: The soc_system_hps_only_master_b2p_adapter is a module in Verilog designed to facilitate the transfer of packet-based data from an input to an output while synchronizing with a clock signal. The module comprises several input ports such as clk (clock input), reset_n (active low reset), in_ready (flag to indicate readiness to receive data, controlled by the out_ready signal), in_valid (flag to indicate valid incoming data), in_data (8-bit incoming data), in_channel (8-bit identifier for incoming data channel), in_startofpacket (flag indicating the start of a data packet), in_endofpacket (flag indicating the end of a data packet), and out_ready (flag indicating readiness to receive data output side). The output ports include out_valid (flag indicating if the outgoing data is valid, controlled by the value of in_channel), out_data (8-bit outgoing data), out_startofpacket, and out_endofpacket both of which mirror their input counterparts. Internally, the module uses a register, out_channel, to hold and assess the incoming data channel for conditional logic to deactivate out_valid when in_channel > 0 indicating no valid data is transmitted for these channels. The code encapsulates synchronization logic and conditional data validation within an always combinational block, ensuring data flows are controlled and mirrored appropriately under the defined conditions.
