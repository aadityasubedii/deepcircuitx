    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'soc_system_onchip_memory2_0' module implements a single-port on-chip memory system using an 'altsyncram' memory block for FPGA designs. It supports configurable memory operations via input ports addressing data read/write actions, clock synchronization, and reset controls. Internally, signals like clocken0 and wren control clock gating and write enable functions, respectively. The 'altsyncram' block parameters define memory size, data width, and operation mode, facilitating tailored memory management."
