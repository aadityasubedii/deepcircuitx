    "spec": "Module name: intr_capturer. \nModule specification: The intr_capturer is a Verilog module designed to capture and output interrupt signals based on specified read addresses. It is parameterized with `NUM_INTR` to handle a configurable number of interrupts. The module receives interrupts on the `interrupt_in` input, which can range up to 32 or more signals, and captures them into the `interrupt_reg`. It outputs the stored interrupt data through the `rddata` port upon read requests indicated by the `read` input and based on the address specified in the `addr` input. The main inputs are `clk` (clock signal), `rst_n` (active-low reset), `interrupt_in` (interrupt input vector), `addr` (address input to select data segment), and `read` (read enable signal). The sole output is `rddata`, a 32-bit output data bus. Internally, the module uses several signals: `interrupt_reg` (captures the incoming interrupt states), `readdata_with_waitstate` (holds the output data potentially with added wait states), `act_readdata` (intermediate signal combining data from different segments), `readdata_lower_intr` and `readdata_higher_intr` (hold interrupt data from lower and higher segments respectively), `access_lower_32` and `access_higher_32` (control signals to access specific data segments). The code comprises blocks for capturing interrupt signals and handling different sections for configurations exceeding 32 interrupts (`generate` block) to manage multiple interrupt registers. Each operational phase is sensitive to clock edges and reset conditions, ensuring the system's responsiveness and data integrity.",

It features parameterization to support different numbers of interrupts (specified by NUM_INTR). The module handles up to 32 or more interrupts, employing separate registers for interrupts beyond the initial 32 if necessary. On a read command combined with a specified address, the module outputs the stored interrupt data, potentially delayed due to added wait states for synchronization with the system's reading processes.

It carries the interrupt signals that need to be captured and processed.\n- `addr`: Address input used to select which portion of the interrupt data to read.
