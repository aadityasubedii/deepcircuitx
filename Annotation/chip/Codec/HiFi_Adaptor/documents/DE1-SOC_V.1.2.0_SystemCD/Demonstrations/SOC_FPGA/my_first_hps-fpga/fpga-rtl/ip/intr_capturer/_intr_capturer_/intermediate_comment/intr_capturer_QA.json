It captures the states of input interrupts and allows for the reading of these states via a protocol that handles both reads and resets. The module uses a parameter `NUM_INTR` which determines the number of interrupts it can handle. Internally, the module uses registers to store the states of the incoming interrupts and a combination of read operations and address checks to selectively output the appropriate interrupt data. The module supports handling and splitting of interrupt data into two ranges (lower and higher) based on the `NUM_INTR` value relative to 32, thereby providing flexibility for different numbers of interrupt inputs."
