It takes multiple interrupt inputs (up to a specified number, NUM_INTR), and outputs a 32-bit read data based on the interrupt register states. The module operates with a clock and a reset signal. Depending on the value of NUM_INTR, it handles interrupts either within a single 32-bit register or split between two registers (one for lower 32 interrupts and another for any higher). The output read data changes with the read command and address input, providing the state of requested interrupt bits. This allows external systems to read the status of interrupts effectively, facilitating condition handling or diagnostics in a broader system."

It's set true when read operation is enabled and the address input indicates the lower register (i.e., `addr` equals 0).\n- **access_higher_32**: Similar to `access_lower_32`, this control signal enables reading from the higher 32 bits of the interrupt register when read operation is enabled and the address input is set for the higher batch (i.e., `addr` equals 1), and only applicable if `NUM_INTR` exceeds 32."
