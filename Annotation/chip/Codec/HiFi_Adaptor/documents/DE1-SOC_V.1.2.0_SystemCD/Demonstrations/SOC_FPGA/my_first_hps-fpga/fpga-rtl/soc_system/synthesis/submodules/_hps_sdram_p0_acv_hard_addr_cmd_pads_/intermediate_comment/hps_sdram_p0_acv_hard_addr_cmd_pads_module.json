    "module": "Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_addr_cmd_pads` module handles the interfacing of address and command signals to SDRAM using DDR I/O pads, ensuring signal integrity and timing through PLL-derived clocks and delay-locked loops. It translates PHY DDR I/O signals into SDRAM compatible commands and addresses, while managing clocks through internal delay chains and conditioners, offering configurable implementations via parameterization to support different operational scenarios."
