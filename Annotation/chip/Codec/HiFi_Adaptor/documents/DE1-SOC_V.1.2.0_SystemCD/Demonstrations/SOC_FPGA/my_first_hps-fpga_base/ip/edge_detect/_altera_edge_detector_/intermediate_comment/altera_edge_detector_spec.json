    "spec": "Module name: altera_edge_detector. Module specification: The altera_edge_detector is a Verilog module designed to detect edges on a digital signal and generate a corresponding pulse output. It monitors the 'signal_in' input for rising or falling edges, dictated by the 'EDGE_TYPE' configuration. The module features three inputs: 'clk' for the clock signal controlling the timing of operations, 'rst_n' an active-low reset to reinitialize the system, and 'signal_in' which is the digital signal under observation. The sole output 'pulse_out' delivers a pulse when an edge is detected. Internal signals such as 'state' and 'next_state' manage the state machine progression through IDLE, ARM, and CAPT states based on 'signal_in'. 'pulse_detect' indicates edge detection, and 'busy_pulsing' along with 'reset_qual_n' handle pulse continuation when the module is busy, depending on the 'IGNORE_RST_WHILE_BUSY' and 'PULSE_EXT' parameters. Code is partitioned into multiple blocks including state transition logic, reset conditions, and pulse extension functionality configured by 'PULSE_EXT'. Depending on 'PULSE_EXT', the pulse output is either directly the 'pulse_detect' signal or an extended pulse determined by a shift register mechanism. This design allows for versatile edge detection suitable for various applications requiring precise event timing responses to signal changes.",

The module includes additional parameters to extend this pulse output ('PULSE_EXT') and to optionally ignore reset during busy operations if it is currently outputting a pulse ('IGNORE_RST_WHILE_BUSY').

It helps manage the reset behavior when `IGNORE_RST_WHILE_BUSY` is enabled, ensuring the module doesn't reset if it is in the middle of generating an extended pulse.\n- `reset_qual_n`: This wire is a conditioned reset signal that combines the original reset (`rst_n`) and the logic from `busy_pulsing`. This signal ensures robust reset behavior where ongoing pulses may need to be preserved even during a reset condition, as specified by the parameter settings."
