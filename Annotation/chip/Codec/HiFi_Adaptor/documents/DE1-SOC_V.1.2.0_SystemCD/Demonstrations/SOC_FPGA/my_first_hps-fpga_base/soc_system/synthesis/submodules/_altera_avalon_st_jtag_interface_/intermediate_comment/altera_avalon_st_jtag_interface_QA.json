It supports two operational modes based on the compile-time configuration: a normal mode and a PLI (Programming Logic Interface) simulation mode. In the normal mode, it utilizes a sub-module `altera_jtag_dc_streaming` to manage data streaming, controlled by parameters like FIFO sizes and management channel width. The PLI mode uses a different sub-module `altera_pli_streaming`, intended for simulation purposes with configuration for PLI port, to perform similar data streaming operations. This module handles input/output data transactions, flow control, and reset management, adapting to either communication or simulation needs based on its configuration."
