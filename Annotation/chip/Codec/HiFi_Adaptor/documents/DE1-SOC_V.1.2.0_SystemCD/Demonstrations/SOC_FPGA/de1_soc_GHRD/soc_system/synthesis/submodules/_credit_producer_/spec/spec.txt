Module name: credit_producer.
Module specification: The `credit_producer` module manages the credit updating mechanism based on incoming data symbols and packet boundaries for flow control in digital communication systems. The module operates with a synchronous clock (`clk`) and is reset with an asynchronous reset signal (`reset_n`). It has five input ports: `clk`, `reset_n`, `in_valid`, `in_ready`, and `in_endofpacket`, which respectively synchronize operations, reset the module, signal the validity of incoming data, indicate readiness to receive data, and mark the boundary of data packets. Its outputs, `symbol_credits` and `packet_credits`, track the number of symbol-based and packet-based credits. Internally, the module employs `beat`, `eop_beat`, `sym_count`, `next_sym_count`, and `rollover`. The `beat` signal indicates data transfer events; `eop_beat` flags the coinciding occurrence of beats and packet boundaries; `sym_count` and `next_sym_count` track the accumulating symbol count across beats; `rollover` indicates a need to reset symbol counts and increment credits based on set thresholds or packet boundaries. The code is structured into blocks handling different conditions of incrementing symbol credits depending on the configuration of symbols per beat and credit, each evaluated by a different conditional generate block. The packet credits are incremented every time an end-of-packet beat is detected, independent of symbol credit conditions, ensuring timely and accurate flow control deployment.
