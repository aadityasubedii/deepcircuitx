Module name: soc_system_jtag_uart. Module specification: The `soc_system_jtag_uart` module is responsible for managing I/O operations through a JTAG UART interface in a system-on-chip environment. This module operates by reading from and writing to FIFOs while checking overflow conditions, handling interrupts, and managing flags based on FIFO status to facilitate robust data transfers. The input ports include `av_address`, `av_chipselect`, `av_read_n`, `av_write_n`, `av_writedata`, `clk`, and `rst_n`. These control the transaction specifics such as the address, select line, read and write commands, data for writing, the clock signal, and reset signal. Output ports include `av_irq`, `av_readdata`, `av_waitrequest`, `dataavailable`, and `readyfordata`, which manage interrupts, outgoing data, wait signaling, and data readiness statuses. Internal signals like `fifo_AE`, `fifo_AF`, `fifo_clear`, `fifo_rd`, and `fifo_wr`, among others, control operations like FIFO states, reads, writes, and data transfers. The code entails various blocks: instantiation of write and read FIFO-handling submodules (`soc_system_jtag_uart_scfifo_w` and `soc_system_jtag_uart_scfifo_r`), IRQ handling, read and write operations overseeing, and data transfer control, demonstrating a thoroughly designed module to efficiently handle JTAG UART operations with appropriate checks and balances.
