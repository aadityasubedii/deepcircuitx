Module name: soc_system_hps_only_master_timing_adt. Module specification: The `soc_system_hps_only_master_timing_adt` module is designed to simply pass input data to its output under controlled flow conditions based on the ready and valid signals. It operates with input ports including `clk` (clock signal), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `in_valid` (input data valid indicator), `in_data` (8-bit data input), and `out_ready` (output readiness from downstream). The outputs are `out_valid` (indicator of valid data being output) and `out_data` (8-bit data output). Internally, the module utilises `in_payload` and `out_payload` (8-bit registers) for buffering data, and `ready` and `in_ready` (registers) to manage flow control states. The code features an edge-triggered display event within an `always @(negedge in_ready)` block to handle backpressure mismatch scenarios. Additionally, combinational logic in `always @*` blocks manage data transfer from `in_payload` to `out_payload` and align output validation and readiness states with the input conditions, ensuring data integrity and synchronization between upstream and downstream units in the digital system.
