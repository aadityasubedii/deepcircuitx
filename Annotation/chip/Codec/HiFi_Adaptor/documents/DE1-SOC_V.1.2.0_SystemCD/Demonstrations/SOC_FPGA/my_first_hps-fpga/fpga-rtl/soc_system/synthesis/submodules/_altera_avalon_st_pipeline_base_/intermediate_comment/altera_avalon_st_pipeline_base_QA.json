It functions to buffer data across pipeline stages, handling one or more symbols per data beat with each symbol comprising a configurable number of bits. The module supports configurable pipeline-ready behavior through a parameter. If PIPELINE_READY is set, the module includes additional register stages for handling ready signals and buffering the data and full status. This helps manage data under various conditions of input and output readiness, enhancing throughput and reliability in data transmission between pipeline stages. The overall design aims to optimize and stabilize data flow in high-speed digital systems."

Explanation: \n- clk: This is the clock input that synchronizes all operations within the module, including data transfer and state transitions.\n- reset: This port is used to reset the internal states and registers of the module to their initial default values, ensuring a known start state.\n- in_valid: This signal indicates the validity of the data present on the 'in_data' input. The data on 'in_data' is considered for processing only when in_valid is high.\n- in_data: This input carries the data to be processed by the module. It is a bus with a width defined by the 'DATA_WIDTH', which depends on the symbols per beat and bits per symbol.\n- out_ready: This input signal comes from downstream modules and indicates whether the next module or stage is ready to accept new data. This helps in managing the flow control to avoid data loss.\n\nOutput ports: [in_ready, out_valid, out_data]. Explanation:\n- in_ready: This signal is output to indicate to upstream modules whether this module is ready to accept new data. It helps in controlling the back-pressure to prevent data overflow when the module is not ready.\n- out_valid: This output is high when the module has valid data to send out through 'out_data'. It informs downstream modules that the data on 'out_data' is valid and ready to be processed.\n- out_data: This port outputs the processed data from the module. The width of this output is also determined by 'DATA_WIDTH'. The signal carries the data forwarded from the input or processed within the module to the next stages in the pipeline."

The signal helps in managing the data flow, ensuring data is not overwritten before it has been transferred to the next stage.\n- full1: Similar to `full0`, this signal acts as a status flag for the second register (`data1`). It indicates whether `data1` is currently storing valid data, which is crucial for synchronization and orderly data transfer in the pipeline.\n- data0: This register temporarily stores data when it first enters the module from the `in_data` input. It helps in buffering the data within the module, making it available for subsequent processing or forwarding based on the module's control logic.\n- data1: This register holds data either moved from `data0` or directly from `in_data` (depending on the control conditions and the state of `full0`).
