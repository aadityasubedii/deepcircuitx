    "spec": "Module name: hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc.\nModule specification: The hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc is a Verilog module designed for clock management tasks specifically tailored for SDRAM operations, which likely interacts with high-performance Stratix or Cyclone V FPGA chips. The module utilizes three primary input clocks (`pll_hr_clk`, `pll_dq_clk`, `pll_dqs_clk`) for high-resolution tasks, data queue, and data strobe functions respectively, and an input (`dll_phy_delayctrl`) for delay control. The outputs generated include `afi_clk` (for the Advanced Frontside Interface), `avl_clk` (for Avalon interfaces), `adc_clk` and `adc_clk_cps` (for address and command operations with configurable phase or condition settings), and `hr_clk` (a high-resolution output clock). Internal signals like `phy_clk_hr`, `phy_clk_dq`, `phy_clk_dqs` serve as buffered or direct versions of the input clocks to carry out specific memory interfacing roles. Two clock conditioning blocks, `cyclonev_leveling_delay_chain` and `cyclonev_clk_phase_select`, are used to process these clocks and generate finely tuned outputs required by the system. Conditional generation of signals based on configuration settings (`IS_HHP_HPS` and `ADC_INVERT_PHASE`) allows dynamic adaptations to operational modes and performance characteristics. Essentially, this module robustly addresses the need for meticulous clock manipulation catered to optimizing SDRAM operations within FPGA-centric systems.",
