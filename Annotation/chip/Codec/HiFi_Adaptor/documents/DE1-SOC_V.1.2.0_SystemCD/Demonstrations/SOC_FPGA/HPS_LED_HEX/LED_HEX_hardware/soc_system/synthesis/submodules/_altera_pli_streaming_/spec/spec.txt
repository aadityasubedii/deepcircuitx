Module name: altera_pli_streaming. Module specification: The altera_pli_streaming RTL module is tasked with managing data communication between external devices utilizing two distinct protocols: a JTAG-based streaming protocol and a PLI-based transaction protocol. The module features input ports including clk (clock for synchronization), reset_n (active low reset), source_ready (indicates external source readiness for data), sink_valid (indicates validity of incoming data from the sink), and sink_data (8-bit data from external sink). The output ports consist of source_valid (flag for data availability to external sources), source_data (8-bit data sent to external sources), sink_ready (module's readiness to accept more sink data), and resetrequest (signal to request a system reset with a constant 0 level in this design). Internal signals include pli_out_valid, pli_in_ready, and pli_out_data which manage and store the status and data concerning the PLI protocol operations. The code features primary blocks including a synchronous reset and operation block managed with a `always @(posedge clk or negedge reset_n)` block to handle PLI transactions, and another combinational block handled by `always @*` synthesizing outputs from both JTAG and PLI ports and handling default values. This dual protocol management allows effective interfacing and synchronization of data streams in digital communications within embedded systems.
