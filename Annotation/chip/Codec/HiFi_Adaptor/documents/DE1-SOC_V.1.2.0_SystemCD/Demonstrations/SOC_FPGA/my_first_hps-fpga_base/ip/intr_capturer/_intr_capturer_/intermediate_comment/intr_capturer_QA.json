It registers incoming interrupts on a positive edge of the clock or a negative edge of the reset signal. Depending on the number of interrupts (more than 32 or not), it generates either one or two regions for storing these interrupts. It also handles read operations based on an address input, allowing access to different sections of captured interrupts, and provides a data output which echoes the captured interrupt data after a clock cycle delay to incorporate wait states. Essentially, it serves as an interface for capturing and accessing interrupt signals in a system."

When asserted (low), it resets the module's internal registers to their initial state.\n- interrupt_in: This is an input vector with a size dependent on NUM_INTR. It is used to feed the current state of up to 32 interrupt signals into the module.\n- addr: This input signal is used to select between different data regions for reading. It acts as an address signal for accessing specific parts of the captured interrupt data.\n- read: This input signal is used to enable the data read operation. When asserted, it allows data to be read based on the address provided.\n\nOutput ports: rddata.\nExplanation:\n- rddata: This is a 32-bit output data bus which carries the read interrupt data. Depending on the state of 'addr' and 'read', it presents the relevant captured interrupt information back to the requester. This data includes the interrupt information delayed by one clock cycle, incorporating wait states typically needed in system designs for data stability."

It ensures that the interrupt inputs are stably held within the module for processing or further actions.\n- readdata_with_waitstate: This register is used to introduce a wait state by delaying the output data by one clock cycle. It stores the data read based on the address and read inputs and outputs it on the next clock cycle.\n- act_readdata: This wire signal combines the data from lower and higher interrupt registers as per the select signals generated based on the address. It abstracts the handling of which part of the interrupt data should be currently driven to the output before applying the wait state.\n- readdata_lower_intr: This wire signal holds the data of the lower 32 bits of the interrupt register, masked based on the access condition for the lower 32 interrupts.\n- readdata_higher_intr: This wire signal holds the data of the higher bits of the interrupt register (if NUM_INTR > 32), masked based on the access condition for the higher interrupts. If NUM_INTR \u2264 32, this signal is forced to zero.\n- access_lower_32: This wire signal is a condition flag indicating whether the lower 32 bits of interrupt data should be accessed. This is controlled by the 'read' input and the 'addr' input comparing against 0.\n- access_higher_32: This wire signal is similar to access_lower_32 but controls the access to the higher bits of the interrupt register (beyond the 32nd bit if available). This control depends on if NUM_INTR > 32 and is set by the 'read' input and the 'addr' input comparing against 1."
