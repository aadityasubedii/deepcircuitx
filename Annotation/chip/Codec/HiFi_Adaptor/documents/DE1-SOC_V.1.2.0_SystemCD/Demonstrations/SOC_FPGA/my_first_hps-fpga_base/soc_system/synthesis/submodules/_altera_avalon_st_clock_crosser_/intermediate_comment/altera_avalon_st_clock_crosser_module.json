    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser` module ensures safe data transfer between different clock domains using synchronization and buffering. It employs toggling mechanisms and dual-domain synchronizers to manage and validate data transfer, reducing metastability risks. Optionally, an output pipeline stage can enhance data handling. This module effectively controls and synchronizes data between input and output domains, maintaining system stability and data integrity."
