It directly influences what fixed value `readdata` will output.\n- **clock**: This input exists as a standard synchronous design practice though it does not affect the functionality in this specific module, as the output does not depend on the clock edges.\n- **reset_n**: Similar to clock, this is a reset input typically used for asynchronous reset logic. In this particular module, it has no role since the output does not depend on this signal.  \n\nOutput ports: readdata.  \nExplanation:  \n- **readdata**: This is a 32-bit output port providing a fixed output value based on the state of the `address` input.
