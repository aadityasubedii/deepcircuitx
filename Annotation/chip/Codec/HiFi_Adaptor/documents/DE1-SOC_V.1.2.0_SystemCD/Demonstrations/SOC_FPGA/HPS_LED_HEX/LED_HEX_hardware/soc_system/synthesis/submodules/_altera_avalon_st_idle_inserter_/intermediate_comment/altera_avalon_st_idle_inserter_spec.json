    "spec": "Module name: altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter.\nModule specification: The 'altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter' is a Verilog module designed to process data streams by inserting idle characters (`0x4A`) or managing escape characters (`0x4D`) in a manner essential for communication protocols. The input ports include: 'clk' (clock signal for synchronization), 'reset_n' (active-low reset), 'in_valid' (indicates the validity of the incoming data), 'in_data' (8-bit data to be processed), and 'out_ready' (indicates if the downstream module is ready to accept data). The output ports are: 'in_ready' (shows if the module is ready to accept new data), 'out_valid' (signal that the output data should be considered valid), and 'out_data' (processed 8-bit data output). Internal signals such as 'received_esc' (flag for received escape character without subsequent valid data), 'idle_char' (detects if the input data is an idle character), and 'escape_char' (detects if the input data is an escape character) are crucial for decision making in data handling. The Verilog code includes two main blocks: a sequential logic block that updates 'received_esc' based on the conditions of data validity, idleness, escaper, and readiness; and a combinational logic block that updates 'in_ready', 'out_valid', and 'out_data' based on the states of inputs and 'received_esc'. This module ensures precise alterations and additions to the data stream, vital for correct data framing or escaping in interfaces and communication protocols.",

Specifically, it detects idle characters (`0x4A`) and escape characters (`0x4D`) in the incoming data (`in_data`). If an escape or idle character is received and it hasn't previously received an escape character (`received_esc`), the module flags `received_esc`, altering how subsequent characters are processed. The output data (`out_data`) is then conditionally modified: if an idle or an escape character is detected without prior escape reception, `out_data` is set to `0x4D`. If an idle or escape character is received following an already received escape (`received_esc`), `out_data` is produced by XORing the input data with `0x20`. If no valid input data is available, the output is set to the idle character (`0x4A`). The readiness of the module to accept new input (`in_ready`) and to provide valid output (`out_valid`) is controlled based on the presence of input data and the state of the `out_ready` signal. This functionality is critical for ensuring proper data transmission with required data framing or escaping in communication protocols or interfaces."
