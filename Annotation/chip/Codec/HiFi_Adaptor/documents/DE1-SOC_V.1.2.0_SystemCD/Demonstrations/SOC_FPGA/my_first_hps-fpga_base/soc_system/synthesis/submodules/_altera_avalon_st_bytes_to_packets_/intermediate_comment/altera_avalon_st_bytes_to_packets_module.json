    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets` module processes an input byte stream to form packets. It uses control signals for start, end, and channel encoding, managed by internal flags. Configuration parameters control channel information handling and escaping. The module synchronizes output with downstream readiness and maintains state across clock cycles, ensuring robust packet data assembly and channel demarcation."
