    "module": "Module-level comment: The intr_capturer module captures interrupts in systems supporting up to 32 or more signals. It utilizes a clock (clk) and active-low reset (rst_n) for state management, reading interrupt vectors via interrupt_in. Interrupt data is stabilized in interrupt_reg and outputted with a cycle delay to rddata for data integrity. Conditional logic handles configurations of both under and over 32 interrupts, assigning data based on the addr input and ensuring accessibility through structured read conditions.\n"
