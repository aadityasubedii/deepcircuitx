Module-level comment: 
/* This soc_system module implements a System-on-Chip design integrating an HPS with FPGA fabric.
   It manages interfaces between HPS and FPGA, including memory, AXI interconnects, and various I/O.
   The module uses components like on-chip memory, JTAG UART, and interrupt handling to facilitate 
   communication and control between subsystems, providing a complete SoC platform for FPGA-based designs. */
