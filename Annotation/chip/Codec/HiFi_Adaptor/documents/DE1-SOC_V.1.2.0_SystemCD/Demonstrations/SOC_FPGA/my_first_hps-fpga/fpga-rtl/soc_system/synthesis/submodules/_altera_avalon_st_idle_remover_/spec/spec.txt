Module name: altera_avalon_st_idle_remover.
Module specification: The "altera_avalon_st_idle_remover" module processes incoming 8-bit data streams to remove idle characters (hexadecimal "4A") and handle escape sequences (hexadecimal "4D") while managing flow control between an input and an output interface. The module's input ports include `clk` (clock) for synchronization, `reset_n` (active-low reset) for resetting internal states, `in_valid` (input valid) to indicate valid incoming data, `in_data` (input data) which is the 8-bit data stream, and `out_ready` (output ready) to check if the downstream module can accept data. The output ports are `in_ready` (input ready) indicating the moduleâ€™s readiness to accept data, `out_valid` (output valid) signaling that the output data is valid, and `out_data` (output data) which sends adjusted data after processing. Internally, `received_esc` is a register tracking if an escape character has been received, affecting subsequent data processing. `escape_char` signals the detection of an escape character, and `idle_char` detects if the current data is an idle character, both used for controlling data flow and transformation. The Verilog code consists of two main always blocks and assignments: one for handling the reset and state of the escape detection, and the other for assigning output signals based on the presence and processing of escape and idle characters.
