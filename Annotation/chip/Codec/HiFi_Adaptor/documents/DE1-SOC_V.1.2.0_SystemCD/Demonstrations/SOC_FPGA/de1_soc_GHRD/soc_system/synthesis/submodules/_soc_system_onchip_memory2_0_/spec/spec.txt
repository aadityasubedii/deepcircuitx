Module name: soc_system_onchip_memory2_0. Module specification: The soc_system_onchip_memory2_0 module is designed to implement a single-port RAM block for an on-chip memory in a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, utilizing `altsyncram`, a parameterized module from the Altera library. The module manages memory with an array of input and output ports: `address` (13-bit memory address input), `byteenable` (8-bit input to enable specific bytes on the data bus), `chipselect` (activates memory module), `clk` (clock input), `clken` (enables clock), `reset` (initializes memory), `reset_req` (suspends memory operations), `write` (determines read/write operation), and `writedata` (64-bit input data). The single output, `readdata`, releases the data from the specified memory address. Internally, the module utilizes `clocken0` (Anded result of `clken` and not `reset_req` to control clock operations within the module) and `wren` (write enable signal, active when `chipselect` and `write` are high). The moduleâ€™s hierarchical structure includes an `altsyncram` instantiation with parameters setting its physical characteristics and operational behavior (like memory size, data width, and initial content), and signal assignments that form the logic for `wren` and `clocken0`. Additionally, settings in `defparam` statements configure the specifics of the `altsyncram` such as memory depth, operational mode, and data width. This module effectively handles memory data operations synchronously under controlled conditions set by the internal and input signals.
