Module-level comment: The soc_system_onchip_memory2_0 is a Verilog module for a single-port RAM in SoC, using an `altsyncram` with configurable parameters such as memory size and data width. It intakes signals for address, data I/O, and control, using internal logic (`wren` and `clocken0`) to manage read and write operations based on clocking and reset conditions, ensuring synchronous data handling within the memory block.
