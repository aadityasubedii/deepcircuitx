    "spec": "Module name: hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync. \n\nModule specification: The `hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync` module is designed to synchronize an asynchronous active-low reset signal (`reset_n`) with a system clock signal (`clk`) to ensure stable and reliable operation in digital hardware designs, particularly avoiding metastability. The module features two primary input ports: `reset_n`, which receives the asynchronous reset signal, and `clk`, the system clock that drives the synchronization process. It outputs a synchronized reset signal through the `reset_n_sync` port, which is a stable reset signal aligned with the clock cycles, created to mitigate risks of metastability. Internally, the module utilizes a register array named `reset_reg`, configured as a shift register with multiple stages defined by the sum of `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` and `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT` minus two. This register array helps in step-by-step synchronization of the input reset signal by capturing and holding the state from the previous stage on each positive clock edge, ultimately outputting the synchronized reset through the last stage of the register. The Verilog code structure includes a generate block which programmatically creates multiple instances of synchronization stages, essential for adjusting the depth of the synchronization chain (`RESET_SYNC_STAGES`) and handling multiple outputs (`NUM_RESET_OUTPUT`). Special FPGA attributes are applied to `reset_reg` to optimize synchronization performance and safety. The output port `reset_n_sync` is directly assigned from specific slices of `reset_reg`, based on configured parameters, ensuring that the output reset signal is both synchronized and adheres to system specifications.",

The module takes an active low reset signal (`reset_n`) and a clock signal (`clk`) as inputs and outputs a synchronized reset signal (`reset_n_sync`). It uses a shift register technique where each flip-flop stage in the register captures the state of the previous stage at each clock edge. This chain of flip-flops (number of stages defined by `RESET_SYNC_STAGES`) effectively delays the assertion and deassertion of the reset signal by several clock cycles, ensuring stable operation by the time the signal is used in the rest of the system. The parameter `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT` defines the width of the output synchronized reset signal. The attributes set for the register help in making optimizations and setting constraints suitable for safe synchronization of the asynchronous reset signal."

In this module, it is synchronized to the clock to avoid metastability issues.\n- `clk` is the clock input signal.

It is derived from synchronizing the input reset signal (`reset_n`) with the clock (`clk`) using multiple stages. It provides a stable and synchronized reset signal to downstream digital circuits, reducing the risk of metastability due to asynchronous reset signals. The output ensures that the reset activation/deactivation aligns properly with the clock cycles, enhancing the reliability of the system operation."

The initial stages of this register are responsible for capturing and propagating the reset signal, while the final stage outputs the synchronized reset signal.
