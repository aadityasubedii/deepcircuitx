    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_packets_to_bytes` module serializes packet data into bytes for Avalon-ST interfaces, handling packet boundaries and channel changes. It uses internal logic and state flags like `sent_esc` and `channel_count` to manage the encapsulation and framing of the data, ensuring all Avalon-ST rules for data transfer are respected, including data escaping for special characters and sequencing for packet start, end, and channel change notifications. This module is designed for robust data streaming in systems requiring precise packet handling and byte alignment."
