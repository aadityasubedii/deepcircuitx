Module name: altera_jtag_streaming. 

Module specification: The "altera_jtag_streaming" module facilitates JTAG-based data streaming operations by handling various JTAG transactions using internal state machines, synchronizers, and data processors. This module interacts with input ports such as `tck` (JTAG clock), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `sink_data` (input data from JTAG data register), `sink_valid` (indicates if input data is valid), `clock_to_sample` (alternative sampling clock), `reset_to_sample` (reset for the sampling clock), and `ir_in` (instruction register input which guides the module's operation). The output ports include `tck` (mirrored input JTAG clock), `source_data` (processed output data), `source_valid` (indicates if output data is valid), `sink_ready` (indicates readiness to receive more data), `resetrequest` (can request a system-wide reset), `debug_reset`, `mgmt_valid`, `mgmt_channel`, and `mgmt_data` which pertain to management functionalities activated by the `MGMT_CHANNEL_WIDTH` parameter. Internal signals such as `ir_out`, `tdo`, and `tdi` facilitate JTAG interfacing, while signals like `write_state`, `read_state`, and `scan_length_byte_counter` manage data handling states and byte counts. The module implements blocks for idle data insertion and removal, clock domain synchronization, and optionally, management extensions where management functionalities get triggered by specific JTAG instructions. These functionalities collectively manage JTAG data streaming effectively, making the module suitable for applications requiring robust JTAG transaction handling.
