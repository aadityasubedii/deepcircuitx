Module name: altera_edge_detector. Module specification: The "altera_edge_detector" module is a finite state machine designed to detect edges (rising or falling based on the configuration) in a digital signal and generate corresponding output pulses, which can be extended over multiple clock cycles. It operates with input ports: 'clk' (clock input synchronizing operations), 'rst_n' (active-low reset), and 'signal_in' (digital signal input for edge detection). The output port 'pulse_out' emits the detected pulse. Internally, the module utilizes several signals: 'state' and 'next_state' manage current and future states of the machine across IDLE, ARM, and CAPT states; 'pulse_detect' helps in decision-making for pulse generation; 'busy_pulsing' indicates ongoing pulse output impacting reset behavior; 'reset_qual_n' combines 'rst_n' and 'busy_pulsing' to conditionally manage resets; 'extend_pulse' and 'pulse_reg' handle pulse extension based on configuration. The code is structured into conditional blocks handling pulse extension settings and the main state transitions orchestrating the detection and output logic based on signal inputs and parameter settings.
