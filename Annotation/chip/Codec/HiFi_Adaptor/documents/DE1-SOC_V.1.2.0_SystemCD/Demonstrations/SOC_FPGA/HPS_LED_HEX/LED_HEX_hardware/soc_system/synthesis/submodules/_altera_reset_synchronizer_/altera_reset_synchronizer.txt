Module-level comment: The 'altera_reset_synchronizer' module synchronizes an asynchronous reset signal with a clock signal in FPGA systems. It uses a shift register ('altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain') to delay and stabilize the reset signal, handling it either immediately on 'reset_in' assertion or aligned with the clock edge based on 'ASYNC_RESET'. The final synchronized signal is output as 'reset_out'.
