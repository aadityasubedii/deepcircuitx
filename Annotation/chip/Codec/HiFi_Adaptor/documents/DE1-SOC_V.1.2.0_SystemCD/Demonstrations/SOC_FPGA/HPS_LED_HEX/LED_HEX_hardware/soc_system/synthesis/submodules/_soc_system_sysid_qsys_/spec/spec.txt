Module name: soc_system_sysid_qsys. Module specification: The `soc_system_sysid_qsys` module is a simple digital logic component in Verilog that outputs a specific 32-bit data value based on the state of its input address signal. The module consists of one input port named `address`, which controls the output data value. When `address` is true (non-zero), `readdata` outputs the value 1383720737, and when `address` is false (zero), it outputs 2899645186. Additional input ports include `clock` and `reset_n`, which are standard for synchronous operations but are not used in the logic of this module. The sole output port is `readdata`, a 32-bit wire assigned conditionally based on the `address` input. This assignment is handled directly in the always block at the top level of the module, indicating straightforward conditional logic without any blocks or state machines for more complex data handling. The simplicity of the module ensures quick understanding and minimizes potential for faults, making it an effective solution for systems requiring deterministic outputs based on binary address input.
