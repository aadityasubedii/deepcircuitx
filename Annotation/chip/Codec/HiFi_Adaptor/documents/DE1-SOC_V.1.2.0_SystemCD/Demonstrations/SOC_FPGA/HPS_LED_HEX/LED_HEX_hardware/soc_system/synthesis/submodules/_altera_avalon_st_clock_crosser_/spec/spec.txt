Module name: altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser. 

Module specification: The altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser is a Verilog module designed to ensure safe data transfer across different clock domains within an FPGA environment, mitigating issues like data corruption and timing errors. It utilizes input ports such as `in_clk`, `in_reset`, `in_valid`, `in_data`, `out_clk`, `out_reset`, and `out_ready` for clock signals, resets, data validation, and readiness signals for input and output domains respectively. The output ports `in_ready`, `out_valid`, and `out_data` indicate the module's readiness to receive new data, the validity of the output data, and the actual output data that has transitioned domains. Essential internal signals such as `in_data_buffer`, `out_data_buffer`, `in_data_toggle`, `out_data_toggle` and more, help in buffering and toggling data between the domains, managing data validity and transfer readiness. The module employs synchronizers such as `altera_std_synchronizer` for stable signal transitions across domains and optionally includes an output pipeline (`altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base`) controlled by the `USE_OUTPUT_PIPELINE` parameter, which further enhances data flow management at the output stage. This structured approach ensures the robust handling and integrity of data as it moves between the asynchronous clock domains.
