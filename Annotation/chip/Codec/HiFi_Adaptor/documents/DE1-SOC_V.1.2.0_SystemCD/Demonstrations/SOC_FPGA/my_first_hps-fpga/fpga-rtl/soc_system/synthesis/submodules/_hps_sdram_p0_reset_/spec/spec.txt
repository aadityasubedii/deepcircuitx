Module name: hps_sdram_p0_reset. Module specification: The "hps_sdram_p0_reset" module is key to generating synchronized reset signals for various clock domains of an SDRAM controller, ensuring stable operation in hardware platforms like FPGAs or ASICs. It takes multiple clock inputs (pll_afi_clk, pll_addr_cmd_clk, pll_dqs_ena_clk, seq_clk, scc_clk, pll_avl_clk), and boolean inputs indicating memory stability (seq_reset_mem_stable), PLL lock status (pll_locked), and resets (global_reset_n, soft_reset_n). The module outputs various synchronized reset signals, including for SCC, Avalon Interface, AFI, address/command, DQS enable, and sequencing logic clock domains, as well as for individual read capture clock domains. Internally, the major signals include `phy_reset_n`, derived from PLL lock and reset status, and `phy_reset_mem_stable_n`, combining `phy_reset_n` with memory stabilization input. The module also processes an array of resets for read capture clock domains using a generate loop and employs a sub-module "hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync" to synchronize resets across domains. The configurations for synchronization such as stages and number of resets are parameterized to allow flexibility. Various instances of this sub-module cater to different clock inputs, ensuring that each reset output is correctly aligned to its corresponding clock domain.
