Module name: soc_system_mm_interconnect_0. Module specification: This module implements a complex interconnect fabric for a system-on-chip (SoC) design, facilitating communication between multiple master and slave components. It handles AXI and Avalon interfaces, performing address decoding, data width adaptation, and burst transactions. Key input ports include AXI master signals (e.g., hps_0_h2f_axi_master_awid, hps_0_h2f_axi_master_awaddr) and Avalon master signals (e.g., fpga_only_master_master_address), while output ports consist of corresponding slave interface signals (e.g., onchip_memory2_0_s1_address, jtag_uart_avalon_jtag_slave_write). Internal signals such as cmd_xbar_mux
