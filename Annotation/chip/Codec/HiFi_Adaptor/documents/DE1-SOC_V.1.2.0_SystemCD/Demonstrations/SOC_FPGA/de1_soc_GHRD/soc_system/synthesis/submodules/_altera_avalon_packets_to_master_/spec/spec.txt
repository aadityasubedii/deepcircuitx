Module name: altera_avalon_packets_to_master. Module specification: This module is designed to convert packet data to Avalon-MM master transactions and vice versa. It supports both read and write operations with incremental and non-incremental addressing modes. The module has input ports for clock, reset, packet data, and Avalon-MM slave interface signals, and output ports for packet readiness, Avalon-MM master interface signals, and response data. Internally, it uses signals such as fifo_readdata, fifo_write, and fifo_empty to manage data flow through a FIFO buffer. The module can be configured to use either a fast version with separate packet-to-FIFO and FIFO-to-packet submodules or a simpler direct conversion version. The fast version includes three main blocks: packets_to_fifo for converting input packets to FIFO data, fi
