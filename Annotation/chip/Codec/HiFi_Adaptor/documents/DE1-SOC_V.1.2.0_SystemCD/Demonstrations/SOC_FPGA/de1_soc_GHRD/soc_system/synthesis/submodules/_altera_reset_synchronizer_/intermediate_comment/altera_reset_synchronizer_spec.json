    "spec": "Module name: altera_reset_synchronizer. Module specification: The `altera_reset_synchronizer` module, employed in Verilog, is specifically designed to synchronize an asynchronous reset signal (`reset_in`) to a specified clock (`clk`). The functionality of the module revolves around ensuring safe usage of reset signals within synchronous designs, achieved by means of a shift register mechanism. The input ports include `reset_in`, an asynchronous reset input, and `clk`, the clock signal to which the reset is to be synchronized. The module offers a single output port, `reset_out`, which delivers the synchronized reset signal appropriate for use within the specified clock domain. Internally, the module utilizes a register array `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain`, sized according to a configurable depth parameter (`DEPTH`), to debouncethe reset signal. The output of this synchronization process is then held in `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out`. The module code includes a conditional generate block that distinguishes two operational modes based on the `ASYNC_RESET` parameter: 1) When `ASYYNC_RESET` is enabled, the synchronization is sensitive to both the clock's and reset input\u2019s positive edges, initializing all bits in the shift register to 1 upon reset activation, thereby enabling immediate response to reset conditions. 2) When disabled, the synchronization updates based only on the clock's positive edge, capturing the reset input state directly into the shift register, this mode omits the immediate reset responsiveness, likely suiting environments where the input reset is already partially stable. Both paths utilize procedural blocks (`always` blocks) to update the shift register content and output synchronized signal accordingly.",

It uses a shift register mechanism where the depth of the register can be configured via the DEPTH parameter. When `ASYNC_RESET` is enabled, the module triggers a reset upon a positive edge of either the clk or reset_in signal. If the reset signal is active, it sets all bits in the shift register to 1 and outputs a reset signal. If not active, it shifts the register values, effectively debouncing the asynchronous reset input to avoid metastability issues. If `ASYNC_RESET` is disabled, it omits the reset sensitivity to update the internal shift register only on the clock's positive edge, where the last bit takes the input reset state directly. The output reset signal is derived from the first bit of the shift register."

On every positive clock edge (and additionally on the positive edge of `reset_in` if `ASYNC_RESET` is enabled), the bits in this register are shifted, and the input or previous bits determine the value of the next bit.
