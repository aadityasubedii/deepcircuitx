Module name: debounce. Module specification: The 'debounce' module is tailored to filter spurious changes in digital input signals by ensuring that each bit of the input signal remains in a consistent state for a specified duration before reflecting this state on the output. This module utilizes a parameterized approach to cater to different signal widths and timeout durations. It has input ports including 'clk' (clock signal for synchronization), 'reset_n' (active-low reset to initialize counters), and 'data_in' (noisy input signal). The output port 'data_out' provides a stabilized version of 'data_in'. Internal to the module, 'counter' arrays store the count for each bit's stability duration, 'counter_reset' signals reset these counts based on input signal changes, and 'counter_enable' signals allow counters to increment when conditions meet specified stability criteria. The Verilog code defines dynamic generation of debounce logic for multiple bits through a generate block, which includes conditional structures to handle different polarities ('HIGH' or 'LOW') for stabilization. This conditional logic also governs the reset and enablement of counters and ultimately determines the output based on whether the count has reached the specified 'TIMEOUT'. Additionally, the module is parameterized with 'WIDTH' to handle different numbers of input and output bits, 'POLARITY' to select the stabilization condition, 'TIMEOUT' for duration of signal stabilization, and 'TIMEOUT_WIDTH' to accommodate the counter size.
