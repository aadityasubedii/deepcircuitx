Module-level comment: The "altera_avalon_st_idle_remover" module processes 8-bit streaming data to remove idle characters (hex "4A") and manage escape sequences (hex "4D"), ensuring adjusted data flow between input and output interfaces. Utilizes internal flags to track and influence the data processing, specifically through sequences affected by detected escape characters. It manages flow control with ready and valid signals to synchronize data transfer and processing.
