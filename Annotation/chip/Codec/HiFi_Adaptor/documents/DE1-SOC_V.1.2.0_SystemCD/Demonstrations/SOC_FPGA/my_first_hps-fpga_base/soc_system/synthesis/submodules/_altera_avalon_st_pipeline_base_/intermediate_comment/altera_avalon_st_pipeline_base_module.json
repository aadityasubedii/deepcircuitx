    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base` module functions as a pipeline stage with data buffering in streaming setups. It uses internal dual-buffer registers (`data0`, `data1`) and control flags (`full0`, `full1`) to manage data transfers, operating in either registered or unregistered modes based on `PIPELINE_READY`. Efficient flow control is maintained through ready-valid signaling for stable data transmission across pipeline stages."
