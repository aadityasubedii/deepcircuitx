    "module": "Module-level comment: The hps_sdram_p0_iss_probe module is designed for monitoring SDRAM interface signals via probing in a debug or test setup, primarily within a JTAG environment. It implements a `altsource_probe` instance named `iss_probe_inst` that directly connects to the `probe_input` to capture signal data, although other typical JTAG signals like `tdi`, `tdo`, and various state signals are present but unconnected. Specific parameters for the probe instance control attributes like metastability, indexing, and initialization to facilitate controlled testing scenarios."
