    "spec": "Module name: altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter.  \nModule specification: The `altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter` module is a Verilog RTL designed to handle streaming data by managing idle and escape characters, making it ideal for communication protocols. It inserts an idle character `0x4A` or performs an XOR operation on the data preceded by an escape character `0x4D`. The input ports include `clk` (clock signal), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `in_valid` (indicating incoming data validity), `in_data` (8-bit input data bus), and `out_ready` (indicating if the downstream is ready to receive data). The output ports are `in_ready` (indicating readiness to accept more data), `out_valid` (indicating the validity of output data), and `out_data` (8-bit processed data output). Internal signals such as `received_esc` (register to track if an escape character was received), `escape_char` (wire to detect the escape character in input data), and `idle_char` (wire to check for idle character in input data) are crucial for the functioning of this module. In the code, two main procedural blocks can be observed: one sequential block controlled by the clock and reset signals used to update the state of `received_esc`, and one combinational block that determines the values of `out_valid`, `in_ready`, and `out_data` based on the current inputs and the state of internal signals. This structure ensures efficient data processing and flow control in systems requiring special character handling in data streams.",

It functions by inserting a specific character, `0x4A` (idle character) or modifying data with an XOR operation if preceded by an escape character (`0x4D`). The module ensures that data flows smoothly only when the output is ready and respects the sequence of special characters by tracking escape sequences. This makes it suitable for communication protocols or data handling where special characters modify the stream behavior or signal special conditions."

It is used to initialize or reset the module's internal registers and logic to a defined state.\n- `in_valid`: This signal indicates when the data on the `in_data` input is valid. The module uses this signal to decide when to process incoming data.\n- `in_data`: This is an 8-bit input data bus. It carries the actual data to be processed by the module.\n- `out_ready`: This signal from the downstream module or logic indicates that it is ready to accept data. The module uses this signal to control the flow of data, ensuring it only sends data when the downstream is ready to receive it.\n\nOutput ports: in_ready, out_valid, out_data.\nExplanation:\n- `in_ready`: This output signal communicates to the upstream module or logic whether the current module is ready to accept more data. It plays a crucial role in controlling the flow of incoming data.\n- `out_valid`: This signal indicates to downstream modules or logic that the data on the `out_data` output is valid. This signal ensures downstream components only process valid data.\n- `out_data`: This is an 8-bit output data bus that carries the processed data out of the module. The data transmitted may be an idle character, a modified character if preceded by an escape character, or the data itself based on the logic conditions set within the module."

It helps in deciding how to process the incoming character, especially in determining whether to apply an XOR operation.\n- `escape_char`: This wire computes and indicates whether the current `in_data` is an escape character (`0x4D`). If true, it influences the logic to set `received_esc` for handling the next character accordingly.\n- `idle_char`: This wire determines if the current `in_data` represents an idle character (`0x4A`). When `in_data` matches the idle character and no escape sequence was previously started, the module handles it by generating an idle character in the output. This helps in managing idle conditions in the data stream effectively."
