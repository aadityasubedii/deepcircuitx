    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_idle_remover` Verilog module processes 8-bit data streams to eliminate idle characters and handle escape sequences. It operates with synchronous `clk` input and uses signals `in_valid`, `out_ready` to control data flow. Internally, it tracks escape reception via `received_esc` and modifies data upon escape detection. Idle data is detected and excluded from output to ensure streamlined data processing and handling of escape characters."
