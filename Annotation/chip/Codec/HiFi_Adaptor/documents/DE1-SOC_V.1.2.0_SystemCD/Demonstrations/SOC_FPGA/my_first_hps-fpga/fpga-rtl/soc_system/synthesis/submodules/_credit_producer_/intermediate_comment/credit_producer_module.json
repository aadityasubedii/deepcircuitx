    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'credit_producer' module calculates symbol and packet credits in data transmission systems. It uses inputs like 'in_valid', 'in_ready', and 'in_endofpacket' to manage credits synchronized with a clock signal. Configurable parameters allow dynamic adjustments. The internal logic includes beat detection, simultaneous credit updates, and handling of different symbol-to-credit ratios, efficiently updating credits for optimal data flow management."
