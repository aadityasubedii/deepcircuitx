It employs a series of flip-flops to filter out any glitches in the asynchronous reset signal by using multiple stages of synchronization defined by `RESET_SYNC_STAGES`. The synchronously de-asserted reset signal (`reset_n_sync`) is then safely distributed to other parts of the system that operate under the same clock domain, thereby reducing the risk of metastability issues in the system. The attributes attached to the register `reset_reg` ensure that the synchronization logic is recognized and treated appropriately by synthesis tools."
