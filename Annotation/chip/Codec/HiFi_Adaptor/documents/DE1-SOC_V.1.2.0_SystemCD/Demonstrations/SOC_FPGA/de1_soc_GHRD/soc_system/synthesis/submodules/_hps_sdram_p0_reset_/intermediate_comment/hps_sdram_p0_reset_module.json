    "module": "Module-level comment: The hps_sdram_p0_reset module synchronizes reset signals for SDRAM memory interface clock domains. It inputs multiple PLL clocks, reset indications, and utilizes the `hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync` sub-module for specifics like afi_clk, addr_cmd_clk, and read_capture_clk to ensure resets are aligned with each clock domain. Internal signals combine PLL lock status with global and soft resets to control reset release based on operation needs and memory stability."
