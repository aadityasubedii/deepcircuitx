    "spec": "Module name: altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter. \n\nModule specification: The 'altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter' module is designed for data stream processing, specifically inserting idle characters under specified conditions in a streaming interface. The module operates on a clock signal (`clk`) and remains in a safe state until released by an active-low reset signal (`reset_n`). The inputs to the module include `in_valid` which signifies valid incoming data, `in_data` an 8-bit input data stream, and `out_ready` indicating the downstream module's readiness to accept data. The outputs consist of `in_ready`, signaling upstream readiness for data reception, `out_valid` confirming the validity of outgoing data, and `out_data` the processed 8-bit outgoing data stream. Internally, the module utilizes `received_esc`, a register that flags the receipt of escape characters under certain conditions. The `escape_char` and `idle_char` signals identify specific byte values in the data, triggering adjusted behaviors in data handling. The Verilog implementation features two primary procedural blocks: the first is an always block sensitive to the clock and reset, managing the state of `received_esc` based on data character content and stream readiness. The second always block, a combinational logic block, determines the states of `in_ready`, `out_valid`, and the modifications (if necessary) to `out_data`. This setup ensures immediate response to input changes and stream conditions, regulating data flow compliantly with the embedded character processing rules.",

It receives input data and validates it based on the input stream\u2019s readiness and validity. The module detects idle and escape characters in the data stream, using this information to manage an internal state `received_esc` and accordingly manipulate outgoing data values and control signals. If the input data contains idle or escape characters and the outgoing stream is ready but these special characters were not recently received, the module flags the `received_esc`. It ensures the transferred data alternates these special characters' representation to prevent misinterpretation. The output is valid continuously, and output data is determined based on the received escape flag and content of incoming data, either directly transferring, modifying, or replacing with an idle character."
