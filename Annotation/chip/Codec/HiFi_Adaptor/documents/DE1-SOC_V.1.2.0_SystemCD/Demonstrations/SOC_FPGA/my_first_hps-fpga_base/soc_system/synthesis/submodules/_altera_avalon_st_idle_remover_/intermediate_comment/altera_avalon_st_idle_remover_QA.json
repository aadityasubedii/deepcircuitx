It operates on the incoming data (in_data) and checks for idle characters (0x4A) and escape characters (0x4D). If an escape character is detected, the subsequent data byte is transformed by XORing it with 0x20. The module outputs the processed data (out_data) and signals when the data is valid (out_valid). The input and output readiness is synchronized, ensuring that data is transmitted smoothly without congestion. The module works with a synchronous reset and operates on the rising edge of the system clock (clk)."
