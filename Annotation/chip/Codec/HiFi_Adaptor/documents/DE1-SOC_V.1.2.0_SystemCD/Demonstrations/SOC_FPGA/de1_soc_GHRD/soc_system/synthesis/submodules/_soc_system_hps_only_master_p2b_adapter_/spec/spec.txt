Module name: soc_system_hps_only_master_p2b_adapter. 
Module specification: The `soc_system_hps_only_master_p2b_adapter` module is designed to transfer data signals synchronously across interfaces in response to a clock signal. It functions as a bridge or adapter between differing signal protocols by ensuring the matching of validity and readiness states between input and output interfaces. The input ports include `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `in_valid` (indicates if input data is valid), `in_data` (8-bit input data bus), `in_startofpacket` and `in_endofpacket` (signals framing data packets), and `out_ready` (signaling if the receiving side is ready for data). The output ports consist of `in_ready` (shows readiness to accept input data), `out_valid` (mirrors the input validity), `out_data` (8-bit output data bus), `out_startofpacket`, `out_endofpacket`, and `out_channel` (a static 8-bit signal for additional data, typically used for channel identification). Internally, the module includes a signal `in_channel`, which is a register initialized to 0, used primarily for channel identification but remains static in this implementation. The main logic is encapsulated in an always block which conditions the outputs directly on the inputs and the internal register `in_channel`, with an emphasis on real-time, synchronous data transfer by mirroring the states of `out_ready` to `in_ready` and `in_valid` to `out_valid`, thereby ensuring that the data integrity and packet framing are maintained across the interconnecting modules.
