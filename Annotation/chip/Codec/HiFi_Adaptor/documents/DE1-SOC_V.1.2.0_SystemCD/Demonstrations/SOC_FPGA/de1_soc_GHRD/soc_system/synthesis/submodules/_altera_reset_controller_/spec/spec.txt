Module name: `altera_reset_controller`.

Module specification: The `altera_reset_controller` is a crucial Verilog module designed to manage and synchronize reset signals in digital circuits. It accepts multiple reset (`reset_inX`) and reset request (`reset_req_inX`) inputs, where X ranges from 0 to 15, reflecting various reset conditions across different modules or systems. The primary output ports include `reset_out` for the synchronized reset signal and `reset_req` for the synchronized reset request signal, catering to system-wide reset needs and synchronization requirements. Internally, signals like `merged_reset`, which consolidates input resets using a logical OR operation, and `merged_reset_req_in`, which combines reset request inputs based on parameter settings, play key roles in the module's function. The module utilizes various internal blocks for the synchronization and management of reset signals. These include a general condition synchronization and a specialized block for managing more complex reset requirements, such as when extended synchronization or specific timing considerations are involved. The synchronization mechanism leverages parameters such as `SYNC_DEPTH` to achieve stability against issues like metastability by configuring synchronization depths and reset timings precisely. Overall, the `altera_reset_controller` provides a robust and configurable solution for handling resets in complex digital systems, ensuring reliable operation and interoperability of various system components.
