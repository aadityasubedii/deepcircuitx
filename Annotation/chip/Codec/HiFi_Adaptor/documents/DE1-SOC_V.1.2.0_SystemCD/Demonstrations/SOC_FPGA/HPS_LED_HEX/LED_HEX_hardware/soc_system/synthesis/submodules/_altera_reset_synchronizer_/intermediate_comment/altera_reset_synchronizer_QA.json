The module accepts an asynchronous reset input signal (`reset_in`) and a clock signal (`clk`) and outputs a synchronized reset signal (`reset_out`). Based on the parameter `ASYNC_RESET`, if set to 1, it handles the reset immediately when `reset_in` is asserted, otherwise, it synchronizes the reset signal with the clock edges. The module utilizes a shift register (`altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain`) with a length defined by the `DEPTH` parameter to manage and delay the reset signal appropriately, helping to protect against metastability in the digital system."
