It uses input signals such as clock inputs from various PLL outputs, overall locking status of PLL (`pll_locked`), and global/soft reset signals to generate stable, synchronized reset outputs for use in various sub-modules like the SDRAM controller, address/command, and data capture circuits. The module uses instances of the `hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync` submodule to ensure that the reset signals are properly synchronized to prevent glitches and ensure stable operation of the SDRAM interface. Parameters like `MEM_READ_DQS_WIDTH` and `NUM_AFI_RESET` allow customization for different configurations and sizes of SDRAM modules."
