Module name: SEG7_IF. 

Module specification: The SEG7_IF module is designed as an interface for a 7-segment display controller, primarily concerned with managing data display on multiple 7-segment displays. It operates with multiple input ports such as s_clk (system clock), s_address (identifies the target segment display), s_read (enables output of stored data), s_write (enables data writing), s_writedata (data intended for a specific segment display), and s_reset (resets registers). The module has two output ports: s_readdata (outputs the data stored at the specified address), and SEG7 (controls the actual segment displays reflecting the register file state). Internally, the module uses signals like base_index (calculates address offset in the register array), write_data (temporarily holds data being written), read_data (temporarily holds data being read), and reg_file (an array storing the state of all managed segment displays). The code includes blocks handling reset operations (initializing the register states), write operations (writing input data to the specified register), read operations (reading data from the register into the output), and output assignments (establishing segment display outputs and read data). Each operation is sensitive to the negative edge of the system clock to ensure synchronization, and the use of parameters allows configuration of module specifics like active-high/low operations and total segments managed.
