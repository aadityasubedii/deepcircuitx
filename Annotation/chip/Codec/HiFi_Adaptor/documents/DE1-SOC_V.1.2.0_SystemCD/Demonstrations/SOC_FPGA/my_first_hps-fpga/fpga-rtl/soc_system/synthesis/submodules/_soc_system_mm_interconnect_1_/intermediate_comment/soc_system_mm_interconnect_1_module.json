It uses address routers, width adapters, demultiplexers, \nmultiplexers, and a traffic limiter to handle data routing, protocol conversions, \narbitration, and data width adaptations. The module supports separate read and write \nchannels, facilitating efficient communication between different interfaces in the system.\n*/"
