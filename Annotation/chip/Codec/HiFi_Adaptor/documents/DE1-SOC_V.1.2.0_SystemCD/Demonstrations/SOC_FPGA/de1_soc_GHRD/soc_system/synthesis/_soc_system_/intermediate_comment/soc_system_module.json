    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a System-on-Chip (SoC) design integrating an HPS with various peripherals and memory interfaces. It uses AXI interconnects to facilitate communication between the HPS and FPGA fabric, incorporating onchip memory, master interfaces, peripheral controllers (LED, button, DIP switch PIOs), JTAG UART, and interrupt handling. The module manages clock distribution, reset control, and provides interfaces for Ethernet, QSPI, SD card, USB, SPI, UART, and GPIO."
