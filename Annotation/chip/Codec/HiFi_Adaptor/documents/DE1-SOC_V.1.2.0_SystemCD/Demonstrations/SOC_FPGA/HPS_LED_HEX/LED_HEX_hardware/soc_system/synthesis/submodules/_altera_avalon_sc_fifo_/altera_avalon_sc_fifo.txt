Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable FIFO buffer for Avalon streaming interfaces, supporting packet-based communication and various data widths. It uses parameterized memory (block or shift register) for storage, manages read/write pointers, and handles full/empty conditions. Optional features include fill level monitoring, almost full/empty signaling, and store-and-forward functionality. The module implements packet handling with error detection and optional dropping, making it suitable for real-time data stream management in digital systems.
