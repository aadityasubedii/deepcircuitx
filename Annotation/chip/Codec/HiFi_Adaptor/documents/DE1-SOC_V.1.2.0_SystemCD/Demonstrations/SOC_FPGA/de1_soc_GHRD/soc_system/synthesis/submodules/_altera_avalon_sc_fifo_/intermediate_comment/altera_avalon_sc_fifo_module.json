    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable FIFO buffer with packet handling capabilities. It uses parameterized memory blocks or shift registers for data storage, supports variable data widths and depths, and includes features like error handling, fill level tracking, and almost full/empty signaling. The module employs pointer-based or shift register-based read/write operations, handles packet integrity, and provides a control/status register interface for dynamic configuration and monitoring."
