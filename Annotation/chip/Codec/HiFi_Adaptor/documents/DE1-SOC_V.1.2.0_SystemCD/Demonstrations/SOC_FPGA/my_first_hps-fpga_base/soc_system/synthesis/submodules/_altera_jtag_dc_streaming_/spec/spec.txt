Module name: altera_jtag_dc_streaming. 

Module specification: The "altera_jtag_dc_streaming" module is designed for efficient data streaming across different clock domains in systems utilizing JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) interfaces. This module manages synchronization and data transfer between these clock domains, featuring input ports such as `clk` (main clock input), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `sink_data` (input data stream), and `sink_valid` (indicates validity of sink data). Output ports include `source_data` and `source_valid` for the outgoing data stream, `sink_ready` for flow control, `resetrequest`, `debug_reset`, `mgmt_valid`, `mgmt_channel`, and `mgmt_data` providing management and debugging functionalities. Internal signals such as `jtag_clock` and `jtag_clock_reset_n` serve as the JTAG-specific clock and reset lines, with signals like `jtag_source_data`, `jtag_sink_data`, and their associated control signals managing internal data flow. Key code blocks include the `altera_std_synchronizer` for signal synchronization, `altera_jtag_streaming` for JTAG-specific streaming operations, and `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser` and `altera_jtag_src_crosser` for managing data crossing between source and sink clock domains. This module is crucial for applications requiring reliable data transmission between different operational domains, particularly in systems where JTAG is used for configuration and debugging purposes.
