It handles reading the current state of the dip switches, detecting edge transitions (changes in state), and managing interrupt requests based on these transitions. The ability to read from and write to specific registers (such as masks and edge capture registers) is also provided, enabling configuration and control of interrupt generation based on the dip switch inputs. Additionally, the module includes debouncing functionality by capturing inputs across two clock edges to ensure stable switch state readings."

It represents the current state of the switches.\n- reset_n: An active-low reset signal that initializes the module\u2019s internal registers and logic when asserted (set to 0).\n- write_n: An active-low signal that determines when a write operation is being performed to the module.\n- writedata: A 32-bit input used during write operations to pass the data that should be written to the selected internal register.\n\nOutput ports:\n- irq: Interrupt request output signal. It goes high to indicate to the processor that an interrupt has been triggered based on the edge detection of the dip switch inputs and the interrupt mask settings.\n- readdata: A 32-bit output which holds the data from the internal registers (selected by the address input) that are read by external entities.\n\nExplanation:\nThe input ports serve to receive external signals and data, allowing the module to perform its intended operations like reading switch states, configuration through writes to internal registers, and reacting to control signals like reset and chipselect. The output ports provide feedback and data outward from the module, specifically for interrupt signaling and data reading purposes, which are essential for interacting with the rest of the system-on-chip environment."
