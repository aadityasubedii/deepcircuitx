    "spec": "Module name: altera_jtag_sld_node. Module specification: The `altera_jtag_sld_node` is a Verilog module designed to simulate JTAG operations within an Altera FPGA environment by managing interactions with JTAG signals\u2014TDI, TDO, TCK\u2014and virtual JTAG states for device testing and configuration. The module accepts two input ports, `ir_out` (3-bit input for incoming instruction register data) and `tdo` (Test Data Out signal from the JTAG chain). It outputs `ir_in` (3-bit outgoing instruction register data), `tck` (JTAG Test Clock), `tdi` (Test Data In signal), and several virtual state signals (`virtual_state_cdr`, `virtual_state_cir`, `virtual_state_e1dr`, `virtual_state_e2dr`, `virtual_state_pdr`, `virtual_state_sdr`, `virtual_state_udr`, `virtual_state_uir`) used for simulating various JTAG states. The internal signals, namely `simulation_clock`, `sdrs`, `cdr`, `sdr`, `e1dr`, `udr`, and `bit_index`, assist in controlling these operations based on the defined JTAG frequency, manage virtual states, and track bit positions during data shifts. The code is sectioned into blocks protected by `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS` preprocessor directives, facilitating both simulation components and real hardware interfacing through tasks like `reset_jtag_state`, mode transitions (`enter_data_mode`, `enter_loopback_mode` etc.), and data transferring tasks (`shift_one_bit`, `shift_one_byte`). These tasks handle various testing modes, state transitions and data manipulation, making this module versatile for JTAG-based testing and configurations in FPGA designs.",

Module specification: The `altera_jtag_sld_node` is a Verilog module designed to simulate JTAG operations within an Altera FPGA environment by managing interactions with JTAG signals\u2014TDI, TDO, TCK\u2014and virtual JTAG states for device testing and configuration. The module accepts two input ports, `ir_out` (3-bit input for incoming instruction register data) and `tdo` (Test Data Out signal from the JTAG chain). It outputs `ir_in` (3-bit outgoing instruction register data), `tck` (JTAG Test Clock), `tdi` (Test Data In signal), and several virtual state signals (`virtual_state_cdr`, `virtual_state_cir`, `virtual_state_e1dr`, `virtual_state_e2dr`, `virtual_state_pdr`, `virtual_state_sdr`, `virtual_state_udr`, `virtual_state_uir`) used for simulating various JTAG states. The internal signals, namely `simulation_clock`, `sdrs`, `cdr`, `sdr`, `e1dr`, `udr`, and `bit_index`, assist in controlling these operations based on the defined JTAG frequency, manage virtual states, and track bit positions during data shifts. The code is sectioned into blocks protected by `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS` preprocessor directives, facilitating both simulation components and real hardware interfacing through tasks like `reset_jtag_state`, mode transitions (`enter_data_mode`, `enter_loopback_mode` etc.), and data transferring tasks (`shift_one_bit`, `shift_one_byte`). These tasks handle various testing modes, state transitions and data manipulation, making this module versatile for JTAG-based testing and configurations in FPGA designs."
