Module-level comment: The `soc_system_hps_0_hps_io` module interfaces an SoC's HPS with peripheral devices, handling I/O for memory, Ethernet, USB, SPI, UART, SDIO, QSPI, and GPIO. It uses input/output ports to manage signals and data flow, including memory addresses, data synchronization, and device control. Internal sub-module `soc_system_hps_0_hps_io_border` facilitates logical separation, efficiently routing the varied interfacing signals to their designated destinations within the SoC architecture.
