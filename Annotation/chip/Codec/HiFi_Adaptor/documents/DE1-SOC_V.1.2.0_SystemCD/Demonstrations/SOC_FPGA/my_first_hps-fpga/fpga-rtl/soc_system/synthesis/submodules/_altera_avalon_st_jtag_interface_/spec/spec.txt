Module name: altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface. Module specification: The "altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface" is a Verilog module designed to facilitate data communication with Altera's JTAG interface, primarily used for debugging and testing purposes. The module operates in either a normal mode or a PLI (Programming Logic Interface) mode, depending on the USE_PLI parameter. It manages two data streams: upstream (sending data to the host) and downstream (receiving data from the host). Input ports include: clk (system clock), reset_n (active-low reset), source_ready (readiness of data source), sink_data (data from the host), and sink_valid (validity of the incoming data). Output ports are: source_data (data to the host), source_valid (validity of outgoing data), sink_ready (module's readiness to receive data), resetrequest (reset request output), debug_reset (debug-specific reset output), mgmt_valid (validity of management data), mgmt_channel (management data channel), and mgmt_data (management data output). Internal signals such as clk and reset_n drive the module's operations and synchronization. The code is divided into two main blocks, controlled by the USE_PLI parameter: the 'normal' block utilizes an 'altera_jtag_dc_streaming' submodule for handling the data streaming in normal operation mode, and the 'pli_mode' uses an 'altera_pli_streaming' submodule when PLI mode is active, for connecting to a debugging interface. These blocks are instantiated conditionally using the generate construct based on the USE_PLI configuration, allowing flexible operation modes suitable for different testing and debugging scenarios.
