Module name: hps_reset. Module specification: The "hps_reset" is a Verilog module designed for interfacing with hardware probe systems and controls the output based on input signals and a source clock. The module consists of two input ports: 'probe' which is used to receive signals for monitoring or interfacing with test environments, and 'source_clk', a clock input that ensures operations are synchronized with the system's timing. It produces a 3-bit output 'source', which represents the processed signal from the 'probe'. Internally, the module utilizes a 3-bit wire 'sub_wire0' that temporarily holds the output from the 'altsource_probe' component before it is assigned to the output port 'source'. The design incorporates the 'altsource_probe' component which manages the core function of signal processing. This component is configured with parameters that control metastability, instance identifiers, and initialization values to enhance signal integrity and reliability. In summary, the 'hps_reset' module is crucial for detailed oversight and manipulation of signals within a hardware testing or debugging framework, facilitated by sophisticated internal configurations and signal management.
