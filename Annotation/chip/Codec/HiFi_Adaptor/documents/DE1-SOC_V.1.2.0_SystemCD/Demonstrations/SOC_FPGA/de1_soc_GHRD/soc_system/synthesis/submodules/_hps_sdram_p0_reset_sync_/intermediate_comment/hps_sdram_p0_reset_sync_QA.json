Synchronization is achieved using a chain of flip-flops to mitigate issues arising from asynchronous reset signals, such as metastability. The number of flip-flop stages in the chain is configurable through the `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` parameter, and the number of synchronized reset outputs is defined by `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT`. The resulting synchronized reset outputs are provided after passing through the specified number of synchronization stages, thereby ensuring that the reset signal is stable and aligned with the clock domain to which it is being synchronized."

These inputs are essential for ensuring that the module can generate stable and synchronized output reset signals to avoid metastability issues in digital circuits.\n\nOutput ports: `reset_n_sync`.\nExplanation: The `reset_n_sync` output is the synchronized version of the input reset signal `reset_n`. It is derived after passing the input reset signal through a series of flip-flop stages specified by the `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` and `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT` parameters.

It is defined with a size of `RESET_SYNC_STAGES + NUM_RESET_OUTPUT - 1`. The purpose of this array is to hold the intermediate values at each stage of the flip-flop chain. Each element of this array sequentially captures the value from its preceding stage on each rising edge of the clock signal, or it is reset to `0` when `reset_n` is asserted (active low). The synchronization process is achieved through this cascading update of values in the register, ensuring that any glitches due to the asynchronous nature of the input reset signal are filtered out by the time the signal reaches the final stage, which then provides a stable and synchronized reset output signal `reset_n_sync`."
