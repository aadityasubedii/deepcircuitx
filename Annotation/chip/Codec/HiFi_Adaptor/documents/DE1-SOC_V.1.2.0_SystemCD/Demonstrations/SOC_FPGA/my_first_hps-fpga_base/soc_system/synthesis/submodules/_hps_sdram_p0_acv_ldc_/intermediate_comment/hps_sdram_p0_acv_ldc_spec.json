    "spec": "Module name: hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc.\nModule specification: The hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc module in Verilog is designed to generate various clock signals required to control SDRAM timing within an FPGA-based system. The module inputs are `pll_hr_clk`, `pll_dq_clk`, `pll_dqs_clk`, and `dll_phy_delayctrl`, used for high-resolution/reliability timing, data queue operations, data strobe signal handling, and delay configuration respectively. The outputs include clocks: `afi_clk` for SDRAM interfacing, `avl_clk` for module-level operations, `adc_clk` and `adc_clk_cps` for SDRAM address and command operations with optional phase inversion, and `hr_clk` for high-resolution sequential logic operations. Internally, the module uses signals like `phy_clk_dqs`, `phy_clk_dq`, and `phy_clk_hr` derived from the input clocks, and additional signals `phy_clk_dqs_2x`, `phy_clk_addr_cmd`, and `phy_clk_addr_cmd_cps` for potential double data rate and address command operations. The code includes conditional generation blocks based on parameter `IS_HHP_HPS` to handle clock buffering, uses a `cyclonev_phy_clkbuf` for conversion of input clocks into useful signals, and employs delay chains like `cyclonev_leveling_delay_chain` and phase selectors such as `cyclonev_clk_phase_select` to appropriately delay and adjust the phases of the clocks to produce the required outputs. These components ensure that the module can be configured to work across different types of hardware platforms while maintaining precise SDRAM timing control.",

It is selectively picked through phase control from the delayed data strobe clocks.\n- `adc_clk_cps`: Similarly involved in addressing and command tasks, this clock is the phase-adjusted version of `adc_clk`, providing finer control over the phase characteristics.\n- `hr_clk`: Predominantly helpful in sequential logic that requires high-resolution timing, this clock is the result of phase selection and adjustments made to the initially processed `pll_hr_clk`."
