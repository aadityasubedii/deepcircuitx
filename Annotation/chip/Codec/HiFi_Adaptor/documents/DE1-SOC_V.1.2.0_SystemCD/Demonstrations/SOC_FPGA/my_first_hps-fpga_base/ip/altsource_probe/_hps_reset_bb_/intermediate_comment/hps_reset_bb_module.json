    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'hps_reset' module acts as a basic structural template in Verilog, housing two inputs ('probe' and 'source_clk') and a 3-bit output ('source'). 'Probe' potentially triggers actions, while 'source_clk' ensures synchronized operations. Currently, the module lacks internal implementations, set to be elaborated for specific functionalities as development progresses."
