Module-level comment: The 'altera_pli_streaming' module orchestrates data transactions between a JTAG interface and a processor utilizing a PLI port. It employs synchronization with 'clk' and 'reset_n', handling input and output data based on readiness and validity signals from connected components. Crucially, the module integrates PLI transaction handling when 'MODEL_TECH' is defined, and it uses an instantiation of 'altera_jtag_dc_streaming' for further data control. The operations are encapsulated in logic blocks, managing data flow dynamically with respect to input signals and internal conditions.
