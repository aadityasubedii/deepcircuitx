Module name: soc_system_hps_only_master. Module specification: The 'soc_system_hps_only_master' is a Verilog module designed to interface with a master device in a system-on-chip (SoC) configuration, handling data transport between various sub-modules and external master interfaces. This functionality includes data packet transformations, FIFO management, and parameter checks. Input ports include clk_clk (system clock), clk_reset_reset (module reset), master_readdata (data from the master device), master_waitrequest (indicates master is not ready for operations), and master_readdatavalid (indicates data validity from the master). Output ports are master_address (address to the master device), master_read and master_write (control signals for read/write operations), master_writedata (data to be sent to master), master_byteenable (byte enable signals), and master_reset_reset (reset signal to the master). Key internal signals like jtag_phy_embedded_in_jtag_master_src_valid, fifo_out_valid, and b2p_out_packets_stream_endofpacket manage the validity, control, and flow of data across different interfacing and processing blocks. The module structure includes configurable checks for instantiation parameters (USE_PLI, PLI_PORT, FIFO_DEPTHS) to ensure correct setup, multiple blocks for converting byte streams to packet data and vice versa, and an internal reset controller to manage module resets. These elements collectively facilitate efficient data handling and error management within an SoC environment.
