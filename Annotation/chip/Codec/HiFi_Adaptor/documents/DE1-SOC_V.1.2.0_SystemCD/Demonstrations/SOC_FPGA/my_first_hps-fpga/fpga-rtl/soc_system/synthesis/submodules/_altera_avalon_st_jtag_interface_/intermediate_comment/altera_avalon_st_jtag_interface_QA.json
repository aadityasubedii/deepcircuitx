It handles data communication over JTAG through two streams: upstream (data sent to the host) and downstream (data received from the host). The module can operate in two modes: normal and PLI (Programming Logic Interface). In the normal mode, it uses the 'altera_jtag_dc_streaming' submodule to manage data streaming. If the PLI mode is enabled (indicated by the USE_PLI parameter), the 'altera_pli_streaming' submodule is used instead, which can be connected to a debugging interface on a specific port defined by PLI_PORT. The module manages multiple signals such as data validation, data readiness, and resets to ensure correct operations and synchronization across different components."

It synchronizes data transfer and processing within the module.\n- **reset_n**: This is the active-low reset signal. It is used to reset the internal state of the module and submodules to a defined initial state.\n- **source_ready**: Indicates the readiness of the data source to accept more data. It is used to control the flow of upstream data to prevent overflow.\n- **sink_data**: This is the input data stream coming from the host through the JTAG interface, used in the downstream direction.\n- **sink_valid**: A signal that indicates whether the sink_data is valid.

This signal is used to indicate that the data is valid and ready to be consumed by the host.\n- **sink_ready**: It shows whether the module is ready to receive more data from the host. This is crucial for controlling the flow of data in the downstream path to prevent data loss.\n- **resetrequest**: An output signal that can be used to request a reset from connected systems or subsystems. This is typically used for system-level control and error handling.\n- **debug_reset**: An additional reset signal that might be employed specifically during debugging operations to ensure clean start and debug states.\n- **mgmt_valid**: Indicates that the management data on the mgmt_channel and mgmt_data is valid and ready for use.\n- **mgmt_channel**: Output data channel for management data, its width could be variable based on the MGMT_CHANNEL_WIDTH parameter.\n- **mgmt_data**: Management data being sent out, its valid flag is indicated by mgmt_valid.
