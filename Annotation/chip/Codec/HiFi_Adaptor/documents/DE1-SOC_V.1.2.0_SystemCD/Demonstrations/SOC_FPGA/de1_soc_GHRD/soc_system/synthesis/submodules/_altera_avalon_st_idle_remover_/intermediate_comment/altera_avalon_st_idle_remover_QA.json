The module checks input data for idle and escape characters using specific conditions. When an escape character is detected and no previous escape has been received, it flags that an escape has been received. This allows the module to modify subsequent data bytes by XOR-ing them with `8'h20` until an output-valid signal resets the escape status. Idle characters in the data are skipped, not forwarded to the output, ensuring they do not interfere with the stream processing. The readiness of the module to accept new inputs (`in_ready`) is directly linked to its ability to send outputs (`out_ready`)."
