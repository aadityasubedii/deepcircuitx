The primary function appears to be to route a probe signal through the `altsource_probe_component` based on a source clock (`source_clk`). The output named `source` is a 3-bit bus generated from the component, potentially providing some kind of status or control signal alignment relative to the probe and clock input. Further, numerous unconnected pins suggest configuration for a more complex operation possibly related to JTAG state control or debugging, as indicated by the presence of parameters referring to metastability and probe widths. However, without further comments or a full scope of the code, assumptions are based strictly on the observable code."
