It accepts input data (in_data) and outputs packetized data (out_data) indicating the start and end of packets with control signals (out_startofpacket and out_endofpacket). The module handles special characters like start-of-packet (sop_char), end-of-packet (eop_char), escape characters (escape_char), and channel identifiers (channel_char) to correctly frame the data. The CHANNEL_WIDTH parameter allows for customization of the channel information's width and whether to use encoding via the ENCODING parameter. The process is synchronized to a clock (clk) and operates safely under reset conditions using a reset signal (reset_n). The outputs are regulated based on the availability signaled by out_ready, ensuring that the exchanges are properly synchronized with the readiness of subsequent processes."

This helps in controlling the flow of data to ensure synchronization.\n- `in_valid`: Signal indicating if the data on the `in_data` input is valid and should be processed.\n- `in_data`: 8-bit input data stream which the module processes based on embedded control characters and flags to form packets.\n\nOutput ports: out_valid, out_data, out_channel, out_startofpacket, out_endofpacket, in_ready.\nExplanation:\n- `out_valid`: Signal that indicates whether the data on the `out_data` output is valid.\n- `out_data`: 8-bit output data which forms part of a packet, with control characters removed or processed.\n- `out_channel`: Output that shows the channel data derived from `in_data` when channel character is identified; width depends on the `CHANNEL_WIDTH` parameter.\n- `out_startofpacket`: A flag that signals the start of a new packet, activated when a start-of-packet character is detected in `in_data`.\n- `out_endofpacket`: A flag that indicates the end of a packet, activated when an end-of-packet character is detected in `in_data`.\n- `in_ready`: Indicates to the upstream provider of `in_data` that the module is ready to receive data, used to synchronize and manage the flow of incoming data."

This flag helps in determining if the next character needs special handling (used for processing subsequent escaped data).\n- `received_channel`: A flag that indicates if a channel character has been received.
