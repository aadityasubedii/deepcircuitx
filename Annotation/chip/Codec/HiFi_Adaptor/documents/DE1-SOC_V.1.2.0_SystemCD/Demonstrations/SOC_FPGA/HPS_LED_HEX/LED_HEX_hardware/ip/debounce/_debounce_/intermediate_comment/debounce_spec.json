    "spec": "Module name: debounce. \n\nModule specification: The debounce module is designed to stabilize fluctuating input signals by filtering out noise and bounces, particularly in setups involving mechanical switches. It processes each bit of the input signal 'data_in' to produce a noise-free output 'data_out'. The module operates with a WIDTH-defined multi-bit input 'data_in' and provides a corresponding WIDTH-defined multi-bit output 'data_out'. It utilizes a parameterized WIDTH, POLARITY ('HIGH' or 'LOW'), TIMEOUT value, and TIMEOUT_WIDTH for its operations. Input \u2018clk\u2019 is the clock signal driving the synchronization and state transitions, while \u2018reset_n\u2019 is an active-low reset that initializes or resets module states. Internally, the module uses an array of counters (\u2018counter\u2019) to track the duration each input bit remains unchanged, with each counter having a width specified by TIMEOUT_WIDTH. Wire arrays \u2018counter_reset\u2019 and \u2018counter_enable' manage resetting and enabling counters based on input changes and the POLARITY setup. The debounce logic is implemented within a generate block iterating for each bit of 'data_in', ensuring independent processing and stability check before reflecting in 'data_out'. This structure enables debounce functionality across multi-bit inputs efficiently and flexibly, tailored by easily configurable parameters.",

It checks each bit of the input signal, 'data_in', and outputs a stable version in 'data_out'. This is achieved by employing counters for each bit of the input signal. These counters increment if the input state remains constant long enough (controlled by a set threshold 'TIMEOUT').

They are used to count the number of clock cycles during which a specific input bit remains unchanged. The count aids in determining if the input signal has been stable long enough to consider it debounced.\n- 'counter_reset' is a wire array where each element corresponds to a bit of 'data_in'. These signals manage when to reset the associated counter. If a counter_reset signal for a particular bit is high, the corresponding counter is reset to 0. This usually happens when a change is detected in the input signal for that bit, depending on the defined POLARITY.\n- 'counter_enable' is a wire array, also corresponding to each bit of 'data_in'. These signals control whether a counter should increment. A specific counter_enable is active if the corresponding input bit is in the state that should be counted (high for POLARITY \"HIGH\", low for \"LOW\") and the counter is not yet at the TIMEOUT value.
