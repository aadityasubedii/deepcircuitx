Module-level comment: The `soc_system_led_pio` module controls LED outputs via peripheral I/O handling. It receives control through inputs like address, chipselect, and write signals, directly reflecting processed LED states on a 10-bit `out_port` and providing a 32-bit zero-padded state via `readdata`. Updates occur on positive clock edges or reset conditions, ensuring synchronous operations within system constraints.
