Module name: soc_system_hps_0_hps_io. 
Module specification: The `soc_system_hps_0_hps_io` module acts as an interfacing layer specifically designed for the High-Performance Subsystem (HPS) within FPGA-based System on Chip (SoC) designs. It manages various I/O signals for interfaces including memory, Ethernet MAC, SPI, USB, and several others. The module includes a range of input and output ports such as `mem_a`, `mem_ba` for external memory interfaces; `hps_io_emac1_inst_RXD0` to `hps_io_emac1_inst_RXD3` for receiving data for the Ethernet MAC; and `hps_io_usb1_inst_CLK` which is a clock input for USB data transmissions. It also includes inout ports like `mem_dq` and `hps_io_emac1_inst_MDIO` for bidirectional data transfers. The module does not have internal signals defined within its scope but includes a significant connection setup through the instantiation of a submodule named `soc_system_hps_0_hps_io_border`. This submodule mapping handles the actual interfacing logic, pointing towards the abstractions at the current level solely focusing on correct signal routing and interfacing with the other system components or external elements. Thus, the primary purpose of this module is to facilitate signal routing to support seamless communication and control across different subsystems and peripherals aligned with the SoC.
