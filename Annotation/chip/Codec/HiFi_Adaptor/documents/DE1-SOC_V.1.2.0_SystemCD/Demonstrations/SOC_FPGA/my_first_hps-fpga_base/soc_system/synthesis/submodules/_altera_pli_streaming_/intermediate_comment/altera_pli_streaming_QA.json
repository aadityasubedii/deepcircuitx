The module takes a clock and reset signal along with streams of data from and to both the JTAG interface and the PLI transaction system. The core functionality revolves around passing and transforming these data streams while ensuring synchronization with the system clock and maintaining valid states based on the reset signal. The module operates under a parameterized PLI port and purpose and integrates an instantiated JTAG streaming module to handle specific JTAG-based communications, adjusting data validity, readiness of data acceptance, and reset request signals appropriately between the two interfacing systems.`"
