It accepts a vector of input interrupts (`interrupt_in`) and an address and read control signal to manage these interrupts. Internally, the module captures these interrupt signals in a register (`interrupt_reg`) at every positive clock edge when the reset is not asserted. Depending on the number of interrupts (specified by `NUM_INTR`), the module can handle either a single group of up to 32 interrupts or two groups of interrupts (lower and higher). Through conditional compilation (using generate blocks), it configures itself to either single or dual interrupt register mode. The captured interrupt data can be read back, from either the lower 32 bits or from the higher section (if more than 32 interrupts are supported), based on the read address. The actual reading includes a wait state mechanism through `readdata_with_waitstate`, which synchronizes the read data to be available only at the next clock cycle after the reading is requested. This mechanism ensures data stability and correctness under possible clock domain crossing scenarios or system timing constraints."

This vector represents the incoming interrupts that the module captures and processes.\n- `addr`: This is the address input, used to select which portion of the interrupt register to read. Typically, it distinguishes between low and high sections of the register in systems with more than 32 interrupts.\n- `read`: This is the read command input, used to control the reading operation of the interrupt data. When activated, the module outputs the content of the interrupt register based on the address provided.\n\nOutput ports: `rddata`.\nExplanation:\n- `rddata`: This is a 32-bit wide output data port. It outputs the interrupt data stored in the interrupt registers. Depending on the `addr` input, it can output either from the first 32 bits or the additional bits if NUM_INTR exceeds 32.
