Module-level comment: The 'altera_pli_streaming' module acts as an intermediary between JTAG-based and PLI transaction-based data streams on FPGA. It employs dual mechanismsâ€”PLI-based transactions using macro functions and a JTAG communication sub-module 'altera_jtag_dc_streaming'. This setup manages synchronization of data flow, readiness signals and reset requests by handling internal state signals and conditionally merging outputs from both JTAG and PLI interfaces effectively.
