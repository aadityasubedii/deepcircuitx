It is designed to detect edge transitions (rising edges) on the input ports, manage interrupt generation based on these events, and provide mechanisms for reading the status of input ports and edge detections. The module is capable of masking interrupts, capturing edge events, and determining when to generate interrupts based on the combined state of the edge captures and interrupt masks."

It goes high to signal an external processor of an event that requires attention, based on edge captures and the interrupt mask.\n- readdata: A 32-bit output which provides the data corresponding to the addressed register. This can be the state of the input ports, the interrupt mask or the status of edge captures.\n\nExplanation:\nThe input ports primarily facilitate the control and configuration of the module in addition to providing the actual input signals from buttons that the module is meant to process. These include dynamic inputs like the button states and control inputs like address and chipselect which determine behavior for reading and writing internal registers.\n\nThe output ports are used to communicate externally. The `irq` output is particularly critical as it enables the module to signal an external processor about specific events (like button presses/releases detected), while the `readdata` output lets an external system read the configuration or status of the module as needed, enhancing the module's utility in system monitoring and control."

It is assigned a constant high value, essentially keeping clock operations always enabled.\n- d1_data_in: This register holds the first delayed version of the input port data. It is used in detecting edge transitions.\n- d2_data_in: This register holds the second delayed version of the input port data, following `d1_data_in`, and helps in determining rising edges by comparing its value with `d1_data_in`.\n- data_in: Represents the current state of the incoming button inputs, directly assigned from the 'in_port' input port.\n- edge_capture: This register stores the detected edge events (transitions). It can be cleared manually via write operations and is used to record edges until they are acknowledged by the system.\n- edge_capture_wr_strobe: This signal controls when the edge_capture register can be written to. It is active when there's a chip select, a write operation, and the address targets the edge capture registers.\n- edge_detect: This signal identifies the actual rising edges based on the difference between `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in`. It indicates a rising edge when `d1_data_in` is low and `d2_data_in` is high.\n- irq_mask: This register holds the mask settings for interrupts. Whether an interrupt for a particular button press is enabled or not is determined by this mask.\n- read_mux_out: This multiplexer output provides the selected data output to be read based on the `address` input. It can output the current button states, the IRQ mask settings, or the edge captures, facilitating selective read operations dictated by the address lines."
