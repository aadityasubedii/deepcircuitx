Module name: soc_system_jtag_uart. Module specification: The `soc_system_jtag_uart` module acts as a UART interface for a JTAG system, providing asynchronous serial communication capabilities. It handles data transfer with input ports including `av_address`, `av_chipselect`, `av_read_n`, `av_write_n`, `av_writedata`, `clk`, and `rst_n`, which are used to select memory blocks, enable the module, initiate read/write operations, provide data and clock signals, and manage resets, respectively. The output ports are `av_irq`, `av_readdata`, `av_waitrequest`, `dataavailable`, and `readyfordata`, which handle interrupt requests, data output, indicate wait states, and signal availability of new data or readiness for data, respectively.

Internally, the module uses numerous signals such as `fifo_FF`, `fifo_EF`, `fifo_wdata`, `fifo_wr`, `r_dat`, and `fifo_rd` to manage FIFO operations like data writing and reading and to relay FIFO state information (full, empty). Other critical signals such as `ipen_AE`, `ipen_AF`, `fifo_AE`, `fifo_AF`, `ac`, and various controls (`ien_AE`, `ien_AF`) manage interrupt handling and activity status based on FIFO conditions. 

The code includes various functional blocks such as `soc_system_jtag_uart_scfifo_w` and `soc_system_jtag_uart_scfifo_r` which manage write and read operations to the FIFOs. Each block includes data propagation controls and condition evaluations to manage UART state and transmission flow effectively based on FIFO fullness or emptiness and reset conditions. Additionally, logical conditions within these blocks also handle interrupt generation and FIFO read/write enable signals, ensuring a streamlined data flow and responsive system behavior during UART operation.
