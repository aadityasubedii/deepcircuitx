Module name: hps_sdram. Module specification: The hps_sdram module is a memory controller for a Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) interface, specifically designed for a Hard Processor System (HPS). It manages communication between the processor and SDRAM, handling timing, addressing, and data transfer. The module has input ports for clock reference (pll_ref_clk), reset signals (global_reset_n, soft_reset_n), and on-chip termination calibration (oct_rzqin). Output ports include SDRAM control signals (mem_a, mem_ba, mem_ck, mem_ck_n, mem_cke, mem_cs_n, mem_dm, mem_ras_n, mem_cas_n, mem_we_n, mem_reset_n, mem_odt) and bidirectional data ports (mem
