Module name: soc_system_master_secure_p2b_adapter.  
Module specification: The "soc_system_master_secure_p2b_adapter" is a Verilog module designed to function as a data-passing adapter between its input and output interfaces, primarily used within larger system architectures to maintain data and control signal integrity. The module accepts input signals 'clk' (clock), 'reset_n' (active-low reset), 'in_ready', 'in_valid', 'in_data', 'in_startofpacket', 'in_endofpacket', and 'out_ready'. These inputs include data signals, validity flags, packet flags, and readiness indicators to control data flow. The output ports include 'in_ready', 'out_valid', 'out_data', 'out_startofpacket', 'out_endofpacket', and 'out_channel', where 'in_ready' (output) matches the 'out_ready' input to synchronize with upstream systems, and others manage data output validity, content, and packet framing based on input conditions. Internally, the module utilizes a register 'in_channel', initialized to 0, intended for future enhancements that might incorporate channel-based operations; it is directly mirrored to 'out_channel' in the output. The code primarily consists of an always block that activates on any change to inputs or internal signals, mapping input states directly to output states in a straightforward manner, ensuring that data and control flags are transferred instantly when conditions are met. This setup empowers the module to perform real-time data mirroring with high reliability and minimal complexity.
