Module-level comment: The `soc_system_hps_only_master_p2b_adapter` module facilitates data signal transfer between interfaces, synchronizing with a clock. It utilizes readiness and validity signals, such as `in_ready` and `out_valid`, mirroring them in response to counterpart signals (`out_ready` and `in_valid`) to ensure data flows seamlessly. Internal logic, centered in an always block, directly transfers inputs to outputs and maintains a static channel identifier with `in_channel`.
