Module name: altera_edge_detector. 
Module specification: The 'altera_edge_detector' is a Verilog module primarily designed for edge detection on a digital signal. It detects rising or falling edges on the input signal 'signal_in' and outputs a pulse 'pulse_out' when such an edge is detected, with the behavior customized by several parameters. The module has three primary inputs: 'clk' (clock signal for synchronization), 'rst_n' (active-low reset for initialization), and 'signal_in' (the input signal whose edges are to be detected). The sole output is 'pulse_out', which indicates the detection of an edge. Internally, the module employs a finite state machine (FSM) with states IDLE, ARM, and CAPT, managed through signals 'state' and 'next_state'. Other internal signals include 'pulse_detect' (indicates edge detection), 'busy_pulsing' (indicates ongoing pulse output), and 'reset_qual_n' (manages reset conditions considering ongoing operations). Depending on the 'PULSE_EXT' parameter, which extends the pulse duration, the pulse generation mechanism can vary. For 'PULSE_EXT' greater than 1, a series of flip-flops ('extend_pulse') extend the pulse, while for 'PULSE_EXT' of 1 or less, a simple register ('pulse_reg') holds the pulse. The module also includes a decision-making code block handling the transitions of the FSM depending on the input signal and edge type, governed by the parameters 'EDGE_TYPE' (selects rising or falling edge detection) and 'IGNORE_RST_WHILE_BUSY' (determines if resets are ignored during pulse output). Together, these components and mechanisms enable the module to robustly detect signal edges and generate corresponding output pulses in a configurable manner.
