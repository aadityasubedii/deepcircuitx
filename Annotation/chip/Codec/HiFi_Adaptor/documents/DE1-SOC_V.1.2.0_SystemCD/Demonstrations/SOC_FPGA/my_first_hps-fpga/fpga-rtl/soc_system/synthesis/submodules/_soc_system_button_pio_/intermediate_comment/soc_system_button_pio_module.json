    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"soc_system_button_pio\" module acts as a programmable I/O controller for handling button inputs in SoCs, detecting rising edges and managing interrupts. It integrates registers for configuration and state management, utilizes internal delay and detection mechanisms to spot edge transitions, and employs masks to control interrupt generation based on edge events. The operations are synchronized by a system clock and managed through selective reading and writing of internal registers based on input signals."
