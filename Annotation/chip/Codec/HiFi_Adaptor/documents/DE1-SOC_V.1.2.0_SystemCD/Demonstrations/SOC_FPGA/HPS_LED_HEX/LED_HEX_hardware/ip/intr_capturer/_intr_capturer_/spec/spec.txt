Module name: intr_capturer.

Module specification:
The 'intr_capturer' module is designed for capturing and storing interrupt signals in a parameterizable system, defined by `NUM_INTR`. It efficiently handles the registration of interrupt signals based on a clock signal or during a reset condition, using either one or two 32-bit registers, depending on the total number of interrupts. The module operates with several input ports: `clk` (clock input for synchronization), `rst_n` (active-low reset input which clears internal registers), `interrupt_in` (a vector of interrupt signals), `addr` (address input for selecting specific interrupt data segments), and `read` (enables the reading operation). The sole output port, `rddata`, outputs stable interrupt data, delayed by one clock cycle for data stability, from an internal register `readdata_with_waitstate`.

Internally, the module utilizes significant signals including `interrupt_reg` that stores incoming interrupts; `readdata_with_waitstate` which buffers the data to introduce a wait state; wires `readdata_lower_intr` and `readdata_higher_intr` for lower and higher segment data respectively; and control signals `access_lower_32` and `access_higher_32` to navigate between these segments based on the `addr` input. The code encompasses a `generate` block which adapts to the number of interrupts (`NUM_INTR`), allowing for handling more than 32 interrupts by enabling separate logic for accessing and controlling more extended register segments. Each clock cycle or reset pulse captures interrupt data or resets the respective registers (`interrupt_reg` and `readdata_with_waitstate`), ensuring that the module provides updated and stable output read data (`rddata`). The usage of conditional logic for managing various interrupt quantities makes the module scalable and versatile across different hardware implementations.
