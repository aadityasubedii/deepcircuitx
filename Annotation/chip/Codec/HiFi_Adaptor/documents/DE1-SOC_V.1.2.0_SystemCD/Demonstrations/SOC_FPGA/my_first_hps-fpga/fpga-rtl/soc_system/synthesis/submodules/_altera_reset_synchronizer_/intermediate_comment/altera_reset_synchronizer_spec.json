    "spec": "Module name: altera_reset_synchronizer. Module specification: The \"altera_reset_synchronizer\" module is designed to synchronize an asynchronous reset signal, `reset_in`, to a specific clock domain defined by the `clk` signal, thus mitigating issues like metastability in digital systems. This module features two primary input ports: `reset_in`, which is the asynchronous reset signal requiring synchronization, and `clk`, the clock signal that serves as the timing reference for synchronization. There is one output port, `reset_out`, which delivers the stabilized, synchronized reset signal. Internally, the module utilizes a register array `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain` with a depth determined by the parameter `DEPTH`, functioning as a shift register chain to help in stepwise synchronization. Additionally, `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out` is used as a single bit register that captures and outputs the synchronized state as `reset_out`. The module is controlled by a generate block that adapts its behavior based on the `ASYNC_RESET` parameter; if `ASYNC_RESET` is enabled, the reset process is triggered immediately when `reset_in` goes high, using a combination of synchronous and asynchronous logic control. In the non-async mode, the synchronizer simply shifts the reset signal each clock cycle, gradually integrating it to prevent glitches. Each block of code within the module, governed by conditional compilation, adjusts the behavior of the synchronization chain to handle the reset input either immediately or progressively, ensuring flexible, reliable synchronization across varying operational conditions.",
