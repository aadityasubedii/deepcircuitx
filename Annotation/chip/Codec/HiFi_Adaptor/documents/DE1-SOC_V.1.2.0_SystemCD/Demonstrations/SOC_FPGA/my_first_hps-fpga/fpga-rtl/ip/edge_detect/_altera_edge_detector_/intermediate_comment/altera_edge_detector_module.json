    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"altera_edge_detector\" detects edges in a digital signal and generates pulses based on these detections. It employs a finite state machine with states IDLE, ARM, and CAPT, transitioning based on input 'signal_in'. The pulse output can be extended over multiple cycles controlled by parameter 'PULSE_EXT'. Reset behavior can ignore pulse output states when 'IGNORE_RST_WHILE_BUSY' is enabled. The implementation uses registers and conditional logic to manage state transitions and pulse generation."
