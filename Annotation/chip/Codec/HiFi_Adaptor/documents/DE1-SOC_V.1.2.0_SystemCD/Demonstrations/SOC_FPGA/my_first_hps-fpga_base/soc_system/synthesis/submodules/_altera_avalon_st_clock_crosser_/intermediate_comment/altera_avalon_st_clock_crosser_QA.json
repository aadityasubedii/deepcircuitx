It features synchronization mechanisms for signals crossing these clock boundaries, ensuring data integrity and reducing the risk of metastability issues. It uses registers to buffer data and toggles to manage synchronization. Additionally, it supports configurable synchronization depth, data widths derived from parameters, and an optional output pipeline stage to enhance timing performance and output data handling."
