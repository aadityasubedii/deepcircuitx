Module-level comment: This module converts packet data to Avalon-MM master transactions and vice versa. It supports read/write operations with incremental/non-incremental addressing. The module uses a FIFO buffer for data management and can be configured for fast operation (separate packet-to-FIFO and FIFO-to-packet submodules) or simple direct conversion. It handles clock domain crossing and implements state machines for packet processing, FIFO management, and Avalon-MM interface control.
