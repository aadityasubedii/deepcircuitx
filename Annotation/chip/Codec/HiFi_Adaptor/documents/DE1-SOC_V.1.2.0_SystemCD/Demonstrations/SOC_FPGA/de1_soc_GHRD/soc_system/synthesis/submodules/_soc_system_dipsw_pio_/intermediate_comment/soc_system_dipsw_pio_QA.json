It captures changes in the dip switch positions (edge detection) and can mask and unmask interrupts for each switch. The module supports reading of the current switch states, irq mask and detected edges. It uses synchronous logic with respect to a given clock signal, and operations are also sensitive to a reset signal."

Changes in this input are monitored for edge detection.\n- `reset_n`: An active-low reset signal that, when asserted, initializes or resets internal registers and module behavior to a known state.\n- `write_n`: An active-low write control signal; when low, it allows data on the `writedata` input to be written to the address specified by the `address` input.\n- `writedata`: A 32-bit input that holds the data to be written into the module\u2019s internal registers when a write operation is instructed.\n\nOutput ports: [irq, readdata].\nExplanation:\n- `irq`: An interrupt request output that is asserted (high) when any enabled edge detection condition is met as per the mask settings in `irq_mask`.\n- `readdata`: A 32-bit output that provides the requested data from internal registers based on the current `address` when a read operation is executed.

It is set to always be high, indicating that clock-sensitive operations are always enabled as long as the clock is active.\n- `d1_data_in`: This registers the current state of the `data_in` (i.e., `in_port`, the dip switch states) at one clock edge, used for detecting edges by comparing with `d2_data_in`.\n- `d2_data_in`: This stores the `d1_data_in` state at the subsequent clock edges, thus allowing `edge_detect` to compare the two consecutive states for any change to capture the edge.\n- `data_in`: Represents the immediate current state of the dip switches from the `in_port`; this is directly assigned from `in_port`.\n- `edge_capture`: A register set for each bit that captures detected edges based on specific conditions \u2013 essentially holding a detected edge until processed.\n- `edge_capture_wr_strobe`: A signal that activates writing to the `edge_capture` registers when appropriate conditions in address, chip select, and write operations are met.\n- `edge_detect`: This signal results from the XOR of `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in`, where a `1` indicates that a differential (change) has been detected between two consecutive states of a switch.\n- `irq_mask`: This holds the mask settings for interrupts; only those switches whose corresponding bit in `irq_mask` is set are allowed to have their edge captures result in an IRQ.\n- `read_mux_out`: This multiplexer output selects data output based on the `address` signal; it combines various internal state reports like current switch state, the interrupt mask, or edge capture status and passes it to the `readdata` register based on the requested address."
