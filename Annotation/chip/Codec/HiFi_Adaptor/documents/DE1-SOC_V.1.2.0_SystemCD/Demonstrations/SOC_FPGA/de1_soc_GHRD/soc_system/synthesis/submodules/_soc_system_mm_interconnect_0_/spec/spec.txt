Module name: soc_system_mm_interconnect_0. Module specification: This module implements a complex memory-mapped interconnect structure for a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, connecting multiple master and slave components. It supports AXI and Avalon interfaces, handling tasks such as address decoding, data transfer, and bus arbitration. The module has numerous input and output ports for AXI master interfaces (e.g., hps_0_h2f_axi_master_*), clock and reset signals, and various slave interface signals (e.g., button_pio_s1_*). Internal signals include crossbar multiplexers (e.g., rsp_xbar_mux_src_*), master and slave translators (e.g., *_translator_avalon_universal_*), burst adapters (burst_adapter_*), and width adapters (
