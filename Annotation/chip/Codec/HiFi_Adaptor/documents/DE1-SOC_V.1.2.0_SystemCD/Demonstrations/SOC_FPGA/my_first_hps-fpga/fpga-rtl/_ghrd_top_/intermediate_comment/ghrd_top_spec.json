It ensures consistent and stable input signals from the buttons.\n- `fpga_led_internal`: This signal is used to control internal representations or states associated with LEDs on the FPGA development board. The modification or monitoring of this signal typically reflects changes to be shown on physical LEDs.\n- `hps_fpga_reset_n`: This is a reset signal for the FPGA, controlled by the hard processor system (HPS). It's an active-low signal, meaning the FPGA is in reset state when this signal is low.\n- `hps_reset_req`: This signal consists of multiple bits that indicate different types of reset requests from the HPS such as cold, warm, or debug resets. It is a multi-bit signal where each bit corresponds to a specific reset demand.\n- `hps_cold_reset`, `hps_warm_reset`, `hps_debug_reset`: These signals are specific types of reset triggers (cold, warm, and debug) used within the FPGA system. They are generated based on the respective bits in `hps_reset_req` and conditions exposed by edge detection circuits: `altera_edge_detector`, which ensures that these reset events are triggered in response to specific transitions or conditions.\n- `stm_hw_events`: This signal aggregates various events or status flags, composed of switch states, internal LED states, and debounced button states to be used or monitored by other system components such as the System Trace Macrocell for debug and analysis purposes."

Module specification: The 'ghrd_top' module is a top-level FPGA design for integrating hardware interfaces and peripherals of an SoC in an FPGA environment. It manages connections for a variety of interfaces including DDR3 memory, Ethernet, USB, SPI, I2C, UART, and GPIO, as well as handling I/O for standard FPGA peripherals such as switches, LEDs, buttons, and providing VGA output. Input ports like `CLOCK_50`, and `HPS_ENET_RX_DATA` receive synchronization clocks and Ethernet data, while output ports such as `DRAM_ADDR` and `LEDR` manage memory addressing and LED Displays respectively. Internal signals like `hps_cold_reset` and `fpga_led_internal` manage the FPGA's reset logic and LED states. The code includes instances of subsystems like `soc_system` that interface directly with the hard processor system (HPS), handling complex tasks such as data transmissions and memory management. Edge detectors and reset controllers like `altera_edge_detector` and `hps_reset` control the timing and conditions for various reset operations, ensuring the system maintains correct operational states during runtime. This module acts as a comprehensive control center, coordinating between the HPS and FPGA fabric to ensure smooth operation and integration of embedded systems."
