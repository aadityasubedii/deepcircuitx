    "spec": "Module name: soc_system_button_pio. \nModule specification: The \"soc_system_button_pio\" is a programmable input/output peripheral designed for interfacing buttons in a system-on-chip (SoC) environment. It detects button press events by spotting rising edges on the 4-bit `in_port` input signal. The module provides an interrupt output (`irq`) and a 32-bit output (`readdata`) for communicating the button press states and configuration register statuses. The input ports include `address` for register selection, `chipselect` for module activation, `clk` for timing control, `in_port` for receiving button states, `reset_n` for module reset, `write_n` for enabling write operations, and `writedata` for data to be written to internal registers. Internally, the module utilizes signals like `clk_en` always set to one for continuous operation, `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in` for delay elements in edge detection, `data_in` tied directly to `in_port`, and `edge_capture` for storing detected edges. It also uses several control signals (`edge_capture_wr_strobe`, `edge_detect`, `irq_mask`, `read_mux_out`) for managing interrupts, data reading, and conditional logic operations. The code structure includes blocks for signal assignments, edge detection logic, register updates based on clock and reset conditions, and multiplexer logic for reading from selected internal registers, efficiently organizing operations critical for interfaced button control within the SoC.",

It detects button press events by spotting rising edges on the 4-bit `in_port` input signal. The module provides an interrupt output (`irq`) and a 32-bit output (`readdata`) for communicating the button press states and configuration register statuses. The input ports include `address` for register selection, `chipselect` for module activation, `clk` for timing control, `in_port` for receiving button states, `reset_n` for module reset, `write_n` for enabling write operations, and `writedata` for data to be written to internal registers. Internally, the module utilizes signals like `clk_en` always set to one for continuous operation, `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in` for delay elements in edge detection, `data_in` tied directly to `in_port`, and `edge_capture` for storing detected edges. It also uses several control signals (`edge_capture_wr_strobe`, `edge_detect`, `irq_mask`, `read_mux_out`) for managing interrupts, data reading, and conditional logic operations. The code structure includes blocks for signal assignments, edge detection logic, register updates based on clock and reset conditions, and multiplexer logic for reading from selected internal registers, efficiently organizing operations critical for interfaced button control within the SoC."
