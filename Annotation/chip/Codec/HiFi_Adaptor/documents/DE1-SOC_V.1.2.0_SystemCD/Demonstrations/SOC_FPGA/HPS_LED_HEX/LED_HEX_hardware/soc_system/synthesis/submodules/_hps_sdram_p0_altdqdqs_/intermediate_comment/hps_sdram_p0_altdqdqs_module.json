    "module": "Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_altdqdqs` module interfaces with SDRAM using DDR technology, supporting dynamic configuration for signal integrity and memory operations. It primarily routes signals to a key submodule `altdq_dqs2_acv_connect_to_hard_phy_cyclonev`, actively passing through control, data, and clock signals. This design encapsulates complex functionalities like signal phase control and FIFO management within the submodule, maintaining a streamlined top-level module interface."
