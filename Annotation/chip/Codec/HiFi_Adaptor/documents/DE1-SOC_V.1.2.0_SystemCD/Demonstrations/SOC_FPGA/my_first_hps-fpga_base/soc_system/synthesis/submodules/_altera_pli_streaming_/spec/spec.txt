Module name: altera_pli_streaming.  
Module specification: The 'altera_pli_streaming' module is crafted for interfacing between a JTAG-based data streaming and a PLI transaction-based streaming system, primarily on FPGA platforms. The core functionality hinges on handling and transforming data streams while maintaining synchronization and state validity under a system clock and reset signal. It accepts inputs such as a clock signal (`clk`), an active low reset signal (`reset_n`), signals indicating readiness from a downstream system (`source_ready`), and validity and data (`sink_valid`, `sink_data`) from an upstream system. For outputs, the module provides indications of data validity (`source_valid`), output data (`source_data`), readiness to accept more data (`sink_ready`), and a reset request (`resetrequest`) to external systems under specific conditions. Internally, the module employs registers and wires such as `pli_out_valid`, `pli_in_ready`, `pli_out_data`, `jtag_source_data`, `jtag_source_valid`, `jtag_sink_ready`, and `jtag_resetrequest` to manage data flow and signal states appropriately. The module includes sub-blocks for handling PLI-based transactions using vendor-specific procedural macros (enclosed within `MODEL_TECH` ifdef conditional) and an instantiated sub-module `altera_jtag_dc_streaming`, which provides further JTAG-specific communication handling. This design seamlessly blends these functionalities to manage and control data streaming between the JTAG and PLI protocols efficiently, even under reset conditions defined and captured with attention to both internal logic and external module interfaces.
