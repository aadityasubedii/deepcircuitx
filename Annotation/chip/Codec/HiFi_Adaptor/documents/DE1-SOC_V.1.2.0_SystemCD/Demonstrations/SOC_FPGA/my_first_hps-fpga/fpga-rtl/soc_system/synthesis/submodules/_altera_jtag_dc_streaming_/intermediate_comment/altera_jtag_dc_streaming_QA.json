It includes functionality for streaming data, managing reset and debug signals, and handling clock domain crossings between JTAG and system clocks. The module uses nested sub-modules such as synchronizers and clock crossers to effectively manage timing and data integrity across different clock domains, making it suitable for applications that require reliable data exchange between JTAG and system environments, while also providing management and debug capabilities."
