Module name: debounce. 

Module specification: The debounce module is designed to stabilize fluctuating input signals by filtering out noise and bounces, particularly in setups involving mechanical switches. It processes each bit of the input signal 'data_in' to produce a noise-free output 'data_out'. The module operates with a WIDTH-defined multi-bit input 'data_in' and provides a corresponding WIDTH-defined multi-bit output 'data_out'. It utilizes a parameterized WIDTH, POLARITY ('HIGH' or 'LOW'), TIMEOUT value, and TIMEOUT_WIDTH for its operations. Input ‘clk’ is the clock signal driving the synchronization and state transitions, while ‘reset_n’ is an active-low reset that initializes or resets module states. Internally, the module uses an array of counters (‘counter’) to track the duration each input bit remains unchanged, with each counter having a width specified by TIMEOUT_WIDTH. Wire arrays ‘counter_reset’ and ‘counter_enable' manage resetting and enabling counters based on input changes and the POLARITY setup. The debounce logic is implemented within a generate block iterating for each bit of 'data_in', ensuring independent processing and stability check before reflecting in 'data_out'. This structure enables debounce functionality across multi-bit inputs efficiently and flexibly, tailored by easily configurable parameters.
