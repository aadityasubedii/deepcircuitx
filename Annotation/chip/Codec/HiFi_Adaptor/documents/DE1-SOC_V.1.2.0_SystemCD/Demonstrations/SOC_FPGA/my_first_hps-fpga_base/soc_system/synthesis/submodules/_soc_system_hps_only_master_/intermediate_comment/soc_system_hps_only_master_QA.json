It includes parameters to check instantiation errors and utilizes a series of Avalon Streaming (ST) components and FIFOs to facilitate the transport and transformation of data streams. The module also orchestrates control over these data flows with specific attention to packetizing, depacketizing, and interaction with memory-mapped registers, accommodating JTAG master functionalities, adapting bytes to packets, and vice versa, managing transaction flows, and handling system resets."

It is used to initialize or reset the system to a known state, usually at power-up or when an error needs to clear.\n- **master_readdata**: This input port receives data read from a master device. It is part of the interface that handles data coming back from the memory or peripheral in response to a read request.\n- **master_waitrequest**: This signal is used by external devices to throttle the master. When high, it indicates that the master should wait before performing further transactions because the external device is not ready.\n- **master_readdatavalid**: This indicates that the data on the `master_readdata` bus is valid and can be read by the master.

The address usually points to a location in memory or a register in a peripheral.\n- **master_read**: This signal is asserted by the module when it wants to read data from the memory or a peripheral device.\n- **master_write**: This signal is asserted by the module when it wants to write data to memory or a peripheral device.\n- **master_writedata**: This output carries data to be written to the address specified by `master_address` during write operations.\n- **master_byteenable**: This output specifies which bytes in the data bus are valid for the current data transfer. It's essential in systems where the data bus width may be wider than some of the data widths of memory or peripherals being accessed.\n- **master_reset_reset**: This is the reset signal output that can be used to reset external devices connected to the module, ensuring all connected elements can be reset synchronously."
