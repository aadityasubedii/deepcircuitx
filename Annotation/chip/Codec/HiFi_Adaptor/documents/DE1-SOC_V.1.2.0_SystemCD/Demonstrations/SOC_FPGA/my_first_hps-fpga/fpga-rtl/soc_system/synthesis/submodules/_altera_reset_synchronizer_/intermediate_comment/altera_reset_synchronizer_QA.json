It takes an external reset input (asynchronous) and a clock signal, and outputs a synchronized reset signal. Depending on the `ASYNC_RESET` parameter, the module can handle the reset either as soon as the `reset_in` goes high, or it can latch the reset input state on each clock edge. The parameter `DEPTH` specifies the number of flip-flops (stages of synchronization) used to filter the reset signal to mitigate any potential glitches."

It functions as a chain of flip-flops used to store and shift the state of the asynchronous reset input (`reset_in`). This chain helps in the step-by-step synchronization of the reset input to the clock signal, effectively filtering any glitches and reducing the likelihood of metastability.\n- `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out`: This is a single bit register that eventually outputs the synchronized reset signal after the filtering process through the flip-flop chain. It captures the final output state from the `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain` which then feeds into the `reset_out` port, thus providing a stable reset output synchronized to the clock domain."
