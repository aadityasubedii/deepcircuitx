It operates based on various parameters such as symbols per credit, symbols per beat, and supports configurations for symbol and packet credits. The module updates 'symbol_credits' and 'packet_credits' based on incoming symbols and detected packet boundaries (end of packet signal). It uses clock signals and a reset mechanism to maintain and update these credits synchronously. The functionalities are dynamically adjusted depending on the parameter values for optimal flexibility in different usage scenarios."

Explanation: \n- `clk`: The clock signal, used to drive synchronous operations within the module.\n- `reset_n`: Active low reset signal, used to reset the internal state of the module to initial values.\n- `in_valid`: Indicates that the input data is valid. This signal is typically used to control the processing of the data.\n- `in_ready`: Indicates that the module is ready to accept data. Helps in managing the flow of data when the module is not ready to process more data.\n- `in_endofpacket`: Signifies the end of a packet which is used to manage packet based operations like updating packet credits.\n\nOutput ports: symbol_credits, packet_credits. Explanation:\n- `symbol_credits`: A 16-bit register that maintains the count of symbol credits. This output is updated based on the number of symbols processed per the configured credit system.\n- `packet_credits`: A 16-bit register that keeps track of the packet credits. It increments upon detecting the end of a packet to keep a count of processed packets."

Explanation:\n- `beat`: A signal derived from the conjunction of `in_valid` and `in_ready`. It indicates when a 'beat' (a unit of processing time or data processing event) has occurred, allowing the module to perform synchronization and credit calculation tasks.\n- `eop_beat`: Represents the 'end of packet at a beat'. It is true if `beat` is true and `in_endofpacket` is also true, signifying that a packet has ended on this specific beat. It is pivotal for updating packet credits.\n- `sym_count`: A register that holds the count of symbols since the last credit was issued or since the last packet end. This counter is essential for managing situations where symbols per beat do not directly match symbols per credit.\n- `next_sym_count`: Represents the projected value of `sym_count` in the next cycle based on the current `beat` status and symbol accumulation. It is crucial in determining if there should be a rollover in the symbol count.\n- `rollover`: A flag that indicates whether `sym_count` has reached or surpassed the `SYMBOLS_PER_CREDIT` or if an end of packet has been detected during a beat. This signal triggers the updating of `symbol_credits` and resets `sym_count`."
