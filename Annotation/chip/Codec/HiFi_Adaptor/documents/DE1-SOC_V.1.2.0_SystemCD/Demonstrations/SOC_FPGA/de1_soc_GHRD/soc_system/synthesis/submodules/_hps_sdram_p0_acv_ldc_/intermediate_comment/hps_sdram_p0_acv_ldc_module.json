    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc' module manages clock generation for SDRAM in FPGAs, handling inputs like 'pll_hr_clk', 'pll_dq_clk', 'pll_dqs_clk' to produce crucial timing signals 'afi_clk', 'avl_clk', 'adc_clk', etc. It uses clock buffers, delay chains, and phase selectors ensuring precise synchronization and timing adjustments within SDRAM operations, configurable for both simulation and hardware deployment via conditional constructs and parameters."
