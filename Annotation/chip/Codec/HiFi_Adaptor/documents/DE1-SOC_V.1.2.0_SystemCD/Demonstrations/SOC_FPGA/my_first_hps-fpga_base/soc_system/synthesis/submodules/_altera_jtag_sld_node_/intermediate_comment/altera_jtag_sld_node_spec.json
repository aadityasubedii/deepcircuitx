    "spec": "Module name: altera_jtag_sld_node. \n\nModule specification: The altera_jtag_sld_node Verilog module is designed to facilitate JTAG testing and debugging for Altera FPGA devices. It interfaces with a virtual JTAG, executing typical scan operations like capture DR, shift DR, and update DR. The module contains optional inputs `ir_out` for selecting operational modes via JTAG instruction bits and `tdo` for feedback data from scan operations. Outputs include `ir_in` for downstream instruction forwarding, a `tck` synchronizing signal, `tdi` for scan chain data entry, and various `virtual_state_...` signals indicating different stages of JTAG testing. Internally, the module uses `simulation_clock` for timing in absence of hardware `tck`, `sdrs` to indicate the start of a shift operation in Data Register, and several state signals (`cdr`, `sdr`, `e1dr`, `udr`) to manage JTAG transitions. The tasks and functions embedded within manage state transitions, data shifting, and mode configurations to simulate or perform actual FPGA testing. The Verilog code is structured to accommodate both simulated environments (`simulation_clock` activation and detailed behavioral tasks like `enter_data_mode`, `shift_one_bit`) and actual operational conditions (`sld_virtual_jtag_basic` component usage defining realistic JTAG interfacing).",

Designed to connect to a virtual JTAG interface, it simulates a JTAG environment and provides outputs to various virtual states such as capture DR, shift DR, update DR, etc. This module is parameterized with attributes such as JTAG frequency, and supports selectively setting JTAG instructions and data modes for testing circuits at different levels (e.g., data, control, management). This is achieved through a series of tasks and procedures defined within the module that manage the setting and clearing of states as well as the shifting of bit and byte values through the JTAG interface based on the clock signal. When compiled for a real FPGA, specific sections of the code can be enabled or disabled to accommodate simulation versus actual hardware operation."

It interfaces with a virtual JTAG, executing typical scan operations like capture DR, shift DR, and update DR. The module contains optional inputs `ir_out` for selecting operational modes via JTAG instruction bits and `tdo` for feedback data from scan operations. Outputs include `ir_in` for downstream instruction forwarding, a `tck` synchronizing signal, `tdi` for scan chain data entry, and various `virtual_state_...` signals indicating different stages of JTAG testing. Internally, the module uses `simulation_clock` for timing in absence of hardware `tck`, `sdrs` to indicate the start of a shift operation in Data Register, and several state signals (`cdr`, `sdr`, `e1dr`, `udr`) to manage JTAG transitions. The tasks and functions embedded within manage state transitions, data shifting, and mode configurations to simulate or perform actual FPGA testing. The Verilog code is structured to accommodate both simulated environments (`simulation_clock` activation and detailed behavioral tasks like `enter_data_mode`, `shift_one_bit`) and actual operational conditions (`sld_virtual_jtag_basic` component usage defining realistic JTAG interfacing)."
