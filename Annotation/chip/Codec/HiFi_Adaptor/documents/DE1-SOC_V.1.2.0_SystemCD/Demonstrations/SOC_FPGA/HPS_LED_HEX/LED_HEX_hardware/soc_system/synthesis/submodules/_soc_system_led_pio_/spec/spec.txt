Module name: soc_system_led_pio. 

Module specification: The `soc_system_led_pio` module functions as a peripheral I/O controller for controlling LED outputs. It primarily interacts with systems via input ports, which include a 2-bit `address` for register selection (only address 0 is relevant in this module for LED control), a 1-bit `chipselect` for enabling the module, a clock signal `clk` for timing, an active-low `reset_n` signal for resetting the module, an active-low `write_n` for enabling write operations, and a 32-bit `writedata` for incoming LED state data. The outputs consist of a 10-bit `out_port` which directly controls the LEDs reflecting the `data_out` content, and a 32-bit `readdata` for external modules to read the LED states in a zero-padded format.

Internally, the module uses several signals: `clk_en` always set to 1 (though not effectively used in the current implementation), `data_out` a 10-bit register storing the current state of LEDs, `read_mux_out`, a 10-bit signal used for routing `data_out` to `readdata` depending on the `address`, and `readdata` which outputs the LED state padded to 32 bits. The main logic block, governed by a clock edge-triggered process, manages the conditions under which `data_out` is updated from `writedata` (based on `chipselect`, `write_n`, and `address`) or reset to an all-high state upon a reset event. The read logic simply assigns the padded `data_out` value to `readdata` and directly passes `data_out` to `out_port`. This architecture ensures synchronized LED control and status verification within a synchronous digital system.
