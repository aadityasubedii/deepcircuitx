Module-level comment: The "intr_capturer" module captures and manages interrupt signals based on the `NUM_INTR` parameter. It samples `interrupt_in` into `interrupt_reg` each clock cycle, stores interrupt data, and outputs specified lower or higher 32-bit sections based on `addr`. Implementation uses conditionals for >32 interrupts and manages data consistency during reads with a wait state in `readdata_with_waitstate`.
