    "spec": "Module name: soc_system_dipsw_pio.\nModule specification: The soc_system_dipsw_pio is a Verilog module designed to manage interrupts originating from changes in input port status. It monitors a 10-bit input port (`in_port`) for status changes, detects edges, and can generate interrupts based on these changes if unmasked. The module has input ports including `address` (2-bit input for register selection), `chipselect` (activates module for operations), `clk` (clock signal), `in_port` (10-bit input being monitored), `reset_n` (active-low reset signal), `write_n` (active-low write signal), and `writedata` (32-bit input data for writing). Its output ports are `irq` (interrupt request signal) and `readdata` (32-bit output data bus). Internal signals such as `clk_en`, `d1_data_in`, `d2_data_in`, `edge_capture`, `edge_detect`, `irq_mask`, and `read_mux_out` are used for clock management, data synchronization, edge detection, interrupt masking, and multiplexing read operations. The module consists of several blocks handling specific functionalities: reset logic initializing all registers, read and write control logic, and edge detection that conditionally updates edge capture registers. This structure ensures the module's responsiveness and reliability in real-time signal processing and interrupt handling.",

It monitors a 10-bit input port (in_port), detects edges (changes), and can generate interrupts based on these changes if they are unmasked. The interrupts are controlled by an IRQ mask and edge detection logic. The module supports reading of the current input port status, the IRQ mask, and the edge capture status through specific addressable registers. It offers functionality to reset edge captures when programmed through corresponding writes to the control registers. Additionally, the module is sensitive to both positive edges of the clock and a negative edge of the reset signal, ensuring proper synchronization and initial reset state respectively."

It monitors a 10-bit input port (`in_port`) for status changes, detects edges, and can generate interrupts based on these changes if unmasked. The module has input ports including `address` (2-bit input for register selection), `chipselect` (activates module for operations), `clk` (clock signal), `in_port` (10-bit input being monitored), `reset_n` (active-low reset signal), `write_n` (active-low write signal), and `writedata` (32-bit input data for writing). Its output ports are `irq` (interrupt request signal) and `readdata` (32-bit output data bus). Internal signals such as `clk_en`, `d1_data_in`, `d2_data_in`, `edge_capture`, `edge_detect`, `irq_mask`, and `read_mux_out` are used for clock management, data synchronization, edge detection, interrupt masking, and multiplexing read operations. The module consists of several blocks handling specific functionalities: reset logic initializing all registers, read and write control logic, and edge detection that conditionally updates edge capture registers. This structure ensures the module's responsiveness and reliability in real-time signal processing and interrupt handling."
