Module-level comment: The "altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser" module synchronizes data between different clock domains using two clocks (`in_clk` for input, `out_clk` for output). It buffers data during transitions and leverages synchronization primitives for flag transfers, ensuring timing integrity. An optional output pipelining stage controlled by `USE_OUTPUT_PIPELINE` enhances throughput. This module uses internal toggle mechanisms and conditions to manage and validate data flow effectively, facilitating reliable data handling across asynchronous interfaces.
