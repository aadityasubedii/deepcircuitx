The code fragment does not contain any logic or comments that explain the specific functionality or how the probe and clock signal are used to generate the output. Therefore, based on the given code alone, it is a basic setup for a module that potentially handles a reset operation depending on the `probe` and `source_clk` inputs, but without further information or internal logic, the exact functionality remains unclear."

The `source_clk` is a clock signal input, typically used to synchronize the operations within the module to a specific clock domain.\n\nOutput ports: source[2:0].\nExplanation: The `source` output is a 3-bit bus that implies multiple bits of information could be driven based on the `probe` and `source_clk`.
