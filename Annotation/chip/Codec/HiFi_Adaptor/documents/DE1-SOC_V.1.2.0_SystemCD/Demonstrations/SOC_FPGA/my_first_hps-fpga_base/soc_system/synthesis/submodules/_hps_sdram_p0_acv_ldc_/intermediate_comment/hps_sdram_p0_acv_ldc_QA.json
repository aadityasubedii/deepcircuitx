It takes multiple input clock signals (`pll_hr_clk`, `pll_dq_clk`, and `pll_dqs_clk`) and produces multiple output clocks (`afi_clk`, `avl_clk`, `adc_clk`, `adc_clk_cps`, and `hr_clk`) with specific characteristics controlled through delay and phase settings. The module uses different components such as clock buffers, delay chains, and phase selectors to adjust and generate these clocks based on configurations which include invert phase control, delay control widths, and phase settings parameters specific for each clock type. The configuration can be adjusted for different types of hardware platforms, indicated by the parameter IS_HHP_HPS. The module utilizes conditional generate blocks to tailor the clock signal generation based on the hardware platform type."

It contributes to generating output clocks conditioned by hardware performance needs.\n- `pll_dq_clk`: It serves as another clock input typically associated with data queue operations in SDRAM modules, contributing to the synchronization and timing of data handling.\n- `pll_dqs_clk`: This input clock is related to the data strobe signal in SDRAM, essential for data read/write operations by providing a timing reference.\n- `dll_phy_delayctrl`: This is an input configuration bus for a delay-locked loop (DLL) controller. Its settings influence the adjustments made in the clock delay chains, impacting the timing precision of the output clocks.\n\nOutput ports: `afi_clk`, `avl_clk`, `adc_clk`, `adc_clk_cps`, `hr_clk`.\nExplanation:\n- `afi_clk`: Driven by a delayed version of `pll_dqs_clk`, this output clock is used for interfacing with SDRAM, adjusted specifically through a leveling delay chain.\n- `avl_clk`: Originating from a delayed `pll_hr_clk`, this output serves general module-level operations needing high-reliability or high-resolution timing, processed through another leveling delay chain.\n- `adc_clk`: This clock output is vital for address and command operations within the SDRAM, the phase of which can be inverted or maintained based on configurations. It is selectively picked through phase control from the delayed data strobe clocks.\n- `adc_clk_cps`: Similarly involved in addressing and command tasks, this clock is the phase-adjusted version of `adc_clk`, providing finer control over the phase characteristics.\n- `hr_clk`: Predominantly helpful in sequential logic that requires high-resolution timing, this clock is the result of phase selection and adjustments made to the initially processed `pll_hr_clk`."
