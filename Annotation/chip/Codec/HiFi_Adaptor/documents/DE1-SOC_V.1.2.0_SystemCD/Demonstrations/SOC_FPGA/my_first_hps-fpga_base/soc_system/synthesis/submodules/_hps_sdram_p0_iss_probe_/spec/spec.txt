Module name: hps_sdram_p0_iss_probe. Module specification: The hps_sdram_p0_iss_probe is a Verilog module designed solely for probing an input signal in a synthesis or simulation environment, particularly within an SDRAM system on an FPGA. The module includes a single input port named `probe_input`, which is a bus of signals with a width defined by the parameter `WIDTH`; this bus serves as the signal to be monitored or tested internally and it typically connects to an internal signal of a larger design, crucial for debugging or analysis. There are no output ports, indicating that the module functions exclusively for internal observational purposes without sending signals to other parts of the system. Inside the module, the `probe_input` signal is directly connected to an instantiated IP block `altsource_probe`, which facilitates the probing operation. This IP core is parameterized to avoid metastability, define instance identification, and manage probing width but leaves other configurations like JTAG states and clock inputs unconnected, emphasizing its straightforward signal probing role without further signal processing or complicated internal signal handling. This architectural simplicity is maintained throughout the module's design, focusing on efficient signal monitoring for testing and debugging applications.
