    "spec": "Module name: ghrd_top. Module specification: The `ghrd_top` module is the top-level Verilog module for an FPGA design, primarily designed to facilitate FPGA and HPS (Hard Processor System) integration and interactions across various peripherals and interfaces. This module includes numerous input and output ports: inputs such as `ADC_DOUT` for digital data from an ADC, multiple clock signals like `CLOCK_50`, and `HPS_USB_DIR` for USB direction signal from HPS; outputs like `ADC_CS_n` for ADC chip select, `DRAM_ADDR` for DRAM address bus, and `VGA_HS` for horizontal sync in VGA signaling, among others. Internal to the module, the `hps_fpga_reset_n` signal is vital for managing resets between the FPGA and HPS ensuring stable operation. The module comprehensively uses instances of the sub-module `soc_system`, which handles detailed interfacing for memory (such as DDR3), networking (like Ethernet), various serial and parallel IO (including USB, SPI, UART), and user interfaces (such as LEDs and switches). This integration essentially allows for complex communication and control structures suitable for advanced digital and signal processing tasks on versatile hardware platforms.",

Module specification: The `ghrd_top` module is the top-level Verilog module for an FPGA design, primarily designed to facilitate FPGA and HPS (Hard Processor System) integration and interactions across various peripherals and interfaces. This module includes numerous input and output ports: inputs such as `ADC_DOUT` for digital data from an ADC, multiple clock signals like `CLOCK_50`, and `HPS_USB_DIR` for USB direction signal from HPS; outputs like `ADC_CS_n` for ADC chip select, `DRAM_ADDR` for DRAM address bus, and `VGA_HS` for horizontal sync in VGA signaling, among others. Internal to the module, the `hps_fpga_reset_n` signal is vital for managing resets between the FPGA and HPS ensuring stable operation. The module comprehensively uses instances of the sub-module `soc_system`, which handles detailed interfacing for memory (such as DDR3), networking (like Ethernet), various serial and parallel IO (including USB, SPI, UART), and user interfaces (such as LEDs and switches). This integration essentially allows for complex communication and control structures suitable for advanced digital and signal processing tasks on versatile hardware platforms."

Module specification: The `ghrd_top` module is the top-level Verilog module for an FPGA design, primarily designed to facilitate FPGA and HPS (Hard Processor System) integration and interactions across various peripherals and interfaces. This module includes numerous input and output ports: inputs such as `ADC_DOUT` for digital data from an ADC, multiple clock signals like `CLOCK_50`, and `HPS_USB_DIR` for USB direction signal from HPS; outputs like `ADC_CS_n` for ADC chip select, `DRAM_ADDR` for DRAM address bus, and `VGA_HS` for horizontal sync in VGA signaling, among others. Internal to the module, the `hps_fpga_reset_n` signal is vital for managing resets between the FPGA and HPS ensuring stable operation. The module comprehensively uses instances of the sub-module `soc_system`, which handles detailed interfacing for memory (such as DDR3), networking (like Ethernet), various serial and parallel IO (including USB, SPI, UART), and user interfaces (such as LEDs and switches). This integration essentially allows for complex communication and control structures suitable for advanced digital and signal processing tasks on versatile hardware platforms."
