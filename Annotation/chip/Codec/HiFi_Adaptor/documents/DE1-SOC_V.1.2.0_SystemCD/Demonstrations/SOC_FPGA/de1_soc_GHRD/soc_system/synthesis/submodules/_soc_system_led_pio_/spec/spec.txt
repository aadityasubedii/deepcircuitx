Module name: soc_system_led_pio. Module specification: The `soc_system_led_pio` module is a peripheral input/output (PIO) designed for LED control within a System on Chip (SoC) framework. It interfaces through input ports that include a 2-bit `address` for selecting write or read operations, an enabling `chipselect`, a system `clk` (clock), a `reset_n` signal that is active low for initializing the module, a `write_n` signal that is active low for enabling write operations, and a 32-bit `writedata` from which the 10 least significant bits are used to set the LED state. The output ports consist of a 10-bit `out_port` which directly controls the LEDs, reflecting the current state of a 10-bit internal register `data_out`, and a 32-bit `readdata` for reading the state of the LEDs. Internally, the module utilizes a constant wire `clk_en` (unused in current functionality but set to 1), `data_out` which stores the current state of LEDs, `read_mux_out` which conditions the read output based on the `address`, and `readdata` which forms the padded read output from `read_mux_out`. The module's operations are governed by a critical `always` block triggered on the clock's positive edge or the negative edge of `reset_n`; this block handles the reset initialization and conditions under which the `data_out` register is updated based on the input `writedata`. Additionally, the module has continuous assignment statements that map the internal state of `data_out` to `out_port` and form the `readdata` output from `read_mux_out`.
