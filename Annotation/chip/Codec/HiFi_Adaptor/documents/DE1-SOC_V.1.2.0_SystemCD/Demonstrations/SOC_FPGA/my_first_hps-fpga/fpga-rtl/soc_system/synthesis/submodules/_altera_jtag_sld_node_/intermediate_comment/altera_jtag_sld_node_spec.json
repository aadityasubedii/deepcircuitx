    "spec": "Module name: altera_jtag_sld_node. Module specification: The altera_jtag_sld_node is a Verilog module tailored for simulating and managing JTAG-based testing for Altera FPGA devices, fostering various JTAG state manipulations and operational modes such as data, loopback, and debug. The module defines input ports: `ir_out`, a 3-bit instruction register output that controls the JTAG TAP's current operation, and `tdo`, the test data output for shifting data out of the device. The output ports include: `ir_in` (instruction register input), `tck` (JTAG Test Clock), `tdi` (Test Data Input), and a series of virtual state signals such as `virtual_state_cdr`, `virtual_state_cir`, through to `virtual_state_uir` which indicate the virtual state of various JTAG TAP controller states. Internal signals like `simulation_clock` derive the internal JTAG clock and manage data flow timing, while registers such as `sdrs`, `cdr`, `sdr`, `e1dr`, and `udr` maintain the current state of the JTAG TAP state machine. The module operates conditionally with two primary blocks separated by the `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS` define guard\u2014where the first block is directed towards simulation purposes, including several tasks for state management and data shifting, and the second block incorporates the `sld_virtual_jtag_basic` instance for component-based behavior using parameters like manufactural and type identifiers, and a configuration for virtual JTAG protocol handling, terming practical application in realistic FPGA testing scenarios.",

The module uses a parameterized TCK frequency to control the JTAG clock and supports multiple virtual JTAG states to observe or control the progression through various JTAG states. It also includes the ability to send and receive data bit-by-bit or byte-by-byte which is crucial for JTAG communication.

Module specification: The altera_jtag_sld_node is a Verilog module tailored for simulating and managing JTAG-based testing for Altera FPGA devices, fostering various JTAG state manipulations and operational modes such as data, loopback, and debug. The module defines input ports: `ir_out`, a 3-bit instruction register output that controls the JTAG TAP's current operation, and `tdo`, the test data output for shifting data out of the device. The output ports include: `ir_in` (instruction register input), `tck` (JTAG Test Clock), `tdi` (Test Data Input), and a series of virtual state signals such as `virtual_state_cdr`, `virtual_state_cir`, through to `virtual_state_uir` which indicate the virtual state of various JTAG TAP controller states. Internal signals like `simulation_clock` derive the internal JTAG clock and manage data flow timing, while registers such as `sdrs`, `cdr`, `sdr`, `e1dr`, and `udr` maintain the current state of the JTAG TAP state machine. The module operates conditionally with two primary blocks separated by the `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS` define guard\u2014where the first block is directed towards simulation purposes, including several tasks for state management and data shifting, and the second block incorporates the `sld_virtual_jtag_basic` instance for component-based behavior using parameters like manufactural and type identifiers, and a configuration for virtual JTAG protocol handling, terming practical application in realistic FPGA testing scenarios."
