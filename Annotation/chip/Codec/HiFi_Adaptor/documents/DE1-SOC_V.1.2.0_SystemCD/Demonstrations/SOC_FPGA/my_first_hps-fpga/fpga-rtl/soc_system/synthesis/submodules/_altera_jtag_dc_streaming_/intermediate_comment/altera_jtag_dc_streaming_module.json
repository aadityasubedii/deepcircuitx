    "module": "Module-level comment: The altera_jtag_dc_streaming module interfaces JTAG data streams with system logic, ensuring data synchronization and control across different clock domains. It features input handling, reset and debug signal management, and management data interfacing using internal blocks like synchronizers and clock domain crossers, pivotal for maintaining data integrity and system stability. This arrangement facilitates robust data transfer and system debugging capabilities."
