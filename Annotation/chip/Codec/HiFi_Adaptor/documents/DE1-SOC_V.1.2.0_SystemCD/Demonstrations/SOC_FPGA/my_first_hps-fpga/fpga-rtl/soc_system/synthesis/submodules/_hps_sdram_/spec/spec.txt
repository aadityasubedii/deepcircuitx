Module name: hps_sdram. Module specification: The hps_sdram module is a DDR3 SDRAM memory controller designed for high-performance systems. It manages memory operations, including address and data management, read/write operations, and timing control. The module interfaces with external DDR3 SDRAM, providing a bridge between the memory and other system components. It has input ports for clock reference (pll_ref_clk), reset signals (global_reset_n, soft_reset_n), and on-chip termination (oct_rzqin). Output ports include memory address and control signals (mem_a, mem_ba, mem_ck, mem_ck_n, mem_cke, mem_cs_n, mem_dm, mem_ras_n, mem_cas_n, mem_we_n, mem_reset_n, mem_odt), while
