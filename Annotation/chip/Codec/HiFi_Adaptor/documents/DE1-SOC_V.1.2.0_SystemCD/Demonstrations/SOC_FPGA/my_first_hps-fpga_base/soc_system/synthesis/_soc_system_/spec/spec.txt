Module name: soc_system. Module specification: The soc_system module is a System-on-Chip (SoC) design that integrates a Hard Processor System (HPS) with FPGA fabric. It serves as the top-level entity for an FPGA-based SoC, providing interfaces between the HPS and FPGA logic, as well as managing system-wide clocking, resets, and communication between different subsystems. The module has numerous input and output ports, including clock and reset signals, memory interface signals, and various I/O signals for Ethernet, SPI, UART, USB, and GPIO interfaces. Internal signals are used for interconnecting different components, such as AXI interconnects, on-chip memory, and interrupt handling. The module consists of several key blocks, including an HPS component, on-chip memory, JTAG UART, interrupt capturer, and multiple
