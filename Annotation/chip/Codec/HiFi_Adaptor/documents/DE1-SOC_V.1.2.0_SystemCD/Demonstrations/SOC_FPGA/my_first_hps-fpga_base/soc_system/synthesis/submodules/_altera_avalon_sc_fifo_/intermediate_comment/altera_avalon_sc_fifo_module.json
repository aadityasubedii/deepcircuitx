    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable FIFO buffer for data storage and transmission. It supports various data widths, depths, and optional features like packet handling and error management. The implementation uses a memory array (either block memory or shift registers) with read/write pointers for data storage. It includes logic for fill level tracking, almost full/empty signaling, and optional store-and-forward functionality for packet-based operations. The module also provides control and status registers for runtime configuration and monitoring."
