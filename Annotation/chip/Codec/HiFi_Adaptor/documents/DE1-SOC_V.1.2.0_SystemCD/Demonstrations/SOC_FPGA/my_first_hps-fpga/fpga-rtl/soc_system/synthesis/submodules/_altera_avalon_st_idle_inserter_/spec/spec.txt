Module name: altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter. 

Module specification: The 'altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter' module is designed for data stream processing, specifically inserting idle characters under specified conditions in a streaming interface. The module operates on a clock signal (`clk`) and remains in a safe state until released by an active-low reset signal (`reset_n`). The inputs to the module include `in_valid` which signifies valid incoming data, `in_data` an 8-bit input data stream, and `out_ready` indicating the downstream module's readiness to accept data. The outputs consist of `in_ready`, signaling upstream readiness for data reception, `out_valid` confirming the validity of outgoing data, and `out_data` the processed 8-bit outgoing data stream. Internally, the module utilizes `received_esc`, a register that flags the receipt of escape characters under certain conditions. The `escape_char` and `idle_char` signals identify specific byte values in the data, triggering adjusted behaviors in data handling. The Verilog implementation features two primary procedural blocks: the first is an always block sensitive to the clock and reset, managing the state of `received_esc` based on data character content and stream readiness. The second always block, a combinational logic block, determines the states of `in_ready`, `out_valid`, and the modifications (if necessary) to `out_data`. This setup ensures immediate response to input changes and stream conditions, regulating data flow compliantly with the embedded character processing rules.
