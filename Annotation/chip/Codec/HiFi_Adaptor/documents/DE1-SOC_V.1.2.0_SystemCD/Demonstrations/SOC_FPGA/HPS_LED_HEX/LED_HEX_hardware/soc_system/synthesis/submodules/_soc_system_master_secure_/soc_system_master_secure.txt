Module-level comment: The `soc_system_master_secure` module orchestrates secure data transactions in an SoC, leveraging the JTAG interface, FIFO buffers, and packet conversion sub-modules. It processes secure data flows through inputs for synchronization (`clk_clk`) and reset (`clk_reset_reset`), and outputs for addressing and data control (`master_address`, `master_read`, `master_write`, etc.). Internal checks validate configuration parameters against acceptable values, ensuring operational integrity. Sub-modules are utilized for effective data management and transformation from bytes to packets and vice versa, facilitating seamless and secure data interactions across system components.
