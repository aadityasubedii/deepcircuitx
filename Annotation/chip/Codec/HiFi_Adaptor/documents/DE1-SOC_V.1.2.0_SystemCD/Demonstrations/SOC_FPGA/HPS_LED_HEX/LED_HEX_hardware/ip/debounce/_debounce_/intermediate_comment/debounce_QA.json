It checks each bit of the input signal, 'data_in', and outputs a stable version in 'data_out'. This is achieved by employing counters for each bit of the input signal. These counters increment if the input state remains constant long enough (controlled by a set threshold 'TIMEOUT'). Depending on the polarity (active high or low), the output bit is set or reset only when the counter reaches the TIMEOUT, ensuring the input has maintained a consistent state for a predetermined period, hence debouncing the signal."

The count aids in determining if the input signal has been stable long enough to consider it debounced.\n- 'counter_reset' is a wire array where each element corresponds to a bit of 'data_in'.

These signals control whether a counter should increment. A specific counter_enable is active if the corresponding input bit is in the state that should be counted (high for POLARITY \"HIGH\", low for \"LOW\") and the counter is not yet at the TIMEOUT value.
