It is designed to safely transfer data between two different clock domains defined by 'in_clk' and 'out_clk'. This is essential in FPGA design to manage timing issues that occur when data crosses between components synchronized by different clock sources. The module uses dual synchronization depth, toggling mechanisms, and optionally an output pipeline stage to ensure data integrity across the clock domains. The utilization of synchronizers (like 'altera_std_synchronizer') and conditional generation of output pipelining are key techniques employed to accomplish this task."

All input signals relative to this module are sampled on the positive edge of this clock.\n- `in_reset`: Asynchronous reset signal for the source domain. It's used to reset the state of the module components driven by the `in_clk`.\n- `in_valid`: Input valid signal indicating that the data on `in_data` is valid and ready to be captured.\n- `in_data`: Data input that originates from the source clock domain. This data needs to be safely transferred to the destination domain.\n- `out_clk`: This is the input clock for the destination domain. All output signals of this module are synchronized to this clock.\n- `out_reset`: Asynchronous reset signal for the destination domain used to reset the state of modules driven by `out_clk`.\n- `out_ready`: Input signal from the destination domain signaling that it is ready to accept data. It is used to control the flow of data and ensure stable data transfer.\n\nOutput ports: \n- in_ready\n- out_valid\n- out_data\n\nExplanation:\n- `in_ready`: Output ready signal that communicates back to the source domain whether it can send new data. This signal effectively provides flow control to prevent data loss during transfers.\n- `out_valid`: Output valid signal for the destination domain, indicating that the data on `out_data` is valid and available for use.\n- `out_data`: Data being output to the destination clock domain, synchronized and safe for use within that domain after crossing from the source domain with this module."
