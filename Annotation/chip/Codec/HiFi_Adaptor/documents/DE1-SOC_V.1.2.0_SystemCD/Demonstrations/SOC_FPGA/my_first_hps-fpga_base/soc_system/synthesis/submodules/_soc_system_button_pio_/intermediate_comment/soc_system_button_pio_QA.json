It detects button press events by identifying rising edges on the input signals, allowing button states to be read and interrupts to be generated based on configured masks. The module uses synchronization and edge detection mechanisms to ensure stable input signal processing and to generate proper read data and interrupts based on the button inputs and configuration registers."

It's crucial for determining the action on different parts of the module (like irq_mask, edge_capture, etc.).\n  - `chipselect`: An active-high signal that enables the module, allowing for valid data transactions when reading or writing data.\n  - `clk`: Clock input which is essential for the timing of the operations and synchronization of the internal processes.\n  - `in_port`: The input port through which the button press signals are received. This port accepts 4-bit input, representing the state of up to four buttons.\n  - `reset_n`: Active-low reset signal used to initialize or reset the module, ensuring that it starts in a known state.\n  - `write_n`: An active-low write enable signal that when asserted, allows data on the `writedata` bus to be written into the module's register selected by the `address`.\n  - `writedata`: The data bus used to write data into the module's register when writing operation is enabled.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `irq`, `readdata`.\nExplanation:\n  - `irq`: Interrupt request output that gets asserted when any configured button press event occurs (based on the irq_mask and edge_capture). It signals to the host processor that an actionable button event has been detected.\n  - `readdata`: This 32-bit output is used to transmit the data read from the internal registers of the module back to the calling entity, based on the address and operation selected."

This constant enable signal is used in various always blocks to ensure operations occur every clock cycle unless blocked by other conditions such as reset.\n- `d1_data_in`: A registered signal used to store the delayed version (one clock cycle delay) of the input signals from `data_in`. This is used as part of the synchronization and edge detection mechanism.\n- `d2_data_in`: Another registered signal used to store the signal delayed by another clock cycle (total two cycles from `data_in`). It helps in further stabilizing the inputs for reliable edge detection.\n- `data_in`: A wire assigned directly from the `in_port`, making it the immediate representation of the external button states into the module.\n- `edge_capture`: A 4-bit registered signal used to store the detected edges (rising edges in this context). This register can be reset or cleared based on specific write operations and is used to trigger interrupts when appropriate conditions are met.\n- `edge_capture_wr_strobe`: A wire signal that becomes high during conditions where the address points to the `edge_capture` register and a write operation is intended (used for clearing bits in `edge_capture`).\n- `edge_detect`: A wire that represents the bitwise result of detecting rising edges on the button input signals. This is determined by comparing the two delayed input signals `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in` to detect transitions from low to high.\n- `irq_mask`: A 4-bit register that holds the mask configuration for generating interrupts. If a corresponding bit in `irq_mask` is set and an edge is captured in `edge_capture`, an interrupt signal will be generated.\n- `read_mux_out`: A wire that multiplexes between the different internal data based on the `address` provided. It selects which internal register's data (from `data_in`, `irq_mask`, or `edge_capture`) is read out to `readdata`."
