    "module": "Module-level comment: The `soc_system_master_secure_timing_adt` module manages secure and timed data transfers within an SoC. It handles data buffering and synchronization via `in_payload` and `out_payload` registers, responding to the readiness of downstream components. It monitors backpressure conditions when `in_ready` is negated, ensuring reliable data flow even during high-load operations."
