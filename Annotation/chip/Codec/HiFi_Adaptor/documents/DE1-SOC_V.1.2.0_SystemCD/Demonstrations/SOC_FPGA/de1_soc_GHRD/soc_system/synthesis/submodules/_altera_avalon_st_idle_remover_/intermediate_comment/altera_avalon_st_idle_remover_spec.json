    "spec": "Module name: altera_avalon_st_idle_remover.\n\nModule specification: The `altera_avalon_st_idle_remover` is a Verilog module designed to process incoming streams of 8-bit data by removing idle characters and managing escape sequences. The module operates synchronously with a clock signal (`clk`) and can be reset with an active-low signal (`reset_n`). It accepts data (`in_data`) only when it's marked as valid (`in_valid`) and can output data (`out_data`) when it's valid (`out_valid`). The readiness to receive new data is determined by the readiness of the downstream component to accept data (`out_ready`), reflected by the `in_ready` signal. Internally, it uses `received_esc` (a register) to track if an escape character has been detected and not yet handled, and two wires, `escape_char` and `idle_char`, to identify incoming escape and idle characters respectively. The data processing involves checking each data byte against these conditions. If an escape character is detected and not previously received, subsequent bytes are modified by XOR-ing with `8'h20` until `out_valid` resets this status. Idle characters are skipped, preventing their output. The module code is divided into three main blocks: one for resetting the `received_esc` register and updating its state (`always @(posedge clk or negedge reset_n)`), another for updating the output signals and data transformation based on the received characters (`always @*` block), and a set of assignments (`assign`) for the `idle_char` and `escape_char`. These constructs work together to ensure smooth data flow and correct handling of special characters within the stream.",

The module checks input data for idle and escape characters using specific conditions. When an escape character is detected and no previous escape has been received, it flags that an escape has been received. This allows the module to modify subsequent data bytes by XOR-ing them with `8'h20` until an output-valid signal resets the escape status. Idle characters in the data are skipped, not forwarded to the output, ensuring they do not interfere with the stream processing.
