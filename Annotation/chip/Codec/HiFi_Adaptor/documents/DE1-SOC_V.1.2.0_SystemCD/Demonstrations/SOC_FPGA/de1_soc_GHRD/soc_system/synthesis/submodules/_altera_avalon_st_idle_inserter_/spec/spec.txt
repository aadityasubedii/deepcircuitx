Module name: altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter. 
Module specification: The `altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter` module is designed specifically for inserting idle characters into a streaming data flow as needed. It operates on an 8-bit basis, identifying and handling special control characters, namely idle (0x4a) and escape (0x4d) characters. The primary inputs include `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset_n` (active low reset), `in_valid` (indicates valid input data), `in_data` (8-bit input data stream), and `out_ready` (shows downstream readiness to accept data). The outputs consist of `in_ready` (signals upstream readiness to accept data), `out_valid` (indicates the validity of output data), and `out_data` (the processed 8-bit data stream). Internally, the module utilizes a register `received_esc` to track whether an escape character was received in the previous cycle, and two combinational wires, `escape_char` and `idle_char`, which detect the presence of escape and idle characters in the input stream, respectively. The operational logic, contained mainly within two always blocks, firstly manages the state of `received_esc` based on current input and previous state. Secondly, it controls output readiness `out_valid`, input readiness `in_ready` and the content of `out_data` based on the received characters and the status flags. This system ensures data integrity and proper management of special characters in data streams, directly handling scenarios where no data or special characters are presented, and transforming data as specified when preceded by an escape character.
