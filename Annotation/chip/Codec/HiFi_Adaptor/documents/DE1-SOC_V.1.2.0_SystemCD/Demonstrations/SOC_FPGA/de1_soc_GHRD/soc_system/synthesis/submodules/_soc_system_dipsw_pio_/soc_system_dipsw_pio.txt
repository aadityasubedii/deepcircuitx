Module-level comment: The `soc_system_dipsw_pio` module interfaces with dip switches for reading states, handling interrupts based on edge detection, and managing resets. It utilizes inputs for configuration and control with synchronous logic tied to a clock signal. Internally, state changes are tracked by registering inputs across clock edges, updating irq masks and edge captures conditionally, using combinational logic and control signals such as chipselect and write, and multiplexing outputs based on address inputs to send switch states, IRQ statuses, or edge detections.
