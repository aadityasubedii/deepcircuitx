    "module": "Module-level comment: The `soc_system_sysid_qsys` module outputs a fixed 32-bit value based on its input address. It employs a conditional assignment where `readdata` is set to 1393576805 for non-zero addresses and 2899645186 for a zero address. Clock and reset inputs are included for interface compatibility but do not influence the behavior. This module exemplifies combinatorial logic for address-dependent output generation."
