Module-level comment: This module implements an SoC interconnect system, managing communication between AXI/Avalon masters and slaves. It uses address routers, command/response crossbars, width/burst adapters, and multiplexers/demultiplexers to handle address decoding, data conversion, burst transactions, and arbitration. The interconnect supports different interfaces, data widths, and protocols, enabling efficient data transfer between SoC components.
