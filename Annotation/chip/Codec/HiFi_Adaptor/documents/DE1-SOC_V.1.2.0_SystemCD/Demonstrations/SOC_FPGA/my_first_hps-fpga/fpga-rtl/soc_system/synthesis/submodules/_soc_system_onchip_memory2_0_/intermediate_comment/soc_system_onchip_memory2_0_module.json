    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'soc_system_onchip_memory2_0' module facilitates on-chip memory operations via a single-port interface, enabling reading and writing data to specific memory locations. It leverages input signals like address, byteenable, and writedata, with controls via chipselect and write signals. Output is managed through readdata. It features internal logic for write enable and clock enable validations using the `altsyncram` component configured for specific memory dimensions and behaviors, ensuring efficient data management under dynamic operational conditions."
