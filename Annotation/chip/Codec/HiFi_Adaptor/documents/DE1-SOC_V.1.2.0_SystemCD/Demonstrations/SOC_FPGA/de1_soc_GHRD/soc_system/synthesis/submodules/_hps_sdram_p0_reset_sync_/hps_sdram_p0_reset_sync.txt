Module-level comment: The "hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync" module synchronizes an asynchronous active-low reset signal to a specified clock domain, mitigating metastability using a chain of flip-flops. Parameters define synchronization stages and output count. An internal register array, controlled via a generate-structured loop, sequentially captures and propagates reset states, stabilizing the output and aligning it with the clock.
