    "spec": "Module name: HPS_LED_HEX. \n\nModule specification: The HPS_LED_HEX module is designed for an FPGA-based system integrated with a Hard Processor System (HPS), responsible for interfacing a variety of hardware components and functionalities. It manages data transfer and control signaling to peripherals such as LEDs, hexadecimal displays, and external devices including DDR3 memory, Ethernet, USB, and SPI among others. The module receives multiple input signals, including various system clocks (CLOCK2_50, CLOCK3_50, CLOCK4_50, CLOCK_50), user inputs (KEY[3:0], SW[9:0]), and data from peripherals like Ethernet (HPS_ENET_RX_DATA[3:0]) and UART (HPS_UART_RX). Output signals include control for DDR3 memory (DRAM_*), interfacing signals for HPS components like Ethernet (HPS_ENET_TX_DATA[3:0]), SD card (HPS_SD_CLK), and USB (HPS_USB_STP), as well as user outputs such as LED drivers (LEDR[9:0]) and HEX displays (HEX0[6:0] to HEX5[6:0]). Internal signals like clk_148_5 are used for custom timing requirements, with UART and SPI clocks likely derived or synchronized from system clocks. Among the blocks of code, there's the instantiation of a \"soc_system\" which acts as the core connectivity fabric interfacing FPGA logic with the HPS. Connections are made for DDR3 memory, peripherals like Ethernet, flash memory, SD card, USB, SPI, and UART within this block, indicating the system's operational interconnectivity with the HPS. The module encapsulates the complexity of FPGA-HPS interfacing in an FPGA-based embedded system applicationContext, fostering efficient system integration and functionality extension.",

It manages data transfer and control signaling to peripherals such as LEDs, hexadecimal displays, and external devices including DDR3 memory, Ethernet, USB, and SPI among others. The module receives multiple input signals, including various system clocks (CLOCK2_50, CLOCK3_50, CLOCK4_50, CLOCK_50), user inputs (KEY[3:0], SW[9:0]), and data from peripherals like Ethernet (HPS_ENET_RX_DATA[3:0]) and UART (HPS_UART_RX). Output signals include control for DDR3 memory (DRAM_*), interfacing signals for HPS components like Ethernet (HPS_ENET_TX_DATA[3:0]), SD card (HPS_SD_CLK), and USB (HPS_USB_STP), as well as user outputs such as LED drivers (LEDR[9:0]) and HEX displays (HEX0[6:0] to HEX5[6:0]). Internal signals like clk_148_5 are used for custom timing requirements, with UART and SPI clocks likely derived or synchronized from system clocks. Among the blocks of code, there's the instantiation of a \"soc_system\" which acts as the core connectivity fabric interfacing FPGA logic with the HPS. Connections are made for DDR3 memory, peripherals like Ethernet, flash memory, SD card, USB, SPI, and UART within this block, indicating the system's operational interconnectivity with the HPS. The module encapsulates the complexity of FPGA-HPS interfacing in an FPGA-based embedded system applicationContext, fostering efficient system integration and functionality extension."

It manages data transfer and control signaling to peripherals such as LEDs, hexadecimal displays, and external devices including DDR3 memory, Ethernet, USB, and SPI among others. The module receives multiple input signals, including various system clocks (CLOCK2_50, CLOCK3_50, CLOCK4_50, CLOCK_50), user inputs (KEY[3:0], SW[9:0]), and data from peripherals like Ethernet (HPS_ENET_RX_DATA[3:0]) and UART (HPS_UART_RX). Output signals include control for DDR3 memory (DRAM_*), interfacing signals for HPS components like Ethernet (HPS_ENET_TX_DATA[3:0]), SD card (HPS_SD_CLK), and USB (HPS_USB_STP), as well as user outputs such as LED drivers (LEDR[9:0]) and HEX displays (HEX0[6:0] to HEX5[6:0]). Internal signals like clk_148_5 are used for custom timing requirements, with UART and SPI clocks likely derived or synchronized from system clocks. Among the blocks of code, there's the instantiation of a \"soc_system\" which acts as the core connectivity fabric interfacing FPGA logic with the HPS. Connections are made for DDR3 memory, peripherals like Ethernet, flash memory, SD card, USB, SPI, and UART within this block, indicating the system's operational interconnectivity with the HPS. The module encapsulates the complexity of FPGA-HPS interfacing in an FPGA-based embedded system applicationContext, fostering efficient system integration and functionality extension."
