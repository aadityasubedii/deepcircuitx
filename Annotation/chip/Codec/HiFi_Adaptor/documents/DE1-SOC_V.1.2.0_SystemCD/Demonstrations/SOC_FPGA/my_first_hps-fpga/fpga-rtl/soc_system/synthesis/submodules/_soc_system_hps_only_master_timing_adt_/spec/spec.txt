Module name: soc_system_hps_only_master_timing_adt. 
Module specification: The `soc_system_hps_only_master_timing_adt` module is designed to manage the synchronization and safe data transfer between components in a system on chip (SoC), controlling the flow of data to ensure correct timing and avoid overflow. This module operates with input ports `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset_n` (active low signal for initializing the module), `in_valid` (indicator of valid input data), `in_data` (8-bit input data to be processed), and `out_ready` (signals if the downstream component is ready to accept data). The output ports include `out_valid` (signaling that the processed data is ready to be consumed) and `out_data` (the 8-bit data transferred to the downstream component). Internally, the module uses `in_payload` and `out_payload` to temporarily store input and output data, respectively, a `ready` signal to mirror the `out_ready` status, and an `in_ready` signal for internal feedback on readiness. The code contains an always block that outputs a simulation warning when there is backpressure and the upstream cannot be paused, reflecting the real-time constraints in SoC designs. Other always blocks handle data assignment to internal signals (`in_payload` and `out_payload`) and readiness states (`ready`, `out_valid`, `in_ready`), setting up an effective mechanism for data flow control and synchronizing transmission readiness.
