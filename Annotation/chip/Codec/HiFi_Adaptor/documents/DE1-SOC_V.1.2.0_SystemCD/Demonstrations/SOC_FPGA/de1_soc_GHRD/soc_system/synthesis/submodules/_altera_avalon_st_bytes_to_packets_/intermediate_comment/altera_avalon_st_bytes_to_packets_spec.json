    "spec": "Module name: altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets.  \nModule specification: The `altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets` module is designed for converting an 8-bit input data stream into a packetized data format based on special signaling characters. The module operates synchronously with the input clock signal `clk`. The input ports include `clk` (clock signal), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `out_ready` (downstream ready signal), `in_valid` (validity of input data), and `in_data` (8-bit input data). Output ports consist of `out_valid` (output data validity), `out_data` (processed 8-bit data stream), `out_channel` (channel identification data), `out_startofpacket` (start of packet indicator), `out_endofpacket` (end of packet indicator), and `in_ready` (module ready for new data). Internal signals such as `received_esc`, `received_channel`, `received_varchannel`, `escape_char`, `sop_char`, `eop_char`, `channel_char`, `varchannelesc_char`, and `data_out` manage the escape sequences, packet boundaries, and channel identification dynamically based on the data content and control flow conditions. The module code is organized into two main `generate` blocks and several procedural blocks (`always` and `always @*`) that manage state initialization, data processing conditions, and output management based on the input signals and internal state of the `received_*` signaling flags. Depending on the configuration (specified by `CHANNEL_WIDTH` and `ENCODING` parameters), the module adjusts its handling of channel information and processes the incoming data stream to maintain data integrity and flow control effectively, making it versatile for use in systems requiring reliable packetized data communications.",

                    "text": "Module name: altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets.  \nModule specification: The `altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets` module is designed for converting an 8-bit input data stream into a packetized data format based on special signaling characters. The module operates synchronously with the input clock signal `clk`. The input ports include `clk` (clock signal), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `out_ready` (downstream ready signal), `in_valid` (validity of input data), and `in_data` (8-bit input data). Output ports consist of `out_valid` (output data validity), `out_data` (processed 8-bit data stream), `out_channel` (channel identification data), `out_startofpacket` (start of packet indicator), `out_endofpacket` (end of packet indicator), and `in_ready` (module ready for new data). Internal signals such as `received_esc`, `received_channel`, `received_varchannel`, `escape_char`, `sop_char`, `eop_char`, `channel_char`, `varchannelesc_char`, and `data_out` manage the escape sequences, packet boundaries, and channel identification dynamically based on the data content and control flow conditions. The module code is organized into two main `generate` blocks and several procedural blocks (`always` and `always @*`) that manage state initialization, data processing conditions, and output management based on the input signals and internal state of the `received_*` signaling flags. Depending on the configuration (specified by `CHANNEL_WIDTH` and `ENCODING` parameters), the module adjusts its handling of channel information and processes the incoming data stream to maintain data integrity and flow control effectively, making it versatile for use in systems requiring reliable packetized data communications."
