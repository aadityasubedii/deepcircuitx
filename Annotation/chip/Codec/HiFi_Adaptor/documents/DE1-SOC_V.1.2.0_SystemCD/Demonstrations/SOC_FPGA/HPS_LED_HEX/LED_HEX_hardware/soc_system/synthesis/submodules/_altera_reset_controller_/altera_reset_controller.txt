Module-level comment: The "altera_reset_controller" manages and synchronizes multiple reset signals for digital systems, ensuring stable operations. It aggregates up to 16 asynchronous reset inputs and optional reset requests, synchronizes them using adaptable chains and logic gates conditional on configuration parameters, and outputs a processed reset signal and a reset request signal. The synchronization depth and reset handling can be configured, enabling customized reset scenarios tailored to system requirements.
