Module-level comment: 
// This module implements an interconnect for AXI transactions in an SoC,
// facilitating communication between a master (HPS) and an AXI slave.
// It uses address routing, data width adaptation, and flow control
// components to manage data transfer. The interconnect includes a master
// translator, AXI slave agent, multiplexers, and demultiplexers to handle
// various aspects of AXI protocol, ensuring efficient data movement.
