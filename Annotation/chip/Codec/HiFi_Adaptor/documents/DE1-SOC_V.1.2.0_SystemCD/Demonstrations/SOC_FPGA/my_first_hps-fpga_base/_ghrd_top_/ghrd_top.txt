Module-level comment: The 'ghrd_top' module is the top-level hardware design facilitating the interface of an FPGA with peripherals and an HPS. It manages input/out signals for devices like ADCs, clocks, Ethernet, and USB. Internally, it incorporates submodules like 'soc_system' for HPS interactions and memory interfacing, and utilizes edge detectors for reset management, ensuring synchronized system operations across various components in a SoC environment.
