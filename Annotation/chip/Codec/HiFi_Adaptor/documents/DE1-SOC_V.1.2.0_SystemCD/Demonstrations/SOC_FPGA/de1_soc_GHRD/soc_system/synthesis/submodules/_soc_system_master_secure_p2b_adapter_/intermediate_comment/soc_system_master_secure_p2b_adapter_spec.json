    "spec": "Module name: soc_system_master_secure_p2b_adapter.  \nModule specification: The \"soc_system_master_secure_p2b_adapter\" is a Verilog module designed to function as a data-passing adapter between its input and output interfaces, primarily used within larger system architectures to maintain data and control signal integrity. The module accepts input signals 'clk' (clock), 'reset_n' (active-low reset), 'in_ready', 'in_valid', 'in_data', 'in_startofpacket', 'in_endofpacket', and 'out_ready'. These inputs include data signals, validity flags, packet flags, and readiness indicators to control data flow. The output ports include 'in_ready', 'out_valid', 'out_data', 'out_startofpacket', 'out_endofpacket', and 'out_channel', where 'in_ready' (output) matches the 'out_ready' input to synchronize with upstream systems, and others manage data output validity, content, and packet framing based on input conditions. Internally, the module utilizes a register 'in_channel', initialized to 0, intended for future enhancements that might incorporate channel-based operations; it is directly mirrored to 'out_channel' in the output. The code primarily consists of an always block that activates on any change to inputs or internal signals, mapping input states directly to output states in a straightforward manner, ensuring that data and control flags are transferred instantly when conditions are met. This setup empowers the module to perform real-time data mirroring with high reliability and minimal complexity.",

The input signals include a clock signal (`clk`), an active-low reset (`reset_n`), valid, data, start of packet, and end of packet flags. The output is set up similarly with validity, data, and packet flags. The module essentially waits for input data to be valid and an output channel to be ready. It directly transfers input data to the output along with the states of start and end of packet indicators. This simple pass-through mechanism is likely part of a larger system where data integrity and timing must be maintained across different system components. Additionally, the output channel is just echoing an internal signal initialized to 0, suggesting it could be used for further extensions or enhancements in a more complex version of the system."

When high, it indicates that the data on `in_data` and the packet flags (`in_startofpacket`, `in_endofpacket`) are valid and should be considered by the module.\n- `in_data`: 8-bit input data which is meant to be transferred to output when `in_valid` is high and `out_ready` is high.\n- `in_startofpacket`: Signal indicating the start of a packet of data, assisting in framing the data packets.\n- `in_endofpacket`: Signal indicating the end of a data packet, helping to properly frame the packets.\n- `out_ready`: Signal coming from the downstream module or system indicating that it is ready to receive data.\n\n**Output ports:** `in_ready`, `out_valid`, `out_data`, `out_startofpacket`, `out_endofpacket`, `out_channel`.  \n**Explanation:**  \n- `in_ready`: Output signal that matches the readiness of the destination or next stage in the data processing path (mirrors `out_ready`). This guides the upstream system on whether it can send more data.\n- `out_valid`: A flag that is driven high to indicate that the output data on `out_data` along with the start and end of packet indicators are valid. This signal follows the state of `in_valid`.\n- `out_data`: 8-bit output data which directly relays the `in_data` received from the input.\n- `out_startofpacket`: This signal directly mirrors `in_startofpacket` to outline the beginning of a packet on the output side.\n- `out_endofpacket`: This signal directly mirrors `in_endofpacket` to define the end of a packet on the output side.\n- `out_channel`: Represents an additional output line, potentially for future use or for multiplexing purposes; currently, it mirrors an internal register initialized to 0."
