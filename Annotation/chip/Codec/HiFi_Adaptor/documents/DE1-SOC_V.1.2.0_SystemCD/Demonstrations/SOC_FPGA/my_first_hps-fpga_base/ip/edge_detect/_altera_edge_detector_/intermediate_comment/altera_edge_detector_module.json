    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'altera_edge_detector' module detects edges (rising/falling configured by EDGE_TYPE) on 'signal_in' and generates a pulse on 'pulse_out'. Internally, it employs a state machine transitioning through IDLE, ARM, and CAPT states, managed by signals like 'state', 'next_state', and 'pulse_detect'. Pulse width extension and reset behaviors are handled by parameters PULSE_EXT and IGNORE_RST_WHILE_BUSY, with additional logic for pulse extension and conditional reset implementation."
