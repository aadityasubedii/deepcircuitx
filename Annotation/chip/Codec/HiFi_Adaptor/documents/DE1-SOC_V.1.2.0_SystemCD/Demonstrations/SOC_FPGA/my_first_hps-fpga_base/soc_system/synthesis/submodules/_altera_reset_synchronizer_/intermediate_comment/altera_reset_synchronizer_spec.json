    "spec": "Module name: altera_reset_synchronizer. Module specification: The `altera_reset_synchronizer` is a Verilog module designed to synchronize reset signals to a clock domain, reducing metastability issues associated with using asynchronous resets directly. The module contains two input ports: `reset_in`, which accepts either an asynchronous or synchronous reset signal, and `clk`, which is the clock signal used for synchronization. The output port, `reset_out`, delivers a stable reset signal, synchronized over several clock cycles. Internally, the module employs a shift register `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain` of size determined by the parameter `DEPTH`, which delays the reset signal accordingly. Another internal signal, `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out`, represents the first stage output of this shift register and is ultimately connected to `reset_out`. The module is parameterized by `ASYNC_RESET` to handle different types of reset inputs: when `ASYNC_RESET` is enabled, the shift register loads all ones upon a reset assertion, whereas in disabled state, it behaves like a standard shift register, taking the `reset_in` directly. This logic is encapsulated within a generate block, which creates appropriate procedural blocks (`always` blocks) based on the `ASYNC_RESET` parameter. Each procedural block describes the behavior of the shift register during clock cycles and reset conditions, ensuring the synchronization of the reset signal as per configuration.",

The module utilizes a shift register of configurable depth (parameter `DEPTH`) to delay the reset signal, effectively debouncing it over several clock cycles. Depending on the configuration parameter `ASYNC_RESET`, it can handle either asynchronous or synchronous reset inputs, loading the register with ones upon an active reset signal in the former case, or shifting based on the input reset signal in the latter case. The output `reset_out` is a synchronized version of the input `reset_in`, stabilized across the specified `DEPTH` of the synchronization chain."
