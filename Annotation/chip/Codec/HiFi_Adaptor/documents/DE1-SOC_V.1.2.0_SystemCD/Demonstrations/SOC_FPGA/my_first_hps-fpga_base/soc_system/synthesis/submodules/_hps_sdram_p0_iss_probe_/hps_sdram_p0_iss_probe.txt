Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_iss_probe` module probes the `probe_input` signal in FPGA-based SDRAM systems for debugging purposes. It uses an `altsource_probe` IP core configured to handle signal probing with specified parameters like `ID_NAME` and `WIDTH`, primarily observing signals without outputting or modifying them. The module straightforwardly directs the `probe_input` to the core, emphasizing simplicity and effectiveness in signal monitoring.
