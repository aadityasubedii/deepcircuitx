    "module": "Module-level comment: The `intr_capturer` module captures and processes interrupt signals based on the hardware configuration. It uses a parameter (`NUM_INTR`) to manage up to 32 or more interrupts by storing them in `interrupt_reg` and outputs the captured data after a delay via `readdata_with_waitstate` for stability. Addressable reading is controlled by `access_lower_32` and `access_higher_32`, which respond to the `addr` and `read` inputs to selectively output lower or upper interrupt data upon request. This functionality ensures efficient and flexible interrupt handling in varying system setups."
