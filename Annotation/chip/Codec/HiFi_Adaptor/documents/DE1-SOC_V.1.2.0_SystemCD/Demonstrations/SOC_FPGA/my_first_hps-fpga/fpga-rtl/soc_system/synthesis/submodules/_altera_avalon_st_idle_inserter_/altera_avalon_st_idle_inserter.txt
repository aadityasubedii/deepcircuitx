Module-level comment: The 'altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter' module processes streaming data to manage and insert idle characters. It uses internal registers to monitor escape characters and manipulates output per stream conditions and content, ensuring continuous output validation. The module operates on active clock edges and reset signals, dynamically adjusting data ready and output states based on incoming and outgoing stream readiness.
