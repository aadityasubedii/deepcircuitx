    "spec": "Module name: intr_capturer. \nModule specification: The intr_capturer module is designed for capturing and handling interrupts in a system with customizable support up to 32 or more interrupts. It operates with a primary clock (clk) and an active-low reset (rst_n) to manage internal states and data transitions. Input ports include clk, rst_n for synchronization and reset, interrupt_in which is a vector handling current state of interrupts, addr for selecting data regions, and read for enabling data read operations. The module outputs the captured interrupt data through the rddata port after a delay to incorporate wait states. Internal signals like interrupt_reg capture and stabilize interrupt inputs. readdata_with_waitstate adds a latency cycle to the data output for stable data operations. The act_readdata signal manages which part of the interrupt data from either the lower or higher bits should be actively read, affected by address inputs and read flags. The module features conditional structures to manage more than 32 interrupts, splitting the interrupt register and access logic accordingly. Hardware-efficient Verilog synthesizable constructs such as always blocks, generate-if constructs, and continuous assignments are used to setup the logic for capturing interrupts, selecting the correct data based on input address, and passing the data through with a designed latency, thereby ensuring the data\u2019s integrity and timeliness for further system-level processing.",

It registers incoming interrupts on a positive edge of the clock or a negative edge of the reset signal. Depending on the number of interrupts (more than 32 or not), it generates either one or two regions for storing these interrupts. It also handles read operations based on an address input, allowing access to different sections of captured interrupts, and provides a data output which echoes the captured interrupt data after a clock cycle delay to incorporate wait states.

When asserted (low), it resets the module's internal registers to their initial state.\n- interrupt_in: This is an input vector with a size dependent on NUM_INTR. It is used to feed the current state of up to 32 interrupt signals into the module.\n- addr: This input signal is used to select between different data regions for reading. It acts as an address signal for accessing specific parts of the captured interrupt data.\n- read: This input signal is used to enable the data read operation. When asserted, it allows data to be read based on the address provided.\n\nOutput ports: rddata.\nExplanation:\n- rddata: This is a 32-bit output data bus which carries the read interrupt data.

It ensures that the interrupt inputs are stably held within the module for processing or further actions.\n- readdata_with_waitstate: This register is used to introduce a wait state by delaying the output data by one clock cycle.

It abstracts the handling of which part of the interrupt data should be currently driven to the output before applying the wait state.\n- readdata_lower_intr: This wire signal holds the data of the lower 32 bits of the interrupt register, masked based on the access condition for the lower 32 interrupts.\n- readdata_higher_intr: This wire signal holds the data of the higher bits of the interrupt register (if NUM_INTR > 32), masked based on the access condition for the higher interrupts. If NUM_INTR \u2264 32, this signal is forced to zero.\n- access_lower_32: This wire signal is a condition flag indicating whether the lower 32 bits of interrupt data should be accessed.

This control depends on if NUM_INTR > 32 and is set by the 'read' input and the 'addr' input comparing against 1."
