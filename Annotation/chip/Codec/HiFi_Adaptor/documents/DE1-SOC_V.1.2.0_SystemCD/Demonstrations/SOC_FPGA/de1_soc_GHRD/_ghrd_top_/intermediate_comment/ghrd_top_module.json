    "module": "Module-level comment: The `ghrd_top` module is the primary FPGA design managing interfaces and control between FPGA and HPS. It includes numerous I/O ports for peripherals like ADCs, DRAM, VGA, and Ethernet, and a sub-module `soc_system` that orchestrates detailed signal interactions for memory management, communication interfaces, and user input devices. This design ensures robust and versatile interfacing for complex digital and signal processing tasks necessary for advanced hardware systems."
