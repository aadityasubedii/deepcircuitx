Module-level comment: The "hps_sdram_p0_iss_probe" module integrates probing functionality for SDRAM signal debugging using the "altsource_probe" component. It accepts signals via `probe_input` which are parameterizable in width. This module focuses on interfacing the input signals directly to the embedded probing block, which is configured via parameters such as ID, metastability, and initialization, facilitating detailed observation in debug and test environments.
