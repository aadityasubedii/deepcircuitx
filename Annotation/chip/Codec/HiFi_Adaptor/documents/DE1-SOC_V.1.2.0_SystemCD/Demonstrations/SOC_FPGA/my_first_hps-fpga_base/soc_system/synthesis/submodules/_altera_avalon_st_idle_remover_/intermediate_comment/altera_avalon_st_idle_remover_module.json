    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_idle_remover` module processes incoming 8-bit data to exclude 'idle' characters (0x4A) and handle 'escape' characters (0x4D) by XORing the subsequent byte with 0x20. It uses registers (`received_esc`) and conditional checks within sequential logic to maintain states and control data processing based on the readiness signals (`in_ready`, `out_ready`) to ensure smooth data flow without congestion."
