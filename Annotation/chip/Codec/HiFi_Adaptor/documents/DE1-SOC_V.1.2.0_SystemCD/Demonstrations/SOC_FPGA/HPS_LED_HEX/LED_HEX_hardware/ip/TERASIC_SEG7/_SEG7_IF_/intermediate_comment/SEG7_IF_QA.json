It manages a register file that contains the state (on or off) of each segment in the display. The module uses its inputs to either reset the display, write data to specific segments based on address input, or read the state of specific segments. Outputs include the segment data as well as the read data when requested. The behavior of the module is clocked on the negative edge of 's_clk', and includes capabilities to clear the display to a default state upon reset, and the ability to invert the output based on configuration if active low display is used."

Used for triggering the operations inside the module on the negative edge.\n- `s_address`: Address input. Used to specify which segment register is to be accessed for read or write operations.\n- `s_read`: Read enable signal. When high, it initiates a read operation from the segment register specified by `s_address`.\n- `s_writedata`: Data input for writing. Holds the data to be written into the segment register specified by `s_address` during write operations.\n- `s_write`: Write enable signal. When high, it initiates a write operation to the segment register specified by `s_address`.\n- `s_reset`: Reset signal. Used to reset all segment registers to a default state as defined by the parameter `DEFAULT_ACTIVE`.\n\nOutput ports: s_readdata, SEG7.\nExplanation:\n- `s_readdata`: Output data from a read operation. Holds the contents of the segment register read from during a read operation.\n- `SEG7`: Output to the seven-segment display. Represents the current states of all segments in all seven-segment displays controlled by this module, which can be either in the actual or inverted state based on the `LOW_ACTIVE` configuration."

It multiplies the address by 8 (since each segment in the 7-segment display is represented by 8 bits) to point to the correct position in `reg_file`.\n- `write_data`: This register holds the data that is to be written into the `reg_file`. It temporarily stores the data from `s_writedata` which is then written into `reg_file` based on the calculated `base_index`.\n- `read_data`: This register captures and holds the data read from `reg_file` during read operations. The data stored in this register is output on `s_readdata`.\n- `reg_file`: This is a multi-bit register (size depends on `SEG7_NUM` * 8) that represents the state (on/off) of each segment of all seven-segment displays managed by the module. Each segment's state for all displays stored in this register can be written to or read from based on operations triggered by input signals."
