Module-level comment: The `soc_system_hps_0_hps_io` module interfaces I/O for an SoC's High-Performance Subsystem (HPS), routing signals for various peripherals like memory, Ethernet MAC, and USB. It primarily acts as a signal conduit, connecting inputs and outputs directly to a subordinate, `soc_system_hps_0_hps_io_border`, which handles detailed interfacing logic. This structure emphasizes streamlined signal mapping and external interfacing without internal signal processing.
