It includes parameters for defining data properties, such as symbols per beat and bits per symbol. Primarily, it ensures controlled data flow between input (\"in_data\") and output (\"out_data\") using two buffering registers (data0 and data1). The module uses the \"full0\" and \"full1\" flags to manage the buffering status\u2014whether data is ready to be transferred or received\u2014based on the clock (\"clk\") and reset conditions. Additionally, it handles the ready and valid signals to synchronize data transmission and reception, supporting pipeline-ready and unregistered pipeline modes to cater to different operational requirements. This flexibility allows efficient data handling and buffering in high-speed data processing applications."

It gets buffered internally depending on the status of full flags and the module configuration.\n- out_ready: This signal is provided by the downstream module or environment signaling that it is ready to accept data. This helps in managing the flow control and preventing data loss.\n\nOutput ports: in_ready, out_valid, out_data.\nExplanation:\n- in_ready: This signal is generated by the module and sent to the upstream component to indicate that the module is ready to accept more data. It helps in controlling the flow of data into the module.\n- out_valid: This output indicates when the data on the out_data port is valid and can be read by downstream components.\n- out_data: This represents the output data from the module.
