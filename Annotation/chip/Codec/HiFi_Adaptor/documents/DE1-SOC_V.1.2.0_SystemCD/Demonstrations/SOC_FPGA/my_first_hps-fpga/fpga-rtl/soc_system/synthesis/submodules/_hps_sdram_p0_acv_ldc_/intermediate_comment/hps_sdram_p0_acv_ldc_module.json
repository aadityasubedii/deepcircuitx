    "module": "Module-level comment: The hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc module manages clock signals for SDRAM by taking input clocks (pll_hr_clk, pll_dq_clk, pll_dqs_clk) and a delay control (dll_phy_delayctrl). Outputs are generated for different memory interfaces after conditioning through buffers, delay chains, and phase selectors based on configurations like IS_HHP_HPS and ADC_INVERT_PHASE, ensuring optimal operation in FPGA-based systems."
