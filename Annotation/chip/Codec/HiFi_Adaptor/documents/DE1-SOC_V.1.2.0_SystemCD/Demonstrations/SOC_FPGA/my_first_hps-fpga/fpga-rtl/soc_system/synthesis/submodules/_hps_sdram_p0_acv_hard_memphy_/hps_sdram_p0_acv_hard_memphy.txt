Module-level comment: This module implements a memory interface (PHY) for an SDRAM controller in a hard processor system. It manages low-level timing and signaling for SDRAM, handling address/command signals, data read/write operations, and DLL control. The module uses a hard memory PHY instance, reset controller, latency/delay control, and I/O pads to achieve its functionality. It supports customization through parameters and is designed for specific Altera/Intel FPGA families.
