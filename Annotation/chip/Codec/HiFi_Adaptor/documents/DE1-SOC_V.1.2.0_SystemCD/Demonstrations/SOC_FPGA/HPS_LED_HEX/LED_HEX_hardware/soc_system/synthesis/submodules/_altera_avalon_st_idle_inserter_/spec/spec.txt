Module name: altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter.
Module specification: The 'altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter' is a Verilog module designed to process data streams by inserting idle characters (`0x4A`) or managing escape characters (`0x4D`) in a manner essential for communication protocols. The input ports include: 'clk' (clock signal for synchronization), 'reset_n' (active-low reset), 'in_valid' (indicates the validity of the incoming data), 'in_data' (8-bit data to be processed), and 'out_ready' (indicates if the downstream module is ready to accept data). The output ports are: 'in_ready' (shows if the module is ready to accept new data), 'out_valid' (signal that the output data should be considered valid), and 'out_data' (processed 8-bit data output). Internal signals such as 'received_esc' (flag for received escape character without subsequent valid data), 'idle_char' (detects if the input data is an idle character), and 'escape_char' (detects if the input data is an escape character) are crucial for decision making in data handling. The Verilog code includes two main blocks: a sequential logic block that updates 'received_esc' based on the conditions of data validity, idleness, escaper, and readiness; and a combinational logic block that updates 'in_ready', 'out_valid', and 'out_data' based on the states of inputs and 'received_esc'. This module ensures precise alterations and additions to the data stream, vital for correct data framing or escaping in interfaces and communication protocols.
