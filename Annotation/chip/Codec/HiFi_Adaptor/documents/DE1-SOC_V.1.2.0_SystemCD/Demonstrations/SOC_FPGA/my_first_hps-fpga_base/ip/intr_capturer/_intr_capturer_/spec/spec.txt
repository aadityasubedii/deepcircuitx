Module name: intr_capturer. 
Module specification: The intr_capturer module is designed for capturing and handling interrupts in a system with customizable support up to 32 or more interrupts. It operates with a primary clock (clk) and an active-low reset (rst_n) to manage internal states and data transitions. Input ports include clk, rst_n for synchronization and reset, interrupt_in which is a vector handling current state of interrupts, addr for selecting data regions, and read for enabling data read operations. The module outputs the captured interrupt data through the rddata port after a delay to incorporate wait states. Internal signals like interrupt_reg capture and stabilize interrupt inputs. readdata_with_waitstate adds a latency cycle to the data output for stable data operations. The act_readdata signal manages which part of the interrupt data from either the lower or higher bits should be actively read, affected by address inputs and read flags. The module features conditional structures to manage more than 32 interrupts, splitting the interrupt register and access logic accordingly. Hardware-efficient Verilog synthesizable constructs such as always blocks, generate-if constructs, and continuous assignments are used to setup the logic for capturing interrupts, selecting the correct data based on input address, and passing the data through with a designed latency, thereby ensuring the dataâ€™s integrity and timeliness for further system-level processing.
