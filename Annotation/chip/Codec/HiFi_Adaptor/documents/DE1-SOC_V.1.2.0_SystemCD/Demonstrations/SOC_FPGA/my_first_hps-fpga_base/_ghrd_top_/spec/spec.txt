Module name: ghrd_top. Module specification: The 'ghrd_top' module serves as the top-level hardware design of a system that interfaces an FPGA with various peripherals and functionalities, catering both FPGA components and a Hard Processor System (HPS). The module includes input ports such as ADC_DOUT, various clock signals (CLOCK2_50, CLOCK3_50, etc.), and HPS interfaces like HPS_ENET_RX_CLK, and HPS_UART_RX, which are used for operations ranging from time synchronization to communication with serial and network peripherals. The output ports such as ADC_CS_n, ADC_DIN, FPGA_I2C_SCLK, and VGA outputs provide interfaces for digital-analog conversion, I2C communication, and video display respectively. Internal control and interface signals such as hps_fpga_reset_n, fpga_debounced_buttons, and stm_hw_events manage reset conditions and signal integrity processing, handle user inputs through debounced buttons, and aggregate hardware event statuses. The design integrates a variety of submodules such as the soc_system for interfacing the HPS with memory and peripheral interfaces, hps_reset for managing reset requests, and pulse edge detectors for handling reset signals. Collectively, this module orchestrates operations across different system components ensuring synchronized functionality and interfacing with various external and internal modules to facilitate complex hardware interactions in an integrated System on Chip (SoC) environment.
