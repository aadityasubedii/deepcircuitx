    "spec": "Module name: hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync. \nModule specification: The hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync is a Verilog module designed to synchronize an asynchronous reset signal (`reset_n`) with a clock signal (`clk`). The module primarily functions by filtering glitches in the reset signal by using a series of flip-flops configured through the `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` and `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT` parameters. The inputs to the module are `reset_n`, an active-low reset signal that resets the internal state of the module, and `clk`, which provides the timing reference essential for the synchronization process. The output of the module, `reset_n_sync`, delivers the synchronized reset signal, safe for use within the same clock domain. The internal signal `reset_reg` is articulated as a register array implementing a flip-flop chain, which captures and propagates the reset state across its stages, ensuring stability and the absence of glitches. Within the code, the `generate` and `endgenerate` keywords define a loop that iteratively constructs each flip-flop stage in the reset synchronization process. Each stage reacts to the positive edge of the clock or the negative edge of the reset signal, managing reset propagation through conditional statements. The synchronization process's hardware specificity and behavior are further directed by synthesis attributes applied to this register array, guiding the synthesis tools to treat this as a critical synchronization path. This efficient management of the asynchronous reset signal effectively minimizes the risk of metastability in the resulting synchronized output.",
