Module name: altera_reset_synchronizer. Module specification: The `altera_reset_synchronizer` is a Verilog module designed to synchronize reset signals to a clock domain, reducing metastability issues associated with using asynchronous resets directly. The module contains two input ports: `reset_in`, which accepts either an asynchronous or synchronous reset signal, and `clk`, which is the clock signal used for synchronization. The output port, `reset_out`, delivers a stable reset signal, synchronized over several clock cycles. Internally, the module employs a shift register `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain` of size determined by the parameter `DEPTH`, which delays the reset signal accordingly. Another internal signal, `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out`, represents the first stage output of this shift register and is ultimately connected to `reset_out`. The module is parameterized by `ASYNC_RESET` to handle different types of reset inputs: when `ASYNC_RESET` is enabled, the shift register loads all ones upon a reset assertion, whereas in disabled state, it behaves like a standard shift register, taking the `reset_in` directly. This logic is encapsulated within a generate block, which creates appropriate procedural blocks (`always` blocks) based on the `ASYNC_RESET` parameter. Each procedural block describes the behavior of the shift register during clock cycles and reset conditions, ensuring the synchronization of the reset signal as per configuration.
