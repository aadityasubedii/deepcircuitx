    "spec": "Module name: soc_system_hps_only_master_p2b_adapter. \nModule specification: The `soc_system_hps_only_master_p2b_adapter` module is designed to transfer data signals synchronously across interfaces in response to a clock signal. It functions as a bridge or adapter between differing signal protocols by ensuring the matching of validity and readiness states between input and output interfaces. The input ports include `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `in_valid` (indicates if input data is valid), `in_data` (8-bit input data bus), `in_startofpacket` and `in_endofpacket` (signals framing data packets), and `out_ready` (signaling if the receiving side is ready for data). The output ports consist of `in_ready` (shows readiness to accept input data), `out_valid` (mirrors the input validity), `out_data` (8-bit output data bus), `out_startofpacket`, `out_endofpacket`, and `out_channel` (a static 8-bit signal for additional data, typically used for channel identification). Internally, the module includes a signal `in_channel`, which is a register initialized to 0, used primarily for channel identification but remains static in this implementation. The main logic is encapsulated in an always block which conditions the outputs directly on the inputs and the internal register `in_channel`, with an emphasis on real-time, synchronous data transfer by mirroring the states of `out_ready` to `in_ready` and `in_valid` to `out_valid`, thereby ensuring that the data integrity and packet framing are maintained across the interconnecting modules.",

The module reads input signals such as data, start-of-packet, and end-of-packet flags, and forwards these signals to corresponding output signals when the receiving side is ready to accept data. The `in_ready` signal indicates if the module is ready to accept new input data, and is driven by the readiness of the output side (`out_ready`). Similarly, output validity (`out_valid`) is controlled by the input validity (`in_valid`). The module simply acts as a pass-through interface or adapter, allowing for data to flow between different components or systems while matching readiness and validity states of the interfaces."

When high, it signals that valid data is present on the input data port.\n- `in_data`: A 8-bit input data bus carrying the actual data to be transferred through the module.\n- `in_startofpacket`: A signal that indicates the beginning of a data packet, helping to frame the data blocks being transferred.\n- `in_endofpacket`: A signal that indicates the end of a data packet, also aiding in framing the data.\n- `out_ready`: A signal from the receiving module or system indicating it is ready to accept data.\n\nOutput ports: `in_ready`, `out_valid`, `out_data`, `out_startofpacket`, `out_endofpacket`, `out_channel`.\nExplanation:\n- `in_ready`: Indicates whether the module is ready to accept new input data, controlled by the `out_ready` signal from the downstream module.\n- `out_valid`: Indicates if the output data `out_data` is valid. It mirrors the `in_valid` signal to show that the input data has been successfully transferred to the output.\n- `out_data`: A 8-bit output data bus that carries the data being transmitted to the next stage or component.\n- `out_startofpacket`: Passes along the start-of-packet signal received on `in_startofpacket` to mark the beginning of a data packet on the output side.\n- `out_endofpacket`: Passes the end-of-packet signal received on `in_endofpacket`, used to mark the end of a data packet on the output side.\n- `out_channel`: A secondary 8-bit output used for transferring channel or identification data.
