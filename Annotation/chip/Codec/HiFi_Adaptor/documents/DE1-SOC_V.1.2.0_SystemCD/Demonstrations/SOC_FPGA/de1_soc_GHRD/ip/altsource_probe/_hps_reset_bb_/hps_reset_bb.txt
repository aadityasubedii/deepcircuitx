Module-level comment: The `hps_reset` module serves as a basic framework for handling reset operations, driven by input signals `probe` and `source_clk`. It outputs a 3-bit `source`, indicating multiple reset states. The module lacks internal logic, detailed in the provided code, hinting its use as a template requiring further implementation to define exact reset behaviors and synchronization with the clock.
