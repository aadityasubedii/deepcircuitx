    "module": "Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_addr_cmd_pads` module interfaces DDR memory by translating signals between PHY and memory components. It utilizes input/reset signals and multiple clocks to synchronize DDR operations. Key blocks include `hps_sdram_p0_generic_ddio` for signal translation, `hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc` and `altddio_out` for customized clock management, and `hps_sdram_p0_clock_pair_generator` for differential clock outputs, ensuring aligned data rates and optimized memory interaction."
