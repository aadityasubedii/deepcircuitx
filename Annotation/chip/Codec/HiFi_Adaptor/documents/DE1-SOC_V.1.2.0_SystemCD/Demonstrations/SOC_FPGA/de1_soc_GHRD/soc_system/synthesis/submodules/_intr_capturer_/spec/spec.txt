Module name: intr_capturer. 

Module specification: The intr_capturer module is designed to handle and register multiple interrupt signals using a parameterizable number, NUM_INTR. It employs a clock signal (**clk**) to synchronize operations, and an active-low reset (**rst_n**) to initialize the module's state. Input interrupts are received on the **interrupt_in** bus, and their states are captured in the **interrupt_reg** register. The module supports reading the status of these interrupts via a 32-bit output, **rddata**, which is determined by an address input (**addr**) and a read enable signal (**read**). Internally, the module utilizes several key signals: **readdata_with_waitstate** delays output data for synchronization; **act_readdata** merges interrupt data from potential multiple registers; **readdata_lower_intr** and **readdata_higher_intr** hold interrupt states for different segments. The **access_lower_32** and **access_higher_32** signals determine which segment of interrupt data is accessible based on the **addr** input. The Verilog code includes a generate block that adjusts the logic based on NUM_INTR, enabling support for either one or two interrupt register sets, highlighting the module's adaptability to different requirements. This structure ensures effective read operations and status management across varying numbers of interrupts, making the module versatile within broader digital systems.
