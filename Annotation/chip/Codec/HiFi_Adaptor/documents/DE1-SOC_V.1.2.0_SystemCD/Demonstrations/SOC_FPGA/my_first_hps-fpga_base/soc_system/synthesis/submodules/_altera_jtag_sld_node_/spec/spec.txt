Module name: altera_jtag_sld_node. 

Module specification: The altera_jtag_sld_node Verilog module is designed to facilitate JTAG testing and debugging for Altera FPGA devices. It interfaces with a virtual JTAG, executing typical scan operations like capture DR, shift DR, and update DR. The module contains optional inputs `ir_out` for selecting operational modes via JTAG instruction bits and `tdo` for feedback data from scan operations. Outputs include `ir_in` for downstream instruction forwarding, a `tck` synchronizing signal, `tdi` for scan chain data entry, and various `virtual_state_...` signals indicating different stages of JTAG testing. Internally, the module uses `simulation_clock` for timing in absence of hardware `tck`, `sdrs` to indicate the start of a shift operation in Data Register, and several state signals (`cdr`, `sdr`, `e1dr`, `udr`) to manage JTAG transitions. The tasks and functions embedded within manage state transitions, data shifting, and mode configurations to simulate or perform actual FPGA testing. The Verilog code is structured to accommodate both simulated environments (`simulation_clock` activation and detailed behavioral tasks like `enter_data_mode`, `shift_one_bit`) and actual operational conditions (`sld_virtual_jtag_basic` component usage defining realistic JTAG interfacing).
