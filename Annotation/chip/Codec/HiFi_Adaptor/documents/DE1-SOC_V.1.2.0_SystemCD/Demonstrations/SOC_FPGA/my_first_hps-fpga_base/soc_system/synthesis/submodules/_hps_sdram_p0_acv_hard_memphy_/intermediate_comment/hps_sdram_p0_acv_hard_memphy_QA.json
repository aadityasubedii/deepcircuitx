It handles the low-level signaling between the memory controller and the SDRAM chips, including address/command signals, data read/write operations, and various timing and calibration functions. The module integrates DDR (Double Data Rate) I/O, DLL (Delay-Locked Loop) for timing, and OCT (On-Chip Termination) controls. It also includes interfaces for configuration, calibration, and debugging purposes."
