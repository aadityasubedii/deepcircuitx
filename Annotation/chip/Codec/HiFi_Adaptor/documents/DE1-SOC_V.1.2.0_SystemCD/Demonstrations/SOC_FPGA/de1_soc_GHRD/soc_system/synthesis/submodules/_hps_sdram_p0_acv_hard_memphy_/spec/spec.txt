Module name: hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_memphy. Module specification: This module implements a memory interface (PHY) for an SDRAM controller, likely for a Hard Processor System (HPS) in an FPGA. It handles the physical layer interface between the memory controller and SDRAM chips, managing address/command signals, data read/write operations, and timing/calibration functions. The module has numerous input ports for control signals, configuration parameters, and data, including global_reset_n, afi_addr, afi_wdata, and various clock inputs. Output ports include afi_rdata, mem_a, mem_dq, and status signals like afi_cal_success. Internal signals such as ddio_phy_dqdin and phy_ddio_address are used for data transfer and control between sub-components. The module is composed of several key
