Module-level comment: The `altera_reset_controller` module synchronizes and manages multiple reset and reset request signals for Altera/Intel FPGAs. It merges up to 16 reset and reset request inputs, synchronizes them with a clock, and outputs stable reset signals. Internal logic uses parameter-based configurations, adaptive synchronization, and debouncing techniques to ensure signal stability and correctness under various operational conditions. The module employs conditional generate blocks and synchronized shift registers to adaptively control the output resets based on system configurations.
