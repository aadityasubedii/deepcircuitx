    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'debounce' module stabilizes noisy digital input signals by implementing a timeout-based filtering mechanism. It features configurable parameters such as signal width, polarity, and timeout duration. Internally, each bit of the input has a counter that is managed through enable and reset conditions, dependent on the input state and polarity. Counters increment until the timeout is reached, determining the stable output for each bit. This modular design ensures synchronized, stable outputs in noisy environments."
