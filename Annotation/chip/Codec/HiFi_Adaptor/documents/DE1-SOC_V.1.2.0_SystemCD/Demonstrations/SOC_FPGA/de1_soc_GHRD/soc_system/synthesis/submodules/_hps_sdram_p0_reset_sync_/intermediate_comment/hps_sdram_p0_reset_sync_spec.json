    "spec": "Module name: hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync. Module specification: The \"hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync\" module is designed to synchronize an asynchronous active-low reset signal (`reset_n`) to the clock domain specified by the clock signal (`clk`). The synchronization prevents metastability issues typically associated with asynchronous signals in digital circuits. The module has two input ports: `reset_n`, representing the asynchronous reset signal, and `clk`, the clock signal to which the reset is synchronized. The output of the module, `reset_n_sync`, is a synchronized reset signal configured through parameters to manage the number of output signals and the stages of synchronization. Internally, the module utilizes `reset_reg`, an array of registers, to create a chain of flip-flops that sequentially passes the reset signal through various stages. This staging helps in providing a stable output reset signal, suppresses glitches, and timing errors present in the initial asynchronous signal. The Verilog code is structured into significant blocks: declaration of parameters (`RESET_SYNC_STAGES`, `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT`), port declarations, and a `generate` block that dynamically creates the necessary flip-flop stages based on configuration. Each stage in the `generate` block handles the propagation of the reset signal or the forced reset of the register based on the state of `reset_n`. Finally, the `assign` statement at the end of the code ties the output of the last stage of the flip-flops to the `reset_n_sync` output port, completing the synchronization process.",

Synchronization is achieved using a chain of flip-flops to mitigate issues arising from asynchronous reset signals, such as metastability. The number of flip-flop stages in the chain is configurable through the `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` parameter, and the number of synchronized reset outputs is defined by `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT`. The resulting synchronized reset outputs are provided after passing through the specified number of synchronization stages, thereby ensuring that the reset signal is stable and aligned with the clock domain to which it is being synchronized."

It is derived after passing the input reset signal through a series of flip-flop stages specified by the `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` and `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT` parameters.

It is defined with a size of `RESET_SYNC_STAGES + NUM_RESET_OUTPUT - 1`. The purpose of this array is to hold the intermediate values at each stage of the flip-flop chain. Each element of this array sequentially captures the value from its preceding stage on each rising edge of the clock signal, or it is reset to `0` when `reset_n` is asserted (active low). The synchronization process is achieved through this cascading update of values in the register, ensuring that any glitches due to the asynchronous nature of the input reset signal are filtered out by the time the signal reaches the final stage, which then provides a stable and synchronized reset output signal `reset_n_sync`."
