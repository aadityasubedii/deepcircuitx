    "module": "Module-level comment: The `soc_system_onchip_memory2_0` encapsulates on-chip memory utilizing `altsyncram` for SoC applications, enabling read and write operations. Key inputs like address and writedata control memory interactions, alongside control signals like chipselect and write. Internal logics, `clocken0` and `wren`, manage signal synchronization and write operations. Configured properties setup operational parameters for stable and precise memory management."
