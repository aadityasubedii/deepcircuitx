Module name: hps_reset. Module specification: The 'hps_reset' module is designed for handling reset functionalities within a system. It leverages the input 'probe' to monitor conditions or statuses that might trigger a reset, and employs 'source_clk' as a clocking signal to manage the timing and synchronization of the reset activities. The outputs through a 3-bit bus 'source' could potentially convey reset-related status or control signals back to other components of the system. This module does not utilize any internal signals as per the provided Verilog snippet, suggesting a direct relationship between the inputs and the outputs without intermediate processing or storage. The code primarily defines the interface of the module without revealing internal logic or specific block functions, indicating the need for additional details to fully comprehend its operational mechanisms.
