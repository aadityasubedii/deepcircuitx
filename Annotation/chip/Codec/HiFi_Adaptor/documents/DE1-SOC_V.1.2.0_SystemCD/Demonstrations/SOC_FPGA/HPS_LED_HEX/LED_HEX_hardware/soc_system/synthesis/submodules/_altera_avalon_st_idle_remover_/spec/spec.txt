Module name: altera_avalon_st_idle_remover. Module specification: The "altera_avalon_st_idle_remover" is a Verilog module designed to process incoming data streams by removing specific idle and escape characters in a synchronous manner using a clock signal "clk" and an active-low reset "reset_n". The module reads 8-bit data through "in_data" input port based on the "in_valid" signal which indicates that the incoming data is valid. It interacts with subsequent modules using the "out_ready" input, indicating readiness to accept data. The output of the module is controlled via "out_data" and "out_valid" which carry the processed data and its validity, respectively. Internally, the module utilizes "received_esc", a register to mark the reception and processing of an escape character, "escape_char", a wire to detect if the incoming data is an escape character, and "idle_char", another wire to check for idle characters in the data. Essentially, the module weeds out idle characters and modifies data preceded by an unprocessed escape character by XOR-ing it with "0x20". Key operations are handled in two always blocks; the first manages the state of 'received_esc' based on the data and control signals, and the second determines the output validity, readiness to accept new input, and the appropriate output data based on whether an escape character has been processed.
