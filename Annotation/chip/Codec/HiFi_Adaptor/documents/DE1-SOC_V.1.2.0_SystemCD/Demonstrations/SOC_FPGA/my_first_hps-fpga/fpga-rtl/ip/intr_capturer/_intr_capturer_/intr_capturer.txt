Module-level comment: The "intr_capturer" module captures interrupt signals and manages their readout. It uses a register `interrupt_reg` to store interrupt states, updated on each clock edge or reset. Read operations are controlled by `addr` and `read` inputs, directing output through a wait-state register `readdata_with_waitstate` for synchronization. The module handles up to `NUM_INTR` interrupts, splitting data handling between lower and higher ranges if necessary, controlled by conditional compilation and internal signal routing.
