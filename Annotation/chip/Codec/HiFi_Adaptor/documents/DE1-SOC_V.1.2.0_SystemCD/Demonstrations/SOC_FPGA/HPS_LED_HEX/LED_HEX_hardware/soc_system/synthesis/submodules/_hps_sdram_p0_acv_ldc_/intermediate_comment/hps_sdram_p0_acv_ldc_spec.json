The module accepts four input signals: `pll_hr_clk`, `pll_dq_clk`, `pll_dqs_clk`, and `dll_phy_delayctrl`, which serve as the high-resolution, data (DQ), data strobe (DQS) line clocks, and delay control settings from a delay-locked loop respectively. It outputs five clocks: `afi_clk`, `avl_clk`, `adc_clk`, `adc_clk_cps`, and `hr_clk`, each serving different aspects of memory and system interfacing operations. Internally, the module features several significant wires like `phy_clk_dqs`, `phy_clk_dq`, `phy_clk_hr`, and `phy_clk_dqs_2x`, which manage raw and buffered clock signals, alongside `phy_clk_addr_cmd` and `phy_clk_addr_cmd_cps` which were declared but not utilized within the current code. The module also employs a conditional generation block to buffer or directly assign clocks based on system configuration (`IS_HHP_HPS`). Specific hardware components like `cyclonev_phy_clkbuf`, `cyclonev_leveling_delay_chain`, and `cyclonev_clk_phase_select` are used for conditioning and selecting clock phases for SDRAM operations. These components collectively handle the clock management for SDRAM interfacing by providing phased and leveled clock outputs and selectable phase and inversion control for address/command operations, aligning the system for varying timing and operational requirements.",
