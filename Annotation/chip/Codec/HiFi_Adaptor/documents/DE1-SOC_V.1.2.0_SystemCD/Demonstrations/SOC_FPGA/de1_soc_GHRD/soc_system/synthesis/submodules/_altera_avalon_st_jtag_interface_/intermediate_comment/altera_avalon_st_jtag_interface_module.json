    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface` module facilitates JTAG communication in two modes: normal or PLI based on the `USE_PLI` parameter. It handles data streaming between source and sink channels, utilizing `altera_jtag_dc_streaming` or `altera_pli_streaming` sub-modules for configuration-dependent operations. The module supports management tasks and system resets, driven by input `clk` and `reset_n` signals, accommodating adjustable FIFO sizing and management channel width parameters. This structure efficiently integrates with systems requiring dynamic data management and diagnostic capabilities."
