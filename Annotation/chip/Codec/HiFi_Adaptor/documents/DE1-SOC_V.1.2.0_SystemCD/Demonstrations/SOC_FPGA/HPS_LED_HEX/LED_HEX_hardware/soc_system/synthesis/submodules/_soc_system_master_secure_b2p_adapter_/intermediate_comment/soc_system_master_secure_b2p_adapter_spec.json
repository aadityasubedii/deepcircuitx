    "spec": "Module name: soc_system_master_secure_b2p_adapter. \nModule specification: The `soc_system_master_secure_b2p_adapter` module functions as a data forwarding interface, managing transfer from input to output under specific conditions based on the status of the input and output interfaces. Key **input ports** include `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset_n` (active low reset signal), `in_ready` (reflects readiness to receive data), `in_valid` (indicates if incoming data is valid), `in_data` (actual data being transferred), `in_channel` (channel identifier affecting data transfer), `in_startofpacket`, `in_endofpacket` (signal start and end of data packets), and `out_ready` (signals readiness of the downstream module to receive data). The **output ports** are `in_ready` (mirrors output readiness), `out_valid` (validity of output data), `out_data` (data sent to output), `out_startofpacket`, and `out_endofpacket` (marking the start and end of output packets). An **internal signal**, `out_channel`, is crucial as it holds the value of `in_channel` and influences the condition to disable `out_valid` when `in_channel` is greater than 0, thereby halting data transmission. The code consists of a single procedural block `always` which controls the behavior of output signals and their conditions based on the status of the input interfaces and the internal condition set by `in_channel`. This module efficiently ensures the integrity and synchronization of data packets during transmission across various interfaces while managing traffic based on channel specifications.\n",

The output is generated based on the readiness of the outgoing interface and the condition of the input channel, specifically, the data transfer is halted if the input channel value is greater than 0. The module ensures synchronization between input and output by mirroring the start and end of packet indicators, along with data validity, as long as the specified conditions are met, thereby maintaining the integrity of data packets transmitted across the interfaces."
