    "module": "Module-level comment: The `credit_producer` module controls credit calculation for flow management in communication systems, based on incoming data and packet bounds. It synchronizes to a clock (`clk`), with an asynchronous reset (`reset_n`), processing symbol and packet credits through comparative logic blocks depending on configuration parameters. Credits are updated in response to valid data transfers and detected end-of-packet events, using internal logic to handle different credit increment conditions effectively."
