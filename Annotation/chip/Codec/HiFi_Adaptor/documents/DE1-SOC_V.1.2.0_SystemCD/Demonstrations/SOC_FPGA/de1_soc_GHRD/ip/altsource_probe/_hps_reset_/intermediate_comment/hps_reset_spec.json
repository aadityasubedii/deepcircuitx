    "spec": "Module name: hps_reset. Module specification: The \"hps_reset\" is a Verilog module designed for interfacing with hardware probe systems and controls the output based on input signals and a source clock. The module consists of two input ports: 'probe' which is used to receive signals for monitoring or interfacing with test environments, and 'source_clk', a clock input that ensures operations are synchronized with the system's timing. It produces a 3-bit output 'source', which represents the processed signal from the 'probe'. Internally, the module utilizes a 3-bit wire 'sub_wire0' that temporarily holds the output from the 'altsource_probe' component before it is assigned to the output port 'source'. The design incorporates the 'altsource_probe' component which manages the core function of signal processing. This component is configured with parameters that control metastability, instance identifiers, and initialization values to enhance signal integrity and reliability. In summary, the 'hps_reset' module is crucial for detailed oversight and manipulation of signals within a hardware testing or debugging framework, facilitated by sophisticated internal configurations and signal management.",

The core operation is managed by the \"altsource_probe\" component, which likely serves to monitor and/or manipulate signals for debugging or testing purposes in a hardware environment, possibly related to FPGA designs or similar platforms. The module uses a source probe to fetch the input signal (probe) and synchronize it with the source_clk, outputting the processed signal through the 3-bit output 'source'. Various parameters are set for the probe operation, including metastability control and initial values, enhancing the precision and reliability of the signal monitoring or testing process."
