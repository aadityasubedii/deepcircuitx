Module-level comment: 
/* 
This module implements a memory-mapped interconnect for a SoC, connecting multiple masters and slaves.
It supports AXI and Avalon interfaces, handling address decoding, data transfer, and bus arbitration.
The interconnect uses crossbar multiplexers, translators, burst adapters, and width adapters to manage
communication between components with different interfaces, data widths, and burst capabilities.
