Module name: soc_system_led_pio. Module specification: The `soc_system_led_pio` module is tailor-made for managing a set of LEDs or similar output devices in an SoC environment. Its functionality revolves around reading and writing data to LEDs via specified ports and address schemes, synchronized by an input clock. This module uses input ports including `address` (a 2-bit input, defining the address space), `chipselect` (controls module operation upon activation), `clk` (synchronizing clock input), `reset_n` (an active-low reset signal initializing output data), `write_n` (an active-low write control signal), and `writedata` (a 32-bit input, with only the lower 10 bits used for output operations). The output ports are `out_port` (a 10-bit output reflecting the output port state) and `readdata` (a 32-bit output offering padded current output state read-back). Internally, it uses signals like `clk_en` (constantly high, indicating clock-enable redundancy here), `data_out` (a 10-bit register holding current state of outputs, reset to `15`), and `read_mux_out` (output data masked based on the address, specifically address 0). The Verilog code structure includes assignments for enabling signals and managing default values, always-block for edge-triggered logic managing output updates and resets, and final assignments linking internal signals to outputs for state mirroring and read-back operations.
