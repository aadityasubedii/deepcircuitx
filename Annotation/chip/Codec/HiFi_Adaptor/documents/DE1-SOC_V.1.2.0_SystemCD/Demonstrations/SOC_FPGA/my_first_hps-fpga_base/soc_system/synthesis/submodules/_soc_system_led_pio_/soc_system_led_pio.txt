Module-level comment: The `soc_system_led_pio` module interfaces with LEDs in an SoC, handling data via inputs like address, chipselect, and writedata, synchronized by a clock. It outputs the LED states and reads back data. On reset, outputs initialize to 15. Writes occur at address 0, facilitated by a control logic sensitive to chipselect and write conditions. The module efficiently manages LED control and data communication with minimal input and clear output feedback.
