It can be configured to detect either rising or falling edges based on the 'EDGE_TYPE' parameter. The detection of edges results in a pulse output ('pulse_out'). The module includes additional parameters to extend this pulse output ('PULSE_EXT') and to optionally ignore reset during busy operations if it is currently outputting a pulse ('IGNORE_RST_WHILE_BUSY'). The module operates in three states (IDLE, ARM, CAPT) to monitor transitions in the input signal and change states accordingly to generate accurate output pulses based on the detected edges."

It is used to control the timing of state transitions and output pulse generation.\n- 'rst_n' is the active-low reset input. When asserted (low), it initializes the module's internal states and outputs, ensuring a defined startup condition.\n- 'signal_in' is the digital input signal whose edges (rising or falling based on configuration) are to be detected by the module, eventually triggering a pulse on 'pulse_out'.\n\nOutput ports: pulse_out.\nExplanation: \n- 'pulse_out' is the output port that generates a pulse when an edge (as specified by 'EDGE_TYPE') is detected in 'signal_in'. Depending on the 'PULSE_EXT' configuration, this pulse can be of extended duration, allowing for adjustable pulse width as per the requirements."

It transitions through the states IDLE, ARM, and CAPT depending on the input signal conditions, governing how the module reacts to input signals and generates outputs.\n- `next_state`: This signal determines the next state that `state` will transition to at the next clock edge. It is set based on the current state and the status of the input signal (`signal_in`).\n- `pulse_detect`: This is a flag used to indicate when an edge, as specified by the configuration, has been detected. Its value is used to control the output pulse (`pulse_out`), either directly or through additional logic depending on `PULSE_EXT`.\n- `busy_pulsing`: This wire signal is used to reflect the module's current activity related to pulse output. It helps manage the reset behavior when `IGNORE_RST_WHILE_BUSY` is enabled, ensuring the module doesn't reset if it is in the middle of generating an extended pulse.\n- `reset_qual_n`: This wire is a conditioned reset signal that combines the original reset (`rst_n`) and the logic from `busy_pulsing`. This signal ensures robust reset behavior where ongoing pulses may need to be preserved even during a reset condition, as specified by the parameter settings."
