The module operates in a synchronous manner, clocked by the signal `clk` and asynchronously reset by `reset_n`. It processes incoming data, represented by the signals `in_valid`, `in_ready`, and `in_endofpacket`. The module calculates two types of credits\u2014symbol credits and packet credits, which are updated based on the respective configurations and conditions defined by parameters (`SYMBOLS_PER_CREDIT`, `SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT`, `USE_SYMBOL_CREDITS`, `USE_PACKET_CREDITS`, `USE_PACKETS`). Specifically:\n\n- **Symbol credits** are computed either by a direct increment based on beats (when `SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT` is a multiple of `SYMBOLS_PER_CREDIT`) or managed through a more complex mechanism involving a counting and rollover system (when `SYMBOLS_PER_CREDIT` is a multiple of `SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT`).\n- **Packet credits** are incremented upon detecting the end of a packet (as identified by the signal `in_endofpacket`), assuming packet functionality is enabled.\n\nThe management of these credits is essential for coordinating and controlling the flow of data, potentially used for flow control mechanisms in networking, communication, or processing systems."

It is used to determine when the module should process data and potentially increment credits.\n- **eop_beat**: End of Packet beat; it is set when a beat occurs at the same time as the end of a packet (`in_endofpacket`). This signal is crucial in managing packet credits, indicating when to increment the `packet_credits` based on the packet boundaries.\n- **sym_count**: Symbol count register; holds the current count of symbols processed. This register helps track the number of symbols to manage the generation of symbol credits via a counting mechanism, particularly when a simple increment per beat is not applicable (i.e., when `SYMBOLS_PER_CREDIT` is larger than `SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT`).\n- **next_sym_count**: Used to hold the potential next value of `sym_count` before it is committed at the next clock edge based on conditions evaluated during the clock period. This helps in preparing what the next symbol count should be if the current cycle processes the data.\n- **rollover**: This flag indicates whether a rollover in symbol counting should occur, either due to reaching a credit threshold or the end of a packet. It dictates whether `sym_count` should be reset and if `symbol_credits` should be incremented, ensuring proper credit accounting for symbols across packet boundaries or symbol credit thresholds."
