Module name: altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter.  
Module specification: The `altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter` module is a Verilog RTL designed to handle streaming data by managing idle and escape characters, making it ideal for communication protocols. It inserts an idle character `0x4A` or performs an XOR operation on the data preceded by an escape character `0x4D`. The input ports include `clk` (clock signal), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `in_valid` (indicating incoming data validity), `in_data` (8-bit input data bus), and `out_ready` (indicating if the downstream is ready to receive data). The output ports are `in_ready` (indicating readiness to accept more data), `out_valid` (indicating the validity of output data), and `out_data` (8-bit processed data output). Internal signals such as `received_esc` (register to track if an escape character was received), `escape_char` (wire to detect the escape character in input data), and `idle_char` (wire to check for idle character in input data) are crucial for the functioning of this module. In the code, two main procedural blocks can be observed: one sequential block controlled by the clock and reset signals used to update the state of `received_esc`, and one combinational block that determines the values of `out_valid`, `in_ready`, and `out_data` based on the current inputs and the state of internal signals. This structure ensures efficient data processing and flow control in systems requiring special character handling in data streams.
