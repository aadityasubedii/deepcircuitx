Module name: soc_system_led_pio. Module specification: The 'soc_system_led_pio' module functions as an I/O controller for LED devices, facilitating data management through input and output processes synchronized with a system clock. It comprises input ports including a 2-bit 'address' for selecting data operations, a 'chipselect' for enabling the module, a 'clk' for synchronization, a low-active 'reset_n' for initialization, a low-active 'write_n' for write operations control, and a 32-bit 'writedata' for data input. The outputs are a 10-bit 'out_port' directly reflecting the internal data register state for connections like LEDs, and a 32-bit 'readdata' providing a formatted internal state readout. Internal signals in this module contain 'clk_en', a constant true value showing the clock is always enabled; 'data_out', a 10-bit register holding output values; and 'read_mux_out', which selectively outputs the 'data_out' content based on the 'address'. The code structure consists of an always block for managing 'data_out' assignment during write operations and reset conditions, and continuous assignments handle the generation of 'readdata' and mapping 'data_out' to 'out_port'. This design ensures a responsive LED control register adaptable through specified addresses and control signals, rendering real-time data output adjustments based on external inputs.
