Module name: altera_avalon_sc_fifo. Module specification: The altera_avalon_sc_fifo module is a configurable FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer designed for data storage and transmission in digital systems. It supports read and write operations with various data and control signals, and can be customized through parameters for data width, depth, error handling, and packet processing. The module has input ports for clock (clk), reset, data input (in_data), control signals (in_valid, in_startofpacket, in_endofpacket, in_empty, in_error, in_channel), and output readiness (out_ready). Output ports include data output (out_data), validity (out_valid), and corresponding control signals. Internal signals manage read/write pointers, memory usage, packet handling, and fill levels. The module is structured with sections for memory management
