Module name: soc_system_dipsw_pio.
Module specification: The soc_system_dipsw_pio is a Verilog module designed to manage interrupts originating from changes in input port status. It monitors a 10-bit input port (`in_port`) for status changes, detects edges, and can generate interrupts based on these changes if unmasked. The module has input ports including `address` (2-bit input for register selection), `chipselect` (activates module for operations), `clk` (clock signal), `in_port` (10-bit input being monitored), `reset_n` (active-low reset signal), `write_n` (active-low write signal), and `writedata` (32-bit input data for writing). Its output ports are `irq` (interrupt request signal) and `readdata` (32-bit output data bus). Internal signals such as `clk_en`, `d1_data_in`, `d2_data_in`, `edge_capture`, `edge_detect`, `irq_mask`, and `read_mux_out` are used for clock management, data synchronization, edge detection, interrupt masking, and multiplexing read operations. The module consists of several blocks handling specific functionalities: reset logic initializing all registers, read and write control logic, and edge detection that conditionally updates edge capture registers. This structure ensures the module's responsiveness and reliability in real-time signal processing and interrupt handling.
