    "spec": "Module name: soc_system_master_secure_b2p_adapter.\nModule specification: The 'soc_system_master_secure_b2p_adapter' module functions as a data packet bridge or adapter between differing domains, emphasizing secure data transmission via selective channel filtering. Primarily, inputs include `clk` (clock signal for timing), `reset_n` (active low reset), `in_valid` (indicates validity of `in_data`), `in_data` (8-bit input data), `in_channel` (8-bit channel identifier for incoming data), `in_startofpacket`, and `in_endofpacket` (markers for beginning and end of data packets). Additionally, `out_ready` input signals readiness from a downstream module. Outputs comprise `in_ready` (module's readiness to receive data), `out_valid` (validity of outgoing data), `out_data` (8-bit outgoing data), `out_startofpacket`, and `out_endofpacket`. An internal signal `out_channel` mirrors `in_channel`, used to conditionally deactivate `out_valid` for channels greater than zero, thus enforcing data packet blocking by channel specifics. The structural blocks of the Verilog code maintain data flow handling by linking input signals to their respective outputs, adjusting `out_valid` based on channel conditions, and ensuring synchronization through `in_ready` depending on `out_ready` status. This configuration showcases a straightforward yet robust approach for secure data handling and interfacing in sensitive or restricted data flow environments.",

It takes input signals including a data byte, validity of the data, start and end markers of a packet, and channel information. The module passes these inputs directly to the corresponding outputs as long as the incoming channel is zero. If the input channel ID is greater than zero, the module deactivates the output validity, effectively blocking data transfer.
