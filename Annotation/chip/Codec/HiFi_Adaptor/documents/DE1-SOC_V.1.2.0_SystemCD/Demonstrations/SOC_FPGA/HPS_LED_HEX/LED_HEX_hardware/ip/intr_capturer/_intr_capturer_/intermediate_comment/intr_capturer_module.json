    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'intr_capturer' module captures and outputs interrupt signals, supporting systems with up to or more than 32 interrupts. It registers interrupts on rising clock edges or resets and employs 32-bit registers to store and manage interrupts. Conditioning by `addr`, data from lower or higher segments is outputted after a 1-clock wait state, ensuring data stability. Conditional logic based on `NUM_INTR` optimizes resource use and functionality for varying interrupt counts."
