    "spec": "Module name: soc_system_sysid_qsys. \nModule specification: The soc_system_sysid_qsys is a Verilog module designed to output one of two predetermined 32-bit values based on the state of an input signal. The module consists of three input ports and one output port. The 'address' input is a single bit used to select between the two output values: if 'address' is true (non-zero), 'readdata' outputs 1389952628, and if 'address' is false (zero), it outputs 2899645186. The 'clock' input is intended for synchronization purposes; however, in this specific design, it does not affect the module's behavior as there are no sequential logic elements within. The 'reset_n' input is designed for resetting the module, but it is not utilized in the current configuration. The output port 'readdata' is a 32-bit wire that outputs the selected value. Internally, the module employs a simple combinational logic represented by a single wire named 'readdata' which is directly assigned based on the logic condition of the 'address' input through a ternary operator. The module lacks separate internal blocks or sections, focusing solely on the combinational logic assignment for 'readdata', demonstrating a straightforward example of data selection based on an input signal.",
