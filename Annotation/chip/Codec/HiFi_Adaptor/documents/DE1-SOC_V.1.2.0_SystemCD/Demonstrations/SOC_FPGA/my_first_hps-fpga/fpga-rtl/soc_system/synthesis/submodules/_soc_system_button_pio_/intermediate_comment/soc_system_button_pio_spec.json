    "spec": "Module name: soc_system_button_pio. \nModule specification: The \"soc_system_button_pio\" module functions as a programmable input/output controller specifically designed for managing button inputs within a System-on-Chip (SoC) environment. Its primary roles include detecting rising edge transitions from button inputs, generating interrupts, and enabling status reading through specific registers. The module utilizes several input ports: `address` (2-bit, selects registers for access), `chipselect` (activates the module for operations), `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `in_port` (4-bit, represents button states), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `write_n` (active-low write enable), and `writedata` (32-bit data for register writing). The outputs comprise `irq` (interrupt request signal) and `readdata` (32-bit data from the addressed register). Internally, the module uses `clk_en` (always enabled clock operations), `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in` (delay registers for edge detection), `data_in` (current button states), `edge_capture` (stores detected edges), `edge_capture_wr_strobe` (controls edge capture register writing), `edge_detect` (identifies rising edges), `irq_mask` (holds interrupt mask settings), and `read_mux_out` (outputs selected register data based on address). The code is structured into blocks handling edge detection, interrupt management, register operations, and reset conditions, ensuring robust functionality for button input handling and interrupt generation in an SoC scenario.",

It goes high to signal an external processor of an event that requires attention, based on edge captures and the interrupt mask.\n- readdata: A 32-bit output which provides the data corresponding to the addressed register. This can be the state of the input ports, the interrupt mask or the status of edge captures.\n\nExplanation:\nThe input ports primarily facilitate the control and configuration of the module in addition to providing the actual input signals from buttons that the module is meant to process. These include dynamic inputs like the button states and control inputs like address and chipselect which determine behavior for reading and writing internal registers.\n\nThe output ports are used to communicate externally. The `irq` output is particularly critical as it enables the module to signal an external processor about specific events (like button presses/releases detected), while the `readdata` output lets an external system read the configuration or status of the module as needed, enhancing the module's utility in system monitoring and control."

It is assigned a constant high value, essentially keeping clock operations always enabled.\n- d1_data_in: This register holds the first delayed version of the input port data. It is used in detecting edge transitions.\n- d2_data_in: This register holds the second delayed version of the input port data, following `d1_data_in`, and helps in determining rising edges by comparing its value with `d1_data_in`.\n- data_in: Represents the current state of the incoming button inputs, directly assigned from the 'in_port' input port.\n- edge_capture: This register stores the detected edge events (transitions). It can be cleared manually via write operations and is used to record edges until they are acknowledged by the system.\n- edge_capture_wr_strobe: This signal controls when the edge_capture register can be written to. It is active when there's a chip select, a write operation, and the address targets the edge capture registers.\n- edge_detect: This signal identifies the actual rising edges based on the difference between `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in`. It indicates a rising edge when `d1_data_in` is low and `d2_data_in` is high.\n- irq_mask: This register holds the mask settings for interrupts. Whether an interrupt for a particular button press is enabled or not is determined by this mask.\n- read_mux_out: This multiplexer output provides the selected data output to be read based on the `address` input. It can output the current button states, the IRQ mask settings, or the edge captures, facilitating selective read operations dictated by the address lines."

Its primary roles include detecting rising edge transitions from button inputs, generating interrupts, and enabling status reading through specific registers. The module utilizes several input ports: `address` (2-bit, selects registers for access), `chipselect` (activates the module for operations), `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `in_port` (4-bit, represents button states), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `write_n` (active-low write enable), and `writedata` (32-bit data for register writing). The outputs comprise `irq` (interrupt request signal) and `readdata` (32-bit data from the addressed register). Internally, the module uses `clk_en` (always enabled clock operations), `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in` (delay registers for edge detection), `data_in` (current button states), `edge_capture` (stores detected edges), `edge_capture_wr_strobe` (controls edge capture register writing), `edge_detect` (identifies rising edges), `irq_mask` (holds interrupt mask settings), and `read_mux_out` (outputs selected register data based on address). The code is structured into blocks handling edge detection, interrupt management, register operations, and reset conditions, ensuring robust functionality for button input handling and interrupt generation in an SoC scenario."
