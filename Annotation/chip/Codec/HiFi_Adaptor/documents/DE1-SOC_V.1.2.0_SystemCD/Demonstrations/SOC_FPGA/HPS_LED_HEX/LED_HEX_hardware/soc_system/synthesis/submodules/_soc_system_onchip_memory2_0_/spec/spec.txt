Module name: soc_system_onchip_memory2_0. 
Module specification: The 'soc_system_onchip_memory2_0' is a Verilog module representing a single-port on-chip memory system, primarily used in FPGA designs. Its functionality is centered on interfacing with the "altsyncram" memory block, facilitating parameterized configuration for data size and width. It manages data writing and reading through a set of input and output ports. Input ports include address (13-bit, memory location for read/write), byteenable (8-bit, byte-wise data manipulation during writes), chipselect (enables memory device operations), clk (main clock), clken (secondary clock enable for power saving), reset and reset_req (reset operations), write (enables write mode), and writedata (64-bit, data to be written to memory). The sole output port, readdata (64-bit), outputs data read from the specified memory location. Internal signals such as clocken0 (controls memory operation during clock cycles by combining clken and reset_req) and wren (write enable signal, activated by both chipselect and write) help facilitate the operations. The module encapsulates an 'altsyncram' block configured with parameters like memory depth and data width to execute the memory operations effectively. These encapsulated operations and configurations ensure efficient data handling and manipulation within FPGA-based systems, tailored to specific requirements via module parameters.
