The module takes two input ports: `reset_n`, the asynchronous reset signal, and `clk`, the clock signal driving the synchronization process. The `reset_n` input is critical for initializing or resetting the module, while `clk` acts as the timing pulse. The output port, `reset_n_sync`, delivers a stable reset signal synchronized with the clock domain, ensuring safe integration with other system components sharing the clock signal. Internally, the module utilizes an array register `reset_reg`, constructed of several stages defined by `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` and `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT`, which are utilized to buffer the reset signal through multiple flip-flop stages, thereby filtering and stabilizing it before it\u2019s outputted. The Verilog code leverages a `generate` block with a loop inside to dynamically create these flip-flop stages based on parameterization, ensuring flexible and scalable reset synchronization. Each stage of the flip-flops, configured within this block, captures and forwards the reset state based on clock edges, ultimately producing the `reset_n_sync` output after sufficient buffering to prevent any metastability.",

The output `reset_n_sync` is a synchronized version of the input reset which is safe to use in the synchronous design. It includes a parameterizable number of synchronization stages (`RESET_SYNC_STAGES`) and supports multiple output resets (`NUM_RESET_OUTPUT`). The synchronization is achieved by passing the reset signal through a series of flip-flops that trigger on the positive edge of the clock or on the negative edge of the reset signal. The register `reset_reg` holds the state of the reset signal through various stages, ensuring that any glitches or asynchronous behavior is filtered out by the time it reaches the output."

The length of this register is defined by `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` plus `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT` minus one, accommodating the number of stages needed for synchronization and the number of output resets required. Its purpose is to progressively synchronize the incoming reset signal (`reset_n`) to the clock domain by shifting it through these flip-flop stages. Eventually, this filtered reset signal is output as `reset_n_sync`, ensuring it is metastability-free and safe for use in the synchronous part of the system. Each flip-flop effectively delays the propagation of the reset signal by one clock cycle, providing sufficient time for the signal to stabilize and minimizing the risk of metastability in the system affected by the reset."
