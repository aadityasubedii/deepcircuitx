Module-level comment: The intr_capturer module manages interrupt signals, capturing up to 32 or more inputs. It utilizes a register, interrupt_reg, to buffer incoming signals each clock cycle, controlled by clk and rst_n. Data access is governed via addr and read inputs, directing the output to rddata via conditional generationâ€”supporting systems with varying interrupt capacities. Specialized logic blocks synchronize data output and handle the subdivision of interrupt data for effective register interfacing.
