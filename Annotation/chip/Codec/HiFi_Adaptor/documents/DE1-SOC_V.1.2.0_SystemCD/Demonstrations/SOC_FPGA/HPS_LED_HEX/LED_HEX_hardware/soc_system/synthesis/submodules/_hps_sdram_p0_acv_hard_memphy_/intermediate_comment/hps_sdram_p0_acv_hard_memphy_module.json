    "module": "Module-level comment: /*\nThis module implements a memory interface controller for an SDRAM system in a Hard Processor System (HPS). It manages physical layer interactions between SDRAM and the system, handling address/command signals, data operations, clock management, and reset control. The module uses DDIO logic, PLLs, and DLLs to interface with memory, and incorporates components for calibration and OCT control. It processes various input signals and configuration parameters to generate appropriate memory interface signals and status outputs.\n*/"
