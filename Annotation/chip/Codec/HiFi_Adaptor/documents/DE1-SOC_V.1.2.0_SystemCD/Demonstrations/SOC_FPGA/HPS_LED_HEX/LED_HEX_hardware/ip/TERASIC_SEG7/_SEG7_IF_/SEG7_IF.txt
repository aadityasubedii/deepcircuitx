Module-level comment: The SEG7_IF module interfaces with a seven-segment display, managing its states across multiple segments. It operates based on a negative edge-triggered clock, handling resets, reads, and writes through specific input signals. Internal mechanisms involve calculating segment indices, storing transient and operational data, reflecting default configurations, and dynamically adjusting the outputs based on display requirements. The design ensures robust display control with parameterizable segment and address handling.
