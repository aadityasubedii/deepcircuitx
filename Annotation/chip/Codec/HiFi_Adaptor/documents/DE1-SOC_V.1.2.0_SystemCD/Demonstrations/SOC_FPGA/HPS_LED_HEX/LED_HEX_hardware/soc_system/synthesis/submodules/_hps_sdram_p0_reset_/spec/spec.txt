Module name: hps_sdram_p0_reset. 
Module specification: The hps_sdram_p0_reset module is designed to generate and synchronize reset signals for various components of an SDRAM system within an FPGA environment, according to a variety of input clocks and reset criteria. The input ports include various clock signals like pll_afi_clk, pll_addr_cmd_clk, along with global resets such as pll_locked, global_reset_n, and soft_reset_n. These inputs serve to condition and synchronize the reset signals across different SDRAM operational domains. The output ports consist of reset signals like reset_n_scc_clk and reset_n_avl_clk, each corresponding to different clock domains within the SDRAM system. Internal signals such as phy_reset_n and phy_reset_mem_stable_n are crucial for generating stable, clean resets based on the lock status of PLL and memory stability indicators. The code is structured into several sections where instances of the hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync submodule synchronize the reset signals to appropriate clock domains. Parameters like MEM_READ_DQS_WIDTH and NUM_AFI_RESET allow configuration flexibility for different SDRAM setups. The use of generate statements facilitates the dynamic creation of reset circuits based on the MEM_READ_DQS_WIDTH parameter, catering to the needs of specific read capture operations.
