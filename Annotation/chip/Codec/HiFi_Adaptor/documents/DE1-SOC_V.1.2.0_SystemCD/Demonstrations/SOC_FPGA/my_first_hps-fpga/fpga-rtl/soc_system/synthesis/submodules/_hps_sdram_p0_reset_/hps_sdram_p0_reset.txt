Module-level comment: The hps_sdram_p0_reset module generates synchronized reset signals for various SDRAM controller clock domains on FPGAs/ASICs. It inputs clocks and reset signals, leveraging the hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync submodule across different domains to produce stable output resets. The synchronization dependencies include PLL lock status, memory stability, and global/software resets, fine-tuned via parameters for flexibility across domains.
