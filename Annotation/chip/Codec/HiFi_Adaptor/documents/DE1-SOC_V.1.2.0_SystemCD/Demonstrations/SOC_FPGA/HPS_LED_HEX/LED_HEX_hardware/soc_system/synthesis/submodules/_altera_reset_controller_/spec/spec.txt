Module name: altera_reset_controller. 
Module specification: The "altera_reset_controller" is a Verilog module primarily designed to manage and synchronize reset signals derived from multiple sources, suitable for ensuring stable and glitch-free operations across digital system components. The module takes 16 asynchronous reset input signals (`reset_in0` to `reset_in15`) and optional 16 reset request input signals (`reset_req_in0` to `reset_req_in15`), in addition to a clock signal (`clk`). It produces two outputs: `reset_out` which serves as the synchronized reset output, and `reset_req` which is an output indicative of a reset request condition. Internally, the module uses several signals including 'merged_reset' to aggregate all reset inputs, 'merged_reset_req_in' to selectively merge reset request inputs based on configuration, and various internal chains like `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain` and `r_sync_rst_chain` for synchronizing reset conditions and refining reset output states. The code is divided into blocks handling parameter definitions, signal aggregations for inputs, conditional generation dependent on module parameters such as synchronization depth and reset request handling, and reset synchronization with various checks and conditions incorporated to handle different reset escalation and synchronization scenarios effectively. The use of generate blocks and conditional statements allows configuration flexibility, enabling the moduleâ€™s deployment in various system setups requiring specific reset management criteria.
