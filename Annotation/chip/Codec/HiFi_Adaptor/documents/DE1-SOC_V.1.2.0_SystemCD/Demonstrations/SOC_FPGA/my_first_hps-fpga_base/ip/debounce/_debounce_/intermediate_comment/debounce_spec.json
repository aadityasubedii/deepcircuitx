    "spec": "Module name: debounce. Module specification: The 'debounce' module is designed to stabilize digital input signals by filtering out noise and ensuring consistent logic levels, particularly useful to counteract signal perturbations such as bouncing. It operates with configurable parameters such as signal width, polarity, and the timeout period required for stabilization. The inputs include 'clk', a clock signal that synchronizes the internal operations; 'reset_n', an active-low asynchronous reset signal to clear internal counters; and 'data_in', an array of digital signals whose stability is being assessed across a specified width ('WIDTH'). The output 'data_out' provides the debounced version of 'data_in', with each bit reflecting the stable state of the corresponding input bit. Internal signals comprise 'counter', an array of registers tracking the logic level holding time for each input bit; 'counter_reset', controlling when each counter should be reset; and 'counter_enable', determining when each counter should increment. The code features several blocks: parameter definitions for customization, signal declarations, and a generate loop that constructs a debouncing mechanism for each signal bit. Within this generate loop, condition-based logic handles the increment, reset, and stability-check of counters to produce a noise-free output signal. This module adequately provides stable outputs through defined timeout counting facilitated by the 'POLARITY' setting, offering robust data handling in noise-prone digital environments.",

It stabilizes the input signal by implementing a timeout mechanism for each bit of the input signal. If a signal on a particular bit of `data_in` maintains a consistent logic level (high or low, based on `POLARITY`) long enough to reach a predetermined count (`TIMEOUT`), the module outputs a stabilized high or low signal on the corresponding bit of `data_out`. Each bit of the input signal has an individual counter (`counter`) with specific enable (`counter_enable`) and reset (`counter_reset`) conditions based on the input signal state and the `POLARITY`. The module is parameterizable, allowing adjustments to signal width, polarity, and the required stable time. The module operates on positive clock edges and can asynchronously reset on a negative edge of `reset_n`."

It allows the module to reset the counters to zero, effectively restarting the debouncing process.\n- data_in: This is the digital input signal array that the module debounces. It comes in a bus with a width defined by the parameter `WIDTH`. Each bit of this input is individually processed to filter out noise and stabilize the signal.\n\nOutput ports: data_out.\nExplanation:\n- data_out: This is the output signal array of the module, where each bit represents the debounced state of the corresponding bit in the `data_in` input.

Each bit of `data_in` has its corresponding counter which increments on every clock cycle when enabled. The width (`TIMEOUT_WIDTH`) and capacity of each counter ensures they can count up to the `TIMEOUT` value.\n- counter_reset: This wire array provides the reset condition for each bit's counter. It resets the respective counter to zero based on the `data_in` state and `POLARITY`. If `POLARITY` is \"HIGH\" and the bit of `data_in` is low, or if `POLARITY` is \"LOW\" and the bit of `data_in` is high, the corresponding counter is reset.\n- counter_enable: This wire array enables the counting for each counter based on the conditions dictated by the state of `data_in` and whether the counter value has reached the `TIMEOUT`. Counting only occurs if the current bit of `data_in` matches the expected stable state (according to `POLARITY`) and the counter has not yet reached the `TIMEOUT`. This control ensures the counter increments only when the signal is in the process of stabilizing."
