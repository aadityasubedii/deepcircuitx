Module name: ghrd_top. Module specification: The 'ghrd_top' module is a top-level FPGA design for integrating hardware interfaces and peripherals of an SoC in an FPGA environment. It manages connections for a variety of interfaces including DDR3 memory, Ethernet, USB, SPI, I2C, UART, and GPIO, as well as handling I/O for standard FPGA peripherals such as switches, LEDs, buttons, and providing VGA output. Input ports like `CLOCK_50`, and `HPS_ENET_RX_DATA` receive synchronization clocks and Ethernet data, while output ports such as `DRAM_ADDR` and `LEDR` manage memory addressing and LED Displays respectively. Internal signals like `hps_cold_reset` and `fpga_led_internal` manage the FPGA's reset logic and LED states. The code includes instances of subsystems like `soc_system` that interface directly with the hard processor system (HPS), handling complex tasks such as data transmissions and memory management. Edge detectors and reset controllers like `altera_edge_detector` and `hps_reset` control the timing and conditions for various reset operations, ensuring the system maintains correct operational states during runtime. This module acts as a comprehensive control center, coordinating between the HPS and FPGA fabric to ensure smooth operation and integration of embedded systems.
