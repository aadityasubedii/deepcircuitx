Module name: debounce. 
Module specification: The `debounce` module is designed to stabilize the input fluctuating signals across multiple data lines to ensure that they reflect consistent and valid logic states. It incorporates several parameters that configure data width, input polarity, and timeout settings. The input ports include `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset_n` (active-low reset to initialize counters), and `data_in` (digital input vector, monitored for signal stability). The output port, `data_out`, represents the debounced states of `data_in`. Internal signals such as `counter`, `counter_reset`, and `counter_enable` are utilized for counting the duration which each bit of `data_in` remains at a consistent logic level, resetting the counter, and enabling the count under certain conditions, respectively. The code is divided into sections, primarily structured around a `generate` block that creates multiple instances for each input bit according to the `WIDTH` parameter, handling debouncing logic individually per bit. Each instance includes combinational logic to set the output based on the counter reaching a timeout value predefined, influencing the output depending on the configured polarity. This module effectively ensures that each output bit in `data_out` only gets asserted when its corresponding `data_in` bit has been stable for a specified period, hence filtering out any transient changes or noise.
