    "module": "Module-level comment: The hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync module synchronizes an asynchronous active-low reset signal (`reset_n`) with a clock (`clk`). It uses a chain of flip-flops, determined by `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` and `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT`, to filter out glitches and stabilize the reset signal. The implementation involves a loop of conditional logic within flip-flops that handle signal propagation and synchronization, outputting a safe, glitch-free reset signal (`reset_n_sync`) for use in the same clock domain."
