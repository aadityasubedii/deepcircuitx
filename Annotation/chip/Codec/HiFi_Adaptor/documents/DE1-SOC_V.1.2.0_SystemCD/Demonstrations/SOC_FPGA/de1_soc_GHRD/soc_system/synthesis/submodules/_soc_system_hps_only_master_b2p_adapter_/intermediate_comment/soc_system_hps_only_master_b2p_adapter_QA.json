The in_ready flag at the input side is controlled by the out_ready flag at the output, allowing synchronization of readiness based on the output interface's status. The output signals (out_valid, out_data, out_startofpacket, and out_endofpacket) mirror the input signals (in_valid, in_data, in_startofpacket, and in_endofpacket) to pass the data packets through. However, if the in_channel value is greater than 0, the module deactivates the out_valid signal, effectively blocking the data transmission for those channel values."

When in_channel is greater than 0, out_valid is set to 0, indicating that no valid data is being transmitted out.
