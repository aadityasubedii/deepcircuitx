    "spec": "Module name: intr_capturer. \nModule specification: The \"intr_capturer\" is a parameterized Verilog module designed to handle and capture interrupt signals for system management. It accommodates a variable number of interrupt inputs, defined by the `NUM_INTR` parameter. The module's primary functionality involves capturing interrupt signals from a bus `interrupt_in` and storing them into the `interrupt_reg` register. Key input ports include `clk` (clock input for synchronization), `rst_n` (active-low reset for initializing internal states), `interrupt_in` (interrupt signals bus), `addr` (address input for segment selection), and `read` (control signal for enabling the data read process). The module outputs the read interrupt data through the `rddata` port, which holds a 32-bit wide value. Internal signals such as `interrupt_reg`, `readdata_with_waitstate`, `act_readdata`, `readdata_lower_intr`, and `readdata_higher_intr` facilitate the storage, masking, selection, and output of the interrupt data based on the address and read signals. Additional control signals `access_lower_32` and `access_higher_32` are used to determine the accessed segment of `interrupt_reg`. The module structure includes an initial block for handling the `interrupt_reg` updates, a conditional generate block to accommodate systems with more than 32 interrupts by introducing high interrupts handling, and logic to manage the output data queuing through `readdata_with_waitstate`.\nThis holistic approach allows `intr_capturer` module to perform efficient interrupt capturing and conditional data access in synchronous digital systems, making it adaptable to various interrupt configurations.",

It is parameterized by `NUM_INTR`, which specifies the number of interrupt inputs. The module reads these interrupts from the input `interrupt_in` and stores them in a register `interrupt_reg`. Depending on the address input (`addr`), the module allows selective access to either the lower 32 bits or the higher bits (for systems with more than 32 interrupts) of the `interrupt_reg`. The read operation, triggered by the `read` signal in conjunction with `addr`, determines which part of the register is accessed and outputs the relevant bits onto `rddata`. The data output incorporates a wait state managed by `readdata_with_waitstate`, which holds the read data synchronously until the next positive edge of the clock or a reset event. The dual-register handling is managed conditionally using a generate block for systems where interrupts exceed 32 lines."
