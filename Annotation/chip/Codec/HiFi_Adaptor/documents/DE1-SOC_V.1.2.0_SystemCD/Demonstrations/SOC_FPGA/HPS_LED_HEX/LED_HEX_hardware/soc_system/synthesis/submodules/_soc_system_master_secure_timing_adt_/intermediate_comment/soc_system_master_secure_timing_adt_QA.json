It receives an 8-bit input data (`in_data`) along with a valid signal (`in_valid`) and outputs an 8-bit data (`out_data`) once it is ready (`out_ready`) to accept new data. The module ensures the output validity (`out_valid`) directly corresponds to the input validity, essentially making it a pass-through mechanism for data under the provided control signals. Additionally, the module has a debug mechanism using a display call which triggers a message when the input readiness (`in_ready`) is deasserted, indicating a backpressure scenario where the upstream component cannot proceed due to downstream unavailability."

All sequential actions within the module occur in relation to the rising or falling edge of this clock signal.\n- reset_n: This is the active low reset signal. When asserted (low), it initializes or resets the module\u2019s internal states, preparing it for a standard operation cycle.\n- in_valid: This is a control signal which indicates whether the accompanying data on the \u2018in_data\u2019 line is valid. When high (true), it signals that the data can be correctly read and processed by the module.\n- in_data: This is an 8-bit input data line. It carries the actual data to be processed or passed through by the module.\n- out_ready: This is a control signal from the downstream component. When high (true), it indicates that the downstream component is ready to accept data, which affects the data flow control handling by this module.\n\nOutput ports: out_valid, out_data.\nExplanation:\n- out_valid: This is an output control signal that indicates the validity of the data presented on the \u2018out_data\u2019 line. It mirrors the state of the \u2018in_valid\u2019 to indicate that the output data is a legitimate reproduction of the input data, ensuring synchronous data validity between input and output.\n- out_data: This is an 8-bit output data line. It delivers the processed or transferred data to the next component in the data pipeline. The value on this line directly corresponds to the input data presented on \u2018in_data\u2019, as the module functions primarily in a pass-through mode."

It acts as a buffer or intermediary storage for the data coming into the module, ensuring that the data can be handled or manipulated internally without altering the original input directly.\n- out_payload: This is an 8-bit register used to temporarily hold the data before it is sent to the output (`out_data`). Like `in_payload`, it serves as a buffer or intermediary storage but for outgoing data, preparing it to be sent out once the module confirms readiness from the downstream component.\n- ready: This is a 1-bit register used to store and reflect the readiness (`out_ready`) of the downstream component to accept new data. It serves as an internal synchronization signal ensuring that the output control aligns with the downstream component\u2019s state.\n- in_ready: This is a single-bit signal derived from the `ready` register, indicating the readiness of the downstream component (mirrored by `out_ready`). It effectively determines if the module can proceed with data handling and transfer, ensuring proper flow control in response to backpressure or readiness signals from other components in the system."
