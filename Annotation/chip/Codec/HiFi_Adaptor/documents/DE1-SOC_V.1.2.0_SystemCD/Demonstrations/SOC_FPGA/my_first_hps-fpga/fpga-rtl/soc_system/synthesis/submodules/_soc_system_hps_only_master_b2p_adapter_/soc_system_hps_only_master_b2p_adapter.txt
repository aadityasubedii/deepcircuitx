Module-level comment: The `soc_system_hps_only_master_b2p_adapter` module transfers data while maintaining synchronization with a ready-valid handshake. It primarily passes input signals (`in_data`, `in_startofpacket`, `in_endofpacket`) to outputs when `in_valid` and `out_ready` are asserted. An internal `out_channel` signal suppresses `out_valid` if `in_channel` is greater than 0, effectively blocking data transfer based on channel conditions. This setup ensures data flows only under specific conditions, reflecting the status of input and output readiness directly.
