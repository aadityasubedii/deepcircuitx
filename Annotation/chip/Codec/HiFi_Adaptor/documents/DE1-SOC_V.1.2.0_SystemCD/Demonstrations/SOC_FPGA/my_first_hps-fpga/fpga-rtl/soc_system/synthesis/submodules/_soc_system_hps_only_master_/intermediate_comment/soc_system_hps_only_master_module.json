    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"soc_system_hps_only_master\" module serves as a master interface controller, managing data transactions between internal components. It synchronizes through input clocks and resets, handles data via master-specific read/write operations, and incorporates JTAG interfacing, FIFOs, byte-to-packet converters, and transaction handling blocks. These components collaboratively ensure efficient data flow and integrity across the system's interfaces."
