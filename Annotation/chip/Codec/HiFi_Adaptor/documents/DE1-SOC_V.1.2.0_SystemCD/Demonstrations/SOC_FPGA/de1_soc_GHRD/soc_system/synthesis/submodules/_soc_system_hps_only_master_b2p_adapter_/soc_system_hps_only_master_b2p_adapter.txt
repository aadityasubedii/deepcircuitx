Module-level comment: The `soc_system_hps_only_master_b2p_adapter` Verilog module serves as a data bridge, transferring packet-based data from input to output, synchronized by a clock. It maps input signals (validity, data, packet flags) directly to outputs, modulating `out_valid` based on `in_channel` to block data on specific conditions. This control flow is managed within a single combinational block, ensuring responsive data handling and status signaling based on readiness.
