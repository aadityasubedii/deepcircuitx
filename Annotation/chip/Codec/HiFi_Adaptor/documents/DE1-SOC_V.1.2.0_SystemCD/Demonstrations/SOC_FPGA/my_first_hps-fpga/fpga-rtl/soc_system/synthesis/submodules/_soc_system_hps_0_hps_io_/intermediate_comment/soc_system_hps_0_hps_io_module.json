    "module": "Module-level comment: The `soc_system_hps_0_hps_io` module serves as an interface wrapper, linking various peripheral interfaces to the FPGA's Hard Processor System (HPS). It organizes and simplifies connectivity through dedicated I/O ports for memory, Ethernet, USB, SPI, SDIO, UART, I2C, and GPIO, without internal signal processing. All connections are directly routed to a `border` submodule that maintains clean and structured signal pathways."
