Module name: hps_reset. Module specification: The 'hps_reset' is a Verilog module without defined internal logic, serving primarily as a template outline for input and output port declarations. It comprises two input ports and one output port; 'probe', 'source_clk', and 'source' respectively. The 'probe' input may be used for triggering operations (such as resetting mechanisms) contingent on external factors, while 'source_clk' is likely intended for synchronization purposes within the module. The 'source' output, a 3-bit wide bus, although not explicitly detailed, is presumably targeted at conveying status or control signals to other system elements based on internal module activities influenced by 'probe' inputs. The code does not specify any internal signals or intricate logic blocks, thus indicating that the module is a foundational structure awaiting further development for specified functionality.
