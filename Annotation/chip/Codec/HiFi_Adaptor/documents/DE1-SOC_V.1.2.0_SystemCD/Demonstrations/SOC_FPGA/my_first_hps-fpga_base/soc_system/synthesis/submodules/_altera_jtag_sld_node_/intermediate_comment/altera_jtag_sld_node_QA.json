Designed to connect to a virtual JTAG interface, it simulates a JTAG environment and provides outputs to various virtual states such as capture DR, shift DR, update DR, etc. This module is parameterized with attributes such as JTAG frequency, and supports selectively setting JTAG instructions and data modes for testing circuits at different levels (e.g., data, control, management). This is achieved through a series of tasks and procedures defined within the module that manage the setting and clearing of states as well as the shifting of bit and byte values through the JTAG interface based on the clock signal. When compiled for a real FPGA, specific sections of the code can be enabled or disabled to accommodate simulation versus actual hardware operation."
