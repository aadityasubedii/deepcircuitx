    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'soc_system_sysid_qsys' module outputs one of two predefined 32-bit values based on the input `address`. It uses combinational logic, with `readdata` set through an `assign` statement acting like a multiplexer. The `clock` and `reset_n` inputs are present but not functionally used in this purely combinational module. This module is simple yet effective for switching output between two constants based on a single-bit control signal."
