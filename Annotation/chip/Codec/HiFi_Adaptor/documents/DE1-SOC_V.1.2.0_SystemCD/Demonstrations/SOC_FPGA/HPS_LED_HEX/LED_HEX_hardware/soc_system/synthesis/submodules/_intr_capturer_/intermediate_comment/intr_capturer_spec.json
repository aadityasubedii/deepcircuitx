    "spec": "Module name: intr_capturer. Module specification: The intr_capturer is a Verilog module specifically designed to handle and manage up to 32 or more interrupt inputs. It captures and buffers the state of each interrupt input via the `interrupt_in` bus when the system is not in reset. The module operates with inputs including `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `rst_n` (active-low reset for initializing internal states), `interrupt_in` (bus carrying interrupt states), `addr` (address input determining which part of the interrupt data to access), and `read` (control input to enable data read operation). The output of the module `rddata` delivers the captured interrupt data depending on the accessed part. Internally, the module uses several signals: `interrupt_reg` for capturing the interrupts, `readdata_with_waitstate` which outputs the collected data after a synchronization wait state, `act_readdata` as the intermediate actual read data combiner, `readdata_lower_intr` and `readdata_higher_intr` representing respective interrupt data splits based on the address input, and control signals `access_lower_32` and `access_higher_32` which control the access to lower or higher parts of the interrupt data. The code implements conditional generation for systems with interrupts greater than 32 using Verilog generate blocks and contains sequential blocks for handling data on positives edges of the clock or during reset conditions. This structuring allows integration into systems with different interrupt configurations and ensures synchronized, reliable data output for interrupt status readings.",

It captures the state of each interrupt when the module is not in reset. The module supports accesses to read interrupt states through addresses and supports systems with more than 32 interrupts by splitting the interrupt register into lower and higher parts. Depending on the address accessed (either 0 or 1), it outputs the captured interrupt states for the lower 32 interrupts or any additional interrupts beyond the first 32. Therefore, it acts as a register interface that captures and outputs interrupt statuses based on specified addresses, encapsulating the handling of interrupt inputs and the reading of interrupt statuses."
