Module name: soc_system_mm_interconnect_0. Module specification: This module implements an interconnect system for a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, managing communication between various components. It has multiple input ports for AXI and Avalon master interfaces, including address, data, and control signals from HPS (Hard Processor System) and FPGA masters. Output ports include signals for slave interfaces like onchip memory, JTAG UART, interrupt capturer, and system ID. Internal signals handle routing, arbitration, and data conversion between different interfaces. The module consists of several sub-blocks including address routers, command and response crossbars, width adapters, burst adapters, and various multiplexers and demultiplexers. These components work together to manage address decoding, data width conversion, burst transactions, and arbitration between multiple masters accessing shared slaves. The interconnect supports different
