    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a DDR3 SDRAM memory controller for a Hard Processor System (HPS). It integrates a PLL for clock generation, a memory interface, a sequencer, a memory controller, on-chip termination, and a delay-locked loop. The module handles memory interface signals, timing, and control for DDR3 SDRAM operations, managing read/write operations, refresh cycles, and other memory-related tasks. It uses various submodules to handle different aspects of memory control and interfaces with external memory components through dedicated input, output, and bidirectional ports."
