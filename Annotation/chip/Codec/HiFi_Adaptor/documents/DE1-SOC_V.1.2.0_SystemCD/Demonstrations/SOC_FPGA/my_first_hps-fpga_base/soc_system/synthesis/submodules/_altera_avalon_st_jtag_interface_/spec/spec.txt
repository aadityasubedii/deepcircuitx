Module name: altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface. 

Module specification: The `altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface` is a Verilog module designed to facilitate JTAG communication using the Avalon streaming protocol. This module has several input ports: `clk` (clock signal providing the timing reference), `reset_n` (active-low reset signal for initializing or resetting the module), `source_ready` (indicating downstream readiness to accept data), `sink_data` (incoming data to be processed), and `sink_valid` (a flag indicating the validity of the incoming data). The output ports include `source_data` (data sent to downstream modules), `source_valid` (flag accompanying `source_data` to signal data validity), `sink_ready` (indicates module's readiness to accept more data), `resetrequest` (triggers a system reset), `debug_reset` (resets debugging logic), `mgmt_valid` (signals validity of management data), `mgmt_data` (carries management-specific data), and `mgmt_channel` (provides channel information for management communications). Internal signals like `clk`, `reset_n`, `source_data`, and others mirror their respective ports' roles, ensuring data flow and operational control within the module. The code features two main blocks determined by the `USE_PLI` parameter: the normal operational mode utilizing the `altera_jtag_dc_streaming` submodule for standard JTAG data communication, and the PLI simulation mode using the `altera_pli_streaming` submodule, designed mainly for simulation purposes with PLI port configurations. This design allows the module to adapt operationally based on compile-time configurations, suiting it for various application requirements in JTAG communications.
