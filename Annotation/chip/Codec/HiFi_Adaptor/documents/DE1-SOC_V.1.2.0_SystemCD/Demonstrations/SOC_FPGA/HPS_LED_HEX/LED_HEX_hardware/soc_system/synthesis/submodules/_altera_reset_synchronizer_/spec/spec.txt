Module name: altera_reset_synchronizer. Module specification: The 'altera_reset_synchronizer' is a Verilog module developed primarily for FPGA implementations to ensure the synchronization of an asynchronous reset signal ('reset_in') with a clock signal ('clk'). This functionality helps in preventing issues related to metastability by timing the reset correctly with respect to the clock signal. The module contains two input ports: 'reset_in', the asynchronous reset signal that can trigger a reset state, and 'clk', the clock signal used for synchronization. It provides one output port 'reset_out', which is the synchronized reset signal. Internally, the module uses two main signals: 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain', a shift register of length determined by the parameter 'DEPTH' for delaying and dissipating any metastability of the reset signal; and 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out', which holds the synchronized reset signal and is directly linked to the output 'reset_out'. The core logic is encapsulated within a conditional generate block that handles two cases based on the parameter 'ASYNC_RESET': if 'ASYNC_RESET' is set to 1, the module will react immediately to the 'reset_in' signal at the rising edge of either 'reset_in' or 'clk'; if 'ASYNC_RESET' is not set, the 'reset_in' will be synchronized strictly at the rising edge of 'clk'. This setup effectively tailors the synchronization mechanism to the specific needs of the system design, illustrating flexibility in handling asynchronous reset signals.
