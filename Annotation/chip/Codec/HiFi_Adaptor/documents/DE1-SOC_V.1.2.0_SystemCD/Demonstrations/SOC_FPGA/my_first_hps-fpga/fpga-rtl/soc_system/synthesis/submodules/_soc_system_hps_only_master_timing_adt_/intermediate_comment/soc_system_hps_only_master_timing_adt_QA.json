It accepts input data (`in_data`) and validates it (`in_valid`). The output data (`out_data`) is generated and simultaneously checked if the downstream component is ready to receive it (`out_ready`). The module ensures the correct timing and control of data flow across parts of a SoC, handling backpressure by signaling when the downstream component is not ready to accept more data. The module also uses an always block to depict a situation when there is a backpressure scenario, signaling through a simulation prompt when the downstream is not ready and thus cannot accept further data. This is crucial for avoiding data loss or overflow in real-time systems where timing and synchronization are critical."
