Module-level comment: The `soc_system_dipsw_pio` module handles edge-triggered interrupts from a 10-bit input port by monitoring changes and generating IRQs if appropriately unmasked. It features input and output command control through specific addressable registers and relies on double-latched signals for reliable edge detection. Command functionalities are segmented into initialization, conditional logic for interrupt masking, and data I/O handling, orchestrated with a constant clock and a reset mechanism for synchronization and setup.
