Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base` module implements a two-stage pipeline for data buffering in systems using the Altera Avalon streaming protocol. It handles data flow control through registers `full0`, `full1`, `data0`, and `data1`, preventing data loss and overflow. Configurable with `PIPELINE_READY`, it manages data transfer with optional registered feedback, ensuring timing resilience and operational flexibility.
