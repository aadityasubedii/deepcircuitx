Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface` module facilitates JTAG communication via the Avalon streaming protocol. Featuring input/output management and flow control mechanisms, it operates in two modes: a normal mode utilizing the `altera_jtag_dc_streaming` for standard operations and a PLI mode with `altera_pli_streaming` for simulation scenarios. With configurable parameters like FIFO sizes and management channels, the module adapts its behavior based on compile-time settings to suit various JTAG communication requirements efficiently.
