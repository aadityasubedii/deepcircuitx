Module-level comment: The `soc_system_hps_0_hps_io` module interfaces various SOC peripherals for an HPS. It routes I/O lines for DDR memory, Ethernet, USB, SPI, UART, SDIO, QSPI, and I2C via direct connections to the `border` submodule, which manages the detailed interfacing and signal control, effectively organizing the SOC's complex interactions and data flow without internal signal processing.
