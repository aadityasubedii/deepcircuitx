    "spec": "Module name: soc_system_pio_led. \nModule specification: The soc_system_pio_led is a Verilog module designed to manage LED operations through a programmable input/output (PIO) system. It leverages a 10-bit output port 'out_port' for showing the current LED state, and a 32-bit 'readdata' output for monitoring the state, zero-extended from 'out_port'. The module processes input signals including a 2-bit 'address' to select specific internal registers, 'chipselect' to enable operations within the module, 'clk' as a clock signal for timing, an active-low 'reset_n' for initialization, an active low 'write_n' as a write enable, and a 32-bit 'writedata' carrying the new data to be written. Internally, the module uses 'clk_en' set high for enabling clock-related operations (though directly unutilized), 'data_out' a 10-bit register storing the output LED state, and 'read_mux_out' which gates 'data_out' based on the address, contributing to forming 'readdata'. The code consists mainly of a combinational logic block for output assignments and a sequential block responding to clock edges and reset signal, handling the setting of 'data_out' during reset or upon valid write operations, and directing the current 'data_out' to 'out_port' and 'readdata'.",

It manages a 10-bit output port 'out_port' that reflects the current state of the PIO output led data. The module listens for write operations at a specific address and, if conditions match (chipselect active, write operation, and correct address), it updates the output data.

Reset functionality is also incorporated to set the output data to its maximum value upon reset."

Explanation: \n- `address`: A 2-bit input used to determine the specific register or location being accessed within the module. It helps in directing the read/write operations correctly.\n- `chipselect`: A signal that enables the module when it is active, allowing the module to respond to read and write operations.\n- `clk`: The clock signal required for triggering and timing the operations within the module; all sequential logic inside the module is synchronized to the edges of this clock.\n- `reset_n`: An active low reset signal that initializes or resets the module's state or data when asserted.\n- `write_n`: An active low write enable signal that allows data to be written into the module at the address specified, provided chipselect is active.\n- `writedata`: A 32-bit input data bus used to supply data to the module to be written to the output port if the conditions are met (write enable, chipselect active, specific address).\n\nOutput ports: [out_port, readdata]. Explanation:\n- `out_port`: A 10-bit output port reflecting the current state of data intended for external devices or systems, in this case, typically LED output. It shows the result of the written data under specified conditions.\n- `readdata`: A 32-bit output that provides the current state of the 10-bit data from `out_port`, zero-extended to 32 bits, available for reading operations. The data read back through this port depends on the input address and can be used for verification or monitoring purposes in a system incorporating this module."

This register is updated based on write operations when certain conditions are met (address is zero, chipselect is active, and write_n is inactive). It is also set to its maximum value (1023) upon a system reset.\n- `read_mux_out`: A 10-bit masked output of `data_out` based on the address input. It gates `data_out` through with the condition that the address should be zero; otherwise, it outputs zeros. This outcome is used to form the read data output `readdata` by zero-extending it to 32 bits."
