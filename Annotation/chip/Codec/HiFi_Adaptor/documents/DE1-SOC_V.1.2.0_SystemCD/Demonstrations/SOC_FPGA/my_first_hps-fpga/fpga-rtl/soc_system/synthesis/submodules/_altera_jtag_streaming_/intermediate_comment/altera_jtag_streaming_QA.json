It interfaces with source and sink data streams, applying transformations like idle removal and insertion, and is capable of various data handling states such as write, read, loopback, debug, and management through different input commands. Notably, it supports management tasks using an adjustable channel width, processes debug signals, and can handle multiple types of data transmission including direct, loopback, and debug, substantially aiding in device testing and configuration via JTAG."
