Module name: hps_sdram_p0_reset.
Module specification: The `hps_sdram_p0_reset` module is designed to manage synchronized reset signals across various clock domains specifically for an SDRAM subsystem on an FPGA. It handles resets for multiple components utilizing different clock inputs such as those for Advanced Front-Side Bus (AFI), address/command buses, and data strobe enabling. The key input ports include multiple clock signals (`pll_afi_clk`, `pll_addr_cmd_clk`, etc.), stability indicators (`seq_reset_mem_stable`, `pll_locked`), and reset signals (`global_reset_n`, `soft_reset_n`). Output ports provide synchronized reset signals (`reset_n_afi_clk`, `reset_n_addr_cmd_clk`, etc.) for these domains. Internally, signals like `phy_reset_n` and `phy_reset_mem_stable_n` are used to aggregate and condition the reset logic based on system stability and readiness states, ensuring accurate reset timings. The module is implemented with several instances of a submodule `hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync`, which perform the actual reset signal synchronization for each clock domain. The parameters like `MEM_READ_DQS_WIDTH` and `NUM_AFI_RESET` allow customization based on specific hardware configurations. Each clock domain reset logic is instantiated within a generate block for scalability and structured implementation, ensuring each part of the SDRAM subsystem is adequately reset under correct conditions. This structure guarantees that all resets are de-asserted simultaneously with the respective clocks, preventing metastability issues within the SDRAM system.
