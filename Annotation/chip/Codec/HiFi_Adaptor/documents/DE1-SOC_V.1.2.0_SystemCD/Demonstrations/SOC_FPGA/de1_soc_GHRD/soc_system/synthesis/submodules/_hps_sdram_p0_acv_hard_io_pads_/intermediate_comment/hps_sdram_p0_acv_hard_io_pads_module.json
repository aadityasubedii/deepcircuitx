    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_io_pads' module interfaces with SDRAM, facilitating signal interactions for operations such as address and data management through input/output ports and internal signal routing. It employs specialized submodules like 'hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_addr_cmd_pads' and 'hps_sdram_p0_altdqdqs' for handling address commands and bidirectional data, utilizing PLLs and various control signals to ensure synchronized, efficient memory access and data integrity."
