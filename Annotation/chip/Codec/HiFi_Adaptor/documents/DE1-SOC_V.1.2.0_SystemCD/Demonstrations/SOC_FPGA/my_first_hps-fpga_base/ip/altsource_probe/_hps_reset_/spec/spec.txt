Module name: hps_reset. 
Module specification: The `hps_reset` module is crafted to interface with an `altsource_probe` component, primarily serving to process a probe input signal under the guidance of a source clock. The module has two input ports: `probe`, which is used to input a signal that requires probing or analysis, and `source_clk`, the clock signal that handles the timing of the operations inside the module. The output of the module is a 3-bit bus `source`, derived from the `altsource_probe` component, functioning to provide status or control signals relevant to the processed input probe and clock signals. Internally, the module utilizes a wire `sub_wire0` as an intermediate connection that transfers the processed data from the `altsource_probe_component` to the `source` output. In terms of code organization, the module begins with standard time scale settings, followed by the declaration of ports and the essential internal wire. The `altsource_probe_component` is instantiated with various connections like `probe` and `source_clk`, along with numerous unconnected pins likely intended for advanced functionalities such as debugging or JTAG operations. Parameters are set for the component to handle metastability and define operational characteristics like probe width and source width. This module seems well-suited for applications where signal probing with clock synchronization is critical, especially in systems needing status monitoring or signal integrity analysis.
