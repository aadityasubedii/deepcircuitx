Module-level comment: The "altera_jtag_streaming" module manages JTAG-based data streaming, employing internal state machines to process various JTAG transactions. It effectively handles input/output operations through ports like `tck`, `reset_n`, `sink_data` and responds with `source_data`, managing synchronization across different clock domains and potentially extended management capabilities if configured. The implementation includes idle data inserters/removers and clock domain synchronizers to ensure stable and efficient data streaming operations.
