    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'soc_system_hps_only_master' module interfaces with a master device in an SoC, managing data transport and control between sub-modules and the master. It uses clocks, resets, data I/O ports, and internal buffers like FIFOs to process and transform byte streams into packet data, ensuring operations are parameter-checked for correctness. The design includes JTAG, adaptors for byte-packet conversions, and manages unit resets, optimizing data flow and error handling efficiently."
