    "module": "Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_generic_ddio` module handles DDR operations for SDRAM interfacing by processing wide input data (`datain`) using both half-rate and full-rate clocks (`clk_hr`, `clk_fr`). It employs three instances of `cyclonev_ddio_out` within a loop, first for generating intermediate phase data (`fr_data_hi`, `fr_data_lo`) and finally synthesizing the DDR output (`dataout`). The `halfratebypass` signal selectively bypasses the half-rate processing depending on system requirements, facilitating flexible data handling."
