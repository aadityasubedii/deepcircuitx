Module name: soc_system_mm_interconnect_1. Module specification: This module implements an interconnect system for a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, managing communication between a master device (likely a processor or DMA controller) and an AXI slave (possibly memory or peripherals). It supports AXI protocol features such as bursts, multiple channels, and different data widths. The module has input ports for clock, reset, master interface signals (address, data, control), and AXI slave interface signals (handshaking, data, responses). Output ports include AXI slave interface signals for address, data, and control channels, as well as master interface signals for wait requests and read data. Internally, the module uses various signals for address routing, command and response handling, data width adaptation, and arbitration. The code is structured into sections for master and slave agents, address routers, command and response
