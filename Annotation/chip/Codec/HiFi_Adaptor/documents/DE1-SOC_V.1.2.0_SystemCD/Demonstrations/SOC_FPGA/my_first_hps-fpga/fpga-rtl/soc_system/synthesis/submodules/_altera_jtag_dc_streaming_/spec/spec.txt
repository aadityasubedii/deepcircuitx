Module name: altera_jtag_dc_streaming. 
Module specification: The altera_jtag_dc_streaming module serves as an interface between JTAG-related data streams and system logic, including elements for synchronization and control. It manages streaming data, handles clock domain crossings between JTAG and system clocks, manages reset and debug signals, and accommodates for management data and channel control. The input ports include `clk` (system clock), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `sink_data` (data from system to JTAG), `sink_valid` (validity of sink data), and `sink_ready` (readiness of the JTAG to receive data). The output ports encompass `source_data` and `source_valid` (data and its validity flag from JTAG to the system), `resetrequest`, `debug_reset` (reset control for debugging), and `mgmt_data`, `mgmt_valid`, `mgmt_channel` (management data and signals). Internal signals such as `jtag_clock`, `jtag_clock_reset_n`, `jtag_source_data`, `jtag_source_valid`, `jtag_sink_data`, `jtag_sink_valid`, and `jtag_sink_ready` facilitate operations within different clock domains and synchronization purposes. The module consists of several internal blocks: synchronizers and crossers (like `altera_std_synchronizer`, `altera_jtag_streaming`, `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser`, `altera_jtag_src_crosser`) to manage the safe crossing of data between asynchronous clock domains and to ensure the integrity and stability of the data transmitted across these interfaces.
