    "spec": "Module name: debounce. \nModule specification: The `debounce` module is designed to stabilize the input fluctuating signals across multiple data lines to ensure that they reflect consistent and valid logic states. It incorporates several parameters that configure data width, input polarity, and timeout settings. The input ports include `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset_n` (active-low reset to initialize counters), and `data_in` (digital input vector, monitored for signal stability). The output port, `data_out`, represents the debounced states of `data_in`. Internal signals such as `counter`, `counter_reset`, and `counter_enable` are utilized for counting the duration which each bit of `data_in` remains at a consistent logic level, resetting the counter, and enabling the count under certain conditions, respectively. The code is divided into sections, primarily structured around a `generate` block that creates multiple instances for each input bit according to the `WIDTH` parameter, handling debouncing logic individually per bit. Each instance includes combinational logic to set the output based on the counter reaching a timeout value predefined, influencing the output depending on the configured polarity. This module effectively ensures that each output bit in `data_out` only gets asserted when its corresponding `data_in` bit has been stable for a specified period, hence filtering out any transient changes or noise.",

It features parameters that allow configuration of data width, input polarity, and timeout settings, which help in defining how long a signal must remain stable before it is considered as valid. The module works by using counters for each input bit. Each counter increments whenever the input line is active, as determined by the specified polarity and if the counter's current value is below a timeout threshold. If the counter reaches the timeout value and the input state persists, the corresponding output bit is set to a stable high or low value, based on the input polarity. The outputs are reset when the input toggles or when the reset signal is active."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: counter, counter_reset, counter_enable.\nExplanation:\n- **counter**: This is an array of registers, with each register corresponding to a bit of the input vector `data_in`. Each counter in this array has a width defined by `TIMEOUT_WIDTH`. These counters are used to track the duration for which each input bit remains at a consistent logic level. If a bit in the `data_in` remains high (or low, depending on the POLARITY) consistently for a duration equal to the TIMEOUT parameter, the counter's value is used to determine if the output should be toggled or remain stable.\n- **counter_reset**: This is an array of wires, each corresponding to a counter in the `counter` array. Based on the POLARITY and the current state of the corresponding `data_in` bit, these signals determine when to reset the counter to zero. If POLARITY is \"HIGH\", the counter for a bit is reset when that bit in `data_in` goes to zero, and vice versa for \"LOW\" polarity.\n- **counter_enable**: This is an array of wires that enables the counting for each bit's corresponding counter in the `counter` array. These are activated only when the `data_in` bit is consistent with the POLARITY and the current counter value is less than the TIMEOUT. This signal ensures that the counter does not exceed the TIMEOUT value, managing when the count should increment based on the input condition and the existing count on each channel."
