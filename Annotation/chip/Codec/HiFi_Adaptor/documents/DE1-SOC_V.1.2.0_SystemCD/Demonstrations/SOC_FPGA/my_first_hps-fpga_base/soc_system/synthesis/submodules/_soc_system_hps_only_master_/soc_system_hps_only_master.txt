Module-level comment: The "soc_system_hps_only_master" module manages data transmission in a SoC, coordinating data across different protocols and handling packet management. Its design includes input and output handlers for synchronization and data flow control, internal signals for data validation and management, and blocks for data transformation (FIFO, JTAG interface, packet converters) and reset control, ensuring robust, synchronized operations across system components.
