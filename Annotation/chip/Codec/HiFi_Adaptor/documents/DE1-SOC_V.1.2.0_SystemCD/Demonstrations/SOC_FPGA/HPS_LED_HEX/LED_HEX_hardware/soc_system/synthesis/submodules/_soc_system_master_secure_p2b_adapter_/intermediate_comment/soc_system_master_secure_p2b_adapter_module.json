    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'soc_system_master_secure_p2b_adapter' acts as a data pass-through, synchronizing input data and control signals such as start/end of packet flags to corresponding output and signal readiness. All output signals directly mirror input states based on the clock and readiness check, with `out_channel` statically set to channel 0, ensuring simple and effective single-channel data forwarding."
