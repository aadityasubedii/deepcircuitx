Module name: altera_jtag_dc_streaming. Module specification: The 'altera_jtag_dc_streaming' module is specifically designed for data streaming operations via a JTAG interface in FPGA environments. It synchronizes clocks between the system clock and JTAG clock, manages data via FIFOs, and ensures control signal coherence. Input ports include 'clk' (system clock), 'reset_n' (active-low reset signal), 'sink_data' (8-bit data input), 'sink_valid' (data validity signal), along with 'mgmt_valid', 'mgmt_channel', 'mgmt_data' for management. Output ports consist of 'source_data' (8-bit processed data output), 'source_valid' (output data validity), 'sink_ready' (module readiness signal), 'resetrequest' (reset request signal for external systems), 'debug_reset' (debug-specific reset control), and similar management signals as outputs. Internal signals such as 'jtag_clock' and 'jtag_clock_reset_n' handle JTAG clock operations, while 'jtag_source_data', 'jtag_source_valid', 'jtag_sink_data', 'jtag_sink_valid', and 'jtag_sink_ready' facilitate internal data flow and synchronization. There are several internal blocks: 'altera_std_synchronizer' for signal synchronization, 'altera_jtag_streaming' for managing JTAG based streaming and control, and 'altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser' and 'altera_jtag_src_crosser' that assist in crossing data and control signals between different clock domains. These components play crucial roles in maintaining efficient and reliable data transfer in FPGA-based systems, tailored to debugging or management scenarios.
