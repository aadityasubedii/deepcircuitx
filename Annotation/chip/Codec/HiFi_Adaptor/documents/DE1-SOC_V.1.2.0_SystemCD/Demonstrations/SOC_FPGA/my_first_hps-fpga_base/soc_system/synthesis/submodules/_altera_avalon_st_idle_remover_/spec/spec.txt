Module name: altera_avalon_st_idle_remover.
Module specification: The `altera_avalon_st_idle_remover` module is designed to process an 8-bit incoming data stream, specifically to remove idle characters coded as 0x4A and handle escape characters coded as 0x4D in the data. Turning to its ports, it has an input clock (`clk`) and an active low reset (`reset_n`) to initialize or reset internal states. Data is received through `in_data`, with `in_valid` indicating if the current data is ready to be processed. Output readiness is communicated through `out_ready`, managing data flow to prevent congestion. The module outputs the processed data via `out_data` and signals this with `out_valid`. The readied state for new incoming data is shown by `in_ready`. Internally, `received_esc` is a register marking the presence of an unhandled escape character, while `escape_char` and `idle_char` are wires detecting the current escape and idle characters, respectively. The functional blocks include: Detection logic for escape and idle characters, and a sequential logic control block maintaining the state of `received_esc`, determining if an unprocessed escape character precedes the current data byte, which would require special handling (XOR with 0x20). The combination logic block outputs the conditioned data and signals when the data is valid, ensuring the idle characters are removed and escape characters properly transformed. This module effectively streamlines data transmission by conditioning the data stream according to predefined character controls and readiness signals, maintaining synchronization and flow control.
