    "module": "Module-level comment: The hps_sdram_p0_clock_pair_generator module generates differential clock pairs for SDRAM systems on FPGAs. It uses a single-bit input `datain` to produce outputs `dataout` and `dataout_b` through internal buffers (`cyclonev_io_obuf`) and a pseudo differential output block (`cyclonev_pseudo_diff_out`). These components ensure reduced EMI and high signal integrity by controlling signal driving and enabling mechanisms within the module, crucial for stable SDRAM operation."
