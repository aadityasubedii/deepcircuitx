Module-level comment: The `altera_pli_streaming` module manages data streaming between JTAG and PLI interfaces, adaptable for external system communications or testing. It operates through input (`clk`, `reset_n`, `source_ready`, `sink_valid`, `sink_data`) and output ports (`source_valid`, `source_data`, `sink_ready`, `resetrequest`) to control data flow and system states. Key operations are governed by internal signals handling JTAG and PLI specific data states and synchronization, with conditional transaction handling within a clock-driven block and PLI-JTAG integration via `altera_jtag_dc_streaming` instance. Designed for robust interconnectivity and streamlining communication protocols in hardware testing setups.
