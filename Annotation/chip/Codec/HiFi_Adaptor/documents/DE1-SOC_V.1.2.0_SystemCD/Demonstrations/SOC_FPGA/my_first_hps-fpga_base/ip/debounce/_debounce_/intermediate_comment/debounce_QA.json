It stabilizes the input signal by implementing a timeout mechanism for each bit of the input signal. If a signal on a particular bit of `data_in` maintains a consistent logic level (high or low, based on `POLARITY`) long enough to reach a predetermined count (`TIMEOUT`), the module outputs a stabilized high or low signal on the corresponding bit of `data_out`. Each bit of the input signal has an individual counter (`counter`) with specific enable (`counter_enable`) and reset (`counter_reset`) conditions based on the input signal state and the `POLARITY`. The module is parameterizable, allowing adjustments to signal width, polarity, and the required stable time. The module operates on positive clock edges and can asynchronously reset on a negative edge of `reset_n`."

It triggers the operation of the counters within the debounce mechanism, ensuring that the module operations are synchronized with the system clock.\n- reset_n: This is the active-low asynchronous reset input. It allows the module to reset the counters to zero, effectively restarting the debouncing process.\n- data_in: This is the digital input signal array that the module debounces. It comes in a bus with a width defined by the parameter `WIDTH`. Each bit of this input is individually processed to filter out noise and stabilize the signal.\n\nOutput ports: data_out.\nExplanation:\n- data_out: This is the output signal array of the module, where each bit represents the debounced state of the corresponding bit in the `data_in` input. The bit width of this output matches that of `data_in`, determined by `WIDTH`. Each bit in `data_out` shows a stable version of the respective input bit after a defined timeout period."

Each bit of `data_in` has its corresponding counter which increments on every clock cycle when enabled. The width (`TIMEOUT_WIDTH`) and capacity of each counter ensures they can count up to the `TIMEOUT` value.\n- counter_reset: This wire array provides the reset condition for each bit's counter. It resets the respective counter to zero based on the `data_in` state and `POLARITY`. If `POLARITY` is \"HIGH\" and the bit of `data_in` is low, or if `POLARITY` is \"LOW\" and the bit of `data_in` is high, the corresponding counter is reset.\n- counter_enable: This wire array enables the counting for each counter based on the conditions dictated by the state of `data_in` and whether the counter value has reached the `TIMEOUT`. Counting only occurs if the current bit of `data_in` matches the expected stable state (according to `POLARITY`) and the counter has not yet reached the `TIMEOUT`. This control ensures the counter increments only when the signal is in the process of stabilizing."
