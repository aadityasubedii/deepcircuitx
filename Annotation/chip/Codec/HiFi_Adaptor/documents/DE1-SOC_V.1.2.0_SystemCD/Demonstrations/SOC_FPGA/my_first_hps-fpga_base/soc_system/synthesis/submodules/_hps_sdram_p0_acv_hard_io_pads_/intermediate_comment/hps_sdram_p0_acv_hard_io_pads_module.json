    "module": "Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_io_pads` module interfaces with SDRAM by managing input/output signals for address, command, and data paths. It employs PLL clocks for synchronization, OCT for signal integrity, and is segmented into sub-modules for address/command pads and data handling, ensuring precise timing and data flow controls for reliable memory operation."
