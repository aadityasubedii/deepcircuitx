    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements an SDRAM memory controller for a Hard Processor System (HPS). It manages communication between the processor and SDRAM by handling timing, addressing, and data transfer. The module integrates PLL, DLL, and OCT components for clock management, signal timing, and signal integrity. It uses internal AFI signals for memory control and configuration signals for the hard PHY layer. The controller supports multiple ports, priorities, and various SDRAM configurations, providing a flexible interface for SDRAM operations."
