It accepts wide input data (`datain`), processes it through instances of the `cyclonev_ddio_out` submodule in both half-rate and full-rate configurations, and outputs processed data (`dataout`). The input data is taken in phased chunks (hi and lo) and is processed using high and low clock phases (`clk_hr` for half rate and `clk_fr` for full rate) to produce the desired output. This operation is useful in systems where data transfer rates need to be effectively doubled by transmitting on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal. The `halfratebypass` signal allows bypassing the half-rate processing path when enabled."

Each input bit group is divided into hi and lo phases within the processing blocks.\n- `halfratebypass` is a control signal which, when enabled (high), allows the data to bypass the half-rate processing logic, influencing how the `datain` is processed in relation to the clock signals.\n- `clk_hr` and `clk_fr` are clock input ports for half-rate and full-rate operations, respectively. `clk_hr` is used to operate the initial stages of DDR (Double Data Rate) processing in the module, while `clk_fr` is employed for the final output stage. These clocks control the timing of data capture and output on their respective edges.\n\nOutput ports: [dataout]. \nExplanation: \n- `dataout` is the output data port of the module, where the processed data is sent out, with its width being equal to the parameter WIDTH. The data at this port represents the result of the DDR operations performed within the module, ready to be used or interfaced with further stages or components in a system, particularly for SDRAM interfacing applications.
