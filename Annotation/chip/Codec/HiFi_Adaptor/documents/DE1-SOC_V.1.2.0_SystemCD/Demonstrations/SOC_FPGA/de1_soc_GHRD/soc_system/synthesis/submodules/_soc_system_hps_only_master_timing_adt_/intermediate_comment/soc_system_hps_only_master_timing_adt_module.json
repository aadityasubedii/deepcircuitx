    "module": "Module-level comment: This Verilog module, soc_system_hps_only_master_timing_adt, synchronizes data transfers with timing constraints in SoC environments. It buffers and transfers 8-bit data based on flow control signals like `in_valid` and `out_ready`. It uses internal registers (`in_payload`, `out_payload`, `ready`, `in_ready`) and `always` blocks to handle data buffering, output readiness, and debug backpressure issues, ensuring timely and accurate data synchronization between SoC components."
