It captures the state of each interrupt when the module is not in reset. The module supports accesses to read interrupt states through addresses and supports systems with more than 32 interrupts by splitting the interrupt register into lower and higher parts. Depending on the address accessed (either 0 or 1), it outputs the captured interrupt states for the lower 32 interrupts or any additional interrupts beyond the first 32. Therefore, it acts as a register interface that captures and outputs interrupt statuses based on specified addresses, encapsulating the handling of interrupt inputs and the reading of interrupt statuses."
