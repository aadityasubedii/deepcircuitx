    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_packets_to_bytes` module converts packet data into a serialized byte stream, managing packet boundaries and escape sequences. It handles inputs with start/end packet indicators and channels, outputting valid data streams on the change of signals. It uses flags for escapes, boundaries, and channel differentiation, processing through condition checks combined within sequential logic blocks, ensuring data integrity in transmission while adhering to specified encoding and channel configurations."
