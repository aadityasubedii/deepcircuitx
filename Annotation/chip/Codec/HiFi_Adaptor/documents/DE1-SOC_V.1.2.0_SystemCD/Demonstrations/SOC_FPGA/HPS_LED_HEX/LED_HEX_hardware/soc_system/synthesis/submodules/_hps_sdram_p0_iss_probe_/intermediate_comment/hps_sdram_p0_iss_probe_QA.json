This module allows the user to monitor the behavior of signals (`probe_input`), ranging in width as defined by the `WIDTH` parameter. The functionality primarily seems to be centered around facilitating the observation and possibly manipulation of the probe signals during runtime, which can be critical for debug purposes in complex FPGA designs. The various parameters and settings within the module configure how the probing is handled regarding stability, indexing, and initial conditions, though actual connections to many of the altsource_probe instance's ports are left undefined in this snippet."

This array of signals is then passed to an internal instance of `altsource_probe`, where they can be used for debugging purposes. \n\nOutput ports: None explicitly defined in the provided code snippet.\nExplanation: The code snippet does not show any explicitly defined output ports in the module. Instead, the focus is on probing the input signals for observation and potential manipulation through a debugging interface.
