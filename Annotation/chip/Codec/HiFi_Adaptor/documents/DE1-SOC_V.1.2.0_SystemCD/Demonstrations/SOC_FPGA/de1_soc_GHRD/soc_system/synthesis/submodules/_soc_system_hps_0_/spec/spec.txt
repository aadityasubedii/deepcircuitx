Module name: soc_system_hps_0. Module specification: This module serves as an interface layer in a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, facilitating communication between FPGA logic and a Hard Processor System (HPS). It features numerous input and output ports for various interfaces, including AXI buses (f2h, h2f, and h2f_lw), memory interfaces, and multiple I/O interfaces such as EMAC, QSPI, SDIO, USB, SPI, UART, I2C, and GPIO. The module doesn't define any internal signals, instead routing external connections directly to two sub-modules: soc_system_hps_0_fpga_interfaces and soc_system_hps_0_hps_io. It includes parameter checks for F2S_Width and S2F_Width to ensure correct instantiation.
