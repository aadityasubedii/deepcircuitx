Module-level comment: The "altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface" module implements a JTAG interface for data streaming in Altera FPGAs. It handles data transmission between source and sink via parameters-controlled channels and supports both regular and PLI-based operations. This module comprises two primary blocks, 'normal' for direct streaming and 'pli_mode' for PLI simulations, controlled by configurable parameters such as FIFO sizes and channel width, facilitating versatile data management and debugging functionalities.
