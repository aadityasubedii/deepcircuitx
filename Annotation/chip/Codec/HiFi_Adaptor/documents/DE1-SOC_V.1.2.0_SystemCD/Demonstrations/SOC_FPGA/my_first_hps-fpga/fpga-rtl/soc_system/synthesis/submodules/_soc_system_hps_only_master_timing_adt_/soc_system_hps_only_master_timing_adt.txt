Module-level comment: The `soc_system_hps_only_master_timing_adt` module manages data synchronization and flow control in SoC, ensuring safe data transfer across components. It uses input and output ports for data and signals, internal registers for interim storage, and always blocks for data handling and readiness checks. This module monitors readiness, handles backpressure, and transfers data only when downstream components are ready, preventing data loss.
