Module-level comment: The 'altera_edge_detector' module detects edges (rising or falling) on an input signal 'signal_in' and outputs a pulse on 'pulse_out'. It employs a finite state machine (FSM) with states IDLE, ARM, and CAPT, and uses parameters like 'PULSE_EXT' to extend pulse duration and 'EDGE_TYPE' for edge selection. Pulse generation varies by 'PULSE_EXT': using a shift register for extending pulses or a single flip-flop for immediate pulses. Reset conditions are managed based on 'IGNORE_RST_WHILE_BUSY', ensuring robust operation.
