Module name: soc_system_mm_interconnect_1. Module specification: This module implements an interconnect component for a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, facilitating communication between an HPS (Hardware Processor System) and a master component. It manages AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface) transactions, supporting both read and write operations with separate channels. The module has numerous input and output ports for AXI slave interface signals, clock and reset signals, and master interface signals. Internal signals handle communication between subcomponents, including master translator signals, agent signals, and various routing, demuxing, and width adaptation signals. The module consists of several key blocks: address routers, width adapters, command and response demultiplexers, multiplexers, and a traffic limiter. These components work together to manage data routing, protocol conversions, arbitration, and data width adaptations between different interfaces.
