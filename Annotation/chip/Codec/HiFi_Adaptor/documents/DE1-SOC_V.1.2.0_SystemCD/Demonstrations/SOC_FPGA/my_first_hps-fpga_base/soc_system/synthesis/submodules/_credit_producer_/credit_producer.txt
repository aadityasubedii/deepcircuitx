Module-level comment: The "credit_producer" module dynamically generates credits for symbols and packets in data streams. It uses inputs such as clk, reset_n, in_valid, in_ready, and in_endofpacket, with outputs like symbol_credits and packet_credits. Conditions are managed via internal signals, including beat detections and end-of-packet flag checks. Symbol credits are computed either directly per beat or through accumulative counts, and packet credits increase on packet completion detections. The module is highly configurable with parameters controlling credit generation strategies.
