Module-level comment: The "altera_jtag_sld_node" module is designed for JTAG testing and debugging of Altera FPGAs, interfacing with virtual JTAG environments. It employs input ports (`ir_out`, `tdo`) for JTAG instructions and output feedback, and output ports (`ir_in`, `tck`, `tdi`, and various virtual state signals) to control JTAG operations. Inside, tasks handle state transitions and data shifts using internal signals like `simulation_clock` and `sdrs` to emulate or perform actual test actions, effectively managing JTAG scans tailored to specific modes and configurations.
