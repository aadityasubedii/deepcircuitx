Module-level comment: The "altera_jtag_streaming" module handles JTAG data streaming, performing synchronization, encoding, and manipulation of data streams for test environments. It manages input/output data through ports such as 'tck', 'reset_n', and 'source_data', and utilizes internal TAP-related signals (e.g., 'ir_out', 'tdo') and state machines for secure data shifts and commands processing. Key features include idle data management, clock synchronization, and dynamic operational mode adaptation. The design ensures efficient and accurate JTAG communication and control.
