    "spec": "Module name: intr_capturer. \n\nModule specification: The intr_capturer module is designed to handle and register multiple interrupt signals using a parameterizable number, NUM_INTR. It employs a clock signal (**clk**) to synchronize operations, and an active-low reset (**rst_n**) to initialize the module's state. Input interrupts are received on the **interrupt_in** bus, and their states are captured in the **interrupt_reg** register. The module supports reading the status of these interrupts via a 32-bit output, **rddata**, which is determined by an address input (**addr**) and a read enable signal (**read**). Internally, the module utilizes several key signals: **readdata_with_waitstate** delays output data for synchronization; **act_readdata** merges interrupt data from potential multiple registers; **readdata_lower_intr** and **readdata_higher_intr** hold interrupt states for different segments. The **access_lower_32** and **access_higher_32** signals determine which segment of interrupt data is accessible based on the **addr** input. The Verilog code includes a generate block that adjusts the logic based on NUM_INTR, enabling support for either one or two interrupt register sets, highlighting the module's adaptability to different requirements. This structure ensures effective read operations and status management across varying numbers of interrupts, making the module versatile within broader digital systems.",

It takes multiple interrupt inputs (up to a specified number, NUM_INTR), and outputs a 32-bit read data based on the interrupt register states. The module operates with a clock and a reset signal. Depending on the value of NUM_INTR, it handles interrupts either within a single 32-bit register or split between two registers (one for lower 32 interrupts and another for any higher). The output read data changes with the read command and address input, providing the state of requested interrupt bits. This allows external systems to read the status of interrupts effectively, facilitating condition handling or diagnostics in a broader system."
