Module name: altera_reset_controller.

Module specification: The `altera_reset_controller` is a Verilog module designed primarily for Altera/Intel FPGAs to manage and synchronize multiple reset and reset request signals. It inputs up to sixteen reset signals (`reset_in0` to `reset_in15`) and sixteen reset request signals (`reset_req_in0` to `reset_req_in15`), along with a clock signal (`clk`). These reset signals are combined into a single merged reset signal (`merged_reset`), while the reset request signals are merged into a single reset request signal (`merged_reset_req_in`) through configurable parameters that dictate which reset request inputs are active. The module outputs two signals: `reset_out`, the synchronized reset output, and `reset_req`, the synchronized reset request output.

Within the module, several internal signals play crucial roles: `reset_out_pre` and `reset_req_pre` act as intermediate stages before the final output signals. Depending on the configuration (`OUTPUT_RESET_SYNC_EDGES` and `RESET_REQUEST_PRESENT`), these signals might go through additional synchronization stages handled by instances of another module, `altera_reset_synchronizer`. Furthermore, synchronization and stable operation are ensured using internal shift register chains like `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain` and `r_sync_rst_chain`, which help in debouncing and aligning the reset signals to the clock.

The code includes several `generate` blocks that conditionally instantiate synchronization logic based on parameters such as `OUTPUT_RESET_SYNC_EDGES` and whether reset requests are considered (`RESET_REQUEST_PRESENT`). The module efficiently handles different scenarios including the absence of reset requests, adaptation of reset request handling, and handling edge behaviors for reset synchronization. This flexible yet robust approach allows for reliable reset operations across various components within FPGA-based digital systems, tailored to specific timing and functional requirements.
