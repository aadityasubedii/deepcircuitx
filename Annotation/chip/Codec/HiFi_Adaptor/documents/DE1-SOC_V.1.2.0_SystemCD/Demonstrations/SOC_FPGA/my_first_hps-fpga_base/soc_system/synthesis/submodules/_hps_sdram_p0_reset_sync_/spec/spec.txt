Module name: hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync. 

Module specification: The `hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync` module is designed to synchronize an asynchronous active-low reset signal (`reset_n`) with a system clock signal (`clk`) to ensure stable and reliable operation in digital hardware designs, particularly avoiding metastability. The module features two primary input ports: `reset_n`, which receives the asynchronous reset signal, and `clk`, the system clock that drives the synchronization process. It outputs a synchronized reset signal through the `reset_n_sync` port, which is a stable reset signal aligned with the clock cycles, created to mitigate risks of metastability. Internally, the module utilizes a register array named `reset_reg`, configured as a shift register with multiple stages defined by the sum of `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` and `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT` minus two. This register array helps in step-by-step synchronization of the input reset signal by capturing and holding the state from the previous stage on each positive clock edge, ultimately outputting the synchronized reset through the last stage of the register. The Verilog code structure includes a generate block which programmatically creates multiple instances of synchronization stages, essential for adjusting the depth of the synchronization chain (`RESET_SYNC_STAGES`) and handling multiple outputs (`NUM_RESET_OUTPUT`). Special FPGA attributes are applied to `reset_reg` to optimize synchronization performance and safety. The output port `reset_n_sync` is directly assigned from specific slices of `reset_reg`, based on configured parameters, ensuring that the output reset signal is both synchronized and adheres to system specifications.
