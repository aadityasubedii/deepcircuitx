Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base` module manages efficient data buffering and flow control between FPGA pipeline stages using Avalon streaming interface. It uses dual registers (`data0`, `data1`) and status flags (`full0`, `full1`) to control data processing based on input (`in_valid`, `in_data`) and output (`out_ready`) signals. Conditionally adds additional buffering and control when `PIPELINE_READY` is set, enhancing throughput and synchronization among stages.
