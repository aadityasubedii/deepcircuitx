Module-level comment: The "hps_reset" Verilog module interfaces with hardware probes, processing input signals synchronized by 'source_clk' to produce a 3-bit output 'source'. It employs the 'altsource_probe' component for signal manipulation and stabilization, using internal wire 'sub_wire0' to relay the component's output to the main output port, facilitating reliable debugging and monitoring in hardware environments.
