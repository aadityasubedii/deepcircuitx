Module name: altera_avalon_packets_to_master. Module specification: This module converts packets into Avalon-MM master transactions, supporting both incremental and non-incremental read/write operations. It has input ports for clock (clk), reset (reset_n), input data (in_valid, in_data, in_startofpacket, in_endofpacket), and Avalon-MM interface signals (readdata, waitrequest, readdatavalid). Output ports include packet interface signals (in_ready, out_valid, out_data, out_startofpacket, out_endofpacket) and Avalon-MM master signals (address, read, write, byteenable, writedata). Internal signals manage data flow between packet and FIFO interfaces (fifo_readdata, fifo_read, fifo_empty, fifo_writedata, fifo
