Module specification: The 'soc_system_sysid_qsys' module is designed to output one of two predefined 32-bit values based on a single-bit input `address`. This takes place in a combinational logic manner without any state being maintained or any direct dependency on the `clock` or `reset_n` signals. The module possesses one input signal, `address`, that decides whether the output `readdata` will be `1389960742` (when `address` is high) or `2899645186` (when `address` is low). The `clock` signal, though typically crucial in sequential logic, here does not influence the behavior directly due to the purely combinational logic of the module. Likewise, the `reset_n`, an active-low reset signal, is not functionally utilized in this module. Meanwhile, the output, `readdata`, is a 32-bit output that serves to convey the result of the logic based on the `address` input. Internally, `readdata` is implemented as a wire and assigned a value through an `assign` statement that acts like a multiplexer, switching between two constants depending on the state of `address`. This assignment is the primary functional block of the code, which succinctly fulfills the module's purpose without additional complexities.",
