Module-level comment: This module implements an interconnect system for a SoC design, facilitating communication between a master device and an AXI slave. It handles AXI protocol features, data width adaptation, and arbitration. The module uses agents, routers, and crossbars to manage address routing, command/response handling, and data transfer. It supports multiple channels, bursts, and different data widths, ensuring efficient data flow between master and slave interfaces.
