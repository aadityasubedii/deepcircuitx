Module name: hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_memphy. Module specification: This module is a memory PHY (physical layer) interface for an SDRAM controller, likely designed for use in a Cyclone V FPGA or HPS (Hard Processor System). It manages low-level signaling between the memory controller and SDRAM chips, handling address/command signals, data read/write operations, and various timing and calibration functions. The module has numerous input ports for control signals, configuration parameters, and data to be written to memory, as well as output ports for read data, status signals, and memory interface signals. Key inputs include reset signals, PLL signals, and AFI (AMBA Flash Interface) signals, while outputs include data read from memory, calibration status, and SDRAM control signals. Internal signals are used for DDIO (Double Data Rate I/O) operations, reset control
