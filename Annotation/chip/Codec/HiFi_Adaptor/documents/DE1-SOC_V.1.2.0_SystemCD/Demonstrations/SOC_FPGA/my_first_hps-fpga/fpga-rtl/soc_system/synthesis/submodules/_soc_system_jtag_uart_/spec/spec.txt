Module name: soc_system_jtag_uart.
Module specification: The "soc_system_jtag_uart" module simulates a JTAG UART communication interface tailored for FPGA or ASIC systems. This module manages UART transactions, including data transmission and reception. It interfaces with internal FIFOs to handle buffer states and utilizes interrupt handlers based on FIFO status. Input ports include `av_address`, `av_chipselect`, `av_read_n`, `av_write_n`, `av_writedata`, `clk`, and `rst_n`, facilitating address-based data management, read/write operations, and system synchronization. Output ports, such as `av_irq`, `av_readdata`, `av_waitrequest`, `dataavailable`, and `readyfordata`, provide status flags and data handling to external controllers. The module leverages internal signals like `fifo_AE`, `fifo_AF`, and `activity` to monitor and manage FIFO states and operational activity. The Verilog code is structured into several sections, each handling different aspects of the interface. Important sections include simulation of read/write operations, FIFO management, interrupt handling, and data transfer logic. These consolidated functions enable robust data communication management within hardware designs that incorporate UART features.
