    "module": "Module-level comment: The soc_system_hps_only_master_b2p_adapter module interfaces different system components, managing data transfer and signal integrity. It uses input readiness and validity signals, mirroring data and packet boundary indicators from input to output. Internally, it uses `out_channel` to deactivate `out_valid` when `in_channel` exceeds zero, ensuring selective data propagation based on channel specifications. The module synchronizes data flow using an always block for seamless operation."
