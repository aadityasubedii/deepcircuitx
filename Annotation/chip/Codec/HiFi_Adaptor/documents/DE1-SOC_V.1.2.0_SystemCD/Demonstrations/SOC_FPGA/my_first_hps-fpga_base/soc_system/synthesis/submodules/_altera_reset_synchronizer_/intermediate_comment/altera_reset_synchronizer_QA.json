The module utilizes a shift register of configurable depth (parameter `DEPTH`) to delay the reset signal, effectively debouncing it over several clock cycles. Depending on the configuration parameter `ASYNC_RESET`, it can handle either asynchronous or synchronous reset inputs, loading the register with ones upon an active reset signal in the former case, or shifting based on the input reset signal in the latter case. The output `reset_out` is a synchronized version of the input `reset_in`, stabilized across the specified `DEPTH` of the synchronization chain."
