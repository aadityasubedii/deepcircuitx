Module name: hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync. 
Module specification: The hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync is a Verilog module designed to synchronize an asynchronous reset signal, `reset_n`, with a clock, `clk`, eliminating metastability issues in clock domain crossing setups. The module takes two input ports: `reset_n`, the asynchronous reset signal, and `clk`, the clock signal driving the synchronization process. The `reset_n` input is critical for initializing or resetting the module, while `clk` acts as the timing pulse. The output port, `reset_n_sync`, delivers a stable reset signal synchronized with the clock domain, ensuring safe integration with other system components sharing the clock signal. Internally, the module utilizes an array register `reset_reg`, constructed of several stages defined by `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` and `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT`, which are utilized to buffer the reset signal through multiple flip-flop stages, thereby filtering and stabilizing it before itâ€™s outputted. The Verilog code leverages a `generate` block with a loop inside to dynamically create these flip-flop stages based on parameterization, ensuring flexible and scalable reset synchronization. Each stage of the flip-flops, configured within this block, captures and forwards the reset state based on clock edges, ultimately producing the `reset_n_sync` output after sufficient buffering to prevent any metastability.
