Module name: soc_system_pio_led. 
Module specification: The soc_system_pio_led is a Verilog module designed to manage LED operations through a programmable input/output (PIO) system. It leverages a 10-bit output port 'out_port' for showing the current LED state, and a 32-bit 'readdata' output for monitoring the state, zero-extended from 'out_port'. The module processes input signals including a 2-bit 'address' to select specific internal registers, 'chipselect' to enable operations within the module, 'clk' as a clock signal for timing, an active-low 'reset_n' for initialization, an active low 'write_n' as a write enable, and a 32-bit 'writedata' carrying the new data to be written. Internally, the module uses 'clk_en' set high for enabling clock-related operations (though directly unutilized), 'data_out' a 10-bit register storing the output LED state, and 'read_mux_out' which gates 'data_out' based on the address, contributing to forming 'readdata'. The code consists mainly of a combinational logic block for output assignments and a sequential block responding to clock edges and reset signal, handling the setting of 'data_out' during reset or upon valid write operations, and directing the current 'data_out' to 'out_port' and 'readdata'.
