Module-level comment: The `soc_system_led_pio` module is designed to control LEDs on a SoC, interfacing via signals like address, chipselect, and writedata. It includes an internal register `data_out` for LED state, updated on specified write conditions and directly mapped to `out_port`. Read operations are handled via `readdata`, outputting the state of `data_out` padded to 32 bits. Operations are synchronized with a system clock and reset integration.
