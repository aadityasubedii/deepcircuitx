It accepts input data (`in_data`) and a validation signal (`in_valid`) and outputs this data (`out_data`) with a matching validation signal (`out_valid`) when the downstream component is ready (`out_ready`). The module features registers for internal payload storage (`in_payload`, `out_payload`) and for synchronizing readyness signals (`ready`, `in_ready`).

It acts as an immediate storage for the output readiness signal, allowing other always blocks to react accordingly based on its state.\n- `in_ready`: A signal to hold the state of readiness for input data processing.
