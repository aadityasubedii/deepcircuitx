Module-level comment: The `altera_reset_controller` module aggregates up to 16 reset and reset request inputs, synchronizing them to produce a unified reset and reset request output. It utilizes internal signals for merging inputs and chains for synchronization, controlled by parameters to manage signal stability and response timing. The design adapts via configurable blocks, based on input conditions and reset synchronization requirements, ensuring flexible and stable reset operations across various system configurations.
