It uses special signaling characters to determine the start and end of a packet, and handles other control signals for escaping and channel identification. The module operates based on input and output readiness and validates signals to manage the data flow effectively. It also conditionally processes channel data based on the given parameter settings, either treating incoming bytes as simple data or as commands for control or configuration. This allows the module to be flexible in different data communication environments where packet formatting and channel tagging are required."
