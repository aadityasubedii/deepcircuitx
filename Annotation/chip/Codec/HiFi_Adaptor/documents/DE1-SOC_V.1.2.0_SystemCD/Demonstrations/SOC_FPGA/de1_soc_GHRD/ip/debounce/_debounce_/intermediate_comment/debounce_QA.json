This is achieved using counters for each bit of the input signal. If POLARITY is set to \"HIGH\", an input bit is considered stable at high after staying high for the TIMEOUT period, and similarly for low if POLARITY is \"LOW\". This module is parameterized to handle signals of different widths and timeout durations, making it flexible for various application needs in digital circuits to filter out spurious changes in input signals commonly caused by mechanical bounce or noise."

All state changes and timing evaluations are based on the rising edge of this clock.\n- reset_n: This is the active-low reset signal. When it is deasserted (low), it resets the debounce counters to their initial state, preparing the module for a fresh start.\n- data_in: This is a multi-bit input signal (with bit width defined by the parameter WIDTH) which represents the raw, potentially noisy digital inputs that the module needs to stabilize.\n\nOutput ports: data_out. \nExplanation:\n- data_out: This is a multi-bit output signal (matching the width of data_in). It provides the debounced version of data_in. Each bit of data_out changes state only when its corresponding bit in data_in has been stable (either high or low, based on the POLARITY parameter setting) for a duration specified by the TIMEOUT parameter. This stabilized output is useful in digital circuits where noisy inputs may cause erratic behavior."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: counter, counter_reset, counter_enable.\nExplanation:\n- counter: These are arrays of registers, with one register per bit of `data_in` (as designated by the parameter WIDTH). Each register has a width defined by `TIMEOUT_WIDTH`. These registers serve as counters which increment every clock cycle when enabled by `counter_enable` and are cleared when instructed by `counter_reset`. The value in each counter is used to determine if the corresponding input bit has been stable for the duration specified by TIMEOUT.\n- counter_reset: These are control signals (one per input bit), which determine when the respective counter should be reset to zero. If POLARITY is \"HIGH\", `counter_reset` for a bit is asserted (set high) when that bit of `data_in` is low, indicating the bit has changed state and thus the counter should be reset. If POLARITY is \"LOW\", `counter_reset` for a bit is asserted when that bit of `data_in` is high.\n- counter_enable: These signals enable the counting mechanism for each corresponding bit's counter. If the respective bit in `data_in` matches the expected stable state (based on the POLARITY setting) and the counter has not reached the TIMEOUT value, the `counter_enable` signal is asserted. This allows the counter to increment, tracking how long the bit has remained in the expected state."
