The 'probe' and 'source_clk' are input ports where 'probe' could be used to receive a signal to initiate a reset and 'source_clk' might be a clock signal. The 'source' is an output port configured as a 3-bit wide bus. From the given code snippet alone, there are no implementations or internal logic provided within the module, thus the specific functionality or how these ports are manipulated or interact is not defined in the provided details."
