It accepts 4 data inputs for each output pin and uses two phases of a half-rate clock and a full-rate clock to manage the data timing. The module utilizes generate loops to create multiple instances of DDIO configurations, allowing setup for each pin independently. This setup involves passing data through a series of DDR I/O blocks that convert half-rate data input to a full-rate data output suitable for SDRAM operations. The `halfratebypass` input conditionally bypasses the half-rate operation mode if required."

Explanation: \n- datain: This is a vector consisting of 4 bits times the parameter WIDTH. Each group of 4 bits corresponds to data inputs fed into the DDR I/O blocks to be managed separately per output bit/hardware pin.\n- halfratebypass: This is a control signal used to bypass the half-rate clock operation mode. When set, data manipulation bypasses some intermediate stages ideally for performance or specific operational reasons.\n- clk_hr: A vector of clocks, size defined by WIDTH, providing half-rate clock signals used for managing data transfer rates and properly timing the internal operations of DDR I/O blocks.\n- clk_fr: Similar to clk_hr, this is a vector of full-rate clock signals used to finalize the data rate conversion and manage the timing for the data outputs suitable for SDRAM operations.\n\nOutput ports: [dataout]. Explanation:\n- dataout: This is a vector sized by the parameter WIDTH, with each bit representing the output of each DDR I/O block. This serves as the final output carrying the double data rate processed signal suitable for direct use in SDRAM modules or similar applications.

Explanation:\n- fr_data_hi: This internal signal is used to temporarily hold the high part of the data processed by the half-rate DDR I/O block (`hr_to_fr_hi`). The data processed by the instance is derived from the high bits (specific pairing determined by `pin` indexing) of the `datain` input. This signal's value is used as an input to the full-rate DDR I/O block, specifically as the high data input (`datainhi`) together with `fr_data_lo` to produce the corresponding `dataout`.\n- fr_data_lo: Similar to fr_data_hi, fr_data_lo is an internal signal used to temporarily hold the low part of the data processed by another half-rate DDR I/O block (`hr_to_fr_lo`). It handles the alternating (low) set of data bits from the `datain` and, like fr_data_hi,  is similarly pushed forward to the full-rate DDR I/O block as the low data input (`datainlo`). Together with fr_data_hi, it completes the data pairing needed for the output generation in the full-rate domain.\n\nThese internal signals are crucial for separating the incoming data's timing and handling from half-rate to full-rate as the system processes signals for optimized SDRAM interfacing."
