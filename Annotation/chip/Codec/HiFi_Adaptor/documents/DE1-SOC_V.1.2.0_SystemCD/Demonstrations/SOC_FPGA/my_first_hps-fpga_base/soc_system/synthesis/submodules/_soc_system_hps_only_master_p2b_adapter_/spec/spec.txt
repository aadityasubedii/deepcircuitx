Module name: soc_system_hps_only_master_p2b_adapter. Module specification: The 'soc_system_hps_only_master_p2b_adapter' module serves as a bridge that interfaces between two bus protocols or data streams, primarily focusing on redirecting 8-bit data packets from input to output while mirroring control signals. The module includes several input ports: 'clk' (clock input for synchronization), 'reset_n' (active-low reset signal), 'in_valid' (indicates the validity of incoming data), 'in_data' (8-bit incoming data), 'in_startofpacket' (signals the start of a data packet), 'in_endofpacket' (signals the end of a data packet), and 'out_ready' (indicates if the output is ready to receive data). The output ports are 'in_ready' (shows if the module can receive more data), 'out_valid' (mirrors the validity of the incoming data), 'out_data' (8-bit output data identical to the input), 'out_startofpacket', 'out_endofpacket' (both mirroring the respective input signals), and 'out_channel' (specifies the data packetâ€™s channel, statically set to zero). Internally, the module utilizes a register 'in_channel' initialized to zero, which is used to set 'out_channel' but has no other functional impact in this implementation. The Verilog code primarily consists of an always block that directly assigns input states to the corresponding outputs and control signals, ensuring low latency and straightforward data pass-through functionality.
