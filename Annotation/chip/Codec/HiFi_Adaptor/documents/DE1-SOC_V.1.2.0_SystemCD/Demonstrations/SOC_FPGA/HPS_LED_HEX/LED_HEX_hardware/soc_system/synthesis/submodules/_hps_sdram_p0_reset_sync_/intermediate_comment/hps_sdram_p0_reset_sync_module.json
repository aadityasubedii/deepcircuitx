    "module": "Module-level comment: The hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync module synchronizes an asynchronous reset signal (`reset_n`) with a clock domain (`clk`) to mitigate metastability in synchronous systems. It features a series of parameterized flip-flops (`reset_reg`) which buffer the reset signal across `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` and `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT` stages, outputting a stable, synchronized reset signal (`reset_n_sync`) after enough delay cycles, ensuring robust system reset behavior."
