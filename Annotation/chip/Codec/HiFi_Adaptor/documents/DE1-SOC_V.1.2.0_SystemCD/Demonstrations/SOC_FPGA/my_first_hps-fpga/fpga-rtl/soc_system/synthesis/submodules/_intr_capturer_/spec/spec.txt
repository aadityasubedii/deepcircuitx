Module name: intr_capturer. 
Module specification: The intr_capturer is a Verilog module designed to capture and output interrupt signals based on specified read addresses. It is parameterized with `NUM_INTR` to handle a configurable number of interrupts. The module receives interrupts on the `interrupt_in` input, which can range up to 32 or more signals, and captures them into the `interrupt_reg`. It outputs the stored interrupt data through the `rddata` port upon read requests indicated by the `read` input and based on the address specified in the `addr` input. The main inputs are `clk` (clock signal), `rst_n` (active-low reset), `interrupt_in` (interrupt input vector), `addr` (address input to select data segment), and `read` (read enable signal). The sole output is `rddata`, a 32-bit output data bus. Internally, the module uses several signals: `interrupt_reg` (captures the incoming interrupt states), `readdata_with_waitstate` (holds the output data potentially with added wait states), `act_readdata` (intermediate signal combining data from different segments), `readdata_lower_intr` and `readdata_higher_intr` (hold interrupt data from lower and higher segments respectively), `access_lower_32` and `access_higher_32` (control signals to access specific data segments). The code comprises blocks for capturing interrupt signals and handling different sections for configurations exceeding 32 interrupts (`generate` block) to manage multiple interrupt registers. Each operational phase is sensitive to clock edges and reset conditions, ensuring the system's responsiveness and data integrity.
