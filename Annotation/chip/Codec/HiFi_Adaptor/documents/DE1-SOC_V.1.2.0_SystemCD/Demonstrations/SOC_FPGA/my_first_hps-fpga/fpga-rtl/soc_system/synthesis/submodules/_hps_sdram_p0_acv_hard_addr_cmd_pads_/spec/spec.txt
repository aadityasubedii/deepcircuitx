Module name: hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_addr_cmd_pads. 

Module specification: The `hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_addr_cmd_pads` module is designed for interfacing with SDRAM by handling address and command signals transformation using DDR I/O pads and clock generation components. It accommodates different clock domains sourced from PLLs and utilizes a delay-locked loop for timing and phase adjustments. The module interfaces with input signals such as reset flags, several clock inputs, DDR I/O address, DDR I/O bank control, and command signals from a physical layer (PHY) and processes these to generate corresponding SDRAM memory addresses and command outputs. Internal signals like clock arrays and other configurations control clock signaling and data integrity. This module consists of multiple internal blocks: DDR I/O addressing handled by `hps_sdram_p0_generic_ddio` for converting DDIO address and timing signals to memory format, address and command signal generation using delay chains, and clock conditioners for memory signals, including MEM_CLK clock generation either in Soft Logic or from the physical layer directly. The implementation details are managed through parameters and configurations that adapt the module for different hardware setups and operational requirements. Additionally, the module takes care of arranging memory clock signals into differential pairs for robust high-speed memory operations.
