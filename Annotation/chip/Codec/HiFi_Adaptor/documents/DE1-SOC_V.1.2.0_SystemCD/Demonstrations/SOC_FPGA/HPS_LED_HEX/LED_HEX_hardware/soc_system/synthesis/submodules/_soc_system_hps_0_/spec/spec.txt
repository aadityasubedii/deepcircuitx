Module name: soc_system_hps_0. Module specification: The soc_system_hps_0 module serves as a comprehensive interface for a system-on-chip (SoC) design, integrating various hardware components and communication protocols. It manages AXI interfaces, memory controls, and peripheral connections. The module features numerous input and output ports for AXI communications (f2h and h2f), memory interfacing, and various I/O protocols including Ethernet, QSPI, SDIO, USB, SPI, UART, I2C, and GPIO. Key inputs include clock signals, AXI transaction identifiers, addresses, and control signals, while outputs comprise corresponding ready signals, data outputs, and peripheral controls. The module uses two parameters, F2S_Width and S2F_Width, to configure data widths. Internally, it instantiates two sub-modules: s
