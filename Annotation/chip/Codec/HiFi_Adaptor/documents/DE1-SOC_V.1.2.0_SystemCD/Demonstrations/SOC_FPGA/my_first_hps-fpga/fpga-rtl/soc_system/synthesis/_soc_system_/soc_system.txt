Module-level comment: 
// This module implements a System-on-Chip (SoC) design integrating an HPS with FPGA fabric.
// It provides interfaces for memory, Ethernet, USB, UART, SPI, I2C, and GPIO.
// The module uses AXI interconnects to facilitate communication between the HPS and FPGA,
// incorporates on-chip memory, master interfaces, and interrupt handling capabilities.
// It manages various I/O operations and system control through dedicated submodules and signals.
