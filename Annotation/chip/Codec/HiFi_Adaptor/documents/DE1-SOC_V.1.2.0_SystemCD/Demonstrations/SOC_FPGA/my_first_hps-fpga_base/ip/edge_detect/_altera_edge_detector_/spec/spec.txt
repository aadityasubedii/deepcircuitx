Module name: altera_edge_detector. Module specification: The altera_edge_detector is a Verilog module designed to detect edges on a digital signal and generate a corresponding pulse output. It monitors the 'signal_in' input for rising or falling edges, dictated by the 'EDGE_TYPE' configuration. The module features three inputs: 'clk' for the clock signal controlling the timing of operations, 'rst_n' an active-low reset to reinitialize the system, and 'signal_in' which is the digital signal under observation. The sole output 'pulse_out' delivers a pulse when an edge is detected. Internal signals such as 'state' and 'next_state' manage the state machine progression through IDLE, ARM, and CAPT states based on 'signal_in'. 'pulse_detect' indicates edge detection, and 'busy_pulsing' along with 'reset_qual_n' handle pulse continuation when the module is busy, depending on the 'IGNORE_RST_WHILE_BUSY' and 'PULSE_EXT' parameters. Code is partitioned into multiple blocks including state transition logic, reset conditions, and pulse extension functionality configured by 'PULSE_EXT'. Depending on 'PULSE_EXT', the pulse output is either directly the 'pulse_detect' signal or an extended pulse determined by a shift register mechanism. This design allows for versatile edge detection suitable for various applications requiring precise event timing responses to signal changes.
