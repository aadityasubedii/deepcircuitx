    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a DDR3 SDRAM controller for high-performance systems. It manages memory operations, timing, and interfacing with external DDR3 SDRAM. The module uses a PLL for clock generation, a hard memory controller for core functionality, OCT for I/O calibration, and a DLL for timing adjustments. It handles address/data management, read/write operations, and provides various control signals for memory interaction."
