Module name: hps_reset. 
Module specification: The `hps_reset` module is designed to manage hardware probing for debugging or diagnostics using the `altsource_probe` component. It includes input ports: `probe`, used for receiving the signal to be probed, and `source_clk`, which acts as the clock input ensuring synchronization of operations within the module. The module outputs through a 3-bit wide port `source`, which reflects the signal status or control aspects derived from the probing process. Internally, the module employs a 3-bit wire `sub_wire0` that connects the output of the `altsource_probe` component to the moduleâ€™s `source` output port, facilitating signal transfer. The code is structured with the main module definition followed by instantiation of the `altsource_probe` component, where inputs and outputs get connected, and several other control signals remain unconnected implying possible configurations for extended functionalities. Parameters such as metastability, instance ID, probe width, and initial source values are defined using `defparam` to configure the `altsource_probe` behaviors crucial for robust probing operations.
