Module name: altera_jtag_streaming. 

Module specification: The module "altera_jtag_streaming" is designed for data streaming and processing within a JTAG test environment. It handles synchronization, encoding, and manipulation of JTAG data streams. Input ports include 'tck' for the test clock, 'reset_n' for an active low reset, 'source_data', 'source_valid', 'sink_data', 'sink_valid', and 'sink_ready' for managing data functionalities, 'clock_to_sample' and 'reset_to_sample' for operational timing. Output ports consist of 'tck', 'source_data', 'source_valid', 'sink_ready', 'resetrequest', 'debug_reset', 'mgmt_valid', 'mgmt_channel', and 'mgmt_data' which are critical for broadcasting processed data, resetting circuits, and managing operations dynamically. Internal signals such as 'ir_out', 'tdo', 'tdi', 'sdr', among others, are imperative for TAP (Test Access Port) management, data handling, and transmission state management. Major sections in the code include TAP controller configuration, data shift and capture handling, idle insertion and removal for efficient data flow, clock synchronization, and management of different operational modes like loopback and debug. Overall, the design integrates detailed data processing strategies with TAP state control for robust JTAG operation.
