Module name: hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync. Module specification: The "hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync" module is designed to synchronize an asynchronous active-low reset signal (`reset_n`) to the clock domain specified by the clock signal (`clk`). The synchronization prevents metastability issues typically associated with asynchronous signals in digital circuits. The module has two input ports: `reset_n`, representing the asynchronous reset signal, and `clk`, the clock signal to which the reset is synchronized. The output of the module, `reset_n_sync`, is a synchronized reset signal configured through parameters to manage the number of output signals and the stages of synchronization. Internally, the module utilizes `reset_reg`, an array of registers, to create a chain of flip-flops that sequentially passes the reset signal through various stages. This staging helps in providing a stable output reset signal, suppresses glitches, and timing errors present in the initial asynchronous signal. The Verilog code is structured into significant blocks: declaration of parameters (`RESET_SYNC_STAGES`, `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT`), port declarations, and a `generate` block that dynamically creates the necessary flip-flop stages based on configuration. Each stage in the `generate` block handles the propagation of the reset signal or the forced reset of the register based on the state of `reset_n`. Finally, the `assign` statement at the end of the code ties the output of the last stage of the flip-flops to the `reset_n_sync` output port, completing the synchronization process.
