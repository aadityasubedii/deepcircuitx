    "module": "Module-level comment: The debounce module filters noise from digital inputs, stabilizing them for reliable use. It operates on multi-bit input 'data_in', outputting 'data_out'. Internally, it uses counters controlled by 'clk' and 'reset_n' to maintain input states until a TIMEOUT threshold is reached, determined by POLARITY. Counters are managed individually for each bit via generate loops, enabling flexible, parameterized control of debouncing behavior."
