Module-level comment: This module interfaces between a packet-based protocol and an Avalon Memory-Mapped master interface. It receives packets, decodes commands, and performs read/write operations on the Avalon MM interface. The module supports two versions: a fast version using a FIFO buffer for improved performance, and a standard version without FIFO. It handles various command types, manages address increments, and ensures proper data flow between interfaces. The implementation uses a state machine to process incoming packets, execute commands, and generate appropriate responses.
