    "module": "Module-level comment: The hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc module generates specific clock signals for SDRAM control in FPGA systems. It inputs various clock signals and configurations, processing these through conditional buffering, phase adjustment, and delay chains. Outputs include tailored clocks for SDRAM interfacing and high-resolution operations, configurably adjusted for different hardware platforms, ensuring precise timing management."
