Module name: soc_system_master_secure_b2p_adapter. 
Module specification: The `soc_system_master_secure_b2p_adapter` module functions as a data forwarding interface, managing transfer from input to output under specific conditions based on the status of the input and output interfaces. Key **input ports** include `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset_n` (active low reset signal), `in_ready` (reflects readiness to receive data), `in_valid` (indicates if incoming data is valid), `in_data` (actual data being transferred), `in_channel` (channel identifier affecting data transfer), `in_startofpacket`, `in_endofpacket` (signal start and end of data packets), and `out_ready` (signals readiness of the downstream module to receive data). The **output ports** are `in_ready` (mirrors output readiness), `out_valid` (validity of output data), `out_data` (data sent to output), `out_startofpacket`, and `out_endofpacket` (marking the start and end of output packets). An **internal signal**, `out_channel`, is crucial as it holds the value of `in_channel` and influences the condition to disable `out_valid` when `in_channel` is greater than 0, thereby halting data transmission. The code consists of a single procedural block `always` which controls the behavior of output signals and their conditions based on the status of the input interfaces and the internal condition set by `in_channel`. This module efficiently ensures the integrity and synchronization of data packets during transmission across various interfaces while managing traffic based on channel specifications.
