Module-level comment: The `soc_system_hps_only_master_timing_adt` module transfers input data to its output while managing flow control via ready and valid signals. It utilizes internal buffers (`in_payload`, `out_payload`) and state signals (`ready`, `in_ready`) to ensure synchronization between data input and output stages, thereby preserving data integrity under varying downstream readiness, as showcased in its conditional and continuous logic blocks.
