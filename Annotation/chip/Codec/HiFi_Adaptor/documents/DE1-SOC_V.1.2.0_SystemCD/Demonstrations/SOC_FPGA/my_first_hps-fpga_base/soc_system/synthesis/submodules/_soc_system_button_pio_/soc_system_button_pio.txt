Module-level comment: The "soc_system_button_pio" module acts as a programmable I/O peripheral for button interfacing in SoCs, detecting presses via rising edge detection on a 4-bit input. It employs synchronized delays (`d1_data_in`, `d2_data_in`), edge capturing (`edge_capture`), interrupt masking (`irq_mask`), and conditional logic to manage outputs (`irq`, `readdata`), effectively responding to button events with configured interrupts and data readiness.
