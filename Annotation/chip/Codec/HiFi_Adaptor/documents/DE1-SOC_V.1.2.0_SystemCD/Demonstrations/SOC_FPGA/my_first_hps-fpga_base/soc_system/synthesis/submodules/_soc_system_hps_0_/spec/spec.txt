Module name: soc_system_hps_0. Module specification: The soc_system_hps_0 module serves as an interface bridge between a Hard Processor System (HPS) and FPGA fabric, facilitating communication and control functions. It handles a wide array of input and output signals related to reset controls, AXI interface transactions, IRQ inputs, memory controller interfaces, and various peripheral interfaces (EMAC, QSPI, SDIO, USB, SPI, UART, I2C, and GPIOs). The module has numerous input and output ports for these functions, including clock inputs, AXI interface signals, memory signals, and peripheral I/O signals. While there are no explicitly declared internal signals, the module instantiates two sub-modules: soc_system_hps_0_fpga_interfaces and soc_system_hps_0_hps_io
