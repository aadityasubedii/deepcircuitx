Module name: altera_jtag_dc_streaming. 
Module specification: The `altera_jtag_dc_streaming` module is designed for synchronized data communication between different clock domains using JTAG protocol in digital systems. This module handles data and control signals across clock boundaries to ensure synchronization and data integrity. It features the following input ports: `clk` (the main system clock), `reset_n` (an active-low reset signal for resetting the module state), `sink_data` and `sink_valid` (8-bit data and its validity flag from a sink), with an additional `sink_ready` signal indicating the readiness to receive more data. The outputs include `source_data` (the synchronized data ready for the source domain), `source_valid` (validation of source data), `sink_ready`, `resetrequest` (a signal to reset external modules or components), `debug_reset` (a control signal for testing), `mgmt_valid`, `mgmt_data`, and `mgmt_channel` for management and debugging information exchange. Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `jtag_clock` (a dedicated JTAG clock), and `jtag_clock_reset_n` (reset signal for the JTAG clock domain), along with data and control oriented signals like `jtag_source_data`, `jtag_source_valid`, `jtag_sink_data`, `jtag_sink_valid`, and `jtag_sink_ready`. These facilitate the intermediate stages of data synchronization and control flow. The module incorporates several key sub-components: `altera_std_synchronizer` for signal synchronization, `altera_jtag_streaming` for managing JTAG streams, `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser`, and `altera_jtag_src_crosser` for crossing data between clock domains, which together aid in the robust handling and transitioning of signals and data across the clock domains, ensuring reliable operations within multi-clocked systems.
