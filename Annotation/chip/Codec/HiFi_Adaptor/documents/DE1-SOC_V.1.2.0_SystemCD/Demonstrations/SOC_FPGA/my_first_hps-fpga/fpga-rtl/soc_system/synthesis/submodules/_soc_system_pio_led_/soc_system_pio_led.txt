Module-level comment: The soc_system_pio_led module controls LED operations via a 10-bit PIO system. It updates 'out_port' based on 'writedata' when 'address' is zero, 'chipselect' is active, and 'write_n' is low, resetting 'data_out' to 1023 on reset. 'readdata' gives the zero-extended state of 'out_port' for reads. The module efficiently handles write and read operations synchronized with a clock signal.
