Module name: soc_system_jtag_uart.
Module specification: The soc_system_jtag_uart module serves as a critical interface in a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, managing data transactions through UART using a JTAG interface for debugging and data handling. It operates synchronously with a clock signal and resets functionality. The module's inputs include av_address (determines operation address), av_chipselect (activates the module for communication), av_read_n (enables reading operations when low), av_write_n (enables writing operations when low), av_writedata (data to be written), clk (clock signal), and rst_n (reset signal, active low). Its outputs are av_irq (interrupt request to the host), av_readdata (data being read from module), av_waitrequest (controls the pace of data communication), dataavailable (indicates data presence), and readyfordata (indicates readiness to receive more data). Internal signals like ac (tracks activity status), activity (indicates operation activity based on transmissions), fifo_AE/AF (indicate FIFO's almost empty/full status), and other FIFO control signals like fifo_wr (write control) and fifo_rd (read control), manage FIFO buffer operations and integrate with two FIFO submodules (`soc_system_jtag_uart_scfifo_w`, `soc_system_jtag_uart_scfifo_r`) that handle the specifics of writing and reading FIFO sequences, respectively. Additional functionality encapsulated in the module includes interrupt management based on FIFO thresholds and buffer readiness checks, alongside conditions for reset and pause operations impacting FIFOs and activity registers deeply influencing data integrity and transaction smoothness.
