Module-level comment: The 'altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets' module processes byte-stream input data into organized packets. It uses internal signals for detecting special characters (e.g., start/end of packet, channel identifiers), managing escape sequences, and ensuring data integrity based on channel configuration and encoding parameters. The module handles outputs based on the status of these detections and the readiness of downstream components, supporting variable channel widths and complex encoding schemes.
