Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter` module inserts idle characters (0x4a) into a data stream as needed, handling special escape (0x4d) characters. It uses `received_esc` to track escape receptions, modifying output `out_data` based on input states and character conditions. Control flow is maintained using flags `in_ready` and `out_valid`, ensuring data integrity and synchronization in streaming conditions.
