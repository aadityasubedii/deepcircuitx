Module name: soc_system_hps_0. Module specification: The soc_system_hps_0 module serves as a comprehensive hardware bridge interfacing between a Hard Processor System (HPS) and various peripherals and hardware interfaces. It manages data flows and control signals across a complex integrated circuit or system-on-chip (SoC). The module features numerous input and output ports for AXI interfaces (both full and lightweight), reset signals, memory interfaces, and various I/O interfaces such as EMAC, QSPI, SDIO, USB, UART, I2C, and GPIO. It doesn't contain any explicitly declared internal signals, instead passing signals directly to two sub-modules: fpga_interfaces and hps_io. The module includes a generate block for parameter checking to ensure correct instantiation. The fpga_interfaces sub-module handles the FPGA-side interfaces including AXI
