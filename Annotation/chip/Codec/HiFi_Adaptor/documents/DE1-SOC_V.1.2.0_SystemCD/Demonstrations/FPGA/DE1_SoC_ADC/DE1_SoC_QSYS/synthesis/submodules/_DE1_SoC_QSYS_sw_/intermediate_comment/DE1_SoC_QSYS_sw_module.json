    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sw module reads a 10-bit input from in_port, checks the 2-bit address, and outputs a 32-bit value at readdata. If address is 0, in_port data is positioned in the least significant bits of readdata; otherwise, readdata is zero. Operation is synchronized to the rising edge of the clk signal, and outputs are cleared on the active-low reset. Internal signals like clk_en, data_in, and read_mux_out facilitate correct data transfer and condition checking, ensuring timely updates and system initialization."
