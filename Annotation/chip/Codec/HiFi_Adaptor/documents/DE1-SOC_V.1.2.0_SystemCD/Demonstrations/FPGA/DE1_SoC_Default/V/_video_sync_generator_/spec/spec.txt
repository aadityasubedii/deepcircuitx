Module name: video_sync_generator. Module specification: The video_sync_generator is a Verilog module designed to generate synchronization signals for a VGA display. It takes two input signals; `reset`, an active-high signal used to reset the module's internal counters (`h_cnt`, `v_cnt`), and `vga_clk`, the clock signal that drives the synchronization logic. The module produces three output signals: `blank_n`, an active-low signal indicating if the current pixel is in the active video area, `HS`, the horizontal sync signal, and `VS`, the vertical sync signal, both crucial for aligning the pixel display on the screen. Internally, the module uses several signals including `h_cnt` and `v_cnt`, counters for the current pixel position horizontally and vertically. `cHD`, `cVD`, `hori_valid`, `vert_valid`, and `cDEN` are logic signals that determine the states of `HS`, `VS`, and `blank_n`. The code is structured into several blocks: the synchronous reset and clocking block that updates the counters, logic assignments for generating sync and valid signals, and the output assignment for sync and blanking signals based on the internal logic states. This setup effectively manages synchronization pulses and active display determination within a VGA system.
