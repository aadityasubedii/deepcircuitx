    "spec": "Module name: img_data. Module specification: The 'img_data' module, designed for use in FPGA environments specifically the Cyclone IV E family, is intended to facilitate the reading of image data from a read-only memory (ROM) structure. It operationalizes the altsyncram component configured as ROM to store and retrieve predefined image data from a '.mif' file, suitable for image display or processing tasks. The module includes two input ports: 'address', a 19-bit input selecting the ROM location, and 'clock', a synchronization signal for read operations. It outputs an 8-bit signal 'q' which carries the data retrieved from ROM corresponding to the input address. Internally, the module employs a wire 'sub_wire0' which connects the altsyncram\u2019s output 'q_a' to the module\u2019s output 'q', ensuring data flow from the memory component to the module\u2019s interface. The altsyncram block within the code is meticulously parameterized to align with its ROM operation mode, indicating no write operations are permitted and all configurations are set to ensure stable ROM behavior. This configuration includes disabling address clearing and output data registering, setting the memory block type to 'M9K', and defining other essential parameters that align with the operational specifications detailed in the module's initialization file. Overall, the 'img_data' module provides a crucial interface for accessing image data stored in FPGA memory, streamlined by its connection to a specifically configured altsyncram component.",

The 'clock' input port is a standard clock signal used to synchronize the reading operations in this memory module, ensuring data is accessed in a timely and coordinated manner.\n\nOutput ports: [q].\nExplanation: The 'q' output port is an 8-bit output which provides the data retrieved from the specified memory location at the 'address' for each clock cycle.
