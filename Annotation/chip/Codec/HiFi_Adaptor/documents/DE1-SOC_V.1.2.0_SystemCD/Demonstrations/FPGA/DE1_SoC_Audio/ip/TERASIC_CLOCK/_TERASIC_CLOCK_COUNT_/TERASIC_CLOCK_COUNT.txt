Module-level comment: The TERASIC_CLOCK_COUNT module counts clock pulses from two external signals, CLK_1 and CLK_2, based on control operations written to specific addresses. It features input handling for setup and control (start/stop counting, data loading), output for queried count values, and internal mechanisms for counting and latching pulse counts, governed by system and control signal logic to ensure synchronization and precise monitoring in application requiring exact pulse tracking.
