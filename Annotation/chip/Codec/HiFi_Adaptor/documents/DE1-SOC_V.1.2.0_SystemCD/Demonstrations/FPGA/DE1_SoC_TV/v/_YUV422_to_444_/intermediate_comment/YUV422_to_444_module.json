    "module": "Module-level comment: The YUV422_to_444 module converts YUV 422 input (`iYCbCr`) to YUV 444 format. It employs internal registers (`mY`, `mCb`, `mCr`) to store and output Y, Cb, and Cr components separately, controlled by `iX` LSB. Operations are synchronized to a clock (`iCLK`) and reset (`iRST_N`) for robust and accurate data handling."
