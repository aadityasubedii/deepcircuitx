It handles reading and writing to FIFOs for audio data, processes commands, and controls the status indications based on the fullness of the DAC FIFO and the emptiness of the ADC FIFO. It also ensures synchronization with audio clock signals for proper digital audio signal handling. This module predominantly acts as a bridge, integrating audio data acquisition from ADC (Audio Data Converter), buffering, and output through DAC (Digital to Analog Converter), maintaining separate data paths and buffers for left and right audio channels."
