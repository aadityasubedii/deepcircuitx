Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_wrapper manages JTAG-based CPU debugging on DE1-SoC systems. It processes input signals like clock, breakpoints, and trace controls, and outputs JTAG data and debug state actions. Internal signaling facilitates JTAG operations with wire connections to sub-modules handling specific state machine and synchronizing tasks. This structured approach ensures efficient and streamlined debugging functionalities.
