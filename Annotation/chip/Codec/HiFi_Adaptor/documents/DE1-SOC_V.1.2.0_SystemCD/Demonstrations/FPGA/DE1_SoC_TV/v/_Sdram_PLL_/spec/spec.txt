Module name: Sdram_PLL. Module specification: The 'Sdram_PLL' is a Verilog module designed as a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) specifically tailored for SDRAM timing management. It incorporates an input reference clock (`refclk`) that serves as the baseline for frequency generation, and a reset input (`rst`) which helps in initializing or exerting control over the module in reset conditions. The outputs of the module include three distinct clocks: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, and `outclk_2`, each potentially adjusted to different frequencies or phases to satisfy varying SDRAM operational demands. Internally, this module does not declare any signals but relies on its instantiation of the 'Sdram_PLL_0002' module, where the handling of the input clocks, generation of output clocks, and reset functionality is managed. The module includes the 'Sdram_PLL_0002' instantiation block connected directly to the inputs and outputs, with the additional 'locked' output from the PLL left unconnected. This design encapsulates all core functionalities within the internal instantiated module, maintaining a focused and streamlined external interface for integration into broader system designs.
