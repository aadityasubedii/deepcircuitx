Module-level comment: The `SEG7_LUT_8` module interfaces a 32-bit input (`iDIG`) to six 7-segment displays using outputs (`oSEG0` to `oSEG5`). Each 4-bit slice of `iDIG` is decoded by a corresponding `SEG7_LUT` instance to display hexadecimal values on the segments, mapping bits [3:0] through [23:20] to each display sequentially. No internal signals are used; functionality is achieved through direct instantiation and connections of `SEG7_LUT` modules.
