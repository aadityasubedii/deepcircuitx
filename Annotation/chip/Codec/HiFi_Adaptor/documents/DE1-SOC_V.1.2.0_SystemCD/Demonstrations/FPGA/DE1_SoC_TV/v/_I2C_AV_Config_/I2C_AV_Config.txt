Module-level comment: The I2C_AV_Config module configures audio and video settings using I2C communication, controlled by an input clock (iCLK) and reset (iRST_N). It uses internal registers for clock division, data storage, and control flow with a state machine governing the setup sequence from a lookup table. Outputs include I2C_SCLK and bidirectional I2C_SDAT, interfacing with an I2C_Controller submodule for transaction management.
