    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"PLL\" module implements a phase-locked loop using the `altpll` component for frequency synthesis and stable clock generation in FPGA-based systems. It accepts an input clock `inclk0` and delivers a manipulated output `c0` based on internal signal configurations and altpll parameter settings, tailored for Cyclone IV E devices. This includes frequency division, multiplication, and phase adjustments."
