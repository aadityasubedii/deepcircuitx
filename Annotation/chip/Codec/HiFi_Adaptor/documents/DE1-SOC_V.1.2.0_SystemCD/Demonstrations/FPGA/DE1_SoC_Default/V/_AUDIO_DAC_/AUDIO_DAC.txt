Module-level comment: The AUDIO_DAC module handles digital audio data generation and output for DAC interfacing. It interfaces with external memories (FLASH, SDRAM, SRAM) and an internal sinusoid generator, selects data sources via `iSrc_Select`, and manages synchronized outputs through `oAUD_DATA`, `oAUD_LRCK`, and `oAUD_BCK`. Clocks and counter controls are utilized internally for timing, while data transitions and serialization facilitate accurate audio stream preparation based on configurable parameters like sample rate and data width.
