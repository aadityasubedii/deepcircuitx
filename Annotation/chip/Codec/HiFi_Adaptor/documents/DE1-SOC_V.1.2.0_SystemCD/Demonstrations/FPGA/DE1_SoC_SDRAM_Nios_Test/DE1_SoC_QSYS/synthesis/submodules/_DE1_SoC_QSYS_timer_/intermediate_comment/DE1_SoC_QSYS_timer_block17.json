    "block_comment": "The block serves as a synchronous read logic with asynchronous reset. On every positive clock edge or negative reset assertion, if the reset is active (low), it clears the `readdata` register to `0`. Otherwise, if `clk_en` is high, it updates `readdata` with the value from `read_mux_out`."
