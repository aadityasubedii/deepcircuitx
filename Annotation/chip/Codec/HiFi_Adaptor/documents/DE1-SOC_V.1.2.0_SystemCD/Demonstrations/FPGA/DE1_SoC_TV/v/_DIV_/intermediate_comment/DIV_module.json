    "module": "Module-level comment: The DIV module performs hardware-based division, accepting a 10-bit numerator and a 4-bit denominator to compute a quotient and remainder. It utilizes an LPM_DIVIDE_component configured for unsigned division with pipeline optimization, linked via two internal signals (`sub_wire0` for remainder, `sub_wire1` for quotient). It includes asynchronous reset (`aclr`) and clock synchronization (`clock`) for efficient processing."
