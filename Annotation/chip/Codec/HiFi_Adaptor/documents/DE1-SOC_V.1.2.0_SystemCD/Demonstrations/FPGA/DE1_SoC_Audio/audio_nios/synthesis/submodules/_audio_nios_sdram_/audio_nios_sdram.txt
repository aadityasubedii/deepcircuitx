Module-level comment: 
/*
This module interfaces with SDRAM for audio processing. It manages read/write operations, 
refresh cycles, and initialization using state machines and FIFOs. The module handles 
SDRAM commands, address management, and data flow, ensuring proper timing and sequencing. 
It integrates refresh mechanisms and FIFO status checks for efficient SDRAM-based audio 
data handling.
