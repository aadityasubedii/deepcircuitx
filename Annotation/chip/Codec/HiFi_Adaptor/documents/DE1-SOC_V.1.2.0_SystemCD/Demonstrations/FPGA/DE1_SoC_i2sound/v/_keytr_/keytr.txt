Module-level comment: The "keytr" module detects and processes keypresses with debounce functionality, using internal flags and delays. It employs a 4-bit shift register to detect key falling edges, manages flags via clock-edge-triggered blocks reacting to inputs `key` and `key1`, and controls output `KEYON` with flip-flops `D1` and `D2` that reflect changes in logical states. The delay logic is implemented with a counter that resets or counts based on the key state.
