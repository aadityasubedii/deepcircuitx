Module name: AUDIO_DAC. 

Module specification: The AUDIO_DAC module is designed for digital audio data generation and output management. It interacts with various external memory sources (FLASH, SDRAM, SRAM) and a sinusoidal generator to provide serialized audio data for digital-to-analog conversion. It controls and synchronizes audio output through generated clock signals and manages data source selection via `iSrc_Select`.  **Input ports** include `iFLASH_DATA`, `iSDRAM_DATA`, `iSRAM_DATA` (for receiving data from respective memory sources), `iSrc_Select` (a control for selecting the data source), `iCLK_18_4` (a driving clock), and `iRST_N` (reset signal). **Output ports** encompass `oFLASH_ADDR`, `oSDRAM_ADDR`, `oSRAM_ADDR` (specifying data locations for each memory), and audio-specific outputs `oAUD_DATA`, `oAUD_LRCK`, `oAUD_BCK` (for serialized data, left-right clock, and bit clock, respectively). **Internal signals** such as `BCK_DIV`, `LRCK_X_DIV`, and `LRCK_X` are employed for clock control and synchronization, `SIN_Cont`, `FLASH_Cont`, `SDRAM_Cont`, `SRAM_Cont` manage data fetch operations, and output registers like `*_Out` and `*_Out_Tmp` hold and transition audio data ready for serialization. The operation within the module is segmented into blocks handling clock divisions, data fetching and assignment, output synchronization, source-specific data handling, and serialization logic, facilitating comprehensive audio data management and output preparation tailored to specified audio parameters of sample rate and data width.
