It is used for generating two output clock signals from a single reference clock input, while also providing a locked signal that indicates when the output clocks are stable. The module takes a reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset signal (`rst`) as inputs, then outputs two clock signals (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`) and a status signal (`locked`) to indicate when the output clocks are stable and valid. The functionality is significant in applications involving SDRAM where different clock phases or frequencies might be needed."

It is the primary clock signal from which the output clocks are derived. Typically, it provides the timing reference needed for generating synchronized output clocks.\n- `rst`: This is the reset input to the module. It is used to reset the internal state of the PLL inside the module.

These clocks can have different frequencies or phases and are typically used where multiple clock domains are required, such as in SDRAM applications.\n- `locked`: This is a status output signal that indicates whether the output clocks (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`) are stable and valid. The `locked` signal typically becomes high (logic 1) when the PLL has successfully locked to the desired frequencies.
