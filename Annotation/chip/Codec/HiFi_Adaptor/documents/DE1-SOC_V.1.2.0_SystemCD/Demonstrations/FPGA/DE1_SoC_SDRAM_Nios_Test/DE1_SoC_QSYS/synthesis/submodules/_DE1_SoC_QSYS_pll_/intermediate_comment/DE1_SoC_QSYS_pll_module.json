    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll module manages clock generation using an Altera PLL component, designed for specific timing requirements. It takes a reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset signal (`rst`), producing two output clocks (`outclk_0`, `outclk_1`) and a lock indicator (`locked`). The module wraps the `altera_pll_i` instance which is configured to output clocks at determined frequencies and phases, indicating stability via the `locked` signal."
