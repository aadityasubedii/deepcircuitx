The module controls the data transmission between a CPU and an SPI slave device. It handles reading from and writing to the slave device, manages SPI control signals like MOSI (Master Out Slave In), MISO (Master In Slave Out), SCLK (Serial Clock), and SS_n (Slave Select), and includes status flags like end-of-packet and data availability. This module also features internal registers and control driven by a clock (`clk`) and a reset signal (`reset_n`). It supports various strobes for read and write operations and uses a shift register for handling serial data transmission. The design accommodates interrupts and error signaling, enhancing the robustness in SPI data exchanges."
