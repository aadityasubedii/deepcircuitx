Module name: altera_reset_controller. Module specification: The `altera_reset_controller` module is designed to handle and synchronize reset signals in digital designs, using a clock signal as a reference. It features sixteen input ports labeled `reset_in0` to `reset_in15` for receiving external reset signals, and a `clk` port for the clock signal used to synchronize these inputs. These inputs are merged into a single reset signal. The module outputs two signals: `reset_out`, a synchronized reset output, and `reset_req`, an optional reset request signal that flags special reset conditions. Inside the module, several important internal signals are employed, such as `merged_reset` for combining all reset inputs, and `reset_out_pre` as an intermediate synchronized reset signal. Register chains like `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain` and `r_sync_rst_chain` are utilized for managing and timing the outputs to mitigate potential race conditions or metastability. The module is sectioned into blocks managing the merging of resets, optional synchronization logic, and conditional checks to generate the synchronized and request outputs. This organized approach ensures the synchronized reset signal aligns correctly with the clock edges to support reliable system behavior under various configuration parameters set through the module's instantiation.
