Module-level comment: The AUDIO_ADC module interfaces with an audio ADC, converting serial to parallel data and storing it in a FIFO. It uses clocks ('clk' and 'bclk'), control ('reset', 'read', 'clear'), and data signals ('adclrc', 'adcdat') for synchronization and channel differentiation. Internal logic and an `audio_fifo` instance manage data alignment, storage, and retrieval, ensuring organized buffer handling and data flow control.
