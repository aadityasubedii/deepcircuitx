The module utilizes the parameter 'WIDTH' to define the width of the data inputs and outputs, and 'DEPTH' to set the stabilization depth for each bit in its synchronization process. The input ports include 'clk' for the clock signal, 'reset_n' as an active-low reset signal, and 'din' which is a data bus whose width is defined by the 'WIDTH' parameter. The output port 'dout' provides the synchronized data outputs. Internally, the module does not declare any additional signals but makes direct bit-wise connections between 'din' and 'dout' through individual instances of the 'altera_std_synchronizer' parameterized by 'DEPTH'. The code comprises primarily a generate block which iteratively instantiates these synchronizers, connecting each data bit 'din[i]' to 'dout[i]', ensuring that every bit is individually stabilized. This setup guarantees that the output data can safely be used in a different clock domain from the input.",

It employs a loop-generated array of instances from a standard synchronization module 'altera_std_synchronizer' for each bit of the data input 'din' based on its width specified by the parameter 'WIDTH'.
