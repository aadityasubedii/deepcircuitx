    "module": "Module-level comment: The ITU_656_Decoder processes ITU-R BT.656 video data, decoding 8-bit inputs to output YCbCr color components along with pixel continuity and validation data. Utilizing synchronization detection, it manages video data flows through counters and state machines structured in a main always block, responding to incoming video data based on clock and reset signals, and toggling processing based on control inputs like swap and skip."
