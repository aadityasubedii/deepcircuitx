This PLL takes an input reference clock (`refclk`) and, depending on the configuration parameters provided, generates two output clocks (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`) at specified frequencies and phase shifts. The module also provides an output (`locked`) that indicates when the PLL has achieved lock, i.e., when the output frequencies and phases are stable and as programmed. The primary purpose of this module is to generate multiple clock signals with specific characteristics from a single reference clock, which is useful in timing-critical digital circuits."
