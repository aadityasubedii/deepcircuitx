    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_dc_fifo` is a dual-clock FIFO handling data synchronization across different clock domains. It manages diverse configurations and supports packet-based data integrity. Internal use of Gray-coded pointers ensures safe clock domain crossing, while control logic manages FIFO state under various conditions such as full, empty, and reset scenarios. Additional features include CSR interfaces for monitoring and control, and dynamic response capabilities like backpressure management and status signaling for fill level conditions."
