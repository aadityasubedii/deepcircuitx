It utilizes the `dcfifo` component, configured for the \"Cyclone IV E\" family, to store 32-bit audio data samples. The module manages writing data into the FIFO when the `wrreq` (write request) signal is active and the FIFO is not full, and reading data from the FIFO when the `rdreq` (read request) signal is active and the FIFO is not empty. The module outputs whether the FIFO is full (`wrfull`) or empty (`rdempty`) using the respective signals to control and synchronize data flow efficiently in systems with varying write and read speeds."

This is the audio data that is written into the FIFO buffer when a write operation is triggered.\n- `rdclk`: Read clock signal. This clock is used for all read operations in the FIFO, signaling when data should be read from the FIFO.\n- `rdreq`: Read request signal.

This carries the data that is read from the FIFO when a read operation occurs.\n- `rdempty`: Read empty signal. This signal indicates if the FIFO is empty; it goes high (asserted) when there are no more data elements to read.\n- `wrfull`: Write full signal. This signal indicates if the FIFO is full; it goes high (asserted) when no more data elements can be written into the FIFO due to lack of space."
