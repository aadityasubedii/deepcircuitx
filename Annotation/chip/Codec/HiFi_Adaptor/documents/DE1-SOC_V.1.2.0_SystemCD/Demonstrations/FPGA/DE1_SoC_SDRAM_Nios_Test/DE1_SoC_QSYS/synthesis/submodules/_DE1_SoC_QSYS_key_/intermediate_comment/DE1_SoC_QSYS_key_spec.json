    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_key. \n\nModule specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_key is a Verilog module designed to serve as an interrupt system tied to an input port. It encompasses edge detection, capture, and masking functionality, thereby enabling interrupt signal generation.\n\nInput Ports: The module has seven input ports. `address`(2-bit) helps in selecting one of the registers for read operation. `chipselect` is for choosing the chip for read/write operations. `clk` is the system clock. The 4-bit `in_port` inputs data into the system. `reset_n` resets the system when set to 0. `write_n` and `writedata` (32-bit) together facilitate write operations.\n\nOutput Ports: The module has two output ports. `irq` emits an interrupt signal based on particular conditions within the system. `readdata` (32-bit) outputs the data read from the registers, assigned through an internal mux operation.\n\nInternal Signals: Various internal signals are employed. `clk_en` is a static wire used in clock-enabled operations within always blocks. `data_in` is a direct representation of the `in_port` states. `d1_data_in`, `d2_data_in`, act as delayed versions of `data_in` aiding in edge detection. The detected edges are captured in `edge_capture` while `irq_mask` holds mask values for the generation of `irq`. `edge_capture_wr_strobe` signals when to write or reset `edge_capture`. `read_mux_out` is a multiplexer output used in assigning `readdata`.\n\nBlocks in Code: The blocks primarily manage data read/write operations, edge detection, edge capture and reset, IRQ mask handling, and IRQ generation. The read operations, assigned based on `address`, include input signals, interrupt flags, and edge captures. Edge detection compares `data_in` with its delayed versions. Edge capture happens based on detection results or reset when certain write strobe conditions are met. IRQ mask intervenes when there is a need for masking specific bits in edge detection. Finally, `irq` is generated by a bitwise OR operation on the masked edge captures.",

This can be inferred from various aspects of the code. The module captures edges from an input port (in_port) on the rising edge of a system clock (clk), the detections are stored in the \"edge_capture\" register. These captures can be masked with the \"irq_mask\" register. The contents of these registers and the direct input can be read depending on an input address, which is encoded through the \"read_mux_out\" assignment. An interrupt (irq) is generated when there is any non-zero value in the result of the bitwise-AND operation between the \"edge_capture\" and \"irq_mask\". Additionally, it involves conditions for reset (reset_n) and write operations (chipselect, write_n, writedata). It suggests the use of a system of controlling and managing interruptions in a digital device, potentially in a scenario where input signals asynchronously need to drive certain actions or events."

This constant signal, always enabled, is used in condition checks for clock-enabled-only operations within always blocks.\n  \n- `d1_data_in`: Internal 4-bit register used to delay the `data_in` by one clock cycle.

This further staging is crucial for stable edge detection as it captures the input state from two cycles ago.\n\n- `data_in`: Wire that directly assigns its values from the `in_port`, used as an intermediary signal to propagate inputs into various logic conditions and procedural blocks for processing and decision making.\n\n- `edge_capture`: 4-bit register which captures detected edge events. It is reset or cleared based on specific write strobe conditions or edge detection results.\n\n- `edge_capture_wr_strobe`: Wire computed as a logical condition involving `chipselect`, `write_n`, and `address`.

                    "text": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_key. \n\nModule specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_key is a Verilog module designed to serve as an interrupt system tied to an input port. It encompasses edge detection, capture, and masking functionality, thereby enabling interrupt signal generation.\n\nInput Ports: The module has seven input ports. `address`(2-bit) helps in selecting one of the registers for read operation. `chipselect` is for choosing the chip for read/write operations. `clk` is the system clock. The 4-bit `in_port` inputs data into the system. `reset_n` resets the system when set to 0. `write_n` and `writedata` (32-bit) together facilitate write operations.\n\nOutput Ports: The module has two output ports. `irq` emits an interrupt signal based on particular conditions within the system. `readdata` (32-bit) outputs the data read from the registers, assigned through an internal mux operation.\n\nInternal Signals: Various internal signals are employed. `clk_en` is a static wire used in clock-enabled operations within always blocks. `data_in` is a direct representation of the `in_port` states. `d1_data_in`, `d2_data_in`, act as delayed versions of `data_in` aiding in edge detection. The detected edges are captured in `edge_capture` while `irq_mask` holds mask values for the generation of `irq`. `edge_capture_wr_strobe` signals when to write or reset `edge_capture`. `read_mux_out` is a multiplexer output used in assigning `readdata`.\n\nBlocks in Code: The blocks primarily manage data read/write operations, edge detection, edge capture and reset, IRQ mask handling, and IRQ generation. The read operations, assigned based on `address`, include input signals, interrupt flags, and edge captures. Edge detection compares `data_in` with its delayed versions. Edge capture happens based on detection results or reset when certain write strobe conditions are met. IRQ mask intervenes when there is a need for masking specific bits in edge detection. Finally, `irq` is generated by a bitwise OR operation on the masked edge captures."
