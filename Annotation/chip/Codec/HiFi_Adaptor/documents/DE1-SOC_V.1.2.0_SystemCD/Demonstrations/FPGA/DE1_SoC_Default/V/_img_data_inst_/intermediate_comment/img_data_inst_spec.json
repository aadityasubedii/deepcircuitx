    "spec": "Module name: img_data. Module specification: The 'img_data' module, instantiated as `img_data_inst`, is primarily designed for retrieving image data from memory, aligned for use in image processing applications. Key to its operation are its input ports 'address' and 'clock', and an output port 'q'. The 'address' port, connected via `address_sig`, is used to specify the exact memory location from which data should be accessed. This enables precise navigation through potentially large datasets. The 'clock' port, connected through `clock_sig`, ensures that the data retrieval is synchronized with the system's clock, coordinating the timing of data access with other system operations. The output data, after being retrieved based on the input address, is presented through the 'q' port, linked via `q_sig`. Internally, `address_sig` guides which memory location to access, `clock_sig` controls the timing of these accesses, and `q_sig` outputs the fetched data. This module does not explicitly reveal various blocks or sections in the provided code snippet, but the instantiation and connection of signals suggest it operates primarily as a data access point in a broader image processing system, interfacing with memory to supply necessary data for further analysis or processing.",

It uses the `address` signal (`address_sig`) to look up data, which is synchronized by a `clock` signal (`clock_sig`). The output data from the module is available on the `q` signal (`q_sig`).
