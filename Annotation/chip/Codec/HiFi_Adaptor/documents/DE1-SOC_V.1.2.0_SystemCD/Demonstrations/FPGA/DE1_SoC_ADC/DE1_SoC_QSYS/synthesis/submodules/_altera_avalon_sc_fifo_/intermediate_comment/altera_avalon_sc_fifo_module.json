    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable FIFO buffer for Altera's Avalon interface, supporting packet handling, error signaling, and multiple channels. It uses either flip-flops or memory blocks for data storage, with customizable depth and width. The module manages read/write operations, tracks FIFO status, and handles packet-based data flow. It includes optional features like store-and-forward mechanism, almost full/empty flags, and error handling, controlled via configuration parameters and CSR operations."
