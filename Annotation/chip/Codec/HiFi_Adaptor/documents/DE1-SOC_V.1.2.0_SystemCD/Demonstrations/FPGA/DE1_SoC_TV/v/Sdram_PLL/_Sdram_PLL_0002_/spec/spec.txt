Module name: Sdram_PLL_0002. Module specification: The Sdram_PLL_0002 is a Verilog module that employs an Altera Phase Locked Loop (PLL) to generate three distinct output clock signals from a single reference clock input, designed specifically for SDRAM operations. It features input ports `refclk` and `rst`, where `refclk` serves as the reference clock for the PLL, and `rst` is used to reset the PLL to its initial state under specific conditions. The output ports include `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`, all of which are configured with different frequencies and phase shifts, and a `locked` signal that indicates the PLL locking status. The key internal element in this module is the `altera_pll` instance which is set up with various parameters such as clock frequencies and phase shifts to produce the necessary output clocks and monitor the lock status. There are no explicitly declared internal signals as the module interfaces directly through its ports, with all functionalities embedded within the instantiated PLL block. This module is crucial in applications requiring precise clock generation and synchronization such as memory interfaces in digital hardware systems.
