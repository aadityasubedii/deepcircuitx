    "module": "Module-level comment: The Line_Buffer is a Verilog module acting as a shift register with a tap for Cyclone V FPGA. It takes a 16-bit input, shifts it, and outputs both the shifted data and a tapped intermediate value, controlled via clock signals and enabled by a clock enable signal. Internal wiring connects outputs from the altshift_taps component (with specified RAM and tap settings) to the module's outputs."
