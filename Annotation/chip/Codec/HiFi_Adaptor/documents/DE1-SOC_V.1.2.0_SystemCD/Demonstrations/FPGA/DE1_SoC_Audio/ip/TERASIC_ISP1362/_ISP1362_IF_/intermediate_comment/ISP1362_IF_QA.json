It includes host controller (HC) and device controller (DC) interfaces for managing USB data transfers. The module receives and sends data, addresses, control signals, read and write commands, chip selection signals, clock signals, and reset signals from both the HC and DC units to the USB. It also handles output signals for interrupt requests. The main functionalities include data and address multiplexing between the two controllers based on chip select signals, managing of read and write operations, and forwarding interrupt signals from the USB to the respective controllers."
