Module-level comment: The 'audio_nios_altpll_audio' module generates an 18.432 MHz clock from a 50 MHz source using a PLL tailored for audio applications. It uses the `altera_pll` instance with configured parameters for achieving precise frequency settings, supporting reset functionality and output stabilization. The design includes provisions for multiple outputs but is optimized for a single output clock and lock status indication.
