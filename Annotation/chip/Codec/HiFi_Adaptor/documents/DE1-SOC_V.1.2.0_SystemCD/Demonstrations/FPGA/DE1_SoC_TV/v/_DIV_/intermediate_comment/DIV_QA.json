It takes a numerator (`numer`) and a denominator (`denom`) as inputs and calculates the division result, producing a quotient and a remainder.

The division is processed in a pipelined architecture for efficiency and supports an asynchronous clear (`aclr`) and a clock input (`clock`) for synchronized operations."
