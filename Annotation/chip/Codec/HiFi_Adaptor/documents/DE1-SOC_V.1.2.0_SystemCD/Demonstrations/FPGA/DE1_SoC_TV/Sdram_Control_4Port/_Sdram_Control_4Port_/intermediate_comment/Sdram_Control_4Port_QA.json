It incorporates functionalities to control these operations using a state machine and various timing/flag considerations involving input and output FIFOs tailored for the different ports. The module is integral in handling SDRAM command executions such as read, write, refresh, precharge, and accessing data through specific addresses while also supporting synchronous operations via SDRAM clock signals generated by an internal PLL. This setup helps in interfacing with SDRAM to perform required memory operations efficiently in a digital hardware setup."
