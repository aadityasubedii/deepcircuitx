Module name: command.

Module specification: The `command` module is responsible for managing various operations in an SDRAM controller, such as read, write, refresh, precharge, and initialization through the control and timing signals it generates according to input commands. The module accepts the following input ports: CLK (clock signal), RESET_N (reset signal), SADDR (system address), NOP (no operation), READA (read command), WRITEA (write command), REFRESH (refresh command), PRECHARGE (precharge command), LOAD_MODE (load mode command), REF_REQ (refresh request), INIT_REQ (initialization request), PM_STOP (power management stop), and PM_DONE (power management done). Output ports include REF_ACK (refresh acknowledge), CM_ACK (command acknowledge), OE (output enable), SA (SDRAM address), BA (bank address), CS_N (chip select), CKE (clock enable), RAS_N (row address strobe), CAS_N (column address strobe), and WE_N (write enable). 

Internally, flags such as do_reada, do_writea, do_refresh, etc., manage the activation state of their respective operations, while registers like command_delay and rw_shift handle timing and sequential logic aspects of these operations. The module also decodes the system address input to specify row, column, and bank addresses. 

The design of module is segmented into blocks handling specific functionalities: one block manages the reset and state setup for various operations (read, write, refresh, etc.); another manages output enable and transitions based on module state and timing control. Another block is focused on setting up address and chip select signals depending on the operation being executed. The refresh acknowledge and command acknowledge outputs are managed in a dedicated section which also checks conditions for enabling these signals based on input requests and ongoing operations. This structured approach facilitates efficient SDRAM operations catering to timing, control, and data integrity requirements.
