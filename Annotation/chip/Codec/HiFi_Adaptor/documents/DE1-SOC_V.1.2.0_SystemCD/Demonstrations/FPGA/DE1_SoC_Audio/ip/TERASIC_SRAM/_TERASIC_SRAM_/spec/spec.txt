Module name: TERASIC_SRAM. 
Module specification: The TERASIC_SRAM module serves as an interface between a generic system bus and an SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) device, facilitating address mapping, data transfers, and control signal operations. It is designed to handle read and write operations conditioned by control inputs like chip select (s_chipselect_n), write enable (s_write_n), and output enable (s_read_n). Key input ports include the clock (clk), asynchronous reset (reset_n), chip select (s_chipselect_n), byte enable (s_byteenable_n), write and read enable signals (s_write_n, s_read_n), address bus (s_address), and write data bus (s_writedata). The outputs comprise the read data bus (s_readdata), and control signals leading to the SRAM including chip enable (SRAM_CE_n), output enable (SRAM_OE_n), lower and upper byte enable (SRAM_LB_n, SRAM_UB_n), write enable (SRAM_WE_n), address bus (SRAM_ADDR), and the bidirectional data bus (SRAM_DQ). Internal signals are mostly direct mappings from inputs, such as SRAM_ADDR from s_address, or derived like {SRAM_UB_n, SRAM_LB_n} from s_byteenable_n. These handle enabling bytes, data transfer directions, and activating the SRAM for reading or writing based on bus instructions. The code has sections for parameter definitions, port declarations, and continuous assignments reflecting direct connections and conditional logic for data flow within the SRAM interface.
