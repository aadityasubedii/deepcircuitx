Module name: SEG_HEX. Module specification: The SEG_HEX module is designed to convert a 4-bit binary input (`iDIG`) representing a hexadecimal digit, to a 7-bit output pattern (`oHEX_D`) that controls a seven-segment display. The input port `iDIG` accepts a 4-bit binary number, which is processed by combinational logic to produce an output that represents the hexadecimal digit in a visual format on the seven-segment display. The output port `oHEX_D` is a 7-bit signal where each bit controls an individual segment of the display, determining whether each segment is on or off. The module uses an internal 7-bit register `oHEX_D` that holds the pattern to display the corresponding hexadecimal character based on the input value. Inside the module, there is an always block triggered by changes in `iDIG`. This block contains a case statement that maps each possible 4-bit input value to a specific 7-bit output pattern, updating `oHEX_D` accordingly. The default case is also defined to handle any unspecified input, ensuring the module's robustness.
