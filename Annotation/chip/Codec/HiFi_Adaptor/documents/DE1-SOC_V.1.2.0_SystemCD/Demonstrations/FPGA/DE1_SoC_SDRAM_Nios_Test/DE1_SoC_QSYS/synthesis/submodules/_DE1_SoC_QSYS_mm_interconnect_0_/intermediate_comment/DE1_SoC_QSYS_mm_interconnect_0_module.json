It uses address routers, demultiplexers, width \nadapters, and arbitration logic to handle data transfers between components with different \nbus widths and protocols. The module routes addresses, adapts data widths, manages bursts, \nand arbitrates between multiple masters and slaves, ensuring efficient system-wide communication.\n*/"
