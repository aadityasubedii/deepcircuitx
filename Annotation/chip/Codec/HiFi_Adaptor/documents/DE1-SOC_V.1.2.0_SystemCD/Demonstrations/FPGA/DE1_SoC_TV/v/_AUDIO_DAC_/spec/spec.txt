Module name: AUDIO_DAC

Module specification: The "AUDIO_DAC" module is a versatile audio data generation system designed for interfacing with various memory types like Flash, SDRAM, and SRAM, as well as generating synthetic sine waves. The module takes input data from these memories through ports iFLASH_DATA, iSDRAM_DATA, and iSRAM_DATA, under control settings specified by iSrc_Select. Other inputs include an 18.4 MHz clock iCLK_18_4 and an active-low reset iRST_N. For outputs, the module provides memory addresses (oFLASH_ADDR, oSDRAM_ADDR, oSRAM_ADDR) to specify where to read the next audio data. Processed audio data is delivered through oAUD_DATA, synchronized by two clocks oAUD_BCK (bit clock) and oAUD_LRCK (left-right clock). Internally, the module uses registers like BCK_DIV, LRCK_DIV (1X, 2X, 4X) for clock management, and FLASH_Cont, SDRAM_Cont, SRAM_Cont for managing corresponding memory addresses. Audio output is handled by a clock-driven process that selects and formats the audio data from the current input source determined by iSrc_Select. Additional registers Sin_Out, FLASH_Out, SDRAM_Out, and SRAM_Out store the prepared audio output data, temporarily held by *_Out_Tmp registers during transfer phases. RESET conditions are managed to reset all counters and registers to their initial states. This module effectively manages the synchronization aspects and the routing or mixing of audio data drawn from either memory or generated internally, making it suitable for audio playback systems that require input from mixed audio sources.
