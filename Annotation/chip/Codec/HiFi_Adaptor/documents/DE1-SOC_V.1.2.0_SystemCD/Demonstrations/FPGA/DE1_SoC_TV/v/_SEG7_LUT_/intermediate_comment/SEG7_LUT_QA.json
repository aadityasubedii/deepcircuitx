It outputs a 7-bit signal (oSEG) where each bit corresponds to a specific segment of the display. The `always` block processes the input digit and sets the output accordingly to display the correct numeral or hexadecimal character on the seven-segment display."

This input is used to select which numeral or hexadecimal character (0-F) should be displayed on the seven-segment display.\n\nOutput ports: oSEG. Explanation: The output port oSEG is a 7-bit signal where each bit corresponds to one segment of a seven-segment display (a-g). Depending on the input iDIG, the appropriate configuration of segments is set on oSEG to display the correct character on the seven-segment display. The signal is active low, meaning that a '0' in a bit position turns that specific segment on the display on."

Explanation: The internal signal, oSEG, is a 7-bit register that holds the segment control signals for the seven-segment display. In the module, oSEG's bits each represent a segment of the seven-segment display (from segment 'a' to 'g'). The content of oSEG is determined based on the value of the input signal iDIG. The bits in the oSEG are set accordingly to represent numerals and hexadecimal characters on the display. This register is critical as it directly interfaces with the display hardware to control which segments are illuminated."
