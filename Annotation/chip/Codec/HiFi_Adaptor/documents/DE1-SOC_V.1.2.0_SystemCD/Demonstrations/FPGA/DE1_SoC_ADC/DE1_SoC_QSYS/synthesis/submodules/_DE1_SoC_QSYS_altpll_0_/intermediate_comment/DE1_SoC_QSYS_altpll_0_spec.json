The module features input ports: 'refclk,' a reference clock signal that acts as the baseline frequency for the PLL, and 'rst,' a reset input to clear the PLL configuration. The outputs include 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1,' which provide clock frequencies of 100 MHz and 40 MHz respectively, and a 'locked' signal that indicates whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the 'refclk.' Internally, the module has signals 'fboutclk,' an unused feedback output clock, and 'fbclk,' which is tied to logic zero, signifying the absence of dynamic feedback in the PLL operation. The module utilizes an `altera_pll` block, which is parameterized to specify the clock generation requirements and connected to handle resetting, outputs, and feedback mechanisms. This setup aids in establishing different clock domains for various system components efficiently and reliably.",

It utilizes an Altera-specific PLL component (altera_pll) to generate two different output clock frequencies from a single reference clock input (refclk). The first output clock (outclk_0) is set to 100 MHz, and the second output clock (outclk_1) is set to 40 MHz, both with a 50% duty cycle and no phase shift. Additionally, the module outputs a 'locked' signal indicating whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the input reference clock frequency. The module also includes a reset input (rst) that resets the PLL configuration. This setup can be used in digital circuits where multiple clock domains are necessary, such as for different parts of a system operating at different frequencies."
