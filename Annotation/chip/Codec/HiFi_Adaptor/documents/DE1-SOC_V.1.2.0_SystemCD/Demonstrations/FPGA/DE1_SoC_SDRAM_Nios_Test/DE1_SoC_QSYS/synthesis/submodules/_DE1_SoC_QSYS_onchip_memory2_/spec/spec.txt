Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_onchip_memory2. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_onchip_memory2 serves as a memory block tailored for interfacing with the DE1-SoC development board, providing efficient read and write memory operations. Its primary functionality revolves around accessing on-chip memory using several I/O ports; `readdata` [31:0] outputs the data read from memory, while inputs include `address` [14:0], specifying the memory address; `byteenable` [3:0], for byte-level control during writes; `chipselect`, a control enabling memory operations; `clk`, the system clock; `clken`, the conditional clock enable signal; `reset`, an asynchronous reset; `reset_req`, a conditional reset request; `write`, determining if a write operation should occur; and `writedata` [31:0] for input data to be written. Internal signals like `clocken0`, a calculated clock enable dependent on `clken` and `reset_req`, and `wren` — enabled at the conjunction of `chipselect` and `write` — govern memory operation timings and write permissions respectively. The module incorporates `altsyncram`, an Altera (Intel) synchronous RAM block, wired to facilitate specific memory operations. Parameters like the initial memory contents from `DE1_SoC_QSYS_onchip_memory2.hex`, and various descriptors of the memory's behavior and structure (e.g., size, operational mode, and data path configurations) are defined to optimize memory utilization and interface with the rest of the system. This setup ensures that the module can efficiently manage read and write operations under various system conditions.
