Module name: altera_reset_controller.

Module specification: The 'altera_reset_controller' is a Verilog module designed to manage and synchronize reset signals in digital systems, particularly useful in FPGA or ASIC environments. The input ports include sixteen 'reset_inX' signals, which are individual reset inputs that are merged based on configuration settings, sixteen 'reset_req_inX' input signals for managing conditional reset requests, and a 'clk' input for clock synchronization. The output ports consist of 'reset_out', a synchronized reset output signal, and 'reset_req', an output reset request signal. Internal signals such as 'merged_reset' and 'merged_reset_req_in' combine multiple individual input signals, while 'reset_out_pre' and 'reset_req_pre' store intermediate states of these signals post-synchronization but before final output conditioning. Networks such as 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain' and 'r_sync_rst_chain' are used to stabilize and delay signals to handle metastability and timing requirements. The module utilizes conditional generating blocks, specified using Verilog 'generate' and 'if' constructs, to adapt its behavior based on parameter settings. These include synchronizing reset signals to the clock edge, managing early reset actions, and additional configurations for reset request handling. This structured and parameterized approach ensures flexibility and robustness in managing reset operations across varied system requirements.
