    "spec": "Module name: VGA_Audio. Module specification: The VGA_Audio module is designed to generate multiple clock signals for VGA and audio equipment, relying on an instance of the sub-module VGA_Audio_0002 to provide frequency synthesis or division from an input reference clock. The module accepts two input ports: 'refclk', the reference clock which serves as the baseline timing source, and 'rst', a reset signal to reinitialize the module's state. It outputs three clock signals: 'outclk_0', 'outclk_1', and 'outclk_2', each potentially tailored for specific VGA or audio subsystems, as well as a 'locked' signal indicating the stability and readiness of these clocks. Internally, the VGA_Audio module does not define additional signals but directly interfaces the input and output ports with the VGA_Audio_0002 sub-module. This architecture simplifies the module design, encapsulating all detailed clock management and stability control within the sub-module itself. The primary functional block in the code is the instantiation of VGA_Audio_0002, routing input signals to it, and channeling its output to the VGA_Audio's outputs, thereby making the code compact and focused on interfacing and signal routing.",

It utilizes an instance of another module, presumably a PLL or clock generator, named VGA_Audio_0002. This instance takes a reference clock (refclk) and a reset signal (rst) as inputs and provides three different output clocks (outclk_0, outclk_1, and outclk_2) along with a lock indicator (locked). The lock indicator typically signifies that the output clocks are stable and the module is functioning as expected."
