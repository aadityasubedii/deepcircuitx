Module name: DE1_SoC_PS2_DEMO. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_PS2_DEMO is a demonstration module implemented on the DE1-SoC board to facilitate interfacing with PS/2 devices and managing VGA display outputs. The module is equipped with various input and output ports facilitating these interfaces: Input ports like CLOCK_50 for system timing, KEY for handling user inputs, PS2_CLK and PS2_DAT for PS/2 device communication, and TD_* pins for TV Decoder inputs which determine certain conditions such as the triggering action. Output ports include ADC control signals, audio codec controls, outputs to DRAM, VGA outputs like VGA_B, VGA_G, VGA_R for color signals, and HEX0 to HEX5 for seven-segment display outputs. Internal signals such as HEX0P to HEX5P and 'action' are specified, where 'action' is derived from the TD_HS, TD_CLK27, and TD_DATA signals indicating a specific triggering condition. The module comprises a submodule, 'ps2', handling the PS/2 data to influence LED outputs and the HEX displays; signals VGA_BLANK_N and VGA_SYNC_N are set high, establishing constant parameters for VGA output. The module demonstrates robust interconnectivity and device interfacing on the FPGA, showcasing peripheral control through I/O operations and subsystem interactions.
