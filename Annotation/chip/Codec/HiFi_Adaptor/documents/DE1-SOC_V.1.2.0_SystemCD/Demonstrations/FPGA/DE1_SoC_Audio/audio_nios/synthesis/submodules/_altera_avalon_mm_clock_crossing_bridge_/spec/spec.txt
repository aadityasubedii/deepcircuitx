Module name: altera_avalon_mm_clock_crossing_bridge.

Module specification: The `altera_avalon_mm_clock_crossing_bridge` module serves as a bridge facilitating clock domain crossing for Avalon memory-mapped interfaces, efficiently transferring data between a source (s0) and a master (m0) domain. It features input ports such as `s0_clk`, `s0_reset`, `m0_clk`, `m0_reset`, which are clocks and resets for both domains, control and data signals like `s0_writedata`, `s0_address`, `s0_write`, `s0_read` for source domain operations, and status signals such as `m0_waitrequest`, `m0_readdata` from the master domain. The output ports consist of signals like `s0_waitrequest`, `s0_readdata`, which indicate transaction status back to the source domain, and `m0_burstcount`, `m0_writedata` that carry command details to the master domain. Internal signals such as `s0_cmd_payload`, `m0_cmd_payload` handle packed command details, while `s0_cmd_valid`, `m0_cmd_valid` are validation signals. Control flow is managed by signals like `pending_read_count` and `stop_cmd`, ensuring proper synchronization and data integrity. The code includes two main blocks: command and response FIFOs, which are implemented using `altera_avalon_dc_fifo` components handling data queuing and synchronization, and control structures like `generate` and `always` blocks handling specific conditions like non-bursting modes or command and response management. This structure ensures efficient and error-free data transmission across different clock domains.
