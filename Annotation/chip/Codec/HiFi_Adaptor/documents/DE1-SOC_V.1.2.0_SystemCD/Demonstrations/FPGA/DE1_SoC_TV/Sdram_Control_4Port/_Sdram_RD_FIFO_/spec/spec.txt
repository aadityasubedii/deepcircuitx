Module name: Sdram_RD_FIFO. Module specification: The Sdram_RD_FIFO is a Verilog module designed as a dual-clock FIFO buffer to interface with SDRAM across different clock domains. It employs one clock for read operations (rdclk) and another for write operations (wrclk), managing data transfers using input ports including aclr (asynchronous clear), data (16-bit input for data writing), rdreq (read request), and wrreq (write request). The outputs of the module are q (16-bit data output upon read request), rdempty (indicates empty FIFO), rdusedw (9-bit count of words available for read), wrfull (indicates full FIFO), and wrusedw (9-bit count of words waiting to be read). Internal signals like sub_wire0 to sub_wire4 act as intermediaries mapping the module's operational status and data flow, linking input activities to output responses. Within the Verilog code, the dcfifo component, parameterized specifically for Cyclone V FPGA with various configurations, plays a pivotal role, handling principal functionalities of FIFO operations, including data queue management and status signaling, with overflow, underflow checking, and synchronization settings. This module encapsulates the complexities of asynchronous FIFO operations making it ideal for real-time applications requiring efficient and separate read/write operations in FPGA implementations.
