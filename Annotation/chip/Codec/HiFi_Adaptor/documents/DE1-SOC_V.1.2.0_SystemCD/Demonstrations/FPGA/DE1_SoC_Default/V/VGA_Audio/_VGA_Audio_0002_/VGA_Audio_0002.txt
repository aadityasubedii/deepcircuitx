Module-level comment: The VGA_Audio_0002 module utilizes an Altera PLL to generate three distinct synchronized output clocks from a single reference clock (`refclk`). It features a reset (`rst`) and outputs (`outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`, `locked`). Configuration of the PLL includes predefined frequencies, phases, and duty cycles, facilitating stable and diverse clock management integral for complex digital systems.
