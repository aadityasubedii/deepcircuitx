It utilizes an Altera-specific PLL configuration block to generate multiple clock outputs with different frequencies and phase shifts, based on a reference clock input. The PLL ensures that the output clocks are synchronized with the reference clock, which is crucial for applications involving SDRAM to maintain data integrity and synchronization. The module takes a reference clock and a reset signal as inputs and provides three output clocks along with a locked signal indicating the PLL locking status."

It serves as the basic timing source for the PLL.\n- `rst` (Reset): This signal is used to reset the PLL. When this signal is active, it initializes the PLL configuration, ensuring that it starts in a known state whenever required.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`, `locked`.\nExplanation:\n- `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`: These are the output clocks from the PLL. The PLL module outputs these clocks with different frequencies and phase settings defined in its parameters. These clocks are used to drive different parts of a system that require synchronized clocks with the reference clock.\n- `locked`: This signal indicates the lock status of the PLL. It goes high to indicate that the PLL has successfully synchronized its output clocks to the reference clock. This is a crucial indicator for the reliable operation of systems relying on these clocks, as it confirms that the output is stable and ready for use."
