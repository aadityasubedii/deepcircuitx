Module name: I2C_Controller.

Module specification: The I2C_Controller is a Verilog module designed to function as an I2C master controller, handling data transmission over an I2C bus. The module's primary role is to interface with slave devices on the bus through serial data (SDAT) and clock (SCLK) lines, coordinating the start condition, byte-level data sending, clock signal generation, and slave acknowledgements. It utilizes a state machine driven by `SD_COUNTER` to manage operations, which includes controlling clock transitions, sequencing data transmission, and handling acknowledgments. The module supports both write and read transactions indicated by the `W_R` signal and concludes transactions with an `END` signal. Key input ports include `CLOCK` (main timing signal), `I2C_DATA` (24-bit data for transmission), `GO` (starts the transmission process), `RESET` (resets the module), and `W_R` (determines whether the operation is read or write). Outputs include `I2C_SCLK`, `I2C_SDAT`, `END`, `ACK` (acknowledgment from the slave), `SD_COUNTER` (state counter output) and `SDO` (controls SDAT line state). Internal signals like `SDO`, `SCLK`, `END`, `SD` (stores the serial data), and `ACK1`, `ACK2`, `ACK3` (collect acknowledgment bits) are utilized to manage data flow and states. The code is divided into blocks handling asynchronous reset conditions, state progressions, and specific actions associated with each state step, such as loading data, managing clocks, and handling acknowledgments from slave devices. This structured approach ensures efficient I2C protocol management and robust data communication functionality in digital systems utilizing the I2C standard.
