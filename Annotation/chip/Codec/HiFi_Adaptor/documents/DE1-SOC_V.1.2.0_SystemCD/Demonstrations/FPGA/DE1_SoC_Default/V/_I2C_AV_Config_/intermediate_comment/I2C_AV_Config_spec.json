    "spec": "Module name: I2C_AV_Config. Module specification: The I2C_AV_Config module is designed to configure audio and video settings through the I2C protocol by utilizing a lookup table containing specific configurations. The module has two input ports: iCLK, which is the system clock that drives the timing of internal operations, and iRST_N, an active-low reset that initializes internal states. It outputs two signals: I2C_SCLK, the clock for I2C synchronization, and I2C_SDAT, a bidirectional data line for I2C communication. Internally, the module employs several signals: mI2C_CLK_DIV for dividing the input clock to generate an appropriate I2C clock, mI2C_DATA storing data for transmission, mI2C_CTRL_CLK controlling the I2C clock, mI2C_GO to trigger transmission start, mI2C_END indicating the completion of transmission, mI2C_ACK for acknowledging data reception, LUT_DATA holding configuration data from the lookup table, LUT_INDEX tracking the current entry in the table, and mSetup_ST managing the state of the configuration process. The module's operation is segmented into blocks responsible for clock division, I2C communication set up and control through an I2C_Controller instance, and lookup table management for selecting pertinent configuration data based on the current state and responses from the I2C bus. These blocks collectively enable the dynamic and controlled configuration of external audio and video settings directly via the I2C bus.",

The module generates an I2C clock by dividing the input clock frequency to match the desired I2C frequency for data transmission.

It counts up to a calculated threshold based on the input clock frequency and the desired I2C frequency, then resets to zero, toggling the mI2C_CTRL_CLK each time it resets. This helps in generating a slower clock for the I2C operations from the faster input system clock.\n- **mI2C_DATA**: This register holds the data that is to be transmitted over the I2C bus. It is loaded with the respective data from the lookup table (LUT_DATA) based on the current setting being configured.\n- **mI2C_CTRL_CLK**: This is a control clock specifically derived for the I2C operations. It toggles at a frequency suitable for the I2C communication, derived by dividing the system clock as per the I2C specification requirements. This clock signal drives the I2C_Controller module's operations.\n- **mI2C_GO**: This is a control signal sent to the I2C controller to initiate the start of an I2C data transmission. It is set high when the module is ready to send data and reset once the transmission is acknowledged or ended.\n- **mI2C_END**: This wire signal is from the I2C controller, indicating the completion of an I2C data transmission session. It is used to control state transitions within the finite state machine managing the I2C communication setup and execution.\n- **mI2C_ACK**: This wire signal indicates whether the last piece of data transmitted over I2C was acknowledged by the receiver. This feedback is crucial for error handling and flow control in the communication process.\n- **LUT_DATA**: This register holds the current data entry fetched from the lookup table, which comprises configuration settings for audio or video. This data is then loaded into mI2C_DATA for transmission.\n- **LUT_INDEX**: This register serves as a pointer or index to the current entry within the lookup table that is being accessed. It is incremented after each successful data transmission or when a retry is needed due to a non-acknowledgement.\n- **mSetup_ST**: This is a finite state machine control register that holds the state of the setup process in configuring the I2C communication and data preparation. It maneuvers through data setup, data sending, acknowledgment waiting, and error handling or incremental indexing in the LUT."

                    "text": "Module name: I2C_AV_Config. Module specification: The I2C_AV_Config module is designed to configure audio and video settings through the I2C protocol by utilizing a lookup table containing specific configurations. The module has two input ports: iCLK, which is the system clock that drives the timing of internal operations, and iRST_N, an active-low reset that initializes internal states. It outputs two signals: I2C_SCLK, the clock for I2C synchronization, and I2C_SDAT, a bidirectional data line for I2C communication. Internally, the module employs several signals: mI2C_CLK_DIV for dividing the input clock to generate an appropriate I2C clock, mI2C_DATA storing data for transmission, mI2C_CTRL_CLK controlling the I2C clock, mI2C_GO to trigger transmission start, mI2C_END indicating the completion of transmission, mI2C_ACK for acknowledging data reception, LUT_DATA holding configuration data from the lookup table, LUT_INDEX tracking the current entry in the table, and mSetup_ST managing the state of the configuration process. The module's operation is segmented into blocks responsible for clock division, I2C communication set up and control through an I2C_Controller instance, and lookup table management for selecting pertinent configuration data based on the current state and responses from the I2C bus. These blocks collectively enable the dynamic and controlled configuration of external audio and video settings directly via the I2C bus."
