It utilizes an Altera-specific PLL component (altera_pll) to generate two different output clock frequencies from a single reference clock input (refclk). The first output clock (outclk_0) is set to 100 MHz, and the second output clock (outclk_1) is set to 40 MHz, both with a 50% duty cycle and no phase shift. Additionally, the module outputs a 'locked' signal indicating whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the input reference clock frequency. The module also includes a reset input (rst) that resets the PLL configuration. This setup can be used in digital circuits where multiple clock domains are necessary, such as for different parts of a system operating at different frequencies."
