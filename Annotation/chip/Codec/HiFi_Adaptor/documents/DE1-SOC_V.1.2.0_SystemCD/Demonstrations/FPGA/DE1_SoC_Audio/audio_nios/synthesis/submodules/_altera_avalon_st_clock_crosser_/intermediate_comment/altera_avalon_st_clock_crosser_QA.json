It handles the complexities of clock domain crossing by synchronizing the data transfer to avoid metastability issues. The data is temporarily stored in buffers, and toggle flags are used to manage and track the data transmission state. The module provides optional output pipelining configured through a parameter, enhancing flexibility for different use cases. Special attributes are used for suppressing specific design rule checks and defining false path constraints for proper timing analysis."

It synchronizes the operations in the input side of the module.\n- `in_reset`: Explanation: This is the asynchronous reset signal for the input domain, used to reset the input-related states to their initial conditions.\n- `in_valid`: Explanation: This is a control signal indicating when the data on the `in_data` port is valid and ready to be transferred.\n- `in_data`: Explanation: This is the actual input data to be transferred to the output domain. Its width is determined by `DATA_WIDTH`, which is computed from the module parameters.\n- `out_clk`: Explanation: This is the clock signal for the output domain. It synchronizes the operations on the output side of the module.\n- `out_reset`: Explanation: This is the asynchronous reset signal for the output domain, used to reset the output-related states to their initial conditions.\n- `out_ready`: Explanation: This is a control signal provided by the downstream logic indicating that it is ready to accept data from this module.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `in_ready`: Explanation: This is a control signal that indicates whether the module is ready to accept new input data. It helps manage flow control between the input data source and the module.\n- `out_valid`: Explanation: This is a control signal indicating that the output data on the `out_data` port is valid and ready for the downstream logic to process.\n- `out_data`: Explanation: This is the actual data being output from the module after being transferred across the clock domains.
