Module name: audio_fifo. 
Module specification: The `audio_fifo` is a Verilog module designed primarily as a dual-clock FIFO buffer to manage audio data across different clock domains effectively, using a `dcfifo` component optimized for the Cyclone IV E family. It includes a collection of input ports: `aclr` for asynchronously clearing the FIFO, `data` as a 32-bit input bus for audio data, `rdclk` and `wrclk` as read and write clock signals, and `rdreq` and `wrreq` as signals to request read and write operations respectively. The output ports comprise `q`, a 32-bit output data bus, `rdempty` to signal an empty FIFO and `wrfull` to indicate a full FIFO. Internally, the module uses `sub_wire0`, `sub_wire1`, and `sub_wire2` to connect the state signals and the data output of the `dcfifo` component to the respective module output ports. The source code choreographs these operations through declarations of the inputs and outputs followed by instantiation of the `dcfifo` component, where parameters like the FIFO depth, data width, and operational behaviors such as overflow checking are configured. Additional design components include signal-specific tri-state management and a list of unused optional ports, highlighting the module's tailored configuration for robust and efficient audio data handling.
