    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable FIFO buffer with packet handling and error management capabilities. It uses parameterized memory arrays for data storage, read/write pointers for data management, and a CSR interface for dynamic configuration. The module supports various data widths, packet operations, and fill level monitoring, with options for store-and-forward functionality and almost-full/empty indicators. It handles data flow control, error checking, and provides flexible output timing options to accommodate different system requirements."
