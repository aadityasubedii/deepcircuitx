    "module": "Module-level comment: The Sdram_PLL is a PLL designed for SDRAM usage, generating three clocks from a reference signal. It takes a reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset signal (`rst`), outputs three clocks (`outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`). Internally, it uses the `Sdram_PLL_0002` submodule for all clock generation and stabilization, directly connecting I/O ports without internal signals."
