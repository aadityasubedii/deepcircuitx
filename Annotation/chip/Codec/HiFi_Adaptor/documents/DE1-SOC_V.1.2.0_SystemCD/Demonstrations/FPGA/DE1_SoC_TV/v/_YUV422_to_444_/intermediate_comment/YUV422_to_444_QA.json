The module takes a 16-bit input `iYCbCr` containing combined Y, Cb, and Cr components and outputs them separately as 8-bit values each for Y, Cb, and Cr depending on the value of `iX`. If the least significant bit of `iX` (iX[0]) is high, Y and Cr values are updated from `iYCbCr`; otherwise, Y and Cb values are updated. The updating only happens on the rising edge of the clock `iCLK` or if the reset `iRST_N` is not active low, indicating a reset condition wherein Y, Cb, and Cr are reset to zero."

Explanation: \n- iYCbCr: This is a 16-bit input port that carries combined Y, Cb, and Cr data, where depending on the value of iX, specific color components will be extracted and assigned.\n- iX: This is a 10-bit input used to determine how `iYCbCr` data will be split into individual color channels. Specifically, the least significant bit (iX[0]) decides which chrominance data (Cb or Cr) is updated along with the luminance (Y) data each clock cycle.\n- iCLK: Clock input. It dictates the timing of the data processing; data is latched and the module's internal registers are updated on the rising edge of this clock.\n- iRST_N: Asynchronous active low reset input. It resets the internal registers (mY, mCb, mCr) to zero when activated (low).\n\nOutput ports: [oY, oCb, oCr]. Explanation:\n- oY: 8-bit output port for the Y (luminance) component of the YUV color model. Updated from internal register `mY`.\n- oCb: 8-bit output port for the Cb (blue-difference chrominance) component. Updated from internal register `mCb`.\n- oCr: 8-bit output port for the Cr (red-difference chrominance) component. Updated from internal register `mCr`. \n\nThese outputs allow the module to output YUV 444 format data, which is useful for various video and image processing applications that require separate color channels with higher chrominance resolution compared to YUV 422."

Explanation: \n- mY: This is an 8-bit internal register used to store the luminance (Y) component of the YUV color space.
