It interfaces with each memory type, extracting data based on controlled address sequences, and outputs audio data through manipulation of audio-specific clock signals and data formatting logic. The module processes incoming source selection and generate audio outputs accordingly. The key functionalities include clock division to manage audio bit clock (BCK), left-right clock (LRCK) for synchronization, and audio data selection based on the input source type (e.g., synthetic sine wave, data from Flash, SDRAM, or SRAM). Controls for addressing and data retrieval from memory spaces are also managed within the module, allowing for sequential or pattern-based accessing of memory resources. The audio data output is formatted based on the source selection and clock synchronization signals, ensuring proper data timing and format for audio playback hardware."
