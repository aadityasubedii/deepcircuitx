    "module": "Module-level comment: The Sdram_PLL_0002 module configures a PLL for SDRAM applications using Altera's PLL block. It accepts `refclk` as the timing source and `rst` for initializing. The outputs include three synchronized clocks (`outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`) and a `locked` status. This is achieved through the `altera_pll` instance, handling internal PLL mechanics like frequency division and phase shifts, encapsulating complex functionalities in a simplified interface."
