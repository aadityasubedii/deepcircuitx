    "spec": "Module name: SEG7_LUT_8.\nModule specification: The `SEG7_LUT_8` module is designed to interface with six 7-segment displays by taking a 32-bit input (`iDIG`) and driving each display with a corresponding 7-bit output (`oSEG0` to `oSEG5`). Each output is connected to a sub-module `SEG7_LUT` that decodes 4 bits of `iDIG` into a 7-bit pattern that represents hexadecimal characters 0-9 and A-F for display purposes. Specifically, `oSEG0` is driven by the least significant 4 bits (bits [3:0]) of `iDIG`, and `oSEG5` by bits [23:20] respectively, covering different segments of `iDIG`. The module does not use explicit internal signals for routing or additional computation, as all necessary signal manipulations are handled directly through connections between `iDIG` and the `SEG7_LUT` instances. Moreover, the code defines six instantiations of `SEG7_LUT`, each mapped to successive 4-bit segments of `iDIG` and their respective outputs. This configuration depicts an efficient utilization of modular architecture for decoding and display purposes within digital systems using 7-segment indicators.",
