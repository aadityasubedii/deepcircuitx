Module name: **Sdram_Control**.
Module specification: The `Sdram_Control` module is designed for SDRAM interfacing and control, managing dual-channel operations for both reading and writing to SDRAM, while ensuring proper operation sequences including command issuing and address handling. The module inputs include a reference clock (`REF_CLK`), a reset signal (`RESET_N`), data and control signals for two write (`WR1`, `WR2`) and two read (`RD1`, `RD2`) channels, each channel endowed with signals like data (`WRx_DATA`, `RDx_DATA`), start address (`WRx_ADDR`, `RDx_ADDR`), max address (`WRx_MAX_ADDR`, `RDx_MAX_ADDR`), length of operations (`WRx_LENGTH`, `RDx_LENGTH`), and initiation signals (`WRx_LOAD`, `RDx_LOAD`). Outputs consist of flags and usage indicators for write and read buffers (`WRx_FULL`, `WRx_USE`, `RDx_EMPTY`, `RDx_USE`), and several SDRAM control and data signals (`SA`, `BA`, `CS_N`, `CKE`, `RAS_N`, `CAS_N`, `WE_N`, `DQ`, `DQM`). Internal signals like `mADDR`, `mLENGTH`, and various operational flags dictate the current state of memory transactions and direct the flow within the module.

Several distinct blocks within the code define the role and interactions of these signals and ports. The `sdram_pll0` instantiation generates necessary clock signals tailored for the SDRAM's timing requirements. `control_interface` and `command` set up and manage command sequences and responses, including initial configurations and execution commands for reading, writing, refreshing, and precharge operations. Data paths are manipulated via FIFO buffers handled by `Sdram_WR_FIFO` and `Sdram_RD_FIFO` for writing and reading data respectively, ensuring data integrity and availability as per operational demand. The FSM (Finite State Machine) implemented with procedural blocks (`always` statements) regulates transitions between states based on control signals and the SDRAM's feedback, managing operations such as data input requests and output validation effectively. This systematic management ensures robust control over the SDRAM interfacing, accommodating various operational scenarios dictated by the external system environment.
