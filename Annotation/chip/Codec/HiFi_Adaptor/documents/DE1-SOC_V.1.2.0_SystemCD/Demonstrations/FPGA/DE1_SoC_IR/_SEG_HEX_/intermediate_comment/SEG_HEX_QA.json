It achieves this translation using a combinational logic circuit embodied in a case statement, which maps each possible 4-bit hexadecimal input (from 0 to F) to a specific 7-bit output pattern. Each bit in the output pattern controls one segment of the display, either turning it on or off to represent the appropriate hexadecimal character."

Explanation: The input port `iDIG` is a 4-bit digital input that represents a hexadecimal digit. These bits are used as the input to drive the combinational logic which maps each combination of these 4 bits (representing hexadecimal numbers from 0 to F) to specific segments on a seven-segment display.\n\nOutput ports: oHEX_D. Explanation: The output port `oHEX_D` is a 7-bit register that drives the individual segments of a seven-segment display. Each bit in this 7-bit output corresponds to a certain segment of the display, controlling its on or off state in order to visually represent the hexadecimal digit input as specified by `iDIG`. The assignment of each bit to specific segments is defined and controlled using a combinational logic inside the module, which determines what pattern gets displayed based on the input hexadecimal value."

This register is updated based on the input value `iDIG` through a combinational logic implemented in the always block with a case statement.
