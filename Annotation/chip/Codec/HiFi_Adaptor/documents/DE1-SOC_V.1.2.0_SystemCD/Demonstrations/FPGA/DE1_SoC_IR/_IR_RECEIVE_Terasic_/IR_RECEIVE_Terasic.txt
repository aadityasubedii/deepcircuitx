Module-level comment: The IR_RECEIVE module decodes 32-bit data from IR signals using a state machine with IDLE, GUIDANCE, and DATAREAD states. It processes signals synchronized by a clock (iCLK), utilizing counters to manage state transitions and bit serialization based on signal durations. Outputs include a data-ready signal (oDATA_READY) and the decoded data (oDATA), ensuring reliable data reception and availability for external use.
