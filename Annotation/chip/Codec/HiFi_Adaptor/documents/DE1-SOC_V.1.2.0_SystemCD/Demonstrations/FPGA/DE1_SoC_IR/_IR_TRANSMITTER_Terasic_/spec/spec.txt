Module name: IR_TRANSMITTER_Terasic. Module specification: The IR_TRANSMITTER_Terasic is a Verilog module designed for infrared (IR) communication to transmit address and command data. It processes input signals from a 50 MHz clock (`iCLK_50`), an active low reset (`iRST_n`), an 8-bit address (`iADDRESS`), an 8-bit command (`iCOMMAND`), and a trigger signal (`iSEND`). The module outputs include a busy signal (`oIR_TX_BUSY`) indicating the operational state, and an IR signal (`oIRDA`) resulting from modulation of internal signal states with a 38 kHz clock. Internally, `oIRDA_out` controls the IR LED status, `tx_status` holds the state machine's current state, `send_data` comprises address and command information, `send_count` tracks transmitted bits, `time_count` ensures proper signal duration, `clk_38K_count` aids in the 38 kHz clock generation, and `clk_38K` is the generated clock for modulation. The code segments include initial setup, a clock generator for IR modulation, and a main transmission controller that manipulates transmission based on the defined protocol and timings through a series of states including idle, lead signal generation, and data transmission phases. This structured approach ensures the dependable delivery of IR communication adhering to specific timing requirements.
