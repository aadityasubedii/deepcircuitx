The PLL is configured with specific frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles for each output clock. The `locked` output indicates the status of the PLL, whether it is locked to the input reference clock or not. This module is typically used in digital clock management for generating multiple synchronized clock signals for different parts of a system."

It serves as the base frequency from which the PLL generates the output clocks. \n- `rst`: This is the reset input for the PLL. When asserted, it resets the configuration and state of the PLL, which can be helpful during initialization or error recovery.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`, `locked`.\nExplanation:\n- `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`: These are the output clock signals generated by the PLL. Each of these clocks can have different frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles as configured in the PLL settings. They can be used to drive different parts of a digital system that require synchronized clock signals at varying frequencies.\n- `locked`: This output signal indicates whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the input reference clock. A 'locked' status typically means that the PLL is providing stable and expected output frequencies, which is critical for reliable system operation."

The Verilog code does not show any internally generated or intermediate signals customarily used within the module for additional processing or logic circuitry. The module primarily configures and instantiates the `altera_pll` component, directly mapping the provided input and output ports to this PLL component. Thus, all critical functionality regarding clock signal generation and management is handled within the `altera_pll` block, not requiring additional internal signals within the `VGA_Audio_0002` module itself."
