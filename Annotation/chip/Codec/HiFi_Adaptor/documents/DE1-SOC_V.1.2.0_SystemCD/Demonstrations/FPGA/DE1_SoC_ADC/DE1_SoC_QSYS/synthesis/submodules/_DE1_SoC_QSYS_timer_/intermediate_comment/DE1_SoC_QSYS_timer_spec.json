    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_timer. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_timer is a hardware timer module primarily designed for usage in FPGA-based systems to provide timing and control functionalities. It processes input commands to start, stop, and configure the timer via a simple interface consisting of input ports including `address`, `chipselect`, `clk`, `reset_n`, `write_n`, and `writedata` and yields outputs via `irq` and `readdata`. `address` selects internal registers for operations, `chipselect` enables the module, `clk` drives the internal clock mechanisms, `reset_n` is a reset signal, `write_n` determines the operation mode (read or write), and `writedata` carries configuration data. The output `irq` sends an interrupt request and `readdata` outputs data from the selected register. Internally, the module uses signals like `control_continuous` for continuous mode operation, `control_interrupt_enable` for enabling interrupts, and `internal_counter` as the primary counter. Various control and status registers are also employed (`control_register`, `period_h_register`, `period_l_register`) to hold settings and timer values. The core behavior is managed in blocks conditioned on the clock and reset inputs that handle tasks such as updating the internal counter, processing commands to start/stop the counter, managing the periodic and timeout behaviors, and updating outputs based on register reads. Each block is purposefully designed to either update the internal state, react to input changes, or provide output based on the current configuration and state of the timer module. Overall, the design encapsulates a robust timing solution for embedded systems requiring precise time management and operation scheduling.",

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_timer is a hardware timer module primarily designed for usage in FPGA-based systems to provide timing and control functionalities. It processes input commands to start, stop, and configure the timer via a simple interface consisting of input ports including `address`, `chipselect`, `clk`, `reset_n`, `write_n`, and `writedata` and yields outputs via `irq` and `readdata`. `address` selects internal registers for operations, `chipselect` enables the module, `clk` drives the internal clock mechanisms, `reset_n` is a reset signal, `write_n` determines the operation mode (read or write), and `writedata` carries configuration data. The output `irq` sends an interrupt request and `readdata` outputs data from the selected register. Internally, the module uses signals like `control_continuous` for continuous mode operation, `control_interrupt_enable` for enabling interrupts, and `internal_counter` as the primary counter. Various control and status registers are also employed (`control_register`, `period_h_register`, `period_l_register`) to hold settings and timer values. The core behavior is managed in blocks conditioned on the clock and reset inputs that handle tasks such as updating the internal counter, processing commands to start/stop the counter, managing the periodic and timeout behaviors, and updating outputs based on register reads. Each block is purposefully designed to either update the internal state, react to input changes, or provide output based on the current configuration and state of the timer module. Overall, the design encapsulates a robust timing solution for embedded systems requiring precise time management and operation scheduling."
