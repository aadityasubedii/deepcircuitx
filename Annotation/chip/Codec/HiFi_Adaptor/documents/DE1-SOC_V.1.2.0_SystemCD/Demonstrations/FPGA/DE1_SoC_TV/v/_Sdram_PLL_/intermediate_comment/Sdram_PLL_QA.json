The PLL takes an input reference clock and a reset signal and generates three output clocks. These output clocks are likely differentiated by their phase or frequency to meet various timing requirements of an SDRAM system. The 'locked' output, typically used to indicate the PLL's lock status, is not connected in this instantiation."

It provides the baseline frequency from which the PLL generates its output clocks.\n- `rst`: This is the reset input, which is used to reset the internal state of the PLL. When asserted, it initializes the PLL and usually forces it into a known state or helps it re-acquire lock if lost.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`.\nExplanation:\n- `outclk_0`: This is one of the output clocks generated by the PLL. It could be configured to a specific frequency or phase that is suitable for certain operations in an SDRAM system.\n- `outclk_1`: This is another output clock from the PLL. Similar to `outclk_0`, it is likely set to a different frequency or phase to cater to various timing requirements.\n- `outclk_2`: This is the third output clock from the PLL, providing an additional timing option which might be used differently depending on the SDRAM system's specifications or requirements.\n\nThese ports collectively enable the PLL to generate multiple clock outputs from a single reference clock, each potentially configured for different aspects of SDRAM operation."
