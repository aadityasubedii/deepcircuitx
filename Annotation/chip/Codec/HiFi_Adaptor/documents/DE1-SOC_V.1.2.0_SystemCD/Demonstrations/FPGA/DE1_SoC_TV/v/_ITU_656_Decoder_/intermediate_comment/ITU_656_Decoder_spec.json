    "spec": "Module name: ITU_656_Decoder. \nModule specification: The ITU_656_Decoder is designed to process the ITU-R BT.656 video data stream in digital video systems, decoding 8-bit data to extract chrominance (Cb and Cr) and luminance (Y) values to form YCbCr color space output. It accepts inputs including the 8-bit video data (iTD_DATA), control signals to swap chrominance components (iSwap_CbCr) and skip processing (iSkip), a reset signal (iRST_N), and a clock signal (iCLK_27). The output from the module includes the YCbCr color data (oYCbCr), the current horizontal (oTV_X) and vertical (oTV_Y) pixel locations, a continuity counter (oTV_Cont), and a data validity flag (oDVAL). Internally, the module utilizes signals such as the 24-bit Window for detection of synchronization patterns, counters like Cont for horizontal pixel tracking, and various flags (Active_Video, Start, Data_Valid, Field, and FVAL) to manage the video stream processing. The code is organized into a main always block that handles reset conditions, updates internal registers and counters based on input conditions, and manages transitions from inactive to active video and between fields in the video stream. The block conditionally processes data based on capture and validity conditions, and manages counter resets and settings, reflecting the state of the incoming video data stream effectively.",

                    "text": "Module name: ITU_656_Decoder. \nModule specification: The ITU_656_Decoder is designed to process the ITU-R BT.656 video data stream in digital video systems, decoding 8-bit data to extract chrominance (Cb and Cr) and luminance (Y) values to form YCbCr color space output. It accepts inputs including the 8-bit video data (iTD_DATA), control signals to swap chrominance components (iSwap_CbCr) and skip processing (iSkip), a reset signal (iRST_N), and a clock signal (iCLK_27). The output from the module includes the YCbCr color data (oYCbCr), the current horizontal (oTV_X) and vertical (oTV_Y) pixel locations, a continuity counter (oTV_Cont), and a data validity flag (oDVAL). Internally, the module utilizes signals such as the 24-bit Window for detection of synchronization patterns, counters like Cont for horizontal pixel tracking, and various flags (Active_Video, Start, Data_Valid, Field, and FVAL) to manage the video stream processing. The code is organized into a main always block that handles reset conditions, updates internal registers and counters based on input conditions, and manages transitions from inactive to active video and between fields in the video stream. The block conditionally processes data based on capture and validity conditions, and manages counter resets and settings, reflecting the state of the incoming video data stream effectively."
