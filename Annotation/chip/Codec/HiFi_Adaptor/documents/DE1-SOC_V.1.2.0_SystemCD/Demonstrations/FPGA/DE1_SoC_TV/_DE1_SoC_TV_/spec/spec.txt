Module name: DE1_SoC_TV. 

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_TV module is designed for multimedia processing on an FPGA, specifically handling audio and video streams through various interfacing protocols and outputting video via a VGA port. It interfaces with both analog and digital input signals that are processed and converted for display or further transmission. The inputs include ADC signals for audio data, multiple clock inputs for timing synchronization, High-Performance System (HPS) inputs for interfacing with other processors or systems, video input data via TD signals, and user controls via switches and keys. The outputs control ADC operations, send audio data, manage DRAM for memory operations, send processed video data to VGA for display, and other control signals like those for Ethernet or serial communication. Internal signals such as YCbCr for color data, mRed/mGreen/mBlue for RGB video data, and various control clocks illustrate the internal handling and processing logic used to manage video frames and synchronize operations. Various sub-modules like ITU_656_Decoder, SDRAM_Control, and YCbCr2RGB are instantiated for specific tasks such as video format conversion, memory management, and color space conversion, respectively. Collectively, these components allow the DE1_SoC_TV to function as a comprehensive video and audio processing unit suitable for real-time multimedia applications.
