Module name: Sdram_PLL_0002. Module specification: The Sdram_PLL_0002 module is a specialized configuration for a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) tailored for SDRAM applications, ensuring multiple output clocks are synchronized with a reference clock. It features input ports `refclk` for the primary reference clock and `rst` for resetting the PLL. The output ports include `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2` for different clock frequencies and phases, and `locked` which indicates the status of PLL lock synchronization. Internally, the module utilizes the `altera_pll` instance, named `altera_pll_i`, which manages the PLL configurations and operations such as frequency division and phase adjustments. This instance adapts to input changes through the reset and reference clock signals and provides the necessary output clocks and a lock status. This configuration effectively leverages the internal capabilities of the Altera-specific PLL block, facilitating stable and synchronized clock outputs crucial for SDRAM functioning. The module's design encapsulates these functionalities within a concise and efficient setup, without explicitly defining other internal signals, focusing on straightforward input-output management through a black-box approach in the `altera_pll` instantiation.
