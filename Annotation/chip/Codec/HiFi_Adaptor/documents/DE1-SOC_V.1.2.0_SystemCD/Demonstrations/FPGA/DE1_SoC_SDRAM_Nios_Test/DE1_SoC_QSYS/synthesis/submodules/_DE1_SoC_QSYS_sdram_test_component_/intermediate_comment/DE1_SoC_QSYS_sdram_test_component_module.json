    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component module acts as a simulator for SDRAM in a system-on-chip environment, interfacing via SDRAM control and data signals. It handles read and write operations through internal state management using signals such as CODE and cmd_code, and timing adjustments with latency controls. Reads and writes are directed through a child module `DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram_test_component_ram_module` based on dynamically set addresses and command decoding, ensuring accurate emulation of SDRAM behavior."
