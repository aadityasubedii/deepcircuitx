Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_oci_test_bench module is primarily designed for testing purposes, likely associated with processes involving a Direct Cosine Transform (DCT) buffer. It is a part of an unspecified larger system and operates with no internal logic or output definitions provided in the snippet. The module comprises four input ports: 'dct_buffer', a 30-bit input holding DCT data, 'dct_count', a 4-bit input likely acting as a sequence counter for the DCT buffer, 'test_ending', a single-bit input signaling the imminent end of a test, and 'test_has_ended', a single-bit input indicating the completion of a test. The module does not define any output ports or internal signals within the provided code, suggesting its function might be restricted to modifying or observing the internal state based on the input conditions. There are no explicit blocks, sections, or internal signal manipulations defined in the provided code snippet, indicating a straightforward, input-driven test interface without further processing or output generation detailed in the code.",
