    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'sdr_data_path' module manages data and masking for SDRAM interfaces. It inputs serial data (DATAIN) and a mask (DM), outputs the data directly to DQOUT, and controls DQM based on the reset state. On reset, DQM masks all data; otherwise, it follows DM. The always block handles DQM's logic based on CLK and RESET_N, ensuring synchronized, accurate data handling."
