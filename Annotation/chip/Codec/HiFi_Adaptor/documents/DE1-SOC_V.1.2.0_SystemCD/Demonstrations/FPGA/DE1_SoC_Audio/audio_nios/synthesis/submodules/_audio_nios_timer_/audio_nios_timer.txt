Module-level comment: The `audio_nios_timer` module serves as a versatile timer/counter for NIOS-based audio systems, offering adjustable period registers, start/stop control, and automatic interrupt management on timeout events. It operates using a set of internal registers, control flags, and a main counter that decrements at each clock cycle, also providing snapshotted reads and reconfigurable timer settings contingent on the input commands via control registers.
