Module-level comment: The AUDIO_DAC module interfaces with a digital-to-analog converter for audio, managing audio data through a FIFO buffer for both left and right channels. It utilizes clocks (`bclk` and `daclrc`) for timing control and serial data output (`dacdat`). Essential operations are controlled via signals and registers, handling bit manipulation and transmission based on FIFO status (`full`) and channel allocation. The module ensures precise data processing and DAC interfacing, supporting efficient and accurate audio playback.
