It utilizes a shift register mechanism, where the depth of the shift register can be configured using the 'DEPTH' parameter. If the 'ASYNC_RESET' parameter is set to 1, the reset signal is considered asynchronous, and the reset is asserted immediately on detecting a high signal at the `reset_in` input, then deasserted after a delay determined by 'DEPTH'. If 'ASYNC_RESET' is set to 0, the synchronizer operates with the reset input synchronized only on the rising edge of the clock, allowing for a controlled reset assertion and deassertion based on the clock edges. The output `reset_out` provides the synchronized reset signal."
