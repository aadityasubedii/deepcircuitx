    "spec": "Module name: SEG7_LUT_6. \nModule specification: The module 'SEG7_LUT_6' is designed to take a 24-bit input, split it into six 4-bit segments, and for each segment, compute the corresponding 7-bit output for driving signals to a seven-segment display. The input port `iDIG` is a 24-bit wide signal representing six hexadecimal digits. It has six output ports `oSEG0`, `oSEG1`, `oSEG2`, `oSEG3`, `oSEG4`, and `oSEG5`, each being 7-bit wide signals. These outputs drive six separate seven-segment displays, showcasing the decoded hexadecimal values from `iDIG`. Inside the module, there are instances `u0` through `u5` of the `SEG7_LUT` sub-module, where each instance decodes a respective 4-bit segment of `iDIG` to its corresponding 7-bit segment display output. Each `SEG7_LUT` unit directly transforms a section of the input signal to an output signal, creating an organized route from the 24-bit input signal split into segments to the individual segment outputs. The code is comprehensively arranged in a simple feed-forward manner where input data is processed sequentially through instantiated decoder modules and directed to respective outputs without additional internal signal manipulation.",
