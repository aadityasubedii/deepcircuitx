    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram module serves as an SDRAM controller, facilitating memory management through read and write operations. It achieves this by using a state machine managing initialization, addressing, and data transactions, enabled by FIFO mechanisms for data integrity and flow control. Input and output ports handle interactions with both the system and the SDRAM, ensuring effective communication and timing adherence. This design allows for robust, dynamic control crucial for reliable data storage and retrieval with SDRAM technology."
