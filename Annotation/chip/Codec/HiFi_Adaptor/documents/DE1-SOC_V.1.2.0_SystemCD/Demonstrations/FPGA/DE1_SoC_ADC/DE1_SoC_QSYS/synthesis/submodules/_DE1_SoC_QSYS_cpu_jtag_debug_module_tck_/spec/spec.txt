Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_tck. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_tck is designed to interface with a CPU's debug unit through the JTAG protocol, managing state information, and handling data operations specific to debugging tasks. It accepts various input ports including data registers like MonDReg and break_readreg, control and status signals such as debugack, monitor_ready, and ir_in which define JTAG operations, and the JTAG clock (tck) and data (tdi) signals. Output ports include ir_out for relaying the current JTAG state, the shift register sr for data handling during JTAG operations, the JTAG reset signal jrst_n, and serial data output tdo. Internal signals include DRsize which dictates the operation type based on current instructions, and synchronized signals like debugack_sync ensuring safe cross-clock domain signal handling. The module features several distinct blocks: signal synchronization using altera_std_synchronizer components to manage inputs across clock domains, a shift register control for handling JTAG data based on the operational mode, and output logic to manage outputs based on the internal and input states. This robust handling ensures accurate and effective debugging through JTAG interfacing, maintaining stability and data integrity.
