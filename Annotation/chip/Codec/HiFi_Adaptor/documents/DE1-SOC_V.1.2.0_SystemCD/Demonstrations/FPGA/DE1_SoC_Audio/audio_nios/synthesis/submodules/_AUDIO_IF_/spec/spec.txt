Module name: AUDIO_IF. 

Module specification: The AUDIO_IF module serves as an interface to manage audio data transmission between an audio processing system and external components like ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) and DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter). The module handles data flow through FIFO buffers, utilizing clock signals for synchronization. The input ports include avs_s1_clk (the main clock signal), avs_s1_reset (a reset signal), avs_s1_address (a signal specifying the data address), avs_s1_read, avs_s1_writedata, avs_s1_write (signals to control data read and write operations, respectively), and port connections to DAC and ADC such as avs_s1_export_BCLK (clock signal for data synchronization), avs_s1_export_DACLRC, avs_s1_export_DACDAT, avs_s1_export_ADCLRC, avs_s1_export_ADCDAT (for channel control and data flow). The output ports include avs_s1_readdata, which outputs the data read from the address, and avs_s1_export_XCK, an exported clock signal for synchronization. Key internal signals include reg_readdata (output data register), fifo_clear (signal to clear FIFOs), dacfifo_full (indicates if DAC FIFO is full), dacfifo_write (DAC writing control signal), dacfifo_writedata (data to DAC FIFO), adcfifo_empty (indicates if ADC FIFO is empty), adcfifo_read (reading control signal from ADC FIFO), adcfifo_readdata (data read from ADC FIFO), data32_from_adcfifo and data32_from_adcfifo_2 (temporary storage for ADC data). The Verilog code consists of several blocks: reset and control logic handling FIFO clear command, data writing to DAC FIFO, data reading from ADC FIFO, managing ADC data queuing,  and instantiating ADC and DAC modules with specified data widths, controlling FIFO read and write operations, and synchronizing external hardware data transfers. This setup efficiently interleaves audio data processing and transmission functionalities for real-time audio applications.
