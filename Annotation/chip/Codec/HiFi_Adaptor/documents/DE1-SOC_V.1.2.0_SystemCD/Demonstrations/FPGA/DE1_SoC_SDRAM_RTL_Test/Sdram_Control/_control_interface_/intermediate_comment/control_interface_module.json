    "module": "Module-level comment: The `control_interface` module manages SDRAM operations by taking commands (NOP, READ, WRITE, etc.) through the CMD input and translating ADDR to internal SADDR. It handles SDRAM initialization and refresh cycles using timers (timer and init_timer). The implementation includes multiple always blocks responding to clock and reset signals to decode commands, manage address translation, and generate necessary control signals (REF_REQ, INIT_REQ), ensuring synchronization with external command acknowledgments."
