    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_sw. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sw is a Verilog module designed to handle data input and output based on clock synchronization and address-driven selection. It reads a 10-bit input from the 'in_port', evaluates the 2-bit 'address', and produces a 32-bit output 'readdata'. The output is determined by the address; if the address is 0, the input from 'in_port' is relayed to the least significant bits of 'readdata', otherwise 'readdata' is set to 0. The operation of updating 'readdata' occurs only at the rising edge of the clock signal ('clk') or if the reset signal ('reset_n', active-low) is asserted, which clears 'readdata' to 0 ensuring a known state after reset. Internally, the module employs three signals: 'clk_en' ensures continuous data updates with the clock, 'data_in' channels the input data from 'in_port' to other parts of the module, and 'read_mux_out' serves as an intermediate wire carrying the multiplexer's output based on the 'address'. The multiplexer functionality, set by the 'read_mux_out' wire, selects data based on 'address' being 0. Each part of the code is structured to define these functionalities clearly, with signal assignments preparing data for the clock-triggered block to update output effectively.",

It provides an output 'readdata' that contains the data from 'in_port' if the address is set to 0, and zero otherwise. The module uses synchronous logic, only updating its output on the positive edge of a clock signal or if reset is not active. Additionally, it clears the output to 0 when a reset (active low) is received, ensuring the system can return to a known state."

Specifically, when address is 0, the data from in_port is passed to the output.\n- The clk (clock) input manages the timing of data updates, allowing changes in output only at the rising edge of the clock cycle.\n- The in_port carries the primary data which may be forwarded to the output based on the multiplexer controlled by the address input.\n- The reset_n input is crucial for initializing the system, ensuring that the module can return to a known state upon a reset event.\n\nOutput ports: \n- readdata\n\nExplanation: \n- readdata is a 32-bit output which provides the selected data based on the address and in_port inputs. If the address is 0, in_port data is set in the least significant bits of readdata; otherwise, readdata is set to 0. This output is updated according to the module\u2019s clock, ensuring timely and synchronized data output."

In this module, it's always set to 1, meaning the data update feature (reading input data on the clock's rising edge) is always enabled.\n- **data_in**: Represents the main data input of the module which directly takes its values from the input port `in_port`. This signal is used to transfer the input data to the mux operation controlled by the address input.\n- **read_mux_out**: This is an output of a multiplexer structure controlled by the `address` input.
