    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/*\nThis module manages SDRAM interfacing with dual read/write channels. It handles command sequencing, \naddress management, and data buffering using FIFOs. The module employs a state machine to control \nSDRAM operations, including read, write, refresh, and precharge. It generates necessary timing \nsignals, manages data paths, and ensures proper synchronization between the system and SDRAM clocks.\n*/"
