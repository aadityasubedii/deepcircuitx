    "module": "Module-level comment: The Sdram_WR_FIFO module serves as a dual-clock FIFO buffer interfacing with SDRAM, synchronizing data transfers across separate write (`wrclk`) and read (`rdclk`) clocks. It includes input controls for data handling, status outputs for FIFO state, and utilizes a `dcfifo_component` for FIFO management with configurable parameters targeting Cyclone V FPGA specifics, ensuring efficient and organized memory management in multi-clock domain environments."
