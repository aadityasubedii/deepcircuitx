This module captures serial audio data input (adcdat), determines the channel (left or right) based on the adclrc signal, and processes the data into a 32-bit wide format before storing it in a FIFO (First-In First-Out) buffer. The module operates synchronously with a bit clock (bclk) and handles reset or clear signals to reset internal states. It organizes the serial audio data for each channel into frames, converts them from serial to parallel format, and writes the complete data frames into a FIFO buffer, checking if the buffer is full before writing to avoid data overflow. Data from the FIFO can be read out synchronously with another clock (clk) upon request, with an indicator if the FIFO is empty."

It synchronizes the serial data capturing process.\n- `adclrc`: This signal indicates which channel (left or right) of the audio data is being received. Its state determines the processing path of incoming data bits.\n- `adcdat`: This is the serial audio data input from an external ADC.\n\nOutput ports: readdata, empty, adcfifo_full.\nExplanation:\n- `readdata`: This port outputs the data that has been read from the FIFO buffer. It is a 32-bit width bus corresponding to the processed audio data.\n- `empty`: This signal indicates if the FIFO buffer is empty, assisting in the management of read operations to prevent underflow.\n- `adcfifo_full`: This wire indicates whether the FIFO buffer is full, used internally to prevent writing new data when there's no available storage space, thereby avoiding overflow."
