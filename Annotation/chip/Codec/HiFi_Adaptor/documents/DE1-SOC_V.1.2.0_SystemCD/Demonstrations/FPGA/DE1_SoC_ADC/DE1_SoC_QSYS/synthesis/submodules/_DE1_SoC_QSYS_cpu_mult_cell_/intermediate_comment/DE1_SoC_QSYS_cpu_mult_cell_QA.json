The multiplication is split into two parts using partial products: the lower 16 bits of both operands are multiplied independently from the upper 16 bits of the first operand and the lower 16 bits of the second operand. The results of these multiplications are then combined to form the final 32-bit result. The module uses instantiated components `altera_mult_add` for the multiplication tasks and various parameters are set for these components to optimize the multiplication referring to specifics of the Cyclone V FPGA family. The module is also sensitive to the system clock and a reset signal."

It is derived from the negation of the reset input (`reset_n`), meaning it becomes active (high) when `reset_n` is inactive (low). This signal is connected to the clear (aclr) ports of the `altera_mult_add` components ensuring the internal state and computations of the multipliers are reset appropriately.\n- **A_mul_cell_result_part_1**: This intermediate signal holds the result of multiplying the lower 16 bits of `A_mul_src1` and `A_mul_src2`. The result is a 32-bit value, where the computation captures the entire product of these two half-word lengths of the inputs.\n- **A_mul_cell_result_part_2**: This signal holds the result of multiplying the upper 16 bits of `A_mul_src1` and the lower 16 bits of `A_mul_src2`. The result in this case is a 16-bit value, which is part of the multiplication product used to form the final 32-bit result.
