The configuration provided sets up three distinct output clocks with different frequencies and phase shifts, specifically targeting certain functionalities in SDRAM operations. The PLL ensures that the generated clocks are stable and phase-aligned as required. Additionally, the module provides a 'locked' signal indicating when the PLL is successfully locked to the input clock, ensuring reliable operation. This is typically used in hardware designs where precise clock timing is critical, like in memory interfaces."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports: `refclk`, `rst`. \nExplanation: \n- `refclk`: This is the reference clock input for the PLL. It serves as the base frequency from which the PLL generates the desired output clock frequencies.\n- `rst`: This is the reset input which, when active, resets the PLL to its initial state. This is essential for bringing the PLL to a known state before it starts operating or in case it needs to recover from an error state.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`, `locked`.\nExplanation:\n- `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`: These are the output clocks generated by the PLL based on the reference clock. Each clock output can be configured with different frequencies and phase shifts. For instance, in the given configuration, `outclk_0` and `outclk_1` are both configured to 100 MHz, but with different phase shifts, while `outclk_2` is set at approximately 18.37 MHz with no phase shift.\n- `locked`: This is an indicator output signal that denotes when the PLL has achieved phase and frequency lock. When `locked` is high (1), it indicates that the output clocks are stable and the PLL is functioning correctly. This signal is crucial for ensuring that the downstream digital logic operates on stable clock edges."

All the signals that are manipulated or used are either the inputs (`refclk`, `rst`) or outputs (`outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`, `locked`) of the module. The interaction and control over the phase locked loop (PLL) operations are primarily handled by an instance of the `altera_pll` block, where connections are made directly using these input and output ports.
