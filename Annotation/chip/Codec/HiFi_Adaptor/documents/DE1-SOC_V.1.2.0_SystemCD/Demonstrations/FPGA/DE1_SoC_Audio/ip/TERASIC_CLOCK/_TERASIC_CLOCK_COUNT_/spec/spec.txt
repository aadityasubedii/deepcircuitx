Module name: TERASIC_CLOCK_COUNT. 

Module specification: The TERASIC_CLOCK_COUNT module is designed to count and manage the number of clock pulses from two external clock inputs, CLK_1 and CLK_2. It starts counting when a specific value is written to a designated address, and stops counting when another condition (like countdown reaching zero) is met. It supports functionalities such as reading and writing to internal registers based on memory-mapped addresses. The input ports include s_clk_in (system clock), s_reset_in (system reset), s_address_in (address selection for read/write operations), s_read_in (read operation trigger), s_write_in (write operation trigger), s_writedata_in (data for write operations), and the clock inputs CLK_1 and CLK_2. The only output port, s_readdata_out, provides the latched count values or the state of the counting_now signal depending on the address accessed. Internal signals such as counting_now (indicates if counting is active), cnt_down (a countdown timer for controlling counting duration), clk1_cnt and clk2_cnt (counters for the external clocks), and clk1_cnt_latched and clk2_cnt_latched (latched values of the counters upon stopping the count) are crucial for module functionality. The code features several conditional blocks handling resets, read and write operations to start/stop counting and loading count values, and separate always blocks to increment clock counters and latch their values upon specific conditions, reflecting a structured approach to synchronizing and controlling clock pulse measurements for precision monitoring and system synchronization requirements.
