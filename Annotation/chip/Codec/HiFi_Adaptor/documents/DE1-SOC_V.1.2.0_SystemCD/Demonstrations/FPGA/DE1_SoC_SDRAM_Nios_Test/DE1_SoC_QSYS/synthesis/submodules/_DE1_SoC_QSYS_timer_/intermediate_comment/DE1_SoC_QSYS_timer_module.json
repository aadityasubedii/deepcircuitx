    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_timer module implements a configurable timer with adjustable periods and optional continuous operation. It includes start/stop control, interrupt generation on timeout, and read/write access to internal registers. The timer decrements on each clock cycle, reloads from period registers when expiring or upon direct control, and signals interrupts based on the control settings. Internal multiplexing provides selective register access for external interfacing."
