    "spec": "Module name: I2C_Controller. \n\nModule specification: The I2C_Controller is a Verilog module designed to manage I2C communication, chiefly the synchronous sending and receiving of data. It controls the clock (I2C_SCLK) and data transmission (I2C_SDAT) lines for interfacing with an I2C device. The input ports include CLOCK, which provides the timing signal for the controller, I2C_DATA for the 24-bit data to be transmitted, GO which starts the data transmission, RESET for initializing internal states, and W_R indicating read/write mode. The outputs include I2C_SCLK and I2C_SDAT for I2C communication, END indicating the completion of transmission, ACK for acknowledgment from the I2C device, and SD_COUNTER a counter for internal state management, and SDO representing serialized data output. Internal signals such as SDO (Serial Data Output) to shift data, SCLK (internal clock), and SD (temporary data register) help manage data operations. ACK1, ACK2, and ACK3 capture acknowledgments per data chunk. The code employs a finite state machine driven by SD_COUNTER, cycling through initializing variables, managing data chunks, handling acknowledgments, and concluding the transmission. Each state within this sequence has specific operations tied to CLOCK edges and RESET states to ensure proper timing and synchronization during data transfer.",

It manages sending and receiving data over the I2C bus using a combination of input conditions and internal state management. The controller interacts with an I2C device by generating the necessary signals for clock (SCLK) and data transmission (SDAT), handling different phases of data transmission based on a counter (SD_COUNTER).
