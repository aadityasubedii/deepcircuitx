    "module": "Module-level comment: The SEG7_LUT module decodes a 4-bit hexadecimal input (iDIG) into a 7-bit output pattern (oSEG) for a 7-segment display, where each bit of oSEG controls one segment (0 for on, 1 for off). Using a case statement within an 'always' block triggered by iDIG changes, it assigns specific segment patterns to display corresponding hexadecimal characters."
