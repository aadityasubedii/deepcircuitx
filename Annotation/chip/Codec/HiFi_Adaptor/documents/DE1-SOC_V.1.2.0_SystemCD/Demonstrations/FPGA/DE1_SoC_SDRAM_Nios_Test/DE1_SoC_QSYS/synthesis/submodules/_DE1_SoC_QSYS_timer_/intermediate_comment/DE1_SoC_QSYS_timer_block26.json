    "block_comment": "This block of code manages the control logic for force reloading based on clock signals and reset conditions. On the negative edge of `reset_n`, the `force_reload` is set to 0, effectively clearing it. During each positive edge of the clock (`clk`) where `clk_en` is enabled, `force_reload` is conditionally set based on whether `period_h_wr_strobe` or `period_l_wr_strobe` is asserted, allowing dynamic adjustment based on these strobe signals."
