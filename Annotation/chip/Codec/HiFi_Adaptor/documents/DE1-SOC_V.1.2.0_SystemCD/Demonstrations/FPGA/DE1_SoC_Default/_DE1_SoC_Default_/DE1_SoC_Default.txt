Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_Default module interfaces and manages VGA, audio, and various I/Os on an FPGA platform. It integrates multiple clock inputs, ADC, and HPS signals processing with output control for DRAM, VGA, and audio. Utilizing internal signals such as AUD_CTRL_CLK and VGA_CTRL_CLK, it orchestrates audio and video synchronization. Key functional blocks like VGA_Audio, AUDIO_DAC, and I2C_AV_Config configure peripheral operations, supporting complex embedded system applications.
