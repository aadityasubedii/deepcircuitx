It manages read and write operations to the SDRAM by handling address and data transactions, managing command sequences (like activation, read, write, precharge), and synchronizing these operations based on the system clock. The module also deals with initialization sequences and refresh operations necessary for SDRAM's proper functioning. It uses a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) to buffer incoming data and control commands, handling signals for almost empty/full states and ensuring data integrity during transfer. In summary, it acts as a controller for interfacing with an SDRAM, orchestrating signal transactions and timing to properly store and retrieve data."
