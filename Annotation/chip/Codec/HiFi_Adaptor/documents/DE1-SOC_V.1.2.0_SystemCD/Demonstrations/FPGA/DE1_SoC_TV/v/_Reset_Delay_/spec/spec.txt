Module name: Reset_Delay.
Module specification: The Reset_Delay module is designed for generating staggered reset signals, which are instrumental in managing the sequential start-up phase of various system components. It accepts two inputs: iCLK, a clock signal guaranteeing the updates happen at the clock’s positive edge or when the reset signal is negative; and iRST, an active-low reset input that initializes the counter and output signals to zero to ensure the system starts from a known state. The module outputs three delayed reset signals: oRST_0, oRST_1, and oRST_2, which are each released at different counter thresholds to facilitate phased activation. Internally, the module uses a 22-bit counter (Cont) which increments with each clock cycle until a maximum value is reached, thereby dictating the release timings of the outputs based on predefined threshold values. The Verilog implementation comprises a primary always block that listens on the clock’s positive edge and the reset signal’s negative edge. Within this block, conditional checks determine whether to reset the counter and outputs, or increment the counter and subsequently set the output signals when their respective thresholds are met. This structured approach enables a controlled, sequential reset process across interdependent modules or systems.
