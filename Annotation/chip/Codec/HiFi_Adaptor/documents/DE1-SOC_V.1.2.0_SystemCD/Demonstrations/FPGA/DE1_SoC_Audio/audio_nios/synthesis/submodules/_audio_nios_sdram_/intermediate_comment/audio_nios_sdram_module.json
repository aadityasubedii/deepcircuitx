It manages read/write operations, \nrefresh cycles, and initialization using state machines and FIFOs. The module handles \nSDRAM commands, address management, and data flow, ensuring proper timing and sequencing. \nIt integrates refresh mechanisms and FIFO status checks for efficient SDRAM-based audio \ndata handling.\n*/"
