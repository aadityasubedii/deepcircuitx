    "module": "Module-level comment: The CLOCK_500 module performs clock division, signal generation, and ROM data management in embedded systems. It leverages a 10-bit counter (COUNTER_500) incremented by the CLOCK signal to derive two slower clock signals (CLOCK_500 and CLOCK_2) and manipulate data outputs (DATA) based on ROM content. The module responds to END and RESET signals to control ROM access (address increment/reset) and dynamically updates ROM content based on specific conditions, delivering tailored signal outputs like GO for operational status indication."
