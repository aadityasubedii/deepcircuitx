It achieves this by passing the reset signal through a chain of flip-flops specified by the parameter `DEPTH`. The `ASYNC_RESET` parameter determines how the reset is treated. If `ASYNC_RESET` is enabled, the reset signal is asynchronously set high across all flip-flops when `reset_in` is high. Otherwise, it synchronizes `reset_in` with the clock signal using sequential stages of flip-flops. The output `reset_out` provides the synchronized reset signal."

This reset signal is to be synchronized to the clock domain defined by `clk`. The `clk` input serves as the clock signal against which the reset synchronization is performed.\n\nOutput ports: `reset_out`.\nExplanation: The `reset_out` port provides the output of the reset signal after it has been synchronized to the clock domain. This output is used to safely reset other components in the same clock domain without the risk of metastability issues."

Each flip-flop in the chain holds a stage of the synchronized or transitioning reset signal, which helps in mitigating the effects of metastability by allowing the signal to stabilize across multiple clock cycles.\n\n- `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out`: This signal holds the output of the first flip-flop in the shift register `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain`. It effectively becomes the debounced or synchronized reset signal which is then outputted through `reset_out`. This registered output ensures that the reset signal fed to the rest of the circuitry is stable and synchronized with the clock signal, minimizing potential timing issues."
