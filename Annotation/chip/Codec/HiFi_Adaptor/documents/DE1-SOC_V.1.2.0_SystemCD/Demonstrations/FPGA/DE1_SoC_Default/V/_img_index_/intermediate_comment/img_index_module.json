    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"img_index\" module serves as a ROM, using altsyncram to output image pixel data determined by an 8-bit input address. It relies on synchronous operation with a clock input to ensure data updates each cycle. Internally, sub_wire0 temporarily holds the 24-bit output from altsyncram before assigning it to the output port 'q', based on address inputs facilitated by parameters set for ROM operation and data initialization from 'index_logo.mif'."
