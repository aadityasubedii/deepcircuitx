The module interfaces with external memory and converts digital audio data to an appropriate format for digital-to-analog conversion. It manages audio clock signals for synchronization, selecting the input source through `iSrc_Select`, and handles data conversion and timing using several internal registers and counters. The output signals `oAUD_DATA`, `oAUD_LRCK`, and `oAUD_BCK` are generated based on internal logic and state machines, which handle reset conditions, switching of data sources, and output data serialization. The module operates with selectable audio parameters like sample rate and data width, allowing flexibility for different audio processing requirements."

It is used in conjunction with `oFLASH_ADDR` to fetch audio data for processing.\n- `iSDRAM_DATA`: Receives audio data from external SDRAM. It is used along with `oSDRAM_ADDR` to fetch audio data for processing.\n- `iSRAM_DATA`: Receives audio data from external SRAM. It works with `oSRAM_ADDR` to fetch audio data for processing.\n- `iSrc_Select`: Selects the audio data source with a 2-bit input control. It determines which data source (sinusoid, Flash, SDRAM, SRAM) to use for output generation.\n- `iCLK_18_4`: Clock input which is used to drive the timing of the logic inside the module, controlling data processing and output generation.\n- `iRST_N`: Active-low reset signal that resets the internal states of the module to a known state whenever asserted.\n\nOutput ports:\n- oFLASH_ADDR\n- oSDRAM_ADDR\n- oSRAM_ADDR\n- oAUD_BCK\n- oAUD_DATA\n- oAUD_LRCK\n\nExplanation:\n- `oFLASH_ADDR`: Outputs the address to the external Flash memory. This is used to specify the location of the data to be fetched from Flash memory.\n- `oSDRAM_ADDR`: Outputs the address to the external SDRAM. This address is used to fetch the desired data from SDRAM for audio processing.\n- `oSRAM_ADDR`: Outputs the address to the external SRAM. This address specifies the location of data to be read from SRAM.\n- `oAUD_BCK`: Output bit clock for the audio data. This clock is used for synchronization during data transfer to an external DAC or similar device. It toggles based on internal counters driven by `iCLK_18_4`.\n- `oAUD_DATA`: Serial output audio data. Depending on the source selected by `iSrc_Select`, this pin outputs bits of audio data serially to be used by an external DAC.\n- `oAUD_LRCK`: Left-right clock for audio data which helps in defining the audio channel (left or right) in the output data stream."

It toggles the bit clock signal after reaching a calculated threshold.\n- `LRCK_1X_DIV`, `LRCK_2X_DIV`, `LRCK_4X_DIV`: Dividers for generating different frequencies of the Left-Right Clock (LRCK).

These are serially output based on source selection.\n- `FLASH_Out_Tmp`, `SDRAM_Out_Tmp`, `SRAM_Out_Tmp`: Temporary registers capturing incoming data from memories before they are transferred to their respective main output registers (`*_Out`), ensuring data coherence during the clock changeovers.\n- `SEL_Cont`: Selector counter used to output bits serially from the output data registers by toggling through each bit on negative edges of `oAUD_BCK`, effectively serializing the parallel data."
