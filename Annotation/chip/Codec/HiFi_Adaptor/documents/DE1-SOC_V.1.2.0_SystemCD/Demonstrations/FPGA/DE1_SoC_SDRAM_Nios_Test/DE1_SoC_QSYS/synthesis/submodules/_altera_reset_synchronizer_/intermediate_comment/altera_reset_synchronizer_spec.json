    "spec": "Module name: altera_reset_synchronizer. Module specification: The \"altera_reset_synchronizer\" is a Verilog module designed to synchronize an asynchronous reset signal with a clock signal, reducing metastability risks in digital systems. It includes configurable parameters such as 'ASYNC_RESET' and 'DEPTH'. This module has two input ports, 'reset_in', which accepts the reset signal that could be either asynchronous or synchronous based on the 'ASYNC_RESET' setting, and 'clk', which is the clock input that drives the synchronization process. The module produces one output, 'reset_out', delivering a synchronized reset signal. Internally, the module utilizes a shift register 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain' with a configurable depth 'DEPTH' to adjust the duration for which the reset is maintained. Another internal register, 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out', captures the outcome of the shift register, directly reflecting the state of 'reset_out'. The Verilog code is divided into conditional generate blocks handling the synchronization differently based on the 'ASYYNC_RESET' setting: if true, the reset trigger can happen immediately when 'reset_in' is high, while if false, changes in reset state are only acknowledged at clock edges, thereby utilizing 'reset_in' in conjunction with the clock. This setup ensures flexibility in handling both asynchronous and synchronous reset methodologies effectively.",

It utilizes a shift register mechanism, where the depth of the shift register can be configured using the 'DEPTH' parameter. If the 'ASYNC_RESET' parameter is set to 1, the reset signal is considered asynchronous, and the reset is asserted immediately on detecting a high signal at the `reset_in` input, then deasserted after a delay determined by 'DEPTH'. If 'ASYNC_RESET' is set to 0, the synchronizer operates with the reset input synchronized only on the rising edge of the clock, allowing for a controlled reset assertion and deassertion based on the clock edges. The output `reset_out` provides the synchronized reset signal."
