Module-level comment: The `img_data` module retrieves image data based on specified addresses for image processing tasks. It utilizes input ports `address` and `clock` to navigate and synchronize data access from memory, outputting the retrieved data through the `q` port. Internally, signals `address_sig`, `clock_sig`, and `q_sig` facilitate precise data fetching and synchronization within the system.
