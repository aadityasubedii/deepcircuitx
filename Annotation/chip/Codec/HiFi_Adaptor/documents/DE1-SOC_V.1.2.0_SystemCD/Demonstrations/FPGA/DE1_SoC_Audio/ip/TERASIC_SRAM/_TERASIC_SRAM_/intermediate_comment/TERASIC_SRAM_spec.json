    "spec": "Module name: TERASIC_SRAM. \nModule specification: The TERASIC_SRAM module serves as an interface between a generic system bus and an SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) device, facilitating address mapping, data transfers, and control signal operations. It is designed to handle read and write operations conditioned by control inputs like chip select (s_chipselect_n), write enable (s_write_n), and output enable (s_read_n). Key input ports include the clock (clk), asynchronous reset (reset_n), chip select (s_chipselect_n), byte enable (s_byteenable_n), write and read enable signals (s_write_n, s_read_n), address bus (s_address), and write data bus (s_writedata). The outputs comprise the read data bus (s_readdata), and control signals leading to the SRAM including chip enable (SRAM_CE_n), output enable (SRAM_OE_n), lower and upper byte enable (SRAM_LB_n, SRAM_UB_n), write enable (SRAM_WE_n), address bus (SRAM_ADDR), and the bidirectional data bus (SRAM_DQ). Internal signals are mostly direct mappings from inputs, such as SRAM_ADDR from s_address, or derived like {SRAM_UB_n, SRAM_LB_n} from s_byteenable_n. These handle enabling bytes, data transfer directions, and activating the SRAM for reading or writing based on bus instructions. The code has sections for parameter definitions, port declarations, and continuous assignments reflecting direct connections and conditional logic for data flow within the SRAM interface.",

It ensures that all operations occur in a timely and orderly fashion.\n- `reset_n`: Active low reset signal used to initialize or reset the module to a known state.\n- `s_chipselect_n`: Active low chip select signal used to activate the SRAM when this signal is asserted.\n- `s_byteenable_n`: Byte enable signals that enable access to specific bytes within the data width.\n- `s_write_n`: Active low write enable signal used to control whether a write operation should be performed.\n- `s_read_n`: Active low read enable signal used to control whether a read operation should be performed.\n- `s_address`: Address bus used to specify the address location in SRAM where data will be written to or read from.\n- `s_writedata`: Data bus for inputs that contain data to be written into SRAM during write operations.\n\nOutput ports: `s_readdata, SRAM_CE_n, SRAM_OE_n, SRAM_LB_n, SRAM_UB_n, SRAM_WE_n, SRAM_ADDR, SRAM_DQ`. \nExplanation:\n- `s_readdata`: Data bus for output where data read from SRAM is placed.\n- `SRAM_CE_n`: Active low chip enable output for the SRAM; when asserted, it selects the SRAM.\n- `SRAM_OE_n`: Active low output enable for the SRAM, used to enable output mode when reading data from SRAM.\n- `SRAM_LB_n`: Active low lower-byte enable for the SRAM, used to specify if the lower byte should be enabled when the data width exceeds one byte.\n- `SRAM_UB_n`: Active low upper-byte enable for the SRAM, serving the same purpose as LB_n but for the upper byte.\n- `SRAM_WE_n`: Active low write enable output for the SRAM, used to control write operations to SRAM.\n- `SRAM_ADDR`: Address bus output that mirrors the system address bus `s_address` to the SRAM address pin.\n- `SRAM_DQ`: Bidirectional data bus that serves as the data input during SRAM write operations and data output during read operations."

It is used to transfer data to and from the SRAM.

They control access to specific bytes in the data word, particularly relevant when the data width is greater than 8 bits.\n- `SRAM_WE_n`: A direct mapping from the `s_write_n` input, this active low signal controls the write operations to the SRAM.
