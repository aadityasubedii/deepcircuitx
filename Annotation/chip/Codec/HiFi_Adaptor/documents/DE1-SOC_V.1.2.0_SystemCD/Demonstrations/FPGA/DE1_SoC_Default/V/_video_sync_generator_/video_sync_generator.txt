Module-level comment: The video_sync_generator module generates VGA synchronization signals. It uses input clock (`vga_clk`) and reset signals to manage internal horizontal (`h_cnt`) and vertical (`v_cnt`) counters. The outputs include horizontal and vertical sync signals (`HS`, `VS`) and a blanking signal (`blank_n`). Sync timing is derived from comparisons against predefined values, controlling the visibility of pixel data based on the active display area.
