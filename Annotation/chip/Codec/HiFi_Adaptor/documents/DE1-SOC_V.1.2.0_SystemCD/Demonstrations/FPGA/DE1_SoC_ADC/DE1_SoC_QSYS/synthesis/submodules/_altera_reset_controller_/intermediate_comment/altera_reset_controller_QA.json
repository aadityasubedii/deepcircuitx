It takes multiple reset input signals and optional reset request signals, and outputs a single synchronized reset signal and a reset request signal. The synchronization is controlled by parameters that determine the behavior during reset assertion and deassertion, influenced by system clock edges and specified timings. This ensures stable and predictable reset behavior across various parts of a digital system. The module also supports parameterized configuration to adapt its operation for different scenarios, using a variety of synchronization depths and reset conditions."

The module can handle up to 16 different reset inputs, allowing a wide range of external reset conditions to be monitored and managed through a single reset controller.\n- **reset_req_in0 to reset_req_in15**: These are the optional reset request input signals corresponding to each reset input. They are used to request a reset from external sources, and their usage is governed by flags for each reset input indicating whether the corresponding request input should be considered.\n- **clk**: This is the clock input. It provides the timing reference for all synchronization operations within the module, ensuring that reset signals are aligned with the clock edges to avoid metastability issues.\n\nOutput ports:\n- reset_out\n- reset_req\n\nExplanation:\n- **reset_out**: This is the synchronized reset output signal. It is derived from the input reset signals, synchronized to the clock input to prevent issues such as metastability, ensuring that the reset is cleanly applied across the system.\n- **reset_req**: This is the output reset request signal. It outputs a synchronized reset request based on the input reset request signals. Its behavior is tailored based on module configuration, handling scenarios like early reset deassertion and syncing additional reset requests if required. This signal helps in managing system-level reset sequencing or indicating when a reset condition should propagate through the system."

It combines all the individual reset conditions into a single line that represents if any reset condition is active.\n- **merged_reset_req_in**: This signal combines the inputs of all reset request signals (reset_req_in0 to reset_req_in15) based on the configuration parameters (USE_RESET_REQUEST_INx). It logs which reset request signals should actually contribute to the final reset request output based on their respective flags.\n- **reset_out_pre**: This is an intermediate signal that holds the result of synchronizing the merged reset signal to the clock. It is used as a step in generating the final reset_out signal, ensuring stable and clock-synchronized output.\n- **reset_req_pre**: Similar to reset_out_pre, this signal holds the synchronized version of the merged reset request input signal. This synchronization ensures that the reset request is coherent with the clock edges, avoiding metastability.\n- **altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain**: This registral chain is utilized to delay and synchronize the reset signal over a defined number of clock cycles based on its length. This helps in further stabilizing the reset signal across varied clock domains or operational phases.\n- **r_sync_rst_chain**: A shift register chain used to delay the reset signal according to the required assertion period. This guarantees that the reset pulse is held long enough to ensure system stability.\n- **r_sync_rst**: This signal represents the final output reset state, taking into account the possible reset conditions and the state of the synchronization chain. It provides the output reset signal after adequate delay and synchronization.\n- **r_early_rst**: This Boolean signal manages an early reset request based on the system's need to cater to early deassertion scenarios. It balances the timing of reset requests to optimize system responsiveness and reset integrity."
