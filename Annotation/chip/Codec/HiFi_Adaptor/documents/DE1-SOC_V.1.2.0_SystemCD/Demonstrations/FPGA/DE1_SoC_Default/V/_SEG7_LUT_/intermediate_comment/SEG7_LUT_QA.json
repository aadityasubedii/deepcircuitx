It accepts a 4-bit input `iDIG`, representing a hexadecimal digit, and outputs a 7-bit value `oSEG`. This output directly maps to the segments of a standard 7-segment display, where '0' corresponds to a segment being on and '1' means the segment is off. Each combination of the input digit correlates uniquely to the display pattern of a hexadecimal character on the 7-segment display."

This port is used to select which pattern will be displayed on the 7-segment display based on the hexadecimal value it receives.\n\nOutput ports: [oSEG]. Explanation: The output port `oSEG` consists of 7 bits, each representing a segment of the 7-segment display.

The logic in the `always` block assigns values to `oSEG` based on the hexadecimal value received at the `iDIG` input. The pattern defined by the bits in `oSEG` determines which segments of the display are active (0 for on, 1 for off) to visually represent the corresponding hexadecimal character.
