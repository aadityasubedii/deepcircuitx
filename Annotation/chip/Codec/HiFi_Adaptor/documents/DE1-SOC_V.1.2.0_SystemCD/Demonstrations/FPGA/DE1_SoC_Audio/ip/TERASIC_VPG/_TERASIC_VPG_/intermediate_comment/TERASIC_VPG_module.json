    "module": "Module-level comment: The TERASIC_VPG module generates video patterns and controls VGA signal timing. It leverages inputs like system and VGA clocks, user commands via slave controls, and outputs VGA sync signals and RGB data. Internal signals are driven by a `vga_time_generator` submodule for precise pixel coordination and timing. Various video patterns are facilitated through pattern-specific RGB data assignments synchronized to the VGA clock."
