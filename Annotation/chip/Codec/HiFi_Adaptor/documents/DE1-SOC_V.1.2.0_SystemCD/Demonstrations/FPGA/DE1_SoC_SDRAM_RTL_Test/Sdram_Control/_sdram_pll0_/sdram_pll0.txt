Module-level comment: The "sdram_pll0" module generates two output clocks and a lock indication from a single reference clock. It wraps around "sdram_pll0_0002" and directly maps input (`refclk`, `rst`) to output (`outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `locked`) signals through instance "sdram_pll0_inst", facilitating clock generation and stability monitoring in SDRAM applications.
