    "module": "Module-level comment: The i2c module simulates an I2C controller managing device communications on an I2C bus. It handles data and clock line controls, acknowledgments, and state transitions based on input triggers and internal counters. Using clocks, reset, and control signals, it sequences operations across multiple phases for data transfers, ensuring synchronized, accurate data transfer and response handling between devices."
