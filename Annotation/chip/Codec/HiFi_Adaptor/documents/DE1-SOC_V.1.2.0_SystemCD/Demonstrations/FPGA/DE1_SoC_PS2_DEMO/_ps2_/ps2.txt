Module-level comment: The 'ps2' module interfaces with PS/2 devices, handling data communication over PS2_CLK and PS2_DAT. It uses a finite state machine for state transitions, processing signals to control input (iSTART, iRST_n, iCLK_50) and managing button states and movement outputs (oLEFBUT, oRIGBUT, oMIDBUT, oX_MOV1, oX_MOV2, oY_MOV1, oY_MOV2). The functionality is achieved through clock management, synchronized state transitions, and signal assignments in a structured manner, ensuring effective bidirectional communication according to the PS/2 protocol.
