Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser` module facilitates data transfer across different clock domains in FPGA systems, preventing timing issues like metastability. It synchronizes input and output operations using buffers (`in_data_buffer`, `out_data_buffer`), toggle flags (`in_data_toggle`, `out_data_toggle`), and synchronization units, ensuring reliable data flow. Configurable output pipelining is supported to match downstream performance requirements.
