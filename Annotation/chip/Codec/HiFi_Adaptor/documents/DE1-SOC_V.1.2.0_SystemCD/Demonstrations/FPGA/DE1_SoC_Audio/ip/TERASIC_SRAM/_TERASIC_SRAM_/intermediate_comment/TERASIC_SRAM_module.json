    "module": "Module-level comment: The TERASIC_SRAM module interfaces a system bus with SRAM, handling address mapping and data transfers for read/write operations. It utilizes input signals like clock, reset, and control lines (chip select, write/read enables, byte enables) to manage data flow. Outputs include data, address, and control signals to SRAM. Implementation involves direct and conditional assignments linking system bus operations with SRAM\u2019s access and data handling mechanisms."
