It generates synchronization signals (horizontal and vertical), the pixel clock, and blanking intervals for proper image timing and placement on the screen. The module takes in pixel data defined by RGB values (input signals iRed, iGreen, iBlue) and outputs these colors through oVGA_R, oVGA_G, and oVGA_B, aligned according to the current pixel position (oCurrent_X, oCurrent_Y) within the active video region. It also provides the current pixel's address (oAddress) and a signal to initiate a memory fetch (oRequest) based on the current position of the horizontal (H_Cont) and vertical (V_Cont) counters that track the scanning through the screen grid."

Each is a 10-bit input allowing for a range of intensity levels for each color.\n- iCLK: This is the clock input which controls the timing for all operations within the module. It's used to drive the counters for horizontal and vertical sync timings.\n- iRST_N: This is the active low reset input. When pulled low, it resets the module, including the horizontal and vertical counters and sync signals.\n\nOutput ports: oCurrent_X, oCurrent_Y, oAddress, oRequest, oVGA_R, oVGA_G, oVGA_B, oVGA_HS, oVGA_VS, oVGA_SYNC, oVGA_BLANK, oVGA_CLOCK.\nExplanation: \n- oCurrent_X, oCurrent_Y: These outputs represent the current X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) coordinates of the pixel being accessed on the screen.\n- oAddress: This is the calculated address output for fetching the pixel data from memory based on the current pixel coordinates.\n- oRequest: This signal becomes active to request a new pixel data fetch from memory when the current coordinates are within the active video region.\n- oVGA_R, oVGA_G, oVGA_B: These are the output ports that drive the red, green, and blue signals to the VGA display. They pass through the respective input values.\n- oVGA_HS, oVGA_VS: These are the horizontal and vertical sync signals which are essential for coordinating the timing of picture display on the screen.\n- oVGA_SYNC: This is a constant logic level (high in this case) used as part of VGA signaling.\n- oVGA_BLANK: This output is used to indicate blanking period when no video data should be displayed; it is active low.\n- oVGA_CLOCK: This is the pixel clock signal needed by the VGA display, typically inverted from the main system clock (iCLK)."

It is used to generate timing for horizontal synchronization. The counter increments on every clock cycle and resets when the end of a horizontal line is reached. This counter helps in determining the horizontal timing, generating the horizontal sync (oVGA_HS) signal, and tracking the horizontal position (oCurrent_X) within the video display.\n- V_Cont: This is a vertical counter that operates similarly to H_Cont but in the vertical dimension. It counts from 0 up to the total vertical time period (V_TOTAL). The counter is incremented on the edge of the horizontal sync signal indicating the move to the next vertical line, and it resets when the end of the display frame is reached. This counter is crucial for generating the vertical sync (oVGA_VS) signal and determining the vertical position (oCurrent_Y) of the scanline on the display."
