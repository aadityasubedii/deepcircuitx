    "module": "Module-level comment: The Sdram_RD_FIFO module acts as a dual-clock FIFO buffer for SDRAM interfacing, adjusting data flow between differing clock domains during read and write operations. It manages input/output through signals like aclr, data, rdclk, rdreq, and outputs like q, rdempty, along with internal wires connecting to a dcfifo_component, which is parameterized for efficiency and error handling, ensuring stable FIFO operation across multiple scenarios."
