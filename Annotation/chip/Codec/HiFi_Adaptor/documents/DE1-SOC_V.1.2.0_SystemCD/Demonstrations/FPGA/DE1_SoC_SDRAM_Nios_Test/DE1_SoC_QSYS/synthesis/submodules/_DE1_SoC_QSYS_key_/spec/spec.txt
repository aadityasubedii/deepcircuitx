Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_key. 

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_key is a Verilog module designed to serve as an interrupt system tied to an input port. It encompasses edge detection, capture, and masking functionality, thereby enabling interrupt signal generation.

Input Ports: The module has seven input ports. `address`(2-bit) helps in selecting one of the registers for read operation. `chipselect` is for choosing the chip for read/write operations. `clk` is the system clock. The 4-bit `in_port` inputs data into the system. `reset_n` resets the system when set to 0. `write_n` and `writedata` (32-bit) together facilitate write operations.

Output Ports: The module has two output ports. `irq` emits an interrupt signal based on particular conditions within the system. `readdata` (32-bit) outputs the data read from the registers, assigned through an internal mux operation.

Internal Signals: Various internal signals are employed. `clk_en` is a static wire used in clock-enabled operations within always blocks. `data_in` is a direct representation of the `in_port` states. `d1_data_in`, `d2_data_in`, act as delayed versions of `data_in` aiding in edge detection. The detected edges are captured in `edge_capture` while `irq_mask` holds mask values for the generation of `irq`. `edge_capture_wr_strobe` signals when to write or reset `edge_capture`. `read_mux_out` is a multiplexer output used in assigning `readdata`.

Blocks in Code: The blocks primarily manage data read/write operations, edge detection, edge capture and reset, IRQ mask handling, and IRQ generation. The read operations, assigned based on `address`, include input signals, interrupt flags, and edge captures. Edge detection compares `data_in` with its delayed versions. Edge capture happens based on detection results or reset when certain write strobe conditions are met. IRQ mask intervenes when there is a need for masking specific bits in edge detection. Finally, `irq` is generated by a bitwise OR operation on the masked edge captures.
