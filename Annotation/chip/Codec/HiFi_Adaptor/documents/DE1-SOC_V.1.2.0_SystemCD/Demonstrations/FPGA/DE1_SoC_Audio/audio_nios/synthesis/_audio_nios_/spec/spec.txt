Module name: audio_nios. Module specification: This module is a complex system-on-chip design for audio processing, likely implemented on an FPGA. It integrates various components including a CPU, memory interfaces (SDRAM, on-chip memory), audio interface, I2C communication, timers, JTAG debugging, and various peripherals like LEDs, switches, and 7-segment displays. The module has input ports for clocks, reset, keys, switches, and audio inputs, and output ports for LEDs, 7-segment displays, SDRAM control, audio outputs, and PLL status signals. It also includes bidirectional ports for SDRAM data and I2C communication. Internally, the module uses numerous signals for interconnecting different components, including CPU instruction and data master interfaces, memory interfaces, and peripheral control signals. The code is structured into several sections, including clock generation (PLLs), CPU
