Module name: YCbCr2RGB. 
Module specification: The YCbCr2RGB module is designed for converting YCbCr color space values to RGB color space values, specifically operating on three 8-bit inputs, iY, iCb, iCr, which respectively represent the luminance and chrominance components. These signals, along with input control signals (iDVAL for data validity, iRESET for asynchronous reset, and iCLK for the clock), are processed to produce three 10-bit outputs (Red, Green, Blue) that correspond to the RGB color values. The module operates based on the rising edge of the clock and includes an output validity signal, oDVAL, which synchronizes with the RGB output data. 

Internal signals such as oRed, oGreen, oBlue are registers holding intermediate RGB values, and X_OUT, Y_OUT, Z_OUT are registers for intermediate computation results. Wires X, Y, Z hold the outputs from the MAC units which perform the bulk of the calculation.

Within the core operational blocks, the always block triggered by the iCLK handles the transformation from YCbCr to RGB including clipping and mapping to valid output ranges. The transformation is anchored on three MAC_3 units (labeled as u0, u1, and u2) that handle the matrix multiplication essential to the conversion process. They take Y, Cb, and Cr values and transform them using predetermined coefficients. This output then undergoes shift and offset adjustments in a subsequent always block. Moreover, oDVAL is properly assigned by sampling iDVAL, and another always block handles the conditional reset logic, clearing outputs on reset. This structured approach ensures chromatic conversions are correctly processed, taking into account synchronization and reset conditions, making the YCbCr2RGB an efficient module for video processing applications requiring color space transformations.
