Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS. Module specification: This module implements a System-on-Chip (SoC) design for a DE1 development board, integrating various components including a Nios II processor, memory interfaces (SDRAM and on-chip memory), peripheral controllers (timer, JTAG UART, key input), and system components (PLL, reset controller). It uses an Avalon memory-mapped interface to interconnect these components. The module has input ports for the main clock (clk_clk), reset signal (reset_reset_n), and key inputs (key_external_connection_export). Output ports include SDRAM interface signals (sdram_wire_*), PLL status (pll_locked_export), and SDRAM clock (clk_sdram_clk). Internal signals facilitate communication between components, such as Nios II data
