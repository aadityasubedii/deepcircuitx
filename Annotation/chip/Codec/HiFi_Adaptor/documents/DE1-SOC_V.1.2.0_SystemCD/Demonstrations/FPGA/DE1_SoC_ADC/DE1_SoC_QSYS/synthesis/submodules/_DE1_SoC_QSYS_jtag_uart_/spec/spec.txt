Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart.
Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart module simulates a JTAG UART interface on the DE1-SoC board, handling data transmission between the board and other components using Avalon bus interface protocols. This Verilog module includes input ports such as av_address (register address selector), av_chipselect (device selection signal), av_read_n and av_write_n (read and write operation indicators), av_writedata (data input for write operations), clk (clock signal for synchronization), and rst_n (reset signal). The output ports include av_irq (interrupt request signal), av_readdata (output data from read operations), av_waitrequest (bus flow control signal), dataavailable (data presence indicator), and readyfordata (indicates readiness to accept data). Internally, the module employs signals like fifo_AE (FIFO almost empty), fifo_AF (FIFO almost full), ipen_AE, and ipen_AF (interrupt pending for FIFO thresholds), among others, to manage FIFO operations and maintain proper data flow and control. The code integrates multiple smaller modules such as DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart_scfifo_w and DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart_scfifo_r, used respectively for managing write and read operations specific to FIFO buffers. The modules handle serialization and deserialization processes, storage medium control, and data condition monitoring, with integrated logic to determine buffer statuses and manage data requests and transfers based on system clock and reset conditions. This modular approach enhances maintainability, testing, and scalability of the UART simulation interface on the FPGA.
