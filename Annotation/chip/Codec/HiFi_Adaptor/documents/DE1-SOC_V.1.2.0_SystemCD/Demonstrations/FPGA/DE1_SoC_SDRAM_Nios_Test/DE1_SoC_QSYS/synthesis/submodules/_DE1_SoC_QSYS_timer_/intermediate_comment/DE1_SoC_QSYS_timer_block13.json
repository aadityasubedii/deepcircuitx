    "block_comment": "This block implements a register update mechanism for a high portion of a period, adaptable on each clock cycle. It resets the register to 2 on a negative reset, or updates it with new data if a write strobe signal is active, ensuring synchronized adjustments with system clock changes or reset signals."
