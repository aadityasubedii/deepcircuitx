Module-level comment: The TD_Detect module identifies video signals as NTSC or PAL based on iTD_VS and iTD_HS inputs. Operating with a reset input iRST_N, the module uses internal states (NTSC, PAL, Pre_VS) and a counter (Stable_Cont) to track synchronization signal transitions and count intervals, aiding in determining and signaling the type and stability of the video format. Detection is managed through edge-triggered blocks, resetting on iRST_N's negative edge and computing on iTD_HS's positive edge.
