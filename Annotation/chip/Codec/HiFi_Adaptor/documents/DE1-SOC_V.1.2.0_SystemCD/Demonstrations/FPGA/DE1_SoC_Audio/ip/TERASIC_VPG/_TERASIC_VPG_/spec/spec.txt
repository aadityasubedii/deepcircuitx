Module name: TERASIC_VPG. Module specification: The TERASIC_VPG module is designed to generate video patterns and handle VGA signal timing for a display. It operates based on inputs such as a main system clock (`clk`), a reset signal (`reset_n`), slave control signals including chip select (`s_cs_n`), write enable (`s_write`), write data (`s_writedata`), and read enable (`s_read`), and a VGA-specific clock (`vga_clk`). The module outputs include 8-bit read data (`s_readdata`), VGA horizontal sync (`vga_hs`), vertical sync (`vga_vs`), data enable (`vga_de`), and RGB color data (`vga_r`, `vga_g`, `vga_b`). Internal signals like pixel-based HS, VS, DE, and coordinates (`pix_hs`, `pix_vs`, `pix_de`, `pix_x`, `pix_y`) are generated by the `vga_time_generator` submodule. The module uses additional internal signals (`vga_hs_1`, `vga_vs_1`, `vga_de_1`, and `vga_data_1`) to manage timing and data transfer synchronization with the VGA clock. The RGB color data altering occurs based on the current video pattern (`vga_pattern`), which is controlled by input data. The module coding efficiently handles the switching between various patterns (e.g., scale, red, green, blue, white, and black), manages pixel color scaling based on screen position, and synchronizes output updates using the VGA clock. This ensures proper image rendering based on user inputs and internal timing calculations.
