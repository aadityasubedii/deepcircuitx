    "module": "Module-level comment: The Sdram_WR_FIFO module implements a dual-clock FIFO mechanism for interfacing with SDRAM. It handles asynchronous data writing with wrclk and reading with rdclk. The module uses internal wiring to connect FIFO outputs to external ports, ensuring efficient data flow and state signaling. Key elements include a dcfifo component configured for specific buffering, synchronization delays, and buffer management, supporting a variety of asynchronous operations between different clock domains."
