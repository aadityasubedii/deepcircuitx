    "module": "Module-level comment: The AUDIO_DAC module interfaces with Flash, SDRAM, and SRAM to output audio data, alongside generating synthetic sine waves. It handles input data using selection controls, processes it according to the clock-based division logic for bit and left-right synchronization, and outputs audio through managed memory addressing and data serialization. Clock management utilizes divider registers and counters for precise timing, facilitating effective audio signal generation and synchronization."
