Module name: altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base. 
Module specification: The `altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base` module serves as a pipeline buffer tailored for managing the smooth flow of symbol-based streaming data, capable of functioning in either registered or unregistered mode as determined by the `PIPELINE_READY` parameter. It uses a set of input and output ports: `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset` (synchronous reset), `in_valid` (signifies incoming data validity), `in_data` (incoming data bus), `out_ready` (downstream module's readiness to accept data), `in_ready` (module's readiness to accept new data), `out_valid` (validity of the data being output), and `out_data` (data being sent downstream). Internally, the module employs four signals: `full0` and `full1` (indicators of data validity in buffers), `data0` and `data1` (data buffers). The operational logic of the module divides primarily into two sections based on `PIPELINE_READY`. In "REGISTERED_READY_PLINE", the module uses dual-level buffering with conditions applying flow control based on buffer statuses and readiness signals. Conversely, in "UNREGISTERED_READY_PLINE", it simplifies data buffering, directly transferring data based on combined readiness without additional buffering stages. This configuration allows the module to balance between resource usage and tolerance to variations in data flow rates, enhancing its utility in diverse data streaming settings.
