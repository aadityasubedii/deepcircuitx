It handles address mapping, data transfer, and control signal operations between the system bus and the SRAM. The module captures data from a system bus, manages read and write operations based on the control signals such as chip select, write enable, and output enable, and places the appropriate data onto the SRAM data lines or reads data from these lines depending on the operation being performed."

It ensures that all operations occur in a timely and orderly fashion.\n- `reset_n`: Active low reset signal used to initialize or reset the module to a known state.\n- `s_chipselect_n`: Active low chip select signal used to activate the SRAM when this signal is asserted.\n- `s_byteenable_n`: Byte enable signals that enable access to specific bytes within the data width.\n- `s_write_n`: Active low write enable signal used to control whether a write operation should be performed.\n- `s_read_n`: Active low read enable signal used to control whether a read operation should be performed.\n- `s_address`: Address bus used to specify the address location in SRAM where data will be written to or read from.\n- `s_writedata`: Data bus for inputs that contain data to be written into SRAM during write operations.\n\nOutput ports: `s_readdata, SRAM_CE_n, SRAM_OE_n, SRAM_LB_n, SRAM_UB_n, SRAM_WE_n, SRAM_ADDR, SRAM_DQ`. \nExplanation:\n- `s_readdata`: Data bus for output where data read from SRAM is placed.\n- `SRAM_CE_n`: Active low chip enable output for the SRAM; when asserted, it selects the SRAM.\n- `SRAM_OE_n`: Active low output enable for the SRAM, used to enable output mode when reading data from SRAM.\n- `SRAM_LB_n`: Active low lower-byte enable for the SRAM, used to specify if the lower byte should be enabled when the data width exceeds one byte.\n- `SRAM_UB_n`: Active low upper-byte enable for the SRAM, serving the same purpose as LB_n but for the upper byte.\n- `SRAM_WE_n`: Active low write enable output for the SRAM, used to control write operations to SRAM.\n- `SRAM_ADDR`: Address bus output that mirrors the system address bus `s_address` to the SRAM address pin.\n- `SRAM_DQ`: Bidirectional data bus that serves as the data input during SRAM write operations and data output during read operations."
