Module name: YUV422_to_444. 
Module specification: The YUV422_to_444 Verilog module is designed to convert YUV 422 formatted input into a YUV 444 format, enriching the chrominance detail. It takes a combined 16-bit input `iYCbCr`, which contains Y, Cb, and Cr components. The module outputs these components as separate 8-bit values (`oY`, `oCb`, `oCr`) based on the value of a 10-bit input `iX`. The least significant bit of `iX` indicates whether Y and Cr or Y and Cb are updated in the current cycle (`iX[0]` high for Y and Cr, low for Y and Cb). The timing for processing is controlled by a clock signal `iCLK`, and an asynchronous reset `iRST_N` initializes the outputs to zero if active. The module utilizes internal 8-bit registers (`mY`, `mCb`, `mCr`) to temporarily store the Y, Cb, and Cr components respectively. The main operational blocks include the usage of combinatorial logic for assigning output ports from internal registers, and a sequential logic block defined in an `always` construct, which handles data latching on the clock's rising edge or resetting the outputs based on the reset signal. This structure provides stability and synchronization necessary for accurate color channel separation and output.
