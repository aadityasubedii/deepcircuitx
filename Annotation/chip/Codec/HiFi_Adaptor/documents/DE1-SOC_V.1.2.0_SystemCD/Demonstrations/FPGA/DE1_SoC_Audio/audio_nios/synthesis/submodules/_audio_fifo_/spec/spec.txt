Module name: audio_fifo.  
Module specification: The 'audio_fifo' module is a Verilog implementation of a dual-clock FIFO buffer tailored for audio data applications, supporting asynchronous read and write operations at different clock frequencies. It employs a 'dcfifo_component' optimized for Cyclone IV E FPGA devices. The input ports include 'aclr' (asynchronous clear), 'data' (32-bit audio data input), 'rdclk' (read clock), 'rdreq' (read request), 'wrclk' (write clock), and 'wrreq' (write request). The output ports consist of 'q' (32-bit output data read from FIFO), 'rdempty' (indicates FIFO is empty), and 'wrfull' (indicates FIFO is full). Internal signals such as 'sub_wire0', 'sub_wire1', and 'sub_wire2' facilitate internal connections and data flow within the module â€“ linking between the internal 'dcfifo_component' and the outputs. The Verilog code details connections between signals and ports, defines FIFO characteristics (e.g., memory size, data width), and integrates specific parameters for performance optimization, such as overflow and underflow checking, synchronization delay pipelines, and memory utilization.
