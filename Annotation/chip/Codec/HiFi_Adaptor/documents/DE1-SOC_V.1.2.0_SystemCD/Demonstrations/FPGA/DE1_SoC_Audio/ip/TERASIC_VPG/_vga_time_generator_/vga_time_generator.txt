Module-level comment: The 'vga_time_generator' module generates timing and synchronization signals for VGA displays, managing both interlaced and non-interlaced modes. It processes horizontal and vertical configuration inputs to create sync pulses and data enable signals, controlling pixel placement across display lines and frames. Two main procedural blocks implement the functionality: one for horizontal and one for vertical timing, using counters and internal state signals to ensure correct timing output for the VGA display, including polarity adjustments and frame differentiation.
