Module-level comment: The 'command' module manages SDRAM command signals in response to input controls like read, write, and refresh operations. It uses state machines initialized on the CLK and RESET_N signals to generate appropriate SDRAM control signals (SA, BA, CS_N, RAS_N, CAS_N, WE_N) based on the operational conditions governed by internal signals such as do_reada, do_writea, and command_done. The module meticulously sequences and times these operations to ensure proper SDRAM interfacing, handling initialization, data management, and power control logic within its multiple always blocks.
