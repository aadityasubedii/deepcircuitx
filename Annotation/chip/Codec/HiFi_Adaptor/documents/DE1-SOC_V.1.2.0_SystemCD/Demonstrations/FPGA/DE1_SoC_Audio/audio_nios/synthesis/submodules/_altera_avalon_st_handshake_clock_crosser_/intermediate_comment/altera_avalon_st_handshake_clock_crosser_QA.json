It handles handshake signals across these clock domains ensuring that the data integrity is maintained. The module configures data width, supports optional packet information, channel information, and error signaling. It integrates signaling for start of packet, end of packet, and optionally includes packet channel and error width adjustments. The core of this module is the `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser` submodule which actually performs the clock domain crossing using payload data constructed and deconstructed within this wrapper module. Various parameters such as data width and bit synchronization depth are configurable, enhancing the module's flexibility for different design requirements."

It is based on whether channel functionality (`USE_CHANNEL`) is enabled.\n- `PERROR_W`: Specifies the width of error-related signals within the payload, activated based on the `USE_ERROR` parameter.\n- `PAYLOAD_WIDTH`: Represents the total width of `in_payload` and `out_payload`.
