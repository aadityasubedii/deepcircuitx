    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"img_index_inst\" module instantiation retrieves synchronized data from a memory or lookup table. It uses `address_sig` to target specific memory locations, `clock_sig` to ensure timing precision with system operations, and `q_sig` as the output for data fetched. This setup aids in rapid and coherent data access within digital systems."
