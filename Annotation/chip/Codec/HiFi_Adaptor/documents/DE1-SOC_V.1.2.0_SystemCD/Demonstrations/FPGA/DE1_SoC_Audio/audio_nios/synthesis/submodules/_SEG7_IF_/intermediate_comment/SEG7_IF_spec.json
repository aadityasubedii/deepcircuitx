Module specification: The SEG7_IF module is designed to interface with a 7-segment display, managing data read and write operations to control the segments based on input data and control signals. The module uses input ports such as s_clk (clock signal for synchronization), s_address (specifies the segment address for operations), s_read (enables read operations), s_write (enables write operations), s_writedata (data to be written to segments), and s_reset (resets the state). The output ports include s_readdata (outputs the data read from the internal register), and SEG7 (controls the state of all display segments). Internal signals like base_index (calculates the index in the register for operations), write_data (holds data to be written into the register), read_data (holds the data to be read from the register), and reg_file (internal register that stores the state of each segment) facilitate these operations. The code contains several blocks managing reset conditions, data writing through looping and bit manipulation, and data reading. The final output to the display is determined by the active low/high configuration setting, allowing flexible control over the display appearance.",

It manages reading and writing operations to segments of the display based on input data and control signals. The module includes parameters for configuration such as the number of 7-segment modules (SEG7_NUM) and active low/high settings. Specifically, it handles reset conditions, writes incoming data to a register file based on the specified address, and reads data from the register file into an output on read commands. The output to the 7-segment display is controlled based on whether the displays are low active or not. This design allows dynamic control over multiple 7-segment displays via simple read and write operations."

Used to specify which segment of the 7-segment display is being referenced for read or write operations.\n- **s_read**: Read enable signal. When asserted, the module conducts a read operation, transferring data from the internal register file to the output port `s_readdata`.\n- **s_write**: Write enable signal. When asserted, the module conducts a write operation, storing the data from `s_writedata` into the specified address in the internal register file.\n- **s_writedata**: Write data bus. Holds the data to be written to the internal register file when a write operation is enabled.\n- **s_reset**: Reset signal.

It scales the address input by a factor of 8 (since each 7-segment display is controlled by 8 bits) to address the correct byte within the register.\n- **write_data**: This signal temporarily holds the data from the input `s_writedata` during a write operation. This data is then written bit-by-bit into the reg_file at the position calculated by `base_index`.\n- **read_data**: This signal is used to hold the data retrieved from the register file during a read operation. After all relevant bits are collected from the reg_file, this entire byte (8 bits) is output through the `s_readdata` port.\n- **reg_file**: This signal acts as the internal storage or register file holding the state of each segment of all the 7-segment displays. Each segment's state is controlled by an individual bit, and the entire array of segments across all displays is manipulated through this register file to control the display output."
