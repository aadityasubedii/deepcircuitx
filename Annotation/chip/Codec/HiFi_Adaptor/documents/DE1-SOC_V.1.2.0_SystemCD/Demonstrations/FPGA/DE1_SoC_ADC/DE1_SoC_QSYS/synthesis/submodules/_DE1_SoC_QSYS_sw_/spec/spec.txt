Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_sw. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sw is a Verilog module designed to handle data input and output based on clock synchronization and address-driven selection. It reads a 10-bit input from the 'in_port', evaluates the 2-bit 'address', and produces a 32-bit output 'readdata'. The output is determined by the address; if the address is 0, the input from 'in_port' is relayed to the least significant bits of 'readdata', otherwise 'readdata' is set to 0. The operation of updating 'readdata' occurs only at the rising edge of the clock signal ('clk') or if the reset signal ('reset_n', active-low) is asserted, which clears 'readdata' to 0 ensuring a known state after reset. Internally, the module employs three signals: 'clk_en' ensures continuous data updates with the clock, 'data_in' channels the input data from 'in_port' to other parts of the module, and 'read_mux_out' serves as an intermediate wire carrying the multiplexer's output based on the 'address'. The multiplexer functionality, set by the 'read_mux_out' wire, selects data based on 'address' being 0. Each part of the code is structured to define these functionalities clearly, with signal assignments preparing data for the clock-triggered block to update output effectively.
