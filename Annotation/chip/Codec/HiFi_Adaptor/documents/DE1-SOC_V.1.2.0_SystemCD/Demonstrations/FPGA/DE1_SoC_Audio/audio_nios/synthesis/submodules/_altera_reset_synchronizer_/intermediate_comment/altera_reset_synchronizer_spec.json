    "spec": "Module name: altera_reset_synchronizer. Module specification: The altera_reset_synchronizer module is designed to synchronize an asynchronous reset signal to the clock signal to mitigate metastability in digital circuits. It operates differently based on the ASYNC_RESET parameter; when enabled, it uses a shift register chain to delay and synchronize the `reset_in` signal with the `clk`, and when disabled, it assumes the reset input is already synchronous. The module features input ports `reset_in` and `clk`, where `reset_in` is the asynchronous reset signal, and `clk` is the clock signal to which the reset is synchronized. The output port `reset_out` delivers the synchronized reset signal. Internally, the module utilizes a shift register named `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain` and an output register `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out`. The shift register delays the reset signal appropriately, with the output register capturing the final synchronized reset value for output. The code includes conditional blocks under a generate construct: when ASYNC_RESET is active, reset synchronization is handled with immediate capture of reset events and a shift of existing chain values on clock edges. Conversely, with ASYNC_RESET inactive, the module shifts input reset signals directly into an updating shift register with each clock, effectively treating the input as already synchronized. This controlled handling of signals ensures stability in reset operations aligned with clock edges, essential for reliable digital system operation.",

The module provides two primary modes of operation based on the parameter ASYNC_RESET. If ASYNC_RESET is enabled (set to 1), the module captures and propagates the asynchronous reset signal through a shift register chain, ensuring the reset is synchronized with the clock edges. If ASYNC_RESET is disabled (set to 0), the module uses a similar shift register to directly pass the reset signal which is already assumed to be synchronous with the clock. The parameter DEPTH determines the number of flip-flops in the shift register chain, which impacts how the reset signal is delayed and thus how securely it is synchronized."
