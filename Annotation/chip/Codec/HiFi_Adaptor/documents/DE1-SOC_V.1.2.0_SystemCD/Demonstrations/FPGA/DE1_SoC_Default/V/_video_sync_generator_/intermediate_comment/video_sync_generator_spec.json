    "spec": "Module name: video_sync_generator. Module specification: The video_sync_generator is a Verilog module designed to generate synchronization signals for a VGA display. It takes two input signals; `reset`, an active-high signal used to reset the module's internal counters (`h_cnt`, `v_cnt`), and `vga_clk`, the clock signal that drives the synchronization logic. The module produces three output signals: `blank_n`, an active-low signal indicating if the current pixel is in the active video area, `HS`, the horizontal sync signal, and `VS`, the vertical sync signal, both crucial for aligning the pixel display on the screen. Internally, the module uses several signals including `h_cnt` and `v_cnt`, counters for the current pixel position horizontally and vertically. `cHD`, `cVD`, `hori_valid`, `vert_valid`, and `cDEN` are logic signals that determine the states of `HS`, `VS`, and `blank_n`. The code is structured into several blocks: the synchronous reset and clocking block that updates the counters, logic assignments for generating sync and valid signals, and the output assignment for sync and blanking signals based on the internal logic states. This setup effectively manages synchronization pulses and active display determination within a VGA system.",

The module takes an input clock signal (`vga_clk`) and a reset signal, and outputs horizontal and vertical sync signals (`HS` and `VS`) along with a blanking signal (`blank_n`). Inside the module, counters (`h_cnt` and `v_cnt`) are used to track the current position in the horizontal line and vertical frame, respectively. These counts are compared against predefined parameters that determine the timing of the synchronization pulses and the display area. The sync signals are used to align the display of pixel data on the screen, and the blanking signal indicates whether the current pixel is part of the display area (active video) or part of the synchronization and porch areas (inactive video)."

The synchronization logic, including horizontal and vertical counters, are updated on the falling edge of this clock.\n\nOutput ports: `blank_n`, `HS`, `VS`. \nExplanation: \n- `blank_n`: This is an active-low output signal that indicates the active video area, where the pixel data should be displayed. When `blank_n` is low, it indicates that the display is in either horizontal or vertical blanking intervals or during sync pulses, and no valid pixel data should be displayed.\n- `HS`: Horizontal Sync output signal. It is used to synchronize the horizontal scanning of the pixel data on the display. The polarity and timing of this signal control when the display starts a new line.\n- `VS`: Vertical Sync output signal. It works similarly to the `HS` signal but for vertical scanning, indicating when the display should start a new frame. This signal is crucial for defining the refresh rate of the display."

It is incremented on each clock cycle and resets after reaching the end of a line. This counter is essential for determining horizontal timing, including sync pulse and blanking intervals.\n\n- `v_cnt`: This is a vertical counter similar to `h_cnt` but for vertical lines or rows in the frame. It increments once per horizontal line (when `h_cnt` resets) and resets after reaching the bottom of the frame (`vert_line - 1`). It is used to track and manage the position within vertical sync and blanking periods.\n\n- `cHD`: This signal represents the composited horizontal drive signal, which is an internal logic result used to control the horizontal sync output (`HS`). Specifically, `cHD` goes low during the horizontal sync pulse (`H_sync_cycle`) and high afterward.\n\n- `cVD`: This signal represents the composited vertical drive signal, useful for managing the vertical sync (`VS`). Like `cHD`, `cVD` is low during the vertical sync pulse (`V_sync_cycle`) and high at other times.\n\n- `hori_valid`: A logical signal that indicates when the horizontal position (`h_cnt`) is within the valid video display area (excluding horizontal sync and front/back porch areas). This helps in determining when to display pixel data.\n\n- `vert_valid`: Similar to `hori_valid`, but for the vertical position. It provides an indication of when the vertical counter (`v_cnt`) is within the active video area.\n\n- `cDEN`: This signal, short for 'Composite Display Enable,' is derived from the logical AND of `hori_valid` and `vert_valid`. It indicates when both horizontal and vertical positions are in the active display region. This signal directly controls `blank_n` output, specifying when the current pixel should be displayed or blanked."
