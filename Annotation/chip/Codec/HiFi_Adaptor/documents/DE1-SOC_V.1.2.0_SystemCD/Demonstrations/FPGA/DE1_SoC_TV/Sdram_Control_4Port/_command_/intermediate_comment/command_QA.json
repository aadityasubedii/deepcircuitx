It interfaces with the SDRAM by generating appropriate signals (SA, BA, CS_N, RAS_N, CAS_N, WE_N) for various SDRAM operations like read, write, refresh, and other mode settings. The module reacts to the clock (CLK) and reset signals (RESET_N), and operates state machines and conditions to handle the timing and execution of SDRAM commands. It uses input commands, status signals, and configurations (like from 'Sdram_Params.h') to control the timing and logic for accessing the SDRAM."
