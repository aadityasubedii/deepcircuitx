Module name: I2C_AV_Config.
Module specification: The I2C_AV_Config module is designed for configuring audio and video settings through an I2C interface, utilizing the iCLK system clock signal and iRST_N reset signal as inputs. The module produces I2C_SCLK as the I2C serial clock output and manages I2C_SDAT as a bidirectional serial data line. Internally, it includes multiple registers like mI2C_CLK_DIV for dividing the input clock to achieve the desired I2C frequency, and mI2C_DATA, which stores the data to be transferred via the I2C bus. It employs a state machine (managed by mSetup_ST) to handle various states of the I2C communication process. Specific configuration settings are fetched from a Lookup Table (LUT), indexed by LUT_INDEX, into LUT_DATA, which is then formatted and sent out based on whether the configuration pertains to audio or video. Signals such as mI2C_CTRL_CLK are used to time these operations, while control signals like mI2C_GO trigger the start of transmission. Acknowledgment signals (mI2C_ACK) and end of transmission indicators (mI2C_END) are managed in conjunction with an external I2C_Controller submodule. The code is structured around significant always blocks that deal with: system initialization and clock division, handling the overall state machine for device setup, and a combinatorial block for lookup table data assignments based on the current index. Each block serves distinct functional aspects of setting up and managing I2C transactions, ensuring robust control over audio and video parameter settings through sequential and conditional processing.
