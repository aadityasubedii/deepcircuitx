    "spec": "Module name: audio_fifo. \nModule specification: The `audio_fifo` is a Verilog module designed primarily as a dual-clock FIFO buffer to manage audio data across different clock domains effectively, using a `dcfifo` component optimized for the Cyclone IV E family. It includes a collection of input ports: `aclr` for asynchronously clearing the FIFO, `data` as a 32-bit input bus for audio data, `rdclk` and `wrclk` as read and write clock signals, and `rdreq` and `wrreq` as signals to request read and write operations respectively. The output ports comprise `q`, a 32-bit output data bus, `rdempty` to signal an empty FIFO and `wrfull` to indicate a full FIFO. Internally, the module uses `sub_wire0`, `sub_wire1`, and `sub_wire2` to connect the state signals and the data output of the `dcfifo` component to the respective module output ports. The source code choreographs these operations through declarations of the inputs and outputs followed by instantiation of the `dcfifo` component, where parameters like the FIFO depth, data width, and operational behaviors such as overflow checking are configured. Additional design components include signal-specific tri-state management and a list of unused optional ports, highlighting the module's tailored configuration for robust and efficient audio data handling.",

It utilizes the `dcfifo` component, configured for the \"Cyclone IV E\" family, to store 32-bit audio data samples.

The module outputs whether the FIFO is full (`wrfull`) or empty (`rdempty`) using the respective signals to control and synchronize data flow efficiently in systems with varying write and read speeds."

This is the audio data that is written into the FIFO buffer when a write operation is triggered.\n- `rdclk`: Read clock signal. This clock is used for all read operations in the FIFO, signaling when data should be read from the FIFO.\n- `rdreq`: Read request signal. When asserted, it indicates a request to read data from the FIFO, provided the FIFO is not empty.\n- `wrclk`: Write clock signal. This clock is used for all write operations into the FIFO, governing the timing of data writes.\n- `wrreq`: Write request signal.
