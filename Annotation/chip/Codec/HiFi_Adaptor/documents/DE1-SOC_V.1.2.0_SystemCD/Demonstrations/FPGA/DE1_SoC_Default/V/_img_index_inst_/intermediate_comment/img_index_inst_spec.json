    "spec": "Module name: img_index_inst. Module specification: The \"img_index_inst\" is an instantiation of the \"img_index\" module designed primarily for rapid data retrieval from a memory or lookup table within digital systems. This module plays a crucial role in accessing stored data synchronously with system operations. It includes two input ports: `address` and `clock`. The `address` input port is leveraged to specify the desired index or location in the memory from where data needs to be accessed, allowing for targeted data retrieval. The `clock` input serves as a critical synchronization signal, ensuring that data operations are timed coherently with other processes in the system. There is one output port, `q`, which holds the data retrieved from the memory at the specified address, ready for further use within the system. Internally, the `img_index_inst` involves three main signals: `address_sig`, `clock_sig`, and `q_sig`. `address_sig` is integral for pinpointing the exact memory location for data access, `clock_sig` aligns this data retrieval process with the system's clock signal to maintain synchronization, and `q_sig` outputs the fetched data. This module's operation is straightforward but pivotal for the efficient functioning of memory operations in larger digital system architectures, facilitating both data integrity and timely data access.",
