    "spec": "Module name: AUDIO_DAC. Module specification: The AUDIO_DAC is a Verilog module designed to function as a digital-to-analog converter tailored specifically for audio data. This module interfaces with an audio FIFO buffer to facilitate the formatting of digital audio data into a serial bit stream output via the `dacdat` port, targeted for actual DAC hardware synchronization using two audio-specific clock signals: `bclk` (bit clock) and `daclrc` (DAC left/right clock). The input ports include `clk` (main clock input for timing data operations), `reset` (resets module state), `write` (control signal for FIFO buffer data writing), `writedata` (audio data to be written into FIFO), `clear` (clears FIFO buffer), `bclk`, and `daclrc`. The output ports comprise `full` (indicates if FIFO is full) and `dacdat` (converted digital-to-analog audio data). Internally, the module employs signals like `request_bit`, `bit_to_dac`, `bit_index`, `dac_is_left`, `data_to_dac`, `shift_data_to_dac`, `dacfifo_empty`, `dacfifo_read`, and `dacfifo_readdata` to manage and process the data flow between the FIFO and DAC, including managing bits, tracking channel specifications (left or right), and handling FIFO read operations. Within the module, significant code blocks include a FIFO buffer instantiation (`audio_fifo`), logic to manage channel toggling and data serialization synchronized with `bclk` and `daclrc`, and conditions related to reset and clear operations, all contributing to precisely control the data transformation and output operations necessary for audio DAC functionality.",
