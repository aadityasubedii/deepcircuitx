It safely transfers commands and data across different clock domains, from a source (`s0`) domain to a master (`m0`) domain. This module is equipped with two FIFOs (First-In First-Out memory queues) for handling command and response buffering, effectively managing data flow between two clock domains with different frequencies or phases. It ensures the commands (e.g., read, write, burst count, byte enable, and addresses) given in one clock domain are correctly executed in another clock domain while maintaining data integrity and synchronization. The bridge handles wait requests, read/write operations, and supports debugging, thereby aiding in interfaced, multi-clock domain system designs."
