Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_mult_cell. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_mult_cell module is designed to perform a 32-bit multiplication operation using a two-step process on the Cyclone V FPGA. It takes two 32-bit input operands, A_mul_src1 and A_mul_src2, and outputs a 32-bit result on A_mul_cell_result. The module is clock-driven, utilizing the clk signal for synchronization and operates with an active low reset (reset_n), which initializes the module's state. Internally, it uses signals such as mul_clr to clear the multiplier components on a reset, A_mul_cell_result_part_1 to hold the result of the lower 16 bits multiplication of both operands, and A_mul_cell_result_part_2 for the result of the upper 16 bits of the first operand with the lower 16 bits of the second operand. The primary blocks in the code include two instances of the `altera_mult_add` component. The first instance multiplies the lower 16 bits of both inputs and the second instance multiplies the upper 16 bits of the first input and the lower 16 bits of the second input. Parameters for these components are set specifically for efficiency and performance on the Cyclone V FPGA architecture. The final result is constructed by combining the outputs of these two multiplication processes within the module.
