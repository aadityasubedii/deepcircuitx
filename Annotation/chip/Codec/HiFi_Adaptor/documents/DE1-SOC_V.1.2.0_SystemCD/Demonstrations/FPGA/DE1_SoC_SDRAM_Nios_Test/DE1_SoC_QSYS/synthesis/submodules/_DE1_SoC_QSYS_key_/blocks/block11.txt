The block of code performs a function of a latch controlling read data. It functions asynchronously if a negative reset signal is detected, resetting the read data to zero, while in the case of a positive clock edge, with clock enabling signal condition it synchronously assigns the result of the bitwise OR operation between a 32 bits zero and 'read_mux_out' to 'readdata'.
