Module name: SEG7_LUT. Module specification: The SEG7_LUT module is designed to interface with a seven-segment display, translating a 4-bit input digit (iDIG) into the necessary 7-bit segment control signal (oSEG). This control signal directly determines which segments of the display are illuminated to represent numerals and hexadecimal characters from 0 to F. The input port, iDIG, accepts a 4-bit digital signal, allowing for 16 possible input values. The output port, oSEG, outputs a 7-bit signal, where each bit corresponds to one of the seven segments of the display; this signal is active low, with a '0' turning on a segment. Internally, the module uses a register named oSEG to store the segment configuration. The primary functional block of the code is an `always` block that triggers on changes to iDIG. Inside this block, a `case` statement maps each possible value of iDIG to a corresponding configuration of the display segments, stored in oSEG. This setup ensures the correct display output for any given input digit on a seven-segment display.
