It handles the transmission of digital audio data to the DAC hardware, managing both the left and right audio channels and using a FIFO buffer (`audio_fifo`) for storing audio data. \n\nThe module operates in synchronization with the DAC's `bclk` (bit clock) and `daclrc` (left/right clock) signals. It ensures proper timing and processing of audio data: it reads from the FIFO buffer when data is needed, and sends data bits serially to the DAC through the output `dacdat` based upon the clock signals. The module uses multiple parameters and internal registers to handle the bit manipulation process effectively, delivering the data correctly to the DAC to ensure accurate audio playback.
