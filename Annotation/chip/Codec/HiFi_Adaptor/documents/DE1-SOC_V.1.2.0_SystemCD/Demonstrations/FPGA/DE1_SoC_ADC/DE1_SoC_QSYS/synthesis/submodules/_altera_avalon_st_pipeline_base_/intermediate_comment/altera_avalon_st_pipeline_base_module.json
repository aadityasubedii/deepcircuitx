    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base` module functions as a pipeline buffer for symbol-based streaming data, adaptable through a `PIPELINE_READY` parameter to operate in registered (dual-buffering with gated flow control) and unregistered (simpler, direct buffering) modes. It manages data based on the validity and readiness signals to ensure steady data streaming with flexible resource engagement."
