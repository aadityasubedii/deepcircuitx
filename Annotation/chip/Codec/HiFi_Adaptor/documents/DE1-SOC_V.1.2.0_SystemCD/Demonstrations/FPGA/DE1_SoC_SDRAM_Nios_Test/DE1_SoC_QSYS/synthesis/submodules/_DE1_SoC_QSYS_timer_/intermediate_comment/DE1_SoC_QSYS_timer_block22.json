    "block_comment": "The block implements a synchronous resettable flip-flop with a clock enable. On the negative edge of reset_n, the output `delayed_unxcounter_is_zeroxx0` is asynchronously cleared to 0; when reset is not asserted and `clk_en` is high on a positive clock edge, the output captures and stores the value of `counter_is_zero`."
