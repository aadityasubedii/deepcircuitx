Module name: DE1_SoC_Default. 
Module specification: The DE1_SoC_Default module is created for an FPGA platform to interface and manage various input and output functionalities, mainly focusing on VGA display and audio processing. It consists of several input ports, including multiple clock inputs, ADC outputs, audio data from ADC, various HPS-related signals for interfacing with FPGA's Hard Processor System, and user inputs such as switches and keys. Output ports include signals for driving ADC operations, audio data to DAC, DRAM control signals, VGA output configurations, and several control signals for different peripherals like FPGAs I2C and GPIO. Internally, the module utilizes signals like AUD_CTRL_CLK and VGA_CTRL_CLK to control audio and VGA operations respectively; mVGA_RGB and mVGA_CLK for handling VGA data operations; and audio_count and key1_reg for management of audio operations and key inputs. The code is compartmentalized into discrete sections, including initial signal assignments, handling Display and Audio setups through instances of other sub-modules or entities like SEG7_LUT_6, Reset_Delay, VGA_Audio, AUDIO_DAC, and I2C_AV_Config. Each of these sections primarily sets up configurations and operational parameters necessary for their designated hardware functionalities, ensuring smooth synchronous operation across the various interfaced modules and peripherals on the FPGA board.
