Module name: altera_reset_synchronizer. 
Module specification: The `altera_reset_synchronizer` module is designed for synchronizing asynchronous reset signals to a specific clock domain, addressing potential metastability issues. It utilizes an input reset signal `reset_in`, which may originate asynchronously relative to the clock signal `clk`. The synchronized reset output is provided through `reset_out`. Internally, the module uses a register array named `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain`, which functions as a shift register implementing the synchronization, and an internal signal `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out` which holds the immediate output of the synchronization process. The module leverages a parameter `ASYNC_RESET` to determine if the reset should be handled asynchronously or synchronously. If `ASYNC_RESET` is set, the reset is processed anytime `reset_in` is high, regardless of the clock. Conversely, if disabled, the module synchronizes `reset_in` sequentially according to the clock signal. The synchronization depth is controlled by the `DEPTH` parameter, determining the number of flip-flops in the chain. The module features two primary blocks of behavioral code, one for handling asynchronous resets and another for the synchronous resets, both adjusting the internal shift register based on the provided inputs and the configuration parameters set.
