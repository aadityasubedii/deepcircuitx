Module name: Sdram_WR_FIFO. Module specification: The "Sdram_WR_FIFO" is a dual-clock FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer designed to interface with SDRAM memory, managing data transfer operations across different clock domains. This module ensures synchronization during write and read operations facilitated by separate clocks: `wrclk` for writing and `rdclk` for reading. It features input ports like `aclr` for asynchronous reset, `data` which is a 16-bit data input, and request signals `wrreq` and `rdreq` for write and read operations respectively. Additionally, output ports include `q` which outputs 16-bit data, `rdempty` which signals if the FIFO is empty, `rdusedw` and `wrusedw` showing counts of used words in read and write domains, and `wrfull` indicating if the FIFO is full. Internal signals such as `sub_wire0` to `sub_wire4` serve as conduits between the dcfifo component and output ports, relaying status flags and data count. The code contains a block instantiation of `dcfifo_component` with parameters configured for a Cyclone V FPGA, including specific memory allocation, FIFO properties, and synchronization options which detail the FIFOâ€™s operational specifics including width, depth, and checking mechanisms. This module, therefore, provides robust buffering capabilities essential for interfacing components operating at different timing specifics.
