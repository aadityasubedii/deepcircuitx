Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_oci_test_bench is designed as a test bench for simulating operations, particularly for a NIOS II setup within a QSYS on DE1-SoC FPGA. It accepts inputs such as a data buffer (`dct_buffer`), data count (`dct_count`), and control signals (`test_ending`, `test_has_ended`) to facilitate testing phases from initiation to conclusion. The module lacks outputs or internal logic definitions, indicating its primary role in configuring and interfacing test inputs.
