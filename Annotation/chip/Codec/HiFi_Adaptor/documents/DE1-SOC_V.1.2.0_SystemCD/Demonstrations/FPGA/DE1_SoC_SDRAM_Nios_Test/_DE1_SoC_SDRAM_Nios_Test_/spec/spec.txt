Module name: DE1_SoC_SDRAM_Nios_Test. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_SDRAM_Nios_Test module is designed to interface and manage various input/output functionalities for the DE1-SoC board, focusing on configuring and driving signals for SDRAM operations through a sub-module called DE1_SoC_QSYS. Key input ports include ADC_DOUT for reading from an ADC, multiple CLOCK inputs like CLOCK_50 for system clocking, and HPS prefixed ports which connect to the FPGAâ€™s Hard Processor System enabling memory, communication, and user interface functionalities. Output ports such as ADC_CS_N, ADC_DIN, and ADC_SCLK manage the ADC chip select, data input, and clock signals respectively, along with SDRAM ports like DRAM_ADDR that address the SDRAM. There are no internally defined signals within this module, implying all connections involve external interfacing or the instantiated sub-module. This module also includes extensive support for peripherals such as audio interfaces, HEX displays, LEDs, and system controls under conditional compilation for integration with the Hard Processor System, organizing the configuration and operational integration effectively within the FPGA-based system design.
