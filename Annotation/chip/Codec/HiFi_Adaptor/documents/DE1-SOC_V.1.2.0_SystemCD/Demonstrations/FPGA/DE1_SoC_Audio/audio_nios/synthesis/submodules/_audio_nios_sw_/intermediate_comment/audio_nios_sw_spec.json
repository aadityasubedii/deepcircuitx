    "spec": "Module name: audio_nios_sw. \nModule specification: The \"audio_nios_sw\" module orchestrates the interface of audio processing with interrupt capabilities in an FPGA setting, likely interfacing with a NIOS microcontroller. It utilizes inputs such as a 2-bit \"address\" to select internal registers, a \"chipselect\" signal for module activation, a \"clk\" for timing operations, a 10-bit \"in_port\" for audio data entry, an active-low \"reset_n\" for initialization, an active-low \"write_n\" for enable writing, and a 32-bit \"writedata\" for internal register data input. The output consists of an \"irq\" for interrupt requests and a 32-bit \"readdata\" showcasing internal state based on the address. Internally, the module uses \"clk_en\" to constantly enable the clock, registers \"d1_data_in\" and \"d2_data_in\" for staging audio inputs for edge detection, \"data_in\" representing current audio data, \"edge_capture\" for storing edge events, \"edge_capture_wr_strobe\" for handling register clear operations, and \"edge_detect\" to identify edge events. The code divides into various blocks operating on positive clock edges or negative edge of the reset, handling initialization, updating registers based on input conditions and addressing, and managing interrupt triggering and data output processes. This setup facilitates efficient audio event detection and signal processing within FPGA environments, tailored for systems requiring precision timing and interrupt management.",

It utilizes inputs such as a 2-bit \"address\" to select internal registers, a \"chipselect\" signal for module activation, a \"clk\" for timing operations, a 10-bit \"in_port\" for audio data entry, an active-low \"reset_n\" for initialization, an active-low \"write_n\" for enable writing, and a 32-bit \"writedata\" for internal register data input. The output consists of an \"irq\" for interrupt requests and a 32-bit \"readdata\" showcasing internal state based on the address. Internally, the module uses \"clk_en\" to constantly enable the clock, registers \"d1_data_in\" and \"d2_data_in\" for staging audio inputs for edge detection, \"data_in\" representing current audio data, \"edge_capture\" for storing edge events, \"edge_capture_wr_strobe\" for handling register clear operations, and \"edge_detect\" to identify edge events. The code divides into various blocks operating on positive clock edges or negative edge of the reset, handling initialization, updating registers based on input conditions and addressing, and managing interrupt triggering and data output processes. This setup facilitates efficient audio event detection and signal processing within FPGA environments, tailored for systems requiring precision timing and interrupt management."
