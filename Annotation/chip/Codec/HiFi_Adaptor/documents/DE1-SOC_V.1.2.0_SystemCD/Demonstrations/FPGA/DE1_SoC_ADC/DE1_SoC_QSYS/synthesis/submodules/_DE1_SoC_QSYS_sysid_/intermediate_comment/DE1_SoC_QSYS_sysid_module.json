    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sysid module outputs a unique 32-bit identifier (1383718665) on the 'readdata' port when 'address' is non-zero; otherwise, it outputs 0. This functionality is implemented using a simple conditional assignment in Verilog, which directly links the 'address' input to the 'readdata' output through a ternary operator, supporting instant response to input changes without the need for clock-edge dependencies."
