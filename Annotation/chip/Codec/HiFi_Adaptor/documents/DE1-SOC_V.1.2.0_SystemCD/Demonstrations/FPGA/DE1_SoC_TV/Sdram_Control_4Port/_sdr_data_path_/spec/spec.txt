Module name: sdr_data_path.
Module specification: The 'sdr_data_path' module is designed for handling data operations within an SDRAM interface. It synchronizes incoming data (DATAIN) directly to the data output (DQOUT) and utilizes a data mask (DM) to manage valid data bits in the output through the DQM signal. The input ports include CLK (clock input for synchronization), RESET_N (active-low reset), DATAIN (data input), and DM (data mask input controlling valid data bits in DQOUT). The output ports are DQOUT (direct output of DATAIN) and DQM (data mask output reflecting the state of DM, but preset to all ones on reset). Internally, DQM is also a registered output, initialized to an all-ones state upon reset to ensure a known output state. The code primarily features a clock-edge triggered always block that handles the reset condition and normal data masking operation, alongside a simple continuous assignment for DQOUT. This structure ensures efficient and controlled data handling within SDRAM systems.
