Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_tck facilitates CPU debugging via JTAG protocol. It handles inputs like data registers and control signals, synchronizes them across clock domains, and manipulates a shift register based on the JTAG operation mode. Outputs include synchronized state indications and data, controlled via internal logic blocks and JTAG-specific instructions. This ensures robust and accurate debug operation management across different system states.
