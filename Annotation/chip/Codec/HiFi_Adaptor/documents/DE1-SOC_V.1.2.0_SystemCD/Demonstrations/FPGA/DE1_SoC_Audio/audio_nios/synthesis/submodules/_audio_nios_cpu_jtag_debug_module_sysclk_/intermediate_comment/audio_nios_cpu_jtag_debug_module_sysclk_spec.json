    "spec": "Module name: audio_nios_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk.\n\nModule specification: The `audio_nios_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk` is a Verilog module designed for debugging NIOS CPUs through JTAG operations synchronized to the system clock (`clk`). This module integrates functionality to receive instructions and data, synchronize asynchronous signals, detect edges, and update outputs based on internal decision mechanisms. The **input ports** include a system clock (`clk`), instruction register input (`ir_in`), shift register input (`sr`), and asynchronous signals for update debug request (`vs_udr`) and update instruction register (`vs_uir`). The **output ports** consist of the debug output register (`jdo`) and a series of control flags that manage actions and indicate whether specific operations should occur across various debugging scenarios (like handling on-chip memory and tracking). **Internal signals** like `sync_udr`, `sync_uir`, `sync2_udr`, `sync2_uir`, `enable_action_strobe`, `update_jdo_strobe`, and `jxuir` facilitate the stabilization and edge detection of incoming asynchronous signals, conditioning of control strobes, and instruction updates respectively. The **code blocks** tackle synchronization using standard synchronizers, edge detection for handshaking updates, and conditional assignments to control action outputs. Logic within clocked processes handles conditional parsing and updating of the `ir` and `jdo` registers based on detected edges and instructions. This architecture ensures robust, synchronized debug operation control within a hardware environment, managing complex sequences through combinational logic and sequential processes.",

This module integrates functionality to receive instructions and data, synchronize asynchronous signals, detect edges, and update outputs based on internal decision mechanisms. The **input ports** include a system clock (`clk`), instruction register input (`ir_in`), shift register input (`sr`), and asynchronous signals for update debug request (`vs_udr`) and update instruction register (`vs_uir`). The **output ports** consist of the debug output register (`jdo`) and a series of control flags that manage actions and indicate whether specific operations should occur across various debugging scenarios (like handling on-chip memory and tracking). **Internal signals** like `sync_udr`, `sync_uir`, `sync2_udr`, `sync2_uir`, `enable_action_strobe`, `update_jdo_strobe`, and `jxuir` facilitate the stabilization and edge detection of incoming asynchronous signals, conditioning of control strobes, and instruction updates respectively. The **code blocks** tackle synchronization using standard synchronizers, edge detection for handshaking updates, and conditional assignments to control action outputs. Logic within clocked processes handles conditional parsing and updating of the `ir` and `jdo` registers based on detected edges and instructions. This architecture ensures robust, synchronized debug operation control within a hardware environment, managing complex sequences through combinational logic and sequential processes."
