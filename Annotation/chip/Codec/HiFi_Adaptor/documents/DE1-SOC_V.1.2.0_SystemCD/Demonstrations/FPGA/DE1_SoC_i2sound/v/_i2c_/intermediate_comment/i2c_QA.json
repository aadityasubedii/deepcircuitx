It handles setting up the I2C data line (SDAT) and clock (SCLK), managing write and read operations determined by the W_R signal, and generating an acknowledgement (ACK) signal based on the data received. The module facilitates data transfer through these operations, progresses through various states using a state counter (SD_COUNTER), and manipulates the data and control lines accordingly throughout the transaction process. The process includes managing the start and stop conditions, transmitting data, and handling acknowledgments after data bytes are sent to the slave device. The GO signal triggers the operation, and the module also has a reset condition to reset the states."

It represents the current bit being sent out to the I2C bus during data transmission.\n  \n- SCLK (Serial Clock): It's a register used to manage the clock signal (I2C_SCLK) for synchronization of data transmission over the I2C bus. It is specifically used to toggle the clock signal during data transmission phases.\n\n- SD (Serial Data): This register temporarily holds the entire data (24-bit) from I2C_DATA input before and during the transmission process. Each bit of this data is sequentially moved to SDO for transmission via the SDAT line.\n\n- ACK1, ACK2, ACK3: These are acknowledgement flags corresponding to different phases of the data transmission. They capture the acknowledgement status read from the I2C_SDAT line after sending each significant part of the data (divided into three blocks). The overall acknowledgement ACK to the master device is the OR combination of these three flags, indicating successful receipt of each block by the slave device."
