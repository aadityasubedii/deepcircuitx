Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_mm_clock_crossing_bridge` facilitates data and command transfers between different clock domains through Avalon-MM interfaces. It uses FIFOs for buffering and synchronization, handling clock crossings safely. Input and output ports manage data flow, while internal signals and control logic ensure correct transaction timings and system stability. This module aims to maintain data integrity and synchronization across asynchronous domains efficiently.
