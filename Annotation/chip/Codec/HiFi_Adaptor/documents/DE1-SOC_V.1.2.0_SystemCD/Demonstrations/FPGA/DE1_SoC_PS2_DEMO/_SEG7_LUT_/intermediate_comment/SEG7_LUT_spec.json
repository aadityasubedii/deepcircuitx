    "spec": "Module name: SEG7_LUT. Module specification: The SEG7_LUT module is designed for controlling a 7-segment display, mapping a 4-bit hexadecimal digital input (iDIG) to specific segments of the display through a 7-bit output (oSEG). The input port iDIG, a 4-bit wide signal, receives hexadecimal digits ranging from 0 to F, which determines which numeral is to be visually represented on the display. The output port oSEG consists of 7 bits, each corresponding to a segment (A-G) of a 7-segment display. The state (0 or 1) of each bit in this output signal decides if a particular segment of the display is turned off or on. Internally, the module does not use any additional signals; it purely relies on combinational logic realized through a `case` statement inside an `always` block that triggers on changes in iDIG. This block maps each possible value of iDIG to a predefined pattern on oSEG, controlling the display to show the corresponding hexadecimal character. The code structure is straightforward and consists solely of an input management block in the form of this always-triggered case statement, making it a concise module focused on direct input-to-output mapping.",

The module uses a case statement within an always block, triggered by changes in iDIG, to assign the appropriate pattern to oSEG for display.
