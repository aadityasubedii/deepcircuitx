The block of code manages the reset and capture of the fourth bit in edge_capture upon specific conditions. When the negative edge of the reset_n signal arrives, the fourth bit of edge_capture is reset to 0. When the positive edge of the clk signal arrives and clk_en is true, if the edge_capture_wr_strobe is active, the fourth edge_capture bit is also reset; however, if the third bit of edge_detect is active, it sets the fourth bit of edge_capture to -1.
