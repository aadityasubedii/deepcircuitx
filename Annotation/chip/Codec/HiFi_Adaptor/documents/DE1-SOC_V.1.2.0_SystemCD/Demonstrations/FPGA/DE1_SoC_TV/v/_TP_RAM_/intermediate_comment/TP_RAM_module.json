    "module": "Module-level comment: The TP_RAM module manages dual-port RAM operations using the `alt3pram` component optimized for Cyclone IV E FPGAs. It synchronizes data reading/writing via a clock input, interfacing through addresses and control signals (`wren`). Data is written to or read from specific addresses (`wraddress`, `rdaddress_a`, `rdaddress_b`), temporarily stored in internal signals (`sub_wire0`, `sub_wire1`), and outputted (`qa`, `qb`). This module ensures efficient and synchronized access to RAM, supporting simultaneous read operations."
