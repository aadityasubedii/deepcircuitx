    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_timer module is designed for managing timing functions in FPGA systems, able to start, stop, and configure a hardware timer. It interfaces through specific I/O ports, utilizing internal counters and control registers to handle operations. Actions are clock-driven, with conditions managed by dedicated blocks for updating counters, handling control input, and issuing interrupts. This structured approach ensures reliable, accurate timing operations essential for time-sensitive tasks in embedded applications."
