The module uses the `altera_std_synchronizer` component for each bit of the input signal, ensuring mitigation of metastability issues through parameterizable synchronization depth (`DEPTH`). It operates under the control of a clock signal `clk` and an active-low reset signal `reset_n`. The module handles input and output data via `din` and `dout` ports, both of which are vectors with a size determined by the parameter `WIDTH`. Internally, the module employs a generate loop controlled by the loop variable `i`, which iterates from 0 to `WIDTH-1` to instantiate a synchronizer for each bit of `din`, outputting the synchronized result to the corresponding bit in `dout`. This structured approach in Verilog facilitates compact and efficient synchronization of each bit of the input signal.",

Each bit of the input signal is processed by instantiating a standard synchronizer component `altera_std_synchronizer` for each bit. The parameter `WIDTH` determines the number of bits in the input and output signals, while `DEPTH` specifies the depth of synchronization stages used in the standard synchronizer for each bit to mitigate metastability issues. The operation is clocked by a signal `clk` and it includes a reset function governed by `reset_n`. This is achieved through a generate and loop structure cycling through each bit of the input `din` and applying synchronization, ultimately outputting to `dout`."
