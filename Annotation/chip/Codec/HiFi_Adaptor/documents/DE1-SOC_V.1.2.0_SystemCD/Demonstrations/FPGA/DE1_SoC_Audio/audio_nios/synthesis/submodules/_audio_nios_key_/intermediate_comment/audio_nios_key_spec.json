    "spec": "Module name: audio_nios_key. \n\nModule specification: The `audio_nios_key` module acts as an interface for processing key inputs in a digital audio system coupled with an Altera NIOS II processor. It addresses detecting and managing key presses and releases, generating interrupts for the processor based on configured edge detection settings. The input ports include `address` (selects between various register access within the module), `chipselect` (enables the device on the bus), `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `in_port` (current state of key inputs), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `write_n` (selects between read and write operations), and `writedata` (data to be written into registers). Output ports are `irq` (interrupt request signal) and `readdata` (data output from the module based on address selected). Internal signals such as `clk_en` always enable certain operations, `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in` (hold delayed states of input), `data_in` reflects current key inputs, `edge_capture` records detected edges, and `irq_mask` stores interrupt mask settings. The module is structured into blocks handling read and write operations, resetting conditions, edge detection logic, and generation of output signals based on internal states and input configurations. Each section ensures the module effectively captures, manages, and communicates key press states and edges to the system.",

Changes in these inputs are used to detect key presses or releases.\n- **reset_n**: This is the active-low reset input; it initializes or resets the module when driven low.\n- **write_n**: This active-low input enables a write operation when low and a read operation when high.\n- **writedata [31:0]**: This data input is used to write data to the module\u2019s registers during write operations.\n\nOutput ports: \n- irq\n- readdata [31:0].\n\nExplanation:\n- **irq**: This output signal is the interrupt request line. It goes high to signal the processor that an event has occurred that requires attention, based on enabled conditions in the irq_mask and detected edges in edge_capture.\n- **readdata [31:0]**: This output holds the data being read from the selected register (as determined by the address input) during read operations.

It's used in edge detection to compare the current input state with a one clock cycle before state.\n- **d2_data_in [3:0]**: Similar to `d1_data_in`, this is another 4-bit register that holds the input state delayed by two clock cycles. It assists in determining edges (change in the input state over time).\n- **data_in [3:0]**: This is a wire directly mirroring the `in_port` input, providing the current state of the key inputs to different parts of the module.\n- **edge_capture [3:0]**: This register captures and holds the detected edges (transitions) based on the input data and the edge detection logic.

It is active when the module is selected (`chipselect` active), a write operation is intended (write_n low), and the target register is the edge capture register (address == 3).\n- **edge_detect [3:0]**: Represents the actual detected edges by comparing the delay lines `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in`. Edge detection logic here identifies a rising or falling edge on each bit of the input.\n- **irq_mask [3:0]**: This register holds the interrupt mask settings, which determine which edges (on which keys) will actually trigger an interrupt (`irq` signal). It can be updated through appropriate writes to the module.\n- **read_mux_out [3:0]**: A selection logic that outputs the data corresponding to the requested register based on the `address` input.

It addresses detecting and managing key presses and releases, generating interrupts for the processor based on configured edge detection settings. The input ports include `address` (selects between various register access within the module), `chipselect` (enables the device on the bus), `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `in_port` (current state of key inputs), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `write_n` (selects between read and write operations), and `writedata` (data to be written into registers). Output ports are `irq` (interrupt request signal) and `readdata` (data output from the module based on address selected). Internal signals such as `clk_en` always enable certain operations, `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in` (hold delayed states of input), `data_in` reflects current key inputs, `edge_capture` records detected edges, and `irq_mask` stores interrupt mask settings. The module is structured into blocks handling read and write operations, resetting conditions, edge detection logic, and generation of output signals based on internal states and input configurations. Each section ensures the module effectively captures, manages, and communicates key press states and edges to the system."
