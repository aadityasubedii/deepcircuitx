It contains a register file where each segment's data is stored. The module supports reading from and writing to the register file based on the operations signaled by the inputs. During a write operation, data from the 's_writedata' is stored at the location specified by 's_address'. For read operations, the data at the location specified by 's_address' is sent out through 's_readdata'. The module also manages reset functionality, where it initializes the register values depending on the 'DEFAULT_ACTIVE' parameter. The output to the 7-segment display ('SEG7') may be inverted based on the 'LOW_ACTIVE' parameter, which is useful for different types of 7-segment displays (common anode or common cathode). The module operates on the negative edge of the clock ('s_clk')."

It drives the timing of the module's operations, specifically triggering actions on the negative edge of the clock.\n- **s_address**: An address input that specifies which segment's data is to be accessed during read and write operations.\n- **s_read**: A control signal that, when high, enables the module to perform a read operation. The data at the address specified by 's_address' will be placed on the output 's_readdata'.\n- **s_writedata**: An 8-bit input data that is to be written into the register file at the location specified by 's_address' during a write operation.\n- **s_write**: A control signal that, when high, enables the module to write the data from 's_writedata' into the register file at the specified location.\n- **s_reset**: A reset signal that, when high, initializes the content of the register file according to the 'DEFAULT_ACTIVE' parameter setting.\n\nOutput ports: s_readdata, SEG7.\nExplanation:\n- **s_readdata**: This 8-bit output provides the data read from the register file at the location specified by 's_address' when a read operation is performed.\n- **SEG7**: This output sends the current state of all segments (for up to 8 seven-segment displays) to the physical display units. The content of this output might be inverted based on the 'LOW_ACTIVE' parameter to accommodate different types of displays such as common anode or common cathode. This allows dynamic control over the display visuals directly from the register file states."

It calculates the base index for the specific 8-bit segment by shifting the address left by 3 bits, moving from an address space to an 8-bit index space.\n- **write_data**: This signal holds the data that will be written into the register file during a write operation. It temporarily stores the value of 's_writedata' before placing it into the register file at the calculated 'base_index'.\n- **read_data**: This signal holds the data read from the register file during read operations. It accumulates the 8-bit data from the register file starting at 'base_index' to be output on 's_readdata'.\n- **reg_file**: A multi-bit register (size depends on `SEG7_NUM * 8`), which serves as a storage for the display data of multiple 7-segment segments. Each 8-bit group in this register corresponds to a segment on the 7-segment display, storing its current value for display."
