The module likely functions as a memory or a lookup table, where `address_sig` is used to specify the entry, `clock_sig` is the control signal for synchronization, and `q_sig` is the output from the specified address in the memory or table. This setup is typical for accessing stored data rapidly in synchronous digital systems."

It acts as an input to the `img_index` module indicating the location where the data is stored.\n- `clock_sig`: This signal functions as the synchronization control for the `img_index` module.
