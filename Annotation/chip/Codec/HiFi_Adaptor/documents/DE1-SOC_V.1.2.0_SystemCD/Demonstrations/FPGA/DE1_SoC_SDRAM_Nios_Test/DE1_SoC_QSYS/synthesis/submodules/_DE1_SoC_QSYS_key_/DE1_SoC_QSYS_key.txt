Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_key, a Verilog RTL module, functions as an interrupt system tied to an input port for edge detection, capture, and masking functionalities. It uses internal registers, multiplexers, bitwise operations, and procedural blocks to control data input, edge detection, data read/write, edge capture reset, and interrupt signal generation. Inputs are mapped onto various internal signals while the output is mainly determined by the state of captured and masked edges. Its underlying operation is synchronized with a system clock input.
