    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'altera_reset_controller' module manages and synchronizes reset signals for digital systems, particularly in FPGA or ASIC environments. It accepts multiple reset and reset request inputs, merges them based on configuration, and synchronizes the output to a clock input. Internal shift registers and conditional logic ensure stable, timely, and parameter-configured reset outputs, maintaining system stability across operational transitions."
