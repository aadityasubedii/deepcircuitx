Module-level comment: The 'sdram_pll0_0002' module, implemented in Verilog, uses an Altera PLL component to generate two synchronized 100 MHz output clocks from a reference clock. The module takes 'refclk' and 'rst' as input signals, delivering 'outclk_0', 'outclk_1' with a -3000 ps phase shift, and a 'locked' status output. The PLL configuration and operation are achieved through pre-defined parameters set in the 'altera_pll_i' instance, simplifying the implementation and ensuring stability and accuracy in output frequencies.
