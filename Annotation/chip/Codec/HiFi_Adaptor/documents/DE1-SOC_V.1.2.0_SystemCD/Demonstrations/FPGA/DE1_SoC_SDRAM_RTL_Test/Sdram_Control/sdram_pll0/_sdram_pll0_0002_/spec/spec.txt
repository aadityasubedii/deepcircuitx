Module name: sdram_pll0_0002. Module specification: The 'sdram_pll0_0002' module is a Verilog-based PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) specifically designed for SDRAM applications, using an Altera PLL component. The module's primary functionality is to generate two synchronized output clocks from a single reference clock input, with one of the outputs featuring a -3000 ps phase shift, both set to operate at 100 MHz. The input ports include 'refclk', which provides the reference clock necessary for PLL operations, and 'rst', which is a reset input utilized for initializing or resetting the PLL's internal logic. The output ports are 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1', both operating at 100 MHz with 'outclk_1' having a phase shift for specific timing needs, and 'locked', which signifies whether the PLL has successfully locked to the input frequency. Internally, the module primarily comprises of an instantiated component 'altera_pll_i', configured according to specified parameters like clock frequencies, duty cycles, and phase shifts. This instantiated PLL effectively handles all transformations from the reference clock to the output clocks and lock detection with no additional user-defined internal signals or logic.
