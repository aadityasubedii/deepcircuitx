    "spec": "Module name: DIV. Module specification: The DIV module is designed to carry out division operations in hardware, processing a 10-bit numerator (`numer`) and a 4-bit denominator (`denom`) to produce both a 10-bit quotient (`quotient`) and a 4-bit remainder (`remain`). It integrates an asynchronous clear signal (`aclr`), which immediately resets the outputs to zero regardless of the clock state, and a clock input (`clock`) that synchronizes the division computations with the system\u2019s clock cycle. The module uses two internal signals, `sub_wire0` and `sub_wire1`, which serve as intermediate storage for the remainder and quotient results, respectively, linking the LPM_DIVIDE_component's outputs to the module's output ports. The code showcases a division component, `LPM_DIVIDE_component`, configured for unsigned division with specific parameters that aid in controlling the division behavior such as ensuring positive remainders and setting up pipeline stages for efficient processing. This component is connected with the main I/O ports through the described internal signals and is constantly enabled, ensured by the `clken` signal being tied to a high logic level (`1'b1`).",
