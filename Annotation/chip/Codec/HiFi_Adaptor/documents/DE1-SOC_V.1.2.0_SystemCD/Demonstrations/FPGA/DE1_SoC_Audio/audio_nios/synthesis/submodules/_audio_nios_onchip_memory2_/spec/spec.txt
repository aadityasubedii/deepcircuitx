Module name: audio_nios_onchip_memory2. 
Module specification: The audio_nios_onchip_memory2 is a Verilog module designed to provide on-chip memory functionality specifically for an Altera NIOS audio processor. It functions as a single-port synchronous RAM, defined primarily using the Altera's altsyncram block. The input ports include `address` (17-bit for specifying memory address), `byteenable` (4-bit indicating active byte lanes during write operations), `chipselect` (enables memory device access), `clk` (clock signal), `clken` (clock enable signal), `reset` and `reset_req` (to reset the module under various conditions), `write` (determines the operation mode), and `writedata` (32-bit data for memory write operations). The sole output port is `readdata` (32-bit outputting data from the memory read operations). Internal signals comprise `clocken0` (controls memory operation timing by combining `clken` and `reset_req`) and `wren` (write enable signal formed by `chipselect` and `write`). The module's code features the instantiation of the altsyncram component configured for single-port operation with parameters for byte size, memory depth, and others specified under `defparam`. Additionally, wiring and assignment of internal logics like `wren` and `clocken0` ensure the correct operational behavior with respect to the memory's timing and write functionalities.
