    "spec": "Module name: audio_nios_timer. \nModule specification: The `audio_nios_timer` is a Verilog module designed for use in audio processing systems utilizing a NIOS processor architecture. It functions as a sophisticated timer or counter device capable of reacting to various control signals for flexible operation. The module inputs include `address` for register access, `chipselect` for module selection on a shared bus, `clk` as a clock signal for synchronous operations, `reset_n` for initializing the module, `write_n` enabling write operations, and `writedata` carrying values to be written into registers. It outputs an `irq` interrupt signal for event notification and a `readdata` bus carrying register content back to the processor. Internally, `audio_nios_timer` utilizes signals like `control_continuous` for setting continuous operation mode, `control_interrupt_enable` for managing interrupts, and `internal_counter` serving as the primary counting mechanism. Key blocks of code handle counter operations, interrupt management, register accesses, and data output generation. Operations such as starting or stopping the counter, loading values, and managing timeouts are significantly controlled through the control registers. The module ensures robust timer functionality pivotal in maintaining synchronization in audio applications or any task requiring precise time management within a hardware system.",

                    "text": "Module name: audio_nios_timer. \nModule specification: The `audio_nios_timer` is a Verilog module designed for use in audio processing systems utilizing a NIOS processor architecture. It functions as a sophisticated timer or counter device capable of reacting to various control signals for flexible operation. The module inputs include `address` for register access, `chipselect` for module selection on a shared bus, `clk` as a clock signal for synchronous operations, `reset_n` for initializing the module, `write_n` enabling write operations, and `writedata` carrying values to be written into registers. It outputs an `irq` interrupt signal for event notification and a `readdata` bus carrying register content back to the processor. Internally, `audio_nios_timer` utilizes signals like `control_continuous` for setting continuous operation mode, `control_interrupt_enable` for managing interrupts, and `internal_counter` serving as the primary counting mechanism. Key blocks of code handle counter operations, interrupt management, register accesses, and data output generation. Operations such as starting or stopping the counter, loading values, and managing timeouts are significantly controlled through the control registers. The module ensures robust timer functionality pivotal in maintaining synchronization in audio applications or any task requiring precise time management within a hardware system."
