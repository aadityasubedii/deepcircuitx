Module-level comment: 
/* 
This module implements an interconnect system for a SoC design, managing communication between 
Nios II processor, memory, and peripherals. It uses address routers, demultiplexers, width 
adapters, and arbitration logic to handle data transfers between components with different 
bus widths and protocols. The module routes addresses, adapts data widths, manages bursts, 
and arbitrates between multiple masters and slaves, ensuring efficient system-wide communication.
