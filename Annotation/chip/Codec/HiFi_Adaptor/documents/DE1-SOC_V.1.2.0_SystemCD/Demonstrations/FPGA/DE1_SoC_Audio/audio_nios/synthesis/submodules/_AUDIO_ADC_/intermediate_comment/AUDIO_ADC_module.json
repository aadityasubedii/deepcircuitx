    "module": "Module-level comment: The AUDIO_ADC module processes incoming serial audio data from an ADC, distinguishing between left and right channels using the `adclrc` input. It converts serial data to a 32-bit parallel format through internal registers and bit-state controls, and manages data storage in a FIFO, with outputs ready for efficient retrieval. Additionally, it tackles channel transitions and ensures data integrity by handling reset and clear inputs, synchronized via the bit and system clocks. This module is integral for audio data acquisition and buffering in digital processing systems."
