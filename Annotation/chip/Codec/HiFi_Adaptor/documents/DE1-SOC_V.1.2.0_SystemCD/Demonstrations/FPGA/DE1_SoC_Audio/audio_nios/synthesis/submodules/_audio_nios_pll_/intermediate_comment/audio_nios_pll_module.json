    "module": "Module-level comment: The `audio_nios_pll` module uses an `altera_pll` component to generate three output clocks from a single reference clock, operating at specified frequencies and phases suited for audio processing applications. It features a reference clock, reset input, and outputs for the clocks and PLL lock status. The internal PLL parameters are comprehensively set for optimal functionality, including clock frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles. Feedback paths are defined but statically set as unused in this configuration."
