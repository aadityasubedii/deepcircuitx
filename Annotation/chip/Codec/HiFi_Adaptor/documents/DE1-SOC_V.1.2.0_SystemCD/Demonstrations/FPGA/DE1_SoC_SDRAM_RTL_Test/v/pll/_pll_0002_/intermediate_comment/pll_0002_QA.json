It receives an input reference clock (`refclk`) and generates an output clock (`outclk_0`) with a frequency doubled to 100 MHz from a 50 MHz reference clock. It also provides an output signal (`locked`) to indicate that the PLL is locked to the desired frequency. The module is controlled by an input reset signal (`rst`). Further, the module configures various parameters such as VCO multiplier, clock frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles for multiple clocks, though only one output clock is actively utilized in this configuration."

In this configuration, it is set at 50 MHz.\n- `rst`: This input is used to reset the PLL. When asserted (typically high), it resets the internal state of the PLL, affecting outputs and potentially re-initiating the locking process.  \n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `locked`.  \nExplanation:  \n- `outclk_0`: This is the primary output clock from the PLL, which is derived from the input reference clock. For this module, it generates a clock frequency of 100 MHz, effectively doubling the input clock frequency.\n- `locked`: This output signal indicates the lock status of the PLL.

This configuration does not involve any additional internal signal processing or storage elements like registers or buses within the `pll_0002` module itself, relying entirely on the configuration and functionality provided by the `altera_pll` module. The absence of additional internal signals suggests that all critical functionalities are managed by the `altera_pll` component, and the `pll_0002` acts mainly as a structural wrapper to configure and implement the PLL with specific settings for application use."
