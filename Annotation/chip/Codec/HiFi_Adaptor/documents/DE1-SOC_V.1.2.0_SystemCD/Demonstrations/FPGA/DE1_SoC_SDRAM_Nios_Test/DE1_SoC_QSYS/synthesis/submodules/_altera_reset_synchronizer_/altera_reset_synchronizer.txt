Module-level comment: The "altera_reset_synchronizer" module synchronizes an asynchronous reset signal to a clock signal, minimizing metastability in digital devices. It employs a configurable shift register ('DEPTH' parameter) and supports both immediate and clock-edge-triggered reset synchronization based on 'ASYNC_RESET'. This module uses conditional logic to either immediately assert and deassert or synchronize based on the clock, outputting through 'reset_out'.
