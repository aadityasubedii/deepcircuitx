Module-level comment: The YCbCr2RGB module converts 8-bit YCbCr color values to 10-bit RGB outputs, utilizing three MAC_3 units for matrix computations adjusted by shifting and offset. It operates on a positive clock edge, responds to an asynchronous reset, and manages data validity synchronization with output signals, ensuring coherent color transformation for video processing.
