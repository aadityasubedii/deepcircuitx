    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_tck is designed for JTAG debugging and trace memory interfacing. It utilizes input signals such as MonDReg, debugack, and various controls and data related to JTAG states to manage data shifting and capture, driven by state machines in response to IR values. Key outputs include the IR state, JTAG reset, and shifted data. Internal synchronization is achieved through standard synchronizers for clock domain crossing stability, ensuring reliable operation in handling trace and debug operations."
