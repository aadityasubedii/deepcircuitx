    "spec": "Module name: audio_nios_sysid_qsys. Module specification: The 'audio_nios_sysid_qsys' module is designed to output a system identification or configuration value based on the state of an input signal. The module has three input ports: 'address', 'clock', and 'reset_n'. 'Address' is a one-bit input that determines the output: if high, the output 'readdata' is set to a specific constant (1378176869); if low, 'readdata' is set to 0. The 'clock' input suggests potential future synchronization of operations although it is not utilized in the current logic. 'Reset_n' is an active-low reset, presumably for future functionality, as it is not used in the existing implementation. The sole output port is 'readdata', a 32-bit signal which reflects the system ID based on 'address'. Internally, 'readdata' is implemented as a wire which directly assigns its value based on the 'address' input through combinational logic. The code is straightforward and lacks distinct functional blocks, focusing merely on the assignment of 'readdata' based on 'address' without incorporating any clocked or reset-driven behavior.",
