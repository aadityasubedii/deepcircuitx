    "spec": "Module name: Sdram_PLL. Module specification: The Sdram_PLL is a Verilog module designed specifically for SDRAM applications, utilizing a phase-locked loop (PLL) to generate multiple output clocks based on a reference clock input. It accepts two input ports: `refclk`, which is the reference clock that the PLL locks onto, and `rst`, a reset input that initializes the PLL to a known start state, ensuring stable operation from power-up. The module outputs three clock signals through the ports `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, and `outclk_2`, each potentially operating at different frequencies or phases to meet the needs of the SDRAM subsystem being used. Internally, the module instantiates a submodule named `Sdram_PLL_0002`, which is directly connected to both the input and output ports, but does not employ any internal signals for further processing, indicating a straightforward pass-through implementation. This instantiation handles the core functionality, including the generation of the required clock outputs and the managing of lock status, although the lock status (`locked`) is not connected or used externally in this module. The design encapsulates all PLL-related operations within the `Sdram_PLL_0002` submodule, simplifying the primary module to mainly manage port assignments and integration with the rest of the system.",
