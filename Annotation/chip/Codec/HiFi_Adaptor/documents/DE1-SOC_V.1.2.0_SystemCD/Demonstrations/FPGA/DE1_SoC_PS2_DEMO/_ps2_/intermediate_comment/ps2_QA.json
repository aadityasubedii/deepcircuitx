The module handles the bi-directional communication by managing the PS/2 clock and data lines, tracking states using a finite state machine to pull and sync data. It decodes the incoming data into meaningful signals such as left, right, and middle button clicks (oLEFBUT, oRIGBUT, oMIDBUT) and motion in the x and y directions (oX_MOV1, oX_MOV2, oY_MOV1, oY_MOV2), which signify the movement and button states on a connected PS/2 mouse. The logic primarily operates on the edge and level changes detected on the clock line from the PS/2 device, and actively manages internal states for effective data transactions."

It essentially starts the data transfer phases as defined within the state machine of the module.\n- iRST_n: This input signal is an active low reset, used to reset the internal state of the module to initial conditions, clearing any operations or latched data. Essential for initializing or reinitializing the module upon start-up or after error conditions.\n- iCLK_50: This input clock signal is used to time and control the operation of the module\u2019s internal processes, including the state machine transitions and data sampling.\n\nOutput ports: [oLEFBUT, oRIGBUT, oMIDBUT, oX_MOV1, oX_MOV2, oY_MOV1, oY_MOV2].\nExplanation: \n- oLEFBUT, oRIGBUT, oMIDBUT: These outputs indicate the status of the left, right, and middle buttons of a PS/2 mouse, respectively. They are set high when the corresponding button is pressed.\n- oX_MOV1, oX_MOV2, oY_MOV1, oY_MOV2: These outputs provide the movement data of a PS/2 mouse in the X and Y directions, segmented into two parts each (upper and lower nibbles of a 7-bit number for larger movements). These outputs are used to represent the amount of displacement of the mouse in two dimensions.\n\nInout ports: [PS2_CLK, PS2_DAT].\nExplanation:\n- PS2_CLK: This is a bidirectional line used for the clock signal shared between the PS/2 device and the host. The module drives this line low when pulling the clock line is necessary as per the PS/2 communication protocol.\n- PS2_DAT: This is a bidirectional line used for the data signals shared between the PS/2 device and the host. This line is driven by the module for sending data or may be left in a high impedance state to receive data from the PS/2 device."
