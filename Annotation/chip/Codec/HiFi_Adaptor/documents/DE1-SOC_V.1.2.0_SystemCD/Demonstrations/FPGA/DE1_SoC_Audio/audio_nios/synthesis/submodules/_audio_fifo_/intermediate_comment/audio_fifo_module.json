    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'audio_fifo' module is a dual-clock FIFO designed for handling audio data with asynchronous read/write capabilities, suited for varying data rates in audio applications. It utilizes a 'dcfifo_component' optimized for Cyclone IV E devices, managing internal flow through connections like 'sub_wire0', 'sub_wire1', and 'sub_wire2' for status and data signals. Key functionalities include handling of overflow, underflow, and status indication through signals like 'rdempty' and 'wrfull'."
