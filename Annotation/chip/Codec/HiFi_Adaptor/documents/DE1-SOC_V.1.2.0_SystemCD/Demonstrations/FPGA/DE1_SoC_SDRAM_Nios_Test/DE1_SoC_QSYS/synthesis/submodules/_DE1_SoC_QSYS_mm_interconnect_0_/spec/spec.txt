Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_mm_interconnect_0. Module specification: This module implements an interconnect system for a System-on-Chip (SoC) design, managing communication between various components including a Nios II processor, memory, and peripherals. It features input ports for clock, reset, and master signals from the Nios II processor, and output ports for slave components such as JTAG UART, timer, and SDRAM. The module utilizes numerous internal signals for address routing, data width adaptation, and arbitration. Key components include address routers, command and response demultiplexers, data width adapters, and arbitration logic. The interconnect system handles address routing, data width adaptation, burst adaptation, and arbitration between multiple masters and slaves, efficiently managing data transfers between different parts of the system with potentially different bus widths and protocols.
