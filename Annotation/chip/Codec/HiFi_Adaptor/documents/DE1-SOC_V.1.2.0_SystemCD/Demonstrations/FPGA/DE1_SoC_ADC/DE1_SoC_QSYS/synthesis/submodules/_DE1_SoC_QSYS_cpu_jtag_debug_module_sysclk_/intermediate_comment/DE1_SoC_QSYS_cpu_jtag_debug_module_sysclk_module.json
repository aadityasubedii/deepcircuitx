    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk manages CPU debug operations via JTAG, synchronized with a system clock. It inputs JTAG codes and data and outputs control signals based on the internal state and inputs. Utilizes edge detection, signal synchronization, and conditional logic to maintain precise control during debugging, ensuring synchronization and operational integrity via internal staging registers and synchronizer blocks."
