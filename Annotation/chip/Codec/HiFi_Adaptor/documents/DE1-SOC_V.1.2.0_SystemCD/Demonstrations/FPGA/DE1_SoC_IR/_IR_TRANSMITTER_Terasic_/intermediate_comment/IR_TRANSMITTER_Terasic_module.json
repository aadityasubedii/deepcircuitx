    "module": "Module-level comment: The IR_TRANSMITTER_Terasic module facilitates IR communication by transmitting address and command data. It handles input signals with a 50 MHz clock, processes them through various FSM stages including lead signals and data transfer, and outputs the modulated IR signal by synchronizing it with a generated 38 kHz clock. This design ensures accurate and reliable IR transmissions conformant to specified timing protocols."
