    "spec": "Module name: AUDIO_ADC. Module specification: The AUDIO_ADC Verilog module is essential for processing audio data acquired from an ADC device, specifically designed to manage digital audio workflows by capturing serial data inputs and facilitating storage in a FIFO buffer for later use. It operates with several input ports, including `clk` for reading from the FIFO buffer, `reset` for resetting internal states, `read` to fetch data from the FIFO, `clear` for clearing data handling states, `bclk` (bit clock) for serial data capturing synchronization, `adclrc` for channel differentiation, and `adcdat` for receiving serial audio data. The output ports include `readdata` which carries the processed data from the FIFO, `empty` to indicate FIFO buffer status, and `adcfifo_full` to prevent data overflows by signaling when the FIFO is full. Internally, it uses various signals like `bit_index` for current bit position tracking during data frame assembly, `valid_bit` to flag valid bits, `reg_adc_left` and `is_left_ch` for channel state management, `reg_adc_serial_data` for accumulating converted bits for each audio channel frame, `adcfifo_writedata` and `adcfifo_write` for managing FIFO write operations, and `wait_one_clk` for adding delay ensuring reliable data processing during channel transitions. The code can be separated into blocks handling bit state management and transition detection, serial to parallel conversion, and FIFO management where the processed data is stored or retrieved based on system clock signals, all encapsulated by integrating with the `audio_fifo` module which handles the FIFO operations. Such a structured approach enables clear functioning and efficient audio data management suitable for systems requiring reliable audio processing capabilities.",

This module captures serial audio data input (adcdat), determines the channel (left or right) based on the adclrc signal, and processes the data into a 32-bit wide format before storing it in a FIFO (First-In First-Out) buffer. The module operates synchronously with a bit clock (bclk) and handles reset or clear signals to reset internal states. It organizes the serial audio data for each channel into frames, converts them from serial to parallel format, and writes the complete data frames into a FIFO buffer, checking if the buffer is full before writing to avoid data overflow. Data from the FIFO can be read out synchronously with another clock (clk) upon request, with an indicator if the FIFO is empty."

It synchronizes the serial data capturing process.\n- `adclrc`: This signal indicates which channel (left or right) of the audio data is being received. Its state determines the processing path of incoming data bits.\n- `adcdat`: This is the serial audio data input from an external ADC.\n\nOutput ports: readdata, empty, adcfifo_full.\nExplanation:\n- `readdata`: This port outputs the data that has been read from the FIFO buffer.
