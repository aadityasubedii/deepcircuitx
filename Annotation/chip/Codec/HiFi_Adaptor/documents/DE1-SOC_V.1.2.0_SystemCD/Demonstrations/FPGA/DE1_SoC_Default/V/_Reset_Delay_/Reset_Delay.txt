Module-level comment: The Reset_Delay module generates a delayed reset signal 'oRESET' upon counting a preset number of 'iCLK' clock cycles. It uses a 20-bit counter 'Cont' that increments each clock cycle until the maximum count (0xFFFFF) is reached. Initially, 'oRESET' is low and switches to high when 'Cont' hits its maximum, ensuring a timely system reset.
