Module-level comment: The 'pll' module functions as a phase-locked loop, primarily for frequency synthesis and clock domain synchronization. It utilizes inputs 'refclk' (reference clock) and 'rst' (reset) to produce a stabilized output clock 'outclk_0' and a 'locked' status signal, indicating frequency stabilization. Implementation is achieved via the direct mapping of these ports to the submodule 'pll_0002', which encapsulates all internal logic and processing.
