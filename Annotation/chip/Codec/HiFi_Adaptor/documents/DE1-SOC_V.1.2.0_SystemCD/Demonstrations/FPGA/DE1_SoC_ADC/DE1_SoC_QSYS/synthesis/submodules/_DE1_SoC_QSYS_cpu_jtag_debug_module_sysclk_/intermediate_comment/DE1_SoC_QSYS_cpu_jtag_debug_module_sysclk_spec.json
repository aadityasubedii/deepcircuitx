    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk is designed primarily for managing CPU debugging operations via a JTAG interface, synchronized with the system clock. It has input ports including the system clock (**clk**), instruction register (**ir_in**) representing JTAG instruction codes, shift register data input (**sr**), and update signals for the data register (**vs_udr**) and instruction register (**vs_uir**). The output ports encompass a 38-bit JTAG data output (**jdo**) and various control signals that command specific actions or inhibit actions based on JTAG instructions and data states. These outputs control different debugging operations such as breakpoints and memory operation controls. Internally, signals like **enable_action_strobe**, **update_jdo_strobe**, and **ir** manage the timing and conditions under which actions are taken or blocked. Edge detection and synchronization are handled by **sync_udr**, **sync_uir**, **sync2_udr**, and **sync2_uir**, to ensure operations are aligned with the system clock. Blocks utilizing the Altera standard synchronizers handle input signal synchronization, and conditional assignment and sequential logic blocks manage output and internal state updates in response to synchronized input signals. This module is essential for debugging tasks, allowing for precise control and observation of CPU operations during development and testing.",

Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk is designed primarily for managing CPU debugging operations via a JTAG interface, synchronized with the system clock. It has input ports including the system clock (**clk**), instruction register (**ir_in**) representing JTAG instruction codes, shift register data input (**sr**), and update signals for the data register (**vs_udr**) and instruction register (**vs_uir**). The output ports encompass a 38-bit JTAG data output (**jdo**) and various control signals that command specific actions or inhibit actions based on JTAG instructions and data states. These outputs control different debugging operations such as breakpoints and memory operation controls. Internally, signals like **enable_action_strobe**, **update_jdo_strobe**, and **ir** manage the timing and conditions under which actions are taken or blocked. Edge detection and synchronization are handled by **sync_udr**, **sync_uir**, **sync2_udr**, and **sync2_uir**, to ensure operations are aligned with the system clock. Blocks utilizing the Altera standard synchronizers handle input signal synchronization, and conditional assignment and sequential logic blocks manage output and internal state updates in response to synchronized input signals. This module is essential for debugging tasks, allowing for precise control and observation of CPU operations during development and testing."
