    "spec": "Module name: Sdram_PLL_0002. Module specification: The Sdram_PLL_0002 is a Verilog module that employs an Altera Phase Locked Loop (PLL) to generate three distinct output clock signals from a single reference clock input, designed specifically for SDRAM operations. It features input ports `refclk` and `rst`, where `refclk` serves as the reference clock for the PLL, and `rst` is used to reset the PLL to its initial state under specific conditions. The output ports include `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`, all of which are configured with different frequencies and phase shifts, and a `locked` signal that indicates the PLL locking status. The key internal element in this module is the `altera_pll` instance which is set up with various parameters such as clock frequencies and phase shifts to produce the necessary output clocks and monitor the lock status. There are no explicitly declared internal signals as the module interfaces directly through its ports, with all functionalities embedded within the instantiated PLL block. This module is crucial in applications requiring precise clock generation and synchronization such as memory interfaces in digital hardware systems.",

The configuration provided sets up three distinct output clocks with different frequencies and phase shifts, specifically targeting certain functionalities in SDRAM operations. The PLL ensures that the generated clocks are stable and phase-aligned as required. Additionally, the module provides a 'locked' signal indicating when the PLL is successfully locked to the input clock, ensuring reliable operation. This is typically used in hardware designs where precise clock timing is critical, like in memory interfaces."

It serves as the base frequency from which the PLL generates the desired output clock frequencies.\n- `rst`: This is the reset input which, when active, resets the PLL to its initial state. This is essential for bringing the PLL to a known state before it starts operating or in case it needs to recover from an error state.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`, `locked`.\nExplanation:\n- `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`: These are the output clocks generated by the PLL based on the reference clock. Each clock output can be configured with different frequencies and phase shifts. For instance, in the given configuration, `outclk_0` and `outclk_1` are both configured to 100 MHz, but with different phase shifts, while `outclk_2` is set at approximately 18.37 MHz with no phase shift.\n- `locked`: This is an indicator output signal that denotes when the PLL has achieved phase and frequency lock. When `locked` is high (1), it indicates that the output clocks are stable and the PLL is functioning correctly. This signal is crucial for ensuring that the downstream digital logic operates on stable clock edges."
