Module-level comment: The DE1_SOC_IR module manages IO peripherals on a DE1 SoC board with an emphasis on IR communication. It integrates IR receive and transmit functions, handling external inputs such as clocks, switches, and IR signals, and controls outputs like audio, ADC, and HEX displays. Internally, it uses flags like data_ready and tx_busy to control data flow, coordinating sub-modules for IR data processing and display handling, ensuring organized data communication and user interactivity.
