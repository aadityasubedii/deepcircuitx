Module name: VGA_Audio_0002. 
Module specification: The VGA_Audio_0002 module utilizes an Altera PLL to generate three distinct output clocks from a single reference clock. This helps in effective digital clock management across different sections of a system. The input ports include `refclk`, serving as the reference clock for the PLL and `rst` which is used to reset the PLL during initialization or error scenarios. The output ports comprise `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`, delivering various configured clock signals, and `locked`, indicating the PLL's lock status on the reference clock. Internally, the module does not explicitly declare any signals but configures and instantiates the `altera_pll` component, directly handling all functionality through this block. The `altera_pll` block is parameterized with the required frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles for output clocks alongside general PLL settings, mapped to handle the incoming reference clock, delivering stable output clocks and a lock status. This structuring ensures a streamlined setup to generate multiple synchronized clock outputs crucial for robust digital system operations.
