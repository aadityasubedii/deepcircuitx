Each SEG7_LUT instance within the module maps a specific 4-bit segment of the input 'iDIG' to the corresponding outputs 'oSEG0' to 'oSEG5'.

Each output port `oSEGx` (where x ranges from 0 to 5) receives a 4-bit section of the input `iDIG` and outputs the corresponding 7-bit pattern to drive a 7-segment display to show the hexadecimal value of the input segments.

Everything is handled within the `SEG7_LUT` instances themselves, so all internal signal processing would occur in those sub-modules, and not explicitly within the `SEG7_LUT_8` module as presented."
