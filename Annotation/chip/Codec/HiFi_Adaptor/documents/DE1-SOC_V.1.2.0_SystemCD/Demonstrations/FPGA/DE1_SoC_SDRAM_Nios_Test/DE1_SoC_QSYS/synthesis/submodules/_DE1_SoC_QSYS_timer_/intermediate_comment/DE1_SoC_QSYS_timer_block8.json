    "block_comment": "This block assigns the value of `counter_snapshot` to the signal `snap_read_value`. The use of the `assign` statement indicates a continuous assignment in Verilog, which means that anytime `counter_snapshot` changes, `snap_read_value` will immediately take on the new value, mirroring the state of `counter_snapshot` continuously."
