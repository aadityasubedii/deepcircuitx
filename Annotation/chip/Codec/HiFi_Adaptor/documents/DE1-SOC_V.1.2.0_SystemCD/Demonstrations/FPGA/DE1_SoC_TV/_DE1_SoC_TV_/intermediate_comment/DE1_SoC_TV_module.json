    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_TV module facilitates multimedia processing on an FPGA, primarily handling audio and video data. It integrates and synchronizes various input signals through ADC, HPS interfaces, and video inputs, processing them for output via VGA for display. Internally, the module employs several sub-modules for specific tasks: ITU_656_Decoder for video format decoding, SDRAM_Control for memory operations, and YCbCr2RGB for color conversion, efficiently managing multimedia streams in real-time applications."
