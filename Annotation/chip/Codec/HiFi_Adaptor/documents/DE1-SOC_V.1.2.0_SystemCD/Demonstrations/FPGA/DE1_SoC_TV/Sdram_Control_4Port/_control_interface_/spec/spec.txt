Module name: control_interface. 

Module specification: The control_interface module is designed to manage command and control signaling for an SDRAM system in a synchronous manner using a provided clock (CLK) and an active-low reset (RESET_N). The module processes inputs such as commands (CMD), memory addresses (ADDR), and acknowledgment signals from SDRAM (REF_ACK, INIT_ACK, CM_ACK) to produce output control signals including NOP (no operation), READA (read enable), WRITEA (write enable), REFRESH, PRECHARGE, LOAD_MODE, scrubbed address (SADDR), refresh request (REF_REQ), initialization request (INIT_REQ), and command acknowledgment (CMD_ACK). Internal signals include 16-bit timers (timer and init_timer) to sequence refresh and initialization operations, respectively. The module features multiple always blocks that:
1. Manage output signals based on the command inputs and reset conditions, updating operational status signals like NOP, READA, WRITEA, and directly forwarding the memory address as SADDR.
2. Control the acknowledgment of commands based on feedback from the SDRAM (CMD_ACK) to ensure commands are processed correctly.
3. Time and sequence the refresh requests (REF_REQ) based on the last refresh acknowledgment or during initialization, using the timer for refresh operations.
4. Orchestrate the initialization process, where signals such as REFRESH, PRECHARGE, LOAD_MODE, and INIT_REQ are activated in a timed sequence using the init_timer to properly initialize the SDRAM. 

This structured approach to managing SDRAM operations ensures efficient memory access and control, tailored to the needs of the system's operation and initialization phases.
