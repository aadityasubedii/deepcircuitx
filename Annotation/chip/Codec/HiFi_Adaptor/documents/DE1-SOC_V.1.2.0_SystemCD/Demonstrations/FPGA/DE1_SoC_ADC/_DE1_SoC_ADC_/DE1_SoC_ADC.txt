Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_ADC module serves as an integration point for interfacing with peripherals on a DE1-SoC board. It manages multiple input and output ports for data and control signals across devices like ADC, DRAM, and VGA. Internally, it utilizes signals such as clk_50 and spi_0_external_MISO within the DE1_SoC_QSYS submodule to handle clock management and SPI communication, ensuring coordinated data processing and peripheral control.
