    "spec": "Module name: altera_reset_controller. Module specification: The `altera_reset_controller` module is designed to handle and synchronize reset signals in digital designs, using a clock signal as a reference. It features sixteen input ports labeled `reset_in0` to `reset_in15` for receiving external reset signals, and a `clk` port for the clock signal used to synchronize these inputs. These inputs are merged into a single reset signal. The module outputs two signals: `reset_out`, a synchronized reset output, and `reset_req`, an optional reset request signal that flags special reset conditions. Inside the module, several important internal signals are employed, such as `merged_reset` for combining all reset inputs, and `reset_out_pre` as an intermediate synchronized reset signal. Register chains like `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain` and `r_sync_rst_chain` are utilized for managing and timing the outputs to mitigate potential race conditions or metastability. The module is sectioned into blocks managing the merging of resets, optional synchronization logic, and conditional checks to generate the synchronized and request outputs. This organized approach ensures the synchronized reset signal aligns correctly with the clock edges to support reliable system behavior under various configuration parameters set through the module's instantiation.",

This module accepts multiple reset inputs and generates a synchronized reset output along with an optional reset request signal depending on configuration parameters. The reset is synchronized to the clock to avoid metastability issues, and various parameters are configurable, such as the number of reset inputs, the synchronization depth, and behavior upon reset request presence. Depending on the parameter settings, the output reset signal can be manipulated to be either in an asserted or deasserted state correctly following an edge of the clock. The synchronization process using chains of registers (flip-flops) ensures reliable timing in critical applications, typically found in FPGA designs or digital circuits requiring robust reset mechanisms."

Explanation: The 'reset_inX' ports (where X ranges from 0 to 15) are used to receive external reset signals that can come from various sources. These multiple reset inputs allow the module to handle reset signals coming from different parts of a system, each potentially triggering a reset condition. The 'clk' input is the clock signal used for synchronizing the reset signals. This signal provides the timing reference necessary for synchronization processes within the module, ensuring that the outputs are stable and synchronized to the clock edges to avoid asynchronous behavior and potential metastability.\n\nOutput ports: reset_out, reset_req. Explanation: The 'reset_out' port provides the synchronized reset output. It is used to drive the reset inputs of other modules or components in the system, ensuring they are reset cleanly in synchronization with the clock. The 'reset_req' port optionally outputs a reset request signal which can be used to indicate special reset conditions or requirements, depending on the configuration of the reset controller. This signal can be utilized for further control logic or signaling in a complex system setup where different reset behaviors might be required."

It essentially merges any active-high reset trigger coming from any of the input lines into a single reset signal that the module can internally manipulate.\n\n2. **reset_out_pre**: This is an intermediate reset signal before it is assigned to the `reset_out` output. If the configuration parameter `OUTPUT_RESET_SYNC_EDGES` is \"none,\" `reset_out_pre` simply passes the merged reset signal. Otherwise, it passes through additional synchronization logic provided by the `altera_reset_synchronizer` instance.\n\n3. **altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain**: This is a register chain used in reset synchronization. It captures the state of the `reset_out_pre` through flip-flops synchronized with the clock signal. This chain helps in creating a delay and managing the timing to alter the behavior of the reset signals, hence aiding in mitigating race conditions or metastability.\n\n4. **r_sync_rst_chain**: Another synchronization register chain involved in handling the reset signal. It operates under the control of the `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain` and is crucial in the final computation of the synchronized reset signals.\n\n5. **r_sync_rst_dly**: A register that holds the delayed state of the last bit of the `r_sync_rst_chain`. It assists in creating the final synchronized reset logic by providing a historical logic level necessary for edge detection and reset logic determination.\n\n6. **r_sync_rst**: This is the final synchronized reset output which is assigned back to the `reset_out` if the reset request feature is activated. It evaluates various conditions using `r_sync_rst_chain` and `r_sync_rst_dly` effectively determining when to assert or deassert.\n\n7. **r_early_rst**: It enables early reset signals based on the tapping point defined in the chain `r_sync_rst_chain`. It uses specific logic conditions to determine its status and is mapped to the `reset_req` output to signal an early detection of reset conditions.\n"

                    "text": "Module name: altera_reset_controller. Module specification: The `altera_reset_controller` module is designed to handle and synchronize reset signals in digital designs, using a clock signal as a reference. It features sixteen input ports labeled `reset_in0` to `reset_in15` for receiving external reset signals, and a `clk` port for the clock signal used to synchronize these inputs. These inputs are merged into a single reset signal. The module outputs two signals: `reset_out`, a synchronized reset output, and `reset_req`, an optional reset request signal that flags special reset conditions. Inside the module, several important internal signals are employed, such as `merged_reset` for combining all reset inputs, and `reset_out_pre` as an intermediate synchronized reset signal. Register chains like `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain` and `r_sync_rst_chain` are utilized for managing and timing the outputs to mitigate potential race conditions or metastability. The module is sectioned into blocks managing the merging of resets, optional synchronization logic, and conditional checks to generate the synchronized and request outputs. This organized approach ensures the synchronized reset signal aligns correctly with the clock edges to support reliable system behavior under various configuration parameters set through the module's instantiation."
