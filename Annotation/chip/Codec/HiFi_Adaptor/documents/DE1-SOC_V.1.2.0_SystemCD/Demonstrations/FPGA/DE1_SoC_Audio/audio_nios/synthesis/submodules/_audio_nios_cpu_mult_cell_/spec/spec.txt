Module name: audio_nios_cpu_mult_cell.
Module specification: The `audio_nios_cpu_mult_cell` module performs 32-bit multiplication of two input signals, `A_mul_src1` and `A_mul_src2`, utilizing two instances of the `altera_mult_add` component for partial multiplications. It outputs the 32-bit result `A_mul_cell_result`. The inputs include `A_mul_src1` and `A_mul_src2`, both of which are 32-bit operands for the multiplication, along with `clk` (clock signal to synchronize operations) and `reset_n` (active-low reset signal to initialize internal signals and registers). Internal signals include `A_mul_cell_result_part_1` and `A_mul_cell_result_part_2`, holding intermediate results from the lower and mixed bit multiplications, respectively, and `mul_clr`, an active-low clear signal derived from negating `reset_n`. The module integrates two `altera_mult_add` blocks: `the_altmult_add_part_1` and `the_altmult_add_part_2`. The first block multiplies the lower 16 bits of both inputs and the second block multiplies the upper 16 bits of the first input with the lower 16 bits of the second. Finally, `A_mul_cell_result` is computed by merging the high 16 bits of `A_mul_cell_result_part_1` added to `A_mul_cell_result_part_2` with the low 16 bits of `A_mul_cell_result_part_1`. This formulation allows the module to handle a 32-bit multiplication by breaking it down into manageable partial operations, ensuring efficient hardware utilization and performance.
