    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'audio_nios_sysid_qsys' module outputs a system ID based on the input 'address'. It has three inputs: 'address', 'clock', and 'reset_n'. The output 'readdata' (32-bit) is set to 1378176869 if 'address' is high, or 0 if low. The module operates purely combinatorially without utilizing the 'clock' or 'reset_n'."
