Module-level comment: The 'sdr_data_path' module manages data paths in an SDRAM interface by directly mirroring DATAIN to DQOUT and setting the data mask output DQM based on the input DM or presetting it to all ones on a reset. It uses a clocked always block for conditionally handling the DQM signal during reset or normal operations, ensuring DQM accurately reflects the state of DM or a known state during reset, with an immediate assignment for DQOUT execution.
