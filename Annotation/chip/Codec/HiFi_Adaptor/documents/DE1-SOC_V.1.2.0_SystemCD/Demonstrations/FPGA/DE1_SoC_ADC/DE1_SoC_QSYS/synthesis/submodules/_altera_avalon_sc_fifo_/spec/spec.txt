Module name: altera_avalon_sc_fifo. Module specification: This module implements a configurable FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer primarily designed for Altera's Avalon interface in FPGA environments. It supports various features including packet handling, error signaling, multiple channels, store-and-forward mechanisms, and variable data width. The module uses either flip-flops or memory blocks for data storage and can be configured with optional almost full/empty flags. Key inputs include clock (clk), reset, data input (in_data), and various control signals (in_valid, in_startofpacket, in_endofpacket, in_empty, in_error, in_channel, out_ready). Outputs mirror these inputs (out_data, out_valid, etc.) along with status signals. Internal signals manage read/write pointers, FIFO status flags, packet handling
