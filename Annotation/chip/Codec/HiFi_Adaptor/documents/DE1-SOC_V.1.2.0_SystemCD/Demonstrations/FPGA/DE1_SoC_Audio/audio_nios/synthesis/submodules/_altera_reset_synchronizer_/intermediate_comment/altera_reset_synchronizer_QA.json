The module provides two primary modes of operation based on the parameter ASYNC_RESET. If ASYNC_RESET is enabled (set to 1), the module captures and propagates the asynchronous reset signal through a shift register chain, ensuring the reset is synchronized with the clock edges. If ASYNC_RESET is disabled (set to 0), the module uses a similar shift register to directly pass the reset signal which is already assumed to be synchronous with the clock. The parameter DEPTH determines the number of flip-flops in the shift register chain, which impacts how the reset signal is delayed and thus how securely it is synchronized."

Explanation: The 'reset_in' port is the asynchronous reset input which needs to be synchronized to the clock input 'clk'. The 'clk' port is the clock signal to which the reset signal will be synchronized, ensuring all operations occur at clock edges to prevent metastability.\n\nOutput ports: [reset_out]. Explanation: The 'reset_out' port outputs the synchronized reset signal. Depending on the parameter settings, this output is either directly driven by the logic level of 'reset_in' or through a synchronization chain to ensure it aligns with the clock edges, thereby stabilizing the system's reset behavior."

Explanation: The 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain' is a shift register of length determined by the DEPTH parameter. This register is used to shift the reset signal through multiple flip-flops, delaying it appropriately to achieve synchronization with the clock. Every positive clock edge moves the signal one step through the chain. The signal 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out' is the final output of the shift register chain and directly drives the 'reset_out' port. It holds the synchronized reset signal's final value before it is output, ensuring the reset action aligns with the clock and is free from glitches or metastability issues."
