Module-level comment: /* This module implements a System-on-Chip (SoC) design for a DE1 development board. It integrates a Nios II processor, SDRAM and on-chip memory interfaces, peripheral controllers (timer, JTAG UART, key input), and system components (PLL, reset controller). The module uses an Avalon memory-mapped interface to interconnect these components, creating a complete embedded system with clock distribution, reset handling, and external connections for SDRAM and user input. */
