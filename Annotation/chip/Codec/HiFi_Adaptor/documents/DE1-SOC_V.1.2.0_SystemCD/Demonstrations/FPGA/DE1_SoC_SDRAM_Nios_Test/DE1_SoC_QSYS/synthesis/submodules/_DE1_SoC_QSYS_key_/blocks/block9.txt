Comment: 
The block of code is designed to handle reset and mask updating of an interrupt request (irq). When a negative edge reset is detected, it zeroes out the irq_mask register. If there is no reset, it checks for a chip select high signal and a write enable low signal (indicating a write operation) with the address equal to 2, at the positive edge of the clock. If these conditions are met, the irq_mask register is updated with the lower four bits of the input write-data.
