Module name: TP_RAM. Module specification: The TP_RAM is a Verilog module designed to manage dual-port RAM operations using an `alt3pram` component suited for Cyclone IV E FPGA implementations. This module is centered around synchronous operations determined by the `clock` input, handling data through appropriate read and write sequences. The input ports include `clock`, `data`, `rdaddress_a`, `rdaddress_b`, `wraddress`, and `wren`. The `clock` input synchronizes the module's operations, `data` is a 24-bit value written to RAM, `rdaddress_a` and `rdaddress_b` are 10-bit addresses for reading data outputs `qa` and `qb` respectively, `wraddress` is the 10-bit address for writing the `data` when `wren` (write enable signal) is high. The outputs, `qa` and `qb`, are 24-bit data outputs read from the specified read addresses. Internally, the module utilizes `sub_wire0` and `sub_wire1` signals as intermediaries to hold the read data before outputting through `qa` and `qb` respectively. The core of this module comprises the `alt3pram` component which is parametrized and controlled for read and write functionality with settings such as edge registrations and asynchronic clears being set to off, indicating tightly controlled, synchronous behavior based on the clock input, optimizing the module for specific operational requirements of a Cyclone IV E FPGA environment. This setup ensures the robust management of RAM operations, read and write data integrity, and synchronization across data transactions.
