    "spec": "Module name: Reset_Delay.\nModule specification: The Reset_Delay module is designed for generating staggered reset signals, which are instrumental in managing the sequential start-up phase of various system components. It accepts two inputs: iCLK, a clock signal guaranteeing the updates happen at the clock\u2019s positive edge or when the reset signal is negative; and iRST, an active-low reset input that initializes the counter and output signals to zero to ensure the system starts from a known state. The module outputs three delayed reset signals: oRST_0, oRST_1, and oRST_2, which are each released at different counter thresholds to facilitate phased activation. Internally, the module uses a 22-bit counter (Cont) which increments with each clock cycle until a maximum value is reached, thereby dictating the release timings of the outputs based on predefined threshold values. The Verilog implementation comprises a primary always block that listens on the clock\u2019s positive edge and the reset signal\u2019s negative edge. Within this block, conditional checks determine whether to reset the counter and outputs, or increment the counter and subsequently set the output signals when their respective thresholds are met. This structured approach enables a controlled, sequential reset process across interdependent modules or systems.",

When the input reset is de-asserted (low), it synchronously resets a 22-bit counter (Cont) and all output reset signals to 0. As the clock cycles, the counter increments until it reaches a predefined maximum (22'h3FFFFF). The output reset signals are then individually set to high at staggered counter thresholds: oRST_0 goes high when the counter is beyond 22'h1FFFFF, oRST_1 after 22'h2FFFFF, and oRST_2 after reaching the maximum. This creates a sequence of delayed reset outputs which can be used to control the start-up behavior of other parts of a larger system in a controlled, phased manner."
