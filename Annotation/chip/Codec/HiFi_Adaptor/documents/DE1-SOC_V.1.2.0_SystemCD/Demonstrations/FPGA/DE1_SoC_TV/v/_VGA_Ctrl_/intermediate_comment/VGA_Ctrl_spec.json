    "spec": "Module name: VGA_Ctrl.\nModule specification: The VGA_Ctrl module is designed to control a VGA display by generating necessary signals, including synchronization, pixel clocks, and RGB outputs. It inputs RGB color values (iRed, iGreen, iBlue) and outputs corresponding VGA signals (oVGA_R, oVGA_G, oVGA_B) to drive the display. Additional outputs include current X and Y coordinates (oCurrent_X, oCurrent_Y), frame memory address (oAddress), and request signal for pixel data (oRequest). The module operates based on the input clock (iCLK) and can be reset via an active-low reset signal (iRST_N). Internally, the module uses horizontal (H_Cont) and vertical (V_Cont) counters to manage the timing and positioning of pixels on the screen, which in turn helps in generating horizontal (oVGA_HS) and vertical (oVGA_VS) synchronization signals. It includes several parameters defining the dimensions and timings of the display raster, crucial for the accurate generation of outputs adjusting to VGA standards. The module involves conditional logics within two always blocks that manage the increment and reset operations for counters based on the clock and reset signals, crucial for controlling H_Cont and V_Cont's progression across their respective ranges. Additional assignments determine oVGA_SYNC, oVGA_BLANK (indicating blanking periods), oVGA_CLOCK (pixel clock), and direct mapping of input RGB values to outputs. This structured approach enables precise control over the VGA interface, ensuring proper display timings and color output.",

The module takes in pixel data defined by RGB values (input signals iRed, iGreen, iBlue) and outputs these colors through oVGA_R, oVGA_G, and oVGA_B, aligned according to the current pixel position (oCurrent_X, oCurrent_Y) within the active video region.

The counter is incremented on the edge of the horizontal sync signal indicating the move to the next vertical line, and it resets when the end of the display frame is reached.
