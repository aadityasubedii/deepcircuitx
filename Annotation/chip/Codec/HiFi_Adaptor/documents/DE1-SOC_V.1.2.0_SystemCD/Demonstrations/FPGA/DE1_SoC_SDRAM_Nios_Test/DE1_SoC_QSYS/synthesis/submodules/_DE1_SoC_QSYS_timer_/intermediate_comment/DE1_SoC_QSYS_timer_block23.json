    "block_comment": "This block manages the state of a counter based on a control signal and a reset condition. On a negative reset, the counter disables by setting `counter_is_running` to 0. During active clock cycles enabled by `clk_en`, if a start signal (`do_start_counter`) is received, it sets `counter_is_running` to a high state, and if a stop signal (`do_stop_counter`) is received, it resets `counter_is_running` to low. Thus, controlling the counter's running state based on signals and reset conditions."
