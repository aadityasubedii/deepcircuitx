It contains a register file where each segment's data is stored. The module supports reading from and writing to the register file based on the operations signaled by the inputs. During a write operation, data from the 's_writedata' is stored at the location specified by 's_address'. For read operations, the data at the location specified by 's_address' is sent out through 's_readdata'. The module also manages reset functionality, where it initializes the register values depending on the 'DEFAULT_ACTIVE' parameter. The output to the 7-segment display ('SEG7') may be inverted based on the 'LOW_ACTIVE' parameter, which is useful for different types of 7-segment displays (common anode or common cathode). The module operates on the negative edge of the clock ('s_clk')."

It drives the timing of the module's operations, specifically triggering actions on the negative edge of the clock.\n- **s_address**: An address input that specifies which segment's data is to be accessed during read and write operations.\n- **s_read**: A control signal that, when high, enables the module to perform a read operation. The data at the address specified by 's_address' will be placed on the output 's_readdata'.\n- **s_writedata**: An 8-bit input data that is to be written into the register file at the location specified by 's_address' during a write operation.\n- **s_write**: A control signal that, when high, enables the module to write the data from 's_writedata' into the register file at the specified location.\n- **s_reset**: A reset signal that, when high, initializes the content of the register file according to the 'DEFAULT_ACTIVE' parameter setting.\n\nOutput ports: s_readdata, SEG7.\nExplanation:\n- **s_readdata**: This 8-bit output provides the data read from the register file at the location specified by 's_address' when a read operation is performed.\n- **SEG7**: This output sends the current state of all segments (for up to 8 seven-segment displays) to the physical display units.
