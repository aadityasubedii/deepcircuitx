    "spec": "Module name: I2C_Controller.\n\nModule specification: The I2C_Controller is a Verilog module designed to function as an I2C master controller, handling data transmission over an I2C bus. The module's primary role is to interface with slave devices on the bus through serial data (SDAT) and clock (SCLK) lines, coordinating the start condition, byte-level data sending, clock signal generation, and slave acknowledgements. It utilizes a state machine driven by `SD_COUNTER` to manage operations, which includes controlling clock transitions, sequencing data transmission, and handling acknowledgments. The module supports both write and read transactions indicated by the `W_R` signal and concludes transactions with an `END` signal. Key input ports include `CLOCK` (main timing signal), `I2C_DATA` (24-bit data for transmission), `GO` (starts the transmission process), `RESET` (resets the module), and `W_R` (determines whether the operation is read or write). Outputs include `I2C_SCLK`, `I2C_SDAT`, `END`, `ACK` (acknowledgment from the slave), `SD_COUNTER` (state counter output) and `SDO` (controls SDAT line state). Internal signals like `SDO`, `SCLK`, `END`, `SD` (stores the serial data), and `ACK1`, `ACK2`, `ACK3` (collect acknowledgment bits) are utilized to manage data flow and states. The code is divided into blocks handling asynchronous reset conditions, state progressions, and specific actions associated with each state step, such as loading data, managing clocks, and handling acknowledgments from slave devices. This structured approach ensures efficient I2C protocol management and robust data communication functionality in digital systems utilizing the I2C standard.",

It interfaces with devices using I2C protocol through controlling the serial data line (SDAT) and the serial clock line (SCLK). The controller handles start conditions, sending byte-level data, generating clock signals, and monitoring acknowledgments from the slave devices. It utilites a state machine approach (controlled by `SD_COUNTER`) to manage the I2C operations, which includes setting the clock, sending data bits, and managing the acknowledge phases. The module facilitates both write and read operations as indicated by the `W_R` signal. It also has an `END` signal to indicate the completion of a transaction and an `ACK` output to reflect the acknowledgment status from the slave. The interaction starts and progresses depending on the `GO` signal, and it can be manually reset using the `RESET` input."

It gets latched and then serially transmitted bit by bit.\n- GO: A control signal that, when high, enables the module to begin the I2C transmission process. If low, it resets the internal state counter (SD_COUNTER) to zero.\n- RESET: An active low signal that asynchronously resets the internal states and outputs of the module, putting it in a known state.\n- W_R: Write/Read control signal. Determines the operation mode of the I2C communication (either to write data to the slave or read data from the slave).\n\nOutput ports: I2C_SCLK, I2C_SDAT, END, ACK, SD_COUNTER, SDO.\nExplanation:\n- I2C_SCLK: The serial clock line for I2C communication. It is controlled by the internal logic to synchronize data transmission.\n- I2C_SDAT: The serial data line used in I2C for data transfer. It is bidirectional and its state can be either driven (low) or released (high impedance) based on the data bit being transmitted.\n- END: This signal indicates the completion of an I2C transmission cycle. It goes high once the cycle completes.\n- ACK: This signal reflects the acknowledgment status received from the slave device. It indicates if the transmitted byte was acknowledged by the slave.\n- SD_COUNTER: This 6-bit output gives the current state of the internal state machine managing the I2C operations, useful for debugging or controlling the sequence of operations.\n- SDO: This is the serial data output driving the SDAT line, representing the bit value to be transmitted during each cycle."

It holds the bit value that is to be transmitted onto the I2C data line. \n- SCLK: This is a register signal used to generate the I2C_SCLK output. It controls the I2C clock signal which is essential for the timing of data transmission.\n- END: A register signal that indicates the completion of an I2C operation. It is set to high when the transmission (either read or write) has been successfully completed.\n- SD: A 24-bit register that temporarily stores the data from the I2C_DATA input. It is used to hold the data that needs to be serially transmitted bit by bit onto the I2C bus.\n- SD_COUNTER: A 6-bit register used as a state counter in the finite state machine of the I2C Controller. It sequences through the steps of transmitting data and handles synchronization and control flow of the operation phases.\n- ACK1, ACK2, ACK3: These registers collect and store acknowledgment bits received during different phases of I2C data transmission.
