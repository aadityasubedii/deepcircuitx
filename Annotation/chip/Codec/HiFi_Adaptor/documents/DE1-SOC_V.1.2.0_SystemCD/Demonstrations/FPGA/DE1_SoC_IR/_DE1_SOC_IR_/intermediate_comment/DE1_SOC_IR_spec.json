    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SOC_IR. \nModule specification: The DE1_SOC_IR module is an integral part of managing various peripherals on a DE1 SoC board with a focus on infrared (IR) communication functionalities. It interfaces inputs such as clocks, ADC data, audio data, and VGA, HPS-related signals such as Ethernet, USB, UART, flash, and DRAM, as well as IR signals and user interfaces including switches and keys. The output roles include controlling audio data flows, ADCs, DRAM interface signals, VGA signals, and LED display. Key internal signals within this module include `reset_n`, serving as a deduced reset signal generally held high; `data_ready`, indicating the availability of new data from the IR receiver; `hex_data`, containing received IR data utilized for HEX display outputs; `test_data`, storing the data to be transmitted via IR; `data_send`, a control signal for initiating data transmission; and `tx_busy`, indicating the status of IR transmission busyness. These signals connect various sub-modules such as IR_RECEIVE for receiving IR data, SEG_HEX for decoding data to hexadecimal for displays, and IR_TRANSMITTER_Terasic for sending out IR signals. Each submodule is associated with specific functionality, tying together inputs, outputs, and internal logic to enable a comprehensive control system over infrared and other peripheral interactions facilitated by the FPGA.",

It acts as a reset control, but given its constant value, it appears to be an internal placeholder or unused in this particular configuration.\n- data_ready: This signal serves as an output flag from the IR_RECEIVE submodule indicating whether a new piece of data has been received and is ready for processing.\n- hex_data: A 32-bit wide signal derived from the IR_RECEIVE submodule that holds the data received from the IR receiver. This data is apparently encoded in some specific format, potentially HEX format, and used for display on the HEX outputs.\n- test_data: A 16-bit wide register is used internally to hold data for transmission via the IR transmitter. It is manipulated within an `always` block that detects the system clock and button inputs to increment the test data dynamically.\n- data_send: This control signal determines when data should be sent through the IR transmitter. It is managed within the `always` block tied to system events (e.g., button press and transmit status).\n- tx_busy: This signal receives its status from the IR_TRANSMITTER_Terasic submodule. It indicates whether the IR transmitter is currently busy and thus unable to send new data. This status is used to manage the flow of data within the module, preventing new data transmissions while the transmitter is active."

It acts as a reset control, but given its constant value, it appears to be an internal placeholder or unused in this particular configuration.\n- data_ready: This signal serves as an output flag from the IR_RECEIVE submodule indicating whether a new piece of data has been received and is ready for processing.\n- hex_data: A 32-bit wide signal derived from the IR_RECEIVE submodule that holds the data received from the IR receiver. This data is apparently encoded in some specific format, potentially HEX format, and used for display on the HEX outputs.\n- test_data: A 16-bit wide register is used internally to hold data for transmission via the IR transmitter. It is manipulated within an `always` block that detects the system clock and button inputs to increment the test data dynamically.\n- data_send: This control signal determines when data should be sent through the IR transmitter. It is managed within the `always` block tied to system events (e.g., button press and transmit status).\n- tx_busy: This signal receives its status from the IR_TRANSMITTER_Terasic submodule. It indicates whether the IR transmitter is currently busy and thus unable to send new data. This status is used to manage the flow of data within the module, preventing new data transmissions while the transmitter is active."

It interfaces inputs such as clocks, ADC data, audio data, and VGA, HPS-related signals such as Ethernet, USB, UART, flash, and DRAM, as well as IR signals and user interfaces including switches and keys. The output roles include controlling audio data flows, ADCs, DRAM interface signals, VGA signals, and LED display. Key internal signals within this module include `reset_n`, serving as a deduced reset signal generally held high; `data_ready`, indicating the availability of new data from the IR receiver; `hex_data`, containing received IR data utilized for HEX display outputs; `test_data`, storing the data to be transmitted via IR; `data_send`, a control signal for initiating data transmission; and `tx_busy`, indicating the status of IR transmission busyness. These signals connect various sub-modules such as IR_RECEIVE for receiving IR data, SEG_HEX for decoding data to hexadecimal for displays, and IR_TRANSMITTER_Terasic for sending out IR signals. Each submodule is associated with specific functionality, tying together inputs, outputs, and internal logic to enable a comprehensive control system over infrared and other peripheral interactions facilitated by the FPGA."
