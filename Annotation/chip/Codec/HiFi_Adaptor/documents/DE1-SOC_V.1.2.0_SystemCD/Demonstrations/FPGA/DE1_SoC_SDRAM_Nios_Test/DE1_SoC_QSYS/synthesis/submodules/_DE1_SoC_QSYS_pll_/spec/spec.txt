Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_pll is a Verilog module designed for clock management using an Altera PLL component. It inputs a reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset signal (`rst`). The `refclk` serves as the primary input for the PLL to generate other clocks, while `rst` is used to reset the PLL configuration. The module outputs two clocks (`outclk_0`, `outclk_1`) and a lock status (`locked`). `outclk_0` and `outclk_1` are the generated clocks with specified frequencies and phases, useful for various parts of a digital circuit that require specific timing. The `locked` output indicates whether the PLL is synchronized and stable. Internally, the module encapsulates the `altera_pll_i` instance, directly interfacing the input and output ports without additional internal signals. This instance handles all the phase-locked loop processes based on predefined parameters such as clock frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles, effectively making the module a wrapper that directly connects the physical pins with the logical entities of the PLL. The module's configuration reveals a meticulous setup for potentially multiple output clocks, although only two (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`) are utilized, each set to 143 MHz with specified phase shifts.
