    "spec": "Module name: vga_controller. \nModule specification: The 'vga_controller' module is designed for managing VGA signal timing and displaying image data by coordinating synchronization signals and data retrieval. It accepts an active-low reset input `iRST_n` and a VGA clock input `iVGA_CLK`. The module outputs two synchronization signals (`oHS` for horizontal synchronization, `oVS` for vertical synchronization) and a blanking signal `oBLANK_n` (active low) which indicates no data should be sent to the display. Color data outputs are managed through three 8-bit buses: `b_data`, `g_data`, and `r_data` for blue, green, and red components respectively. Internally, the module uses a register `ADDR` to hold the memory address of the pixel data, `bgr_data` to store the BGR color data, and `VGA_CLK_n`, a negated form of `iVGA_CLK`. Auxiliary wires like `index` and `bgr_data_raw` fetch and store raw image data. The `video_sync_generator` submodule manages the generation of the internal sync signals `cBLANK_n`, `cHS`, and `cVS`, which help in syncing and addressing calculations. Other internal operations include edge-triggered processes for updating address registers and output synchronizations based on clock and reset conditions, alongside data-fetching from memory mapped by addresses stored in `ADDR`. The module effectively mixes image data management with VGA signal requirements to facilitate proper image display timing and synchronization across VGA-compatible devices.",

It takes an input signal `iVGA_CLK` (VGA clock) and a reset signal `iRST_n` to drive the synchronization signals including horizontal sync (`oHS`), vertical sync (`oVS`), and the blanking signal (`oBLANK_n`). The module handles the addressing for image data stored in memory via the `ADDR` register, and retrieves and processes this data into RGB (red, green, blue) components (`r_data`, `g_data`, `b_data`).

It coordinates the timing for all operations within the module including synchronization signal generation and image data reading.\n\nOutput ports: `oBLANK_n`, `oHS`, `oVS`, `b_data`, `g_data`, `r_data`.  \nExplanation:  \n- `oBLANK_n`: This is the blanking signal output in active-low format, used in VGA to indicate the period during which the display is not being updated and no data should be sent to the display.   \n- `oHS`: This is the horizontal synchronization output, used to synchronize the pixels horizontally across the display.  \n- `oVS`: This is the vertical synchronization output, used to synchronize the lines vertically across the display.  \n- `b_data`: 8-bit output for blue color component. It supplies the blue component of the color for the pixel data being displayed.  \n- `g_data`: 8-bit output for green color component. It provides the green component of the color for the pixel data being displayed.  \n- `r_data`: 8-bit output for red color component.
