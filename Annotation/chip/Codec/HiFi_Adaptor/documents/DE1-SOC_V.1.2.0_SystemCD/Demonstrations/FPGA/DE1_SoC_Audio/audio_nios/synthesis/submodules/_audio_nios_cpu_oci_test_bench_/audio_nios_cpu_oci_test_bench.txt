Module-level comment: The `audio_nios_cpu_oci_test_bench` module serves primarily in a DSP/audio processing testbench, monitoring the end conditions of tests. It accepts four inputs: `dct_buffer` (30-bit data buffer), `dct_count` (4-bit index), `test_ending`, and `test_has_ended` (end condition flags). However, it lacks internal logic or output ports, suggesting its role as an intermediary or observer in a testing setup, possibly awaiting further implementation.
