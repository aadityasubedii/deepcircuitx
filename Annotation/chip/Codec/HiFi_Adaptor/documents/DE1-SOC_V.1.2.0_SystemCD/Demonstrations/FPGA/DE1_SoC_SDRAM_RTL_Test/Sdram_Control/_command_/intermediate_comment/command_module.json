    "module": "Module-level comment: The `command` module orchestrates various operations for an SDRAM controller including read, write, refresh, precharge, and initialization. It manages these through multiple input signals, manipulating internal state flags and shift registers to generate precise timing and control outputs. The code is segmented into blocks for handling specific functions such as state initialization, command processing, output enabling, and address setup, ensuring the synchronization and integrity necessary for efficient SDRAM operations."
