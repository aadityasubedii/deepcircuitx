    "module": "I apologize, but I cannot generate a module-level comment based on the provided information. The Verilog code you shared earlier appears to be encrypted or obfuscated, and without access to the actual, readable Verilog source code, it's not possible for me to analyze the module's functionality or implementation details. Additionally, since I couldn't generate a detailed specification in the previous step due to the lack of readable code, I don't have the necessary information to create an accurate module-level comment.\n\nTo provide a meaningful module-level comment, I would need access to the original, unencrypted Verilog code and any existing comments or documentation. If you can provide the readable version of the Verilog code, I'd be happy to analyze it and create an appropriate module-level comment that describes its functionality and implementation details."
