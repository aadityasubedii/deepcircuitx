Module name: pll_0002. Module specification: The 'pll_0002' module is designed to act as a configuration interface for an Altera-specific phase-locked loop (PLL) component, named `altera_pll`, primarily used for frequency synthesis. The module doubles the frequency of an incoming reference clock (`refclk`) from 50 MHz to produce a 100 MHz output clock (`outclk_0`). It accepts two input signals: `refclk`, which is a 50 MHz reference clock input, influencing the PLL's base frequency, and `rst`, a reset input that when asserted, reinitializes the PLL's internal state and may disrupt the output until the PLL relocks. The outputs comprise `outclk_0`, the main clock output at 100 MHz, and `locked`, a status signal that indicates whether the PLL has successfully achieved and maintained the desired frequency lock. Internally, the module lacks additional signals, utilizing only direct connections to the instantiated `altera_pll` block and leaving unconnected any optional output clocks and phase shift controls beyond those needed for `outclk_0`. This absence simplifies the module's internal structure, focusing operation on setting up and maintaining the specified clock outputs. The `altera_pll` instantiation within the module configures settings such as VCO multiplier, clock frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles for potential multiple outputs, although only one output clock is effectively used in this setup. This instantiation forms the primary functional block of the code, handling all critical frequency synthesis operations as defined by `altera_pll` configuration parameters.
