    "module": "Module-level comment: The RW_Test module simulates a memory read-write test using an FSM. It handles user inputs (iBUTTON), performs data manipulation, and sequences through states (c_state) to write, verify, and read data (writedata, readdata). Output flags indicate test status (pass, fail, complete). The FSM operations are synchronized by iCLK and initialized by iRST_n, with internal logic determining data values and flow control."
