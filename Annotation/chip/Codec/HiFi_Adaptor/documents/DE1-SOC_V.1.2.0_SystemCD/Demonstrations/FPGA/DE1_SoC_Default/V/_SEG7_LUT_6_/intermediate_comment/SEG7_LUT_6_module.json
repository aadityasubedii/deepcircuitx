    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'SEG7_LUT_6' module decodes a 24-bit input (`iDIG`) into six 7-bit segments (`oSEG0` to `oSEG5`) for seven-segment displays. It splits `iDIG` into six 4-bit segments, each decoded by an instance of `SEG7_LUT` (u0 to u5) directly mapped to corresponding display outputs, efficiently handling the hexadecimal to 7-segment conversion."
