    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_jtag_uart module simulates a JTAG UART interface for the DE1-SoC board, facilitating serial data communication via Avalon bus protocols. It handles read/write operations, FIFO buffer management, and interrupt signaling based on data availability and flow control conditions. Integrated sub-modules for FIFO handling and comprehensive signal control ensure efficient data flow and system synchronization, all clocked and reset-driven for robust operation."
