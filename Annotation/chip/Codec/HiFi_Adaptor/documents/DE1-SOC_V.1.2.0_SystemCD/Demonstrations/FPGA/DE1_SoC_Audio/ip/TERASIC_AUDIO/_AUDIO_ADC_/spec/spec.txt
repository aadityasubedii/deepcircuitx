Module name: AUDIO_ADC. Module specification: The AUDIO_ADC module is designed to interface with an audio Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) by converting serial audio data into a parallel format and storing it into a FIFO buffer. The module operates under input ports including the main system clock 'clk', an active high 'reset', a 'read' signal for FIFO data read operations, 'clear' for clearing FIFO contents, a bit clock 'bclk' for data synchronization, an audio data word select 'adclrc' to differentiate audio channels, and 'adcdat' for serial audio data input. Output ports consist of 'readdata' delivering data from the FIFO, 'empty' indicating FIFO status, and 'adcfifo_full' showing if the FIFO is full. Internal signals such as 'bit_index', 'valid_bit', 'reg_adc_left', 'reg_adc_serial_data', 'adcfifo_writedata', 'adcfifo_write', 'wait_one_clk', and 'is_left_ch' are utilised for processing data bits, managing FIFO operations, and tracking channel states. The module includes blocks responsible for data management with specific roles: resetting conditions, identifying channel changes, shifting data bits, managing FIFO writes, and interfacing with the 'audio_fifo' which handles data buffering and retrieval operations based on the FIFO principle.
