Module name: Sdram_Control_4Port. Module specification: The `Sdram_Control_4Port` module is designed to interface and manage operations with Synchronous Dynamic RAM (SDRAM) using four ports: two for writing (WR1, WR2) and two for reading (RD1, RD2). It handles read and write requests, and controls SDRAM operations such as refresh, precharge, and data transfer based on operations synchronized with an internally generated clock. The module receives input signals like `REF_CLK` (reference clock), `RESET_N` (active-low reset), data signals (`WR1_DATA`, `WR2_DATA`), control signals (`WR1`, `WR1_ADDR`, `WR1_MAX_ADDR`, etc.), and individual clocks for each port (`WR1_CLK`, `RD1_CLK`, etc.). Output signals include data outputs (`RD1_DATA`, `RD2_DATA`), FIFO status indicators like `WR1_FULL`, `RD2_EMPTY`, status of ongoing operations (`SA`, `BA`, `CS_N` control lines for SDRAM), and clocks (`SDR_CLK`, `CLK_18` generated by an internal PLL). Internally, the module employs a variety of signals like `mADDR` and `mLENGTH` for current command address and length, `WR_MASK` and `RD_MASK` to indicate which ports are active, and several others to manage state transitions and data handling (`ST`, `CMD`). The module consists of several key blocks: setup through an SDRAM specific PLL for clock generation (`sdram_pll1`), a control interface managing command setups and acknowledgments (`control1`), a command controller (`command1`) for issuing SDRAM commands based on system status, a data path managing the actual data transfer to and from SDRAM (`sdr_data_path`), and FIFO elements for each port to buffer write and read operations (`Sdram_WR_FIFO`, `Sdram_RD_FIFO`). This arrangement ensures efficient, flexible SDRAM management suitable for systems requiring high-throughput memory operations with multiple access points.
