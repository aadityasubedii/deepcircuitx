Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_onchip_memory2 serves as a memory block tailored for interfacing with the DE1-SoC development board, providing efficient read and write memory operations. Its primary functionality revolves around accessing on-chip memory using several I/O ports; `readdata` [31:0] outputs the data read from memory, while inputs include `address` [14:0], specifying the memory address; `byteenable` [3:0], for byte-level control during writes; `chipselect`, a control enabling memory operations; `clk`, the system clock; `clken`, the conditional clock enable signal; `reset`, an asynchronous reset; `reset_req`, a conditional reset request; `write`, determining if a write operation should occur; and `writedata` [31:0] for input data to be written. Internal signals like `clocken0`, a calculated clock enable dependent on `clken` and `reset_req`, and `wren` \u2014 enabled at the conjunction of `chipselect` and `write` \u2014 govern memory operation timings and write permissions respectively. The module incorporates `altsyncram`, an Altera (Intel) synchronous RAM block, wired to facilitate specific memory operations. Parameters like the initial memory contents from `DE1_SoC_QSYS_onchip_memory2.hex`, and various descriptors of the memory's behavior and structure (e.g., size, operational mode, and data path configurations) are defined to optimize memory utilization and interface with the rest of the system. This setup ensures that the module can efficiently manage read and write operations under various system conditions.",

When this signal is high, the memory operations (read/write) are permitted.\n- `clk`: The system clock input which synchronizes the operations in the module, specifically the memory read and write processes.\n- `clken`: Clock enable signal, which is used to control when the clock is active, effectively gating the clock to reduce power consumption or control timing.\n- `reset`: A signal to asynchronously reset the memory module to a known state.\n- `reset_req`: A reset request which is generally used for more controlled or conditional reset operations than the general `reset`.\n- `write`: A control signal that determines whether a write operation is performed. If high, data from `writedata` is written to the address specified by `address`.\n- `writedata` [31:0]: A 32-bit input data bus for writing data to the memory.
