Module name: TD_Detect. Module specification: The TD_Detect module is crafted to identify the type of video signal (either NTSC or PAL) based on the input vertical (iTD_VS) and horizontal synchronization (iTD_HS) signals from a video source. It operates with three inputs: iTD_VS and iTD_HS, which are the vertical and horizontal synchronization signals respectively, and iRST_N, a reset signal that when low, resets the moduleâ€™s internal states and counters. The outputs of the module include oTD_Stable, which indicates if a stable video signal has been detected, and oNTSC and oPAL, which specify whether the detected signal conforms to NTSC or PAL standards respectively. Internally, the module utilizes a set of registers (NTSC, PAL, Pre_VS) and a counter (Stable_Cont). The Pre_VS register is used to store the previous state of iTD_VS to detect rising edges, and the Stable_Cont counts the cycles between such edges. These internal signals help evaluate whether the incoming video conforms to NTSC or PAL standards by comparing the count of vertical synchronization pulses between horizontal synchronization pulses against predefined thresholds. The module primarily consists of an initialization block triggered on the negative edge of iRST_N, which resets all internal states, and a detection block which operates on the positive edge of iTD_HS. This detection block manages synchronization signal transitions, counters updates, and the setting of NTSC or PAL flags based on the counted cycles, ultimately determining the type and stability of the video signal.
