It manages the flow and buffering of data based on input and output readiness. The module can operate in two modes based on the PIPELINE_READY parameter: a registered and an unregistered mode. In registered mode, the module uses two levels of internal buffering (`data0` and `data1`) to control the data flow depending on the readiness of subsequent stages, ensuring steady data transmission even with variations in data production and consumption rates. In unregistered mode, there is a simplified handling of data flow which is less tolerant to variations in data rate but requires fewer resources."

It either receives data from `data0` or directly from `in_data` depending on the logic conditions, readiness of the output, and the module\u2019s mode of operation (determined by `PIPELINE_READY`).
