Module name: SEG7_LUT_6. Module specification: The SEG7_LUT_6 module is designed for converting 32-bit digital input values (iDIG) into segment signals suitable for driving up to six 7-segment display units. Each 7-segment unit displays a hexadecimal character or number based on a 4-bit segment of the input `iDIG`. The 32-bit input `iDIG` consists of multiple 4-bit groups, each of which is processed to drive the corresponding display. Specifically, the module includes one input port named `iDIG` which is 32-bits wide, representing the overall digital value to be displayed. It also has six output ports: `oSEG0`, `oSEG1`, `oSEG2`, `oSEG3`, `oSEG4`, and `oSEG5`, each 7-bits wide, which connect to individual 7-segment displays. There are no internal signals explicitly defined in the module as the input is directly connected to the outputs through instantiation of six `SEG7_LUT` submodules (`u0` through `u5`). Each submodule receives a specific 4-bit slice (segment) of `iDIG` â€” for instance, `u0` receives `iDIG[3:0]`, `u1` receives `iDIG[7:4]`, and so on up to `u5` which receives `iDIG[23:20]`. These submodules are responsible for converting the 4-bit binary segments into the 7-bit outputs needed to control the respective 7-segment displays, hence decoding and visualizing the input digital values as readable characters on the displays. The module is straightforward in its structure, focusing on functional decomposition where the complex task of driving multiple 7-segment displays is divided among simpler, reusable submodules.
