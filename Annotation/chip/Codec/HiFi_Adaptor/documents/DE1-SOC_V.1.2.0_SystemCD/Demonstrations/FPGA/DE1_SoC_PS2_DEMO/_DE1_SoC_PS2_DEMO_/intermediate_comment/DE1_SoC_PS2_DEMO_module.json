    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_PS2_DEMO module interfaces PS/2 devices and manages VGA outputs on a DE1-SoC board. It processes PS/2 input to influence VGA display and LED behaviors. Key input controls initiate PS2 interactions, VGA signals are constantly set high for display readiness, and conditions from the TV Decoder influence internal actions. The module encapsulates these functionalities within a clear structure, highlighting peripheral management and data handling in an FPGA environment."
