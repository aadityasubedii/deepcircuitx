    "block_comment": "This block of Verilog RTL code serves as a 2-stage pipeline. It operates synchronously on each positive edge of the clock or when the negative edge reset signal is active. On reset (when reset_n is 0), the data inputs to the first and second stages are cleared to 0. If reset is not active and the clock enable (clk_en) is true, data is moved to the next pipeline stage: data_in is passed to the first stage (d1_data_in), and what was in the first stage is passed to the second stage (d2_data_in). This is how data propagates through the pipeline stages."
