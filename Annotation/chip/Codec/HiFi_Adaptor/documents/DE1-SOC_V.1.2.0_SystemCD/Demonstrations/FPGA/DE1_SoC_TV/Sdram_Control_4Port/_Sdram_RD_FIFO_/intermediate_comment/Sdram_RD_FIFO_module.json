    "module": "Module-level comment: The Sdram_RD_FIFO is a dual-clock FIFO for SDRAM interfaces, handling separate clocks for read (rdclk) and write (wrclk) operations. It uses asynchronous clear (aclr), initiates data writes or reads on wrreq or rdreq signals, and outputs FIFO status via rdempty, wrfull, and word counts (rdusedw, wrusedw). Internally, it leverages a parameterized dcfifo block for buffer management, adhering to specific FPGA configurations for optimized performance."
