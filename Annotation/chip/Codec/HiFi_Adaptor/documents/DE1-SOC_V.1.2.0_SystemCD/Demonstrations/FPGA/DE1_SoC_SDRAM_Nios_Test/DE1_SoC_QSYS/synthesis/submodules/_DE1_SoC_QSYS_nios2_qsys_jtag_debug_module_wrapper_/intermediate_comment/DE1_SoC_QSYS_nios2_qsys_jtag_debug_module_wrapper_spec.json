    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_wrapper.\nModule specification: This module encompasses the functionality necessary for JTAG debugging within a NIOS II system implemented on a DE1-SoC FPGA. It handles data and control flows essential for sophisticated debugging operations. Input ports include MonDReg and break_readreg for handling monitoring and debug data; clk, a clock input; multiple dbrk_hit#_latch signals indicating breakpoint hits; debugack for acknowledging debug mode; multiple monitoring and reset signals (monitor_error, monitor_ready, reset_n, resetlatch); tracemem_on, tracemem_trcdata, and tracemem_tw for trace memory control. Outputs include jdo for JTAG Data Out, jrst_n for JTAG Reset, st_ready_test_idle signifying test or idle readiness, and a variety of take_action_# and take_no_action_# signals to control debug actions concerning breaks and memory operations. Internal signals, like jdo, sr, and various vji_# signals, manage JTAG states, data shifting, and instruction configurations. The module consists of two primary blocks: DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_tck, which manages JTAG clock, input/output data, and resetting operations; and DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_sysclk, focusing on functional actions triggered by external signals and internal state control. This structure supports direct integration into broader FPGA-based systems requiring robust debugging capabilities.",

It integrates sub-modules that likely process debug information and control signals related to JTAG operations, such as capturing data, breaking on trigger conditions, and interfacing with trace memories and other debugging hardware. Signals like `jdo` (probably JTAG Data Out), `jrst_n` (JTAG Reset) and others related to breakpoints and trace control suggest that this module facilitates communication and control flows associated with debugging a complex FPGA-based system."

It handles data and control flows essential for sophisticated debugging operations. Input ports include MonDReg and break_readreg for handling monitoring and debug data; clk, a clock input; multiple dbrk_hit#_latch signals indicating breakpoint hits; debugack for acknowledging debug mode; multiple monitoring and reset signals (monitor_error, monitor_ready, reset_n, resetlatch); tracemem_on, tracemem_trcdata, and tracemem_tw for trace memory control. Outputs include jdo for JTAG Data Out, jrst_n for JTAG Reset, st_ready_test_idle signifying test or idle readiness, and a variety of take_action_# and take_no_action_# signals to control debug actions concerning breaks and memory operations. Internal signals, like jdo, sr, and various vji_# signals, manage JTAG states, data shifting, and instruction configurations. The module consists of two primary blocks: DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_tck, which manages JTAG clock, input/output data, and resetting operations; and DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_sysclk, focusing on functional actions triggered by external signals and internal state control. This structure supports direct integration into broader FPGA-based systems requiring robust debugging capabilities."

It integrates sub-modules that likely process debug information and control signals related to JTAG operations, such as capturing data, breaking on trigger conditions, and interfacing with trace memories and other debugging hardware. Signals like `jdo` (probably JTAG Data Out), `jrst_n` (JTAG Reset) and others related to breakpoints and trace control suggest that this module facilitates communication and control flows associated with debugging a complex FPGA-based system."

It handles data and control flows essential for sophisticated debugging operations. Input ports include MonDReg and break_readreg for handling monitoring and debug data; clk, a clock input; multiple dbrk_hit#_latch signals indicating breakpoint hits; debugack for acknowledging debug mode; multiple monitoring and reset signals (monitor_error, monitor_ready, reset_n, resetlatch); tracemem_on, tracemem_trcdata, and tracemem_tw for trace memory control. Outputs include jdo for JTAG Data Out, jrst_n for JTAG Reset, st_ready_test_idle signifying test or idle readiness, and a variety of take_action_# and take_no_action_# signals to control debug actions concerning breaks and memory operations. Internal signals, like jdo, sr, and various vji_# signals, manage JTAG states, data shifting, and instruction configurations. The module consists of two primary blocks: DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_tck, which manages JTAG clock, input/output data, and resetting operations; and DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_sysclk, focusing on functional actions triggered by external signals and internal state control. This structure supports direct integration into broader FPGA-based systems requiring robust debugging capabilities."
