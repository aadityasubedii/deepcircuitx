    "module": "Module-level comment: The AUDIO_DAC module serves as a digital-to-analog converter for audio data, interfacing with a FIFO buffer to serialize digital audio into an analog bit stream synchronized with audio clocks (`bclk` and `daclrc`). It manages data flow using internal states and signals to control FIFO operations, track audio channels, and serialize data bit-by-bit. Equipped with conditions for reset, clear, and FIFO status, the module ensures accurate DAC operations tailored to channel-specific audio output."
