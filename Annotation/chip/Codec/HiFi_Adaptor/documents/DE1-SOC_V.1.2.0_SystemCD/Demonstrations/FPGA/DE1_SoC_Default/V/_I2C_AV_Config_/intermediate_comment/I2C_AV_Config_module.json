    "module": "Module-level comment: The I2C_AV_Config module configures audio and video settings via I2C, using a lookup table for data and an FSM for managing I2C interactions. It includes clock division for I2C timing, data transmission control via internal registers, and feedback handling through acknowledgment monitoring. This implementation ensures reliable setup of external device settings."
