Module name: altera_avalon_sc_fifo. Module specification: This module implements a parameterized, synthesizable FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer for FPGA designs. It manages data transfer and storage with various options including packet handling, error detection, and interface control features. The FIFO supports multiple data widths and depths, optional packet-based operations, and provides interfaces for reading from and writing to control registers. Input ports include clk, reset, in_data, in_valid, in_startofpacket, in_endofpacket, in_empty, in_error, in_channel, csr_address, csr_write, csr_read, csr_writedata, and out_ready, which allow for data input, control, and configuration. Output ports include in_ready, out_data, out_valid, out_startofpacket, out_
