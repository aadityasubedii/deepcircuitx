This block manages the detection and capture of edge-triggered events for a specific signal line. On a positive clock edge or negative reset, the block checks if the system is being reset and zeroes the edge capture register for line 2 if true. If not resetting, and clock enable is high, it then checks if a write strobe for edge capture is active to clear the register, or if an edge is detected on line 2, it sets the register to -1 to indicate an event capture.
