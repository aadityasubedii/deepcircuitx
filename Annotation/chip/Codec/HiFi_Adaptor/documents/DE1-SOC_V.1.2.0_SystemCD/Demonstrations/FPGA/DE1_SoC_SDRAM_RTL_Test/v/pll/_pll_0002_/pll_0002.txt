Module-level comment: The 'pll_0002' module serves as a configuration layer for an Altera-specific PLL component, effectively doubling an input 50 MHz reference clock (`refclk`) to generate a 100 MHz output (`outclk_0`). It includes a reset input (`rst`) for PLL reinitialization and provides a lock indicator (`locked`). The module employs an `altera_pll` instantiation with predefined parameters for managing VCO multiplier, frequency outputs, and dutycycles, focusing only on the essential functionality without internal signal processing.
