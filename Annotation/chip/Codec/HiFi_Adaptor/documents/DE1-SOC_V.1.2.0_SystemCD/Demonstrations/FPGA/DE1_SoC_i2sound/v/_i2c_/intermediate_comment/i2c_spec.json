    "spec": "Module name: i2c.\nModule specification: The i2c module simulates an I2C controller for facilitating communication between devices over an I2C bus, primarily for inter-device data transfers with a focus on managing serial data and clock, acknowledging signals, and controlling the entire data transaction flow. The input ports include CLOCK (main clock signal for synchronization), I2C_DATA (24-bit data for transmission), GO (initiates communication), RESET (resets internal states), and W_R (determines operation mode: read or write). The output ports are I2C_SCLK (serial clock line), I2C_SDAT (bidirectional serial data line), END (signals transaction completion), ACK (acknowledgment signal), SD_COUNTER (state counter), and SDO (serial data output). Internally, this module uses registers like SDO (holds bits being driven onto I2C_SDAT), SCLK (manages clock signal on the I2C bus), SD (holds entire transaction data), and flags ACK1, ACK2, ACK3 (for acknowledgments in transaction phases). The code has various blocks including initialization on reset, state management during the transaction through an always block keyed to CLOCK and RESET, data transfer logic divided into phases handled by conditional cases within these always blocks, and feedback through ACK1, ACK2, ACK3 combined into an output ACK signal. The states of the transaction are tracked by incrementing SD_COUNTER, and transitions between phases, based on counter values, control data sampling, data output staging, and transition to idle state post-transaction completion.",

It handles setting up the I2C data line (SDAT) and clock (SCLK), managing write and read operations determined by the W_R signal, and generating an acknowledgement (ACK) signal based on the data received. The module facilitates data transfer through these operations, progresses through various states using a state counter (SD_COUNTER), and manipulates the data and control lines accordingly throughout the transaction process. The process includes managing the start and stop conditions, transmitting data, and handling acknowledgments after data bytes are sent to the slave device. The GO signal triggers the operation, and the module also has a reset condition to reset the states."

It represents the current bit being sent out to the I2C bus during data transmission.\n  \n- SCLK (Serial Clock): It's a register used to manage the clock signal (I2C_SCLK) for synchronization of data transmission over the I2C bus. It is specifically used to toggle the clock signal during data transmission phases.\n\n- SD (Serial Data): This register temporarily holds the entire data (24-bit) from I2C_DATA input before and during the transmission process. Each bit of this data is sequentially moved to SDO for transmission via the SDAT line.\n\n- ACK1, ACK2, ACK3: These are acknowledgement flags corresponding to different phases of the data transmission. They capture the acknowledgement status read from the I2C_SDAT line after sending each significant part of the data (divided into three blocks). The overall acknowledgement ACK to the master device is the OR combination of these three flags, indicating successful receipt of each block by the slave device."

                    "text": "Module name: i2c.\nModule specification: The i2c module simulates an I2C controller for facilitating communication between devices over an I2C bus, primarily for inter-device data transfers with a focus on managing serial data and clock, acknowledging signals, and controlling the entire data transaction flow. The input ports include CLOCK (main clock signal for synchronization), I2C_DATA (24-bit data for transmission), GO (initiates communication), RESET (resets internal states), and W_R (determines operation mode: read or write). The output ports are I2C_SCLK (serial clock line), I2C_SDAT (bidirectional serial data line), END (signals transaction completion), ACK (acknowledgment signal), SD_COUNTER (state counter), and SDO (serial data output). Internally, this module uses registers like SDO (holds bits being driven onto I2C_SDAT), SCLK (manages clock signal on the I2C bus), SD (holds entire transaction data), and flags ACK1, ACK2, ACK3 (for acknowledgments in transaction phases). The code has various blocks including initialization on reset, state management during the transaction through an always block keyed to CLOCK and RESET, data transfer logic divided into phases handled by conditional cases within these always blocks, and feedback through ACK1, ACK2, ACK3 combined into an output ACK signal. The states of the transaction are tracked by incrementing SD_COUNTER, and transitions between phases, based on counter values, control data sampling, data output staging, and transition to idle state post-transaction completion."
