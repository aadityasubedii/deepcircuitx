    "spec": "Module name: pll. Module specification: The 'pll' module in Verilog serves as a phase-locked loop (PLL) configuration entity, primarily used for frequency synthesis or clock domain adjustments. It includes two input ports: 'refclk' and 'rst'. 'refclk' is the reference clock input providing the basic timing reference, and 'rst' is the reset input utilized to initialize or reset the internal state of the PLL. The output ports of this module are 'outclk_0' and 'locked'. 'outclk_0' outputs the frequency-adjusted version of the reference clock, while 'locked' indicates whether the PLL has successfully synchronized its output clock to the reference clock, ensuring stable operation. Internally, the module features no explicitly defined signals; instead, it directly maps its top module's ports to an instantiated submodule 'pll_0002', which handles all internal signal processing or generation. The module is structured simply with an instantiation block `pll_0002 pll_inst`, which connects input and output ports to those of the instantiated submodule, encapsulating the primary functionality of the PLL within this submodule.\n",
