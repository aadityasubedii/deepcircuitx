    "module": "Module-level comment: The MAC_3 module performs Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations optimized for Altera Cyclone V FPGAs. It processes three 8-bit and 17-bit input pairs to multiply and accumulate them, outputting a 27-bit result synchronized to a clock signal with an asynchronous reset. Internal implementation uses the `altera_mult_add` block configured for multistage calculations and pipelined operations, ensuring efficient DSP processing within FPGA constraints."
