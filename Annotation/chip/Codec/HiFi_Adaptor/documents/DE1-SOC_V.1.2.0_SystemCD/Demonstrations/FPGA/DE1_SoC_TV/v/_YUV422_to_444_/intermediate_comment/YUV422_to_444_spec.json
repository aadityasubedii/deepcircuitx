    "spec": "Module name: YUV422_to_444. \nModule specification: The YUV422_to_444 Verilog module is designed to convert YUV 422 formatted input into a YUV 444 format, enriching the chrominance detail. It takes a combined 16-bit input `iYCbCr`, which contains Y, Cb, and Cr components. The module outputs these components as separate 8-bit values (`oY`, `oCb`, `oCr`) based on the value of a 10-bit input `iX`. The least significant bit of `iX` indicates whether Y and Cr or Y and Cb are updated in the current cycle (`iX[0]` high for Y and Cr, low for Y and Cb). The timing for processing is controlled by a clock signal `iCLK`, and an asynchronous reset `iRST_N` initializes the outputs to zero if active. The module utilizes internal 8-bit registers (`mY`, `mCb`, `mCr`) to temporarily store the Y, Cb, and Cr components respectively. The main operational blocks include the usage of combinatorial logic for assigning output ports from internal registers, and a sequential logic block defined in an `always` construct, which handles data latching on the clock's rising edge or resetting the outputs based on the reset signal. This structure provides stability and synchronization necessary for accurate color channel separation and output.",

Explanation: \n- iYCbCr: This is a 16-bit input port that carries combined Y, Cb, and Cr data, where depending on the value of iX, specific color components will be extracted and assigned.\n- iX: This is a 10-bit input used to determine how `iYCbCr` data will be split into individual color channels. Specifically, the least significant bit (iX[0]) decides which chrominance data (Cb or Cr) is updated along with the luminance (Y) data each clock cycle.\n- iCLK: Clock input. It dictates the timing of the data processing; data is latched and the module's internal registers are updated on the rising edge of this clock.\n- iRST_N: Asynchronous active low reset input. It resets the internal registers (mY, mCb, mCr) to zero when activated (low).\n\nOutput ports: [oY, oCb, oCr]. Explanation:\n- oY: 8-bit output port for the Y (luminance) component of the YUV color model. Updated from internal register `mY`.\n- oCb: 8-bit output port for the Cb (blue-difference chrominance) component. Updated from internal register `mCb`.\n- oCr: 8-bit output port for the Cr (red-difference chrominance) component. Updated from internal register `mCr`. \n\nThese outputs allow the module to output YUV 444 format data, which is useful for various video and image processing applications that require separate color channels with higher chrominance resolution compared to YUV 422."
