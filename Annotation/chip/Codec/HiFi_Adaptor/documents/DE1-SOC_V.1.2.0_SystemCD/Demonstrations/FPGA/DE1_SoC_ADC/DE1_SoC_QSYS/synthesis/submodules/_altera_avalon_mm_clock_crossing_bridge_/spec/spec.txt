Module name: altera_avalon_mm_clock_crossing_bridge. Module specification: The altera_avalon_mm_clock_crossing_bridge is a Verilog module designed to manage data communication across different clock domains in Avalon memory-mapped (MM) interfaces utilizing FIFO buffers. Input ports include clocks (`s0_clk`, `m0_clk`), resets (`s0_reset`, `m0_reset`), communication control signals such as `s0_burstcount`, `s0_writedata`, `s0_address`, command initiation signals (`s0_write`, `s0_read`), and data control signals (`s0_byteenable`, `s0_debugaccess`). Outputs include wait requests (`s0_waitrequest`), read data (`s0_readdata`), read validation (`s0_readdatavalid`), and appropriate command signals for the m0 domain (`m0_burstcount`, `m0_writedata`, `m0_address`, `m0_write`, `m0_read`, `m0_byteenable`, `m0_debugaccess`). Internally, significant signals include `s0_cmd_payload` and `m0_cmd_payload` which carry command packets, `s0_cmd_valid`, `m0_cmd_valid` indicating command validity, and `m0_internal_write`, `m0_internal_read` directing operations. The module maintains synchronization and control through `s0_cmd_ready`, `m0_cmd_ready`, and manages read and write operations across clock domains by implementing FIFOs -- `cmd_fifo` for commands and `rsp_fifo` for responses. Each FIFO is set up with depth parameters (`COMMAND_FIFO_DEPTH` and `RESPONSE_FIFO_DEPTH`) and synchronization settings (`MASTER_SYNC_DEPTH`, `SLAVE_SYNC_DEPTH`), and includes comprehensive logic for tracking command status and managing internal states like `pending_read_count` and `space_avail`. This Verilog design ensures integrity and synchronization of data transmitted across different clock domain interfaces in hardware systems that handle complex memory-mapped operations.
