Module name: DE1_SoC_SDRAM_RTL_Test. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_SDRAM_RTL_Test module is designed for interfacing with and testing SDRAM on a DE1-SoC board, encompassing various functionalities including clock management and interfacing with peripherals like ADC, audio, GPIO, and a VGA display. Input ports include multiple clock inputs such as CLOCK_50, and CLOCK2_50 through CLOCK4_50, data inputs from devices like ADCs (ADC_DOUT) and PS2 devices (PS2_CLK, PS2_DAT), and control inputs from a KEY and SW switches. Output ports cover a wide range from ADC control signals (ADC_CS_N, ADC_DIN, ADC_SCLK), audio output (AUD_DACDAT, AUD_XCK), SDRAM control (DRAM_ADDR, DRAM_BA, DRAM_CAS_N, etc.), to visual output management for HEX displays (HEX0 to HEX5) and a VGA interface (VGA_B, VGA_G, VGA_R, etc.). Internal signals are used for managing SDRAM read and write operations (writedata, readdata, write, read), test control (test_software_reset_n, test_global_reset_n, test_start_n), and test status (sdram_test_pass, sdram_test_fail, sdram_test_complete). The code integrates a PLL block for clock generation (clk_test), an SDRAM controller (Sdram_Control), and a testing module (RW_Test). The SDRAM controller manages the read and write operations to the SDRAM using input clock and data signals. The testing module initiates and controls the read/write tests on the SDRAM, providing status output that is used for real-time feedback on the LEDs, indicating test status or errors. Additional functionality is provided for debouncing KEY inputs and generating periodic signals (heart_beat) to monitor activity or functionalities. This module is critical for testing and verifying the correct operation of SDRAM in a hardware environment like the DE1-SoC board.
