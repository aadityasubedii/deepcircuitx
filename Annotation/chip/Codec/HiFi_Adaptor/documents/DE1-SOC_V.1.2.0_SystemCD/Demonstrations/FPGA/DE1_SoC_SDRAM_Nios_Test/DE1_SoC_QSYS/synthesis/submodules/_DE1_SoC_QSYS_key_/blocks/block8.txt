Comment: 
The block of code generates an interrupt request (irq) when an edge is captured and is allowed by the irq_mask. The generation of the irq is handled through a bitwise OR operation of the 'edge_capture' and 'irq_mask' signals. If there's an active edge capture and it matches with the irq_mask, an irq would be triggered.
