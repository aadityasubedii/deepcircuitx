    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'vga_controller' module orchestrates VGA image display by managing sync signals and pixel data retrieval. Inputs include the VGA clock and active-low reset. Outputs are sync signals (`oHS`, `oVS`) and a blanking signal (`oBLANK_n`), along with RGB data. Internally, it utilizes address registers and timing controls from the `video_sync_generator` to fetch and update image data in sync with VGA timing requirements, ensuring accurate content display."
