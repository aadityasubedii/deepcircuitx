Module-level comment: 
/*
This module manages SDRAM interfacing with dual read/write channels. It handles command sequencing, 
address management, and data buffering using FIFOs. The module employs a state machine to control 
SDRAM operations, including read, write, refresh, and precharge. It generates necessary timing 
signals, manages data paths, and ensures proper synchronization between the system and SDRAM clocks.
