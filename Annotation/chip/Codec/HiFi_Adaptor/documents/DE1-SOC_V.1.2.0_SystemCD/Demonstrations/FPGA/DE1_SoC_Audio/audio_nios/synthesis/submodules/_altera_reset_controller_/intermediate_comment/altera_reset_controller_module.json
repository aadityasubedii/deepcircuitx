    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_reset_controller` synchronizes multiple input reset signals with a clock to ensure stable reset behavior. It merges 16 reset inputs, processes through configurable sync logic, and outputs a synchronized reset and an optional reset request. Internal register chains handle timing and output determination, managing metastability and alignment with clock edges effectively."
