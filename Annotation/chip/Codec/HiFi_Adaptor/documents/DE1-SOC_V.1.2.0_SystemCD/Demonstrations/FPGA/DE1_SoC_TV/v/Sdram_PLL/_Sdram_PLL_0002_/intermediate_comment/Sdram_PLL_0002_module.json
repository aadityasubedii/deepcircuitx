    "module": "Module-level comment: The Sdram_PLL_0002 module utilizes an Altera PLL to generate three distinct clock outputs (outclk_0, outclk_1, outclk_2) from a single reference clock (refclk) for SDRAM operations. The module is configured with specific frequency and phase shift parameters in the `altera_pll` block, offering a `locked` output for indicating PLL's lock status. Key controls include a reset input (rst) for initializing the PLL."
