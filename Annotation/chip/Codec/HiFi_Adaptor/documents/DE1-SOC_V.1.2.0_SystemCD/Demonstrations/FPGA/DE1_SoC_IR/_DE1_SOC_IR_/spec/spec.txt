Module name: DE1_SOC_IR. 
Module specification: The DE1_SOC_IR module is an integral part of managing various peripherals on a DE1 SoC board with a focus on infrared (IR) communication functionalities. It interfaces inputs such as clocks, ADC data, audio data, and VGA, HPS-related signals such as Ethernet, USB, UART, flash, and DRAM, as well as IR signals and user interfaces including switches and keys. The output roles include controlling audio data flows, ADCs, DRAM interface signals, VGA signals, and LED display. Key internal signals within this module include `reset_n`, serving as a deduced reset signal generally held high; `data_ready`, indicating the availability of new data from the IR receiver; `hex_data`, containing received IR data utilized for HEX display outputs; `test_data`, storing the data to be transmitted via IR; `data_send`, a control signal for initiating data transmission; and `tx_busy`, indicating the status of IR transmission busyness. These signals connect various sub-modules such as IR_RECEIVE for receiving IR data, SEG_HEX for decoding data to hexadecimal for displays, and IR_TRANSMITTER_Terasic for sending out IR signals. Each submodule is associated with specific functionality, tying together inputs, outputs, and internal logic to enable a comprehensive control system over infrared and other peripheral interactions facilitated by the FPGA.
