    "spec": "Module name: img_index. Module specification: The \"img_index\" module functions as a Read-Only Memory (ROM) utilizing a synchronous RAM component termed as altsyncram to retrieve and output image data based on input addresses. This module operates with two primary input ports: an 8-bit 'address' input that specifies the ROM location from which data needs to be fetched (ranging from 0 to 255), and a 'clock' input used to synchronize the data retrieval with the system's clock, changing the output on every rising edge of the clock. The sole output port, 'q', is a 24-bit wide bus that presents the pixel data corresponding to the input address. Internally, a wire variable 'sub_wire0' functions as a temporary holder for the 24-bit data retrieved by the altsyncram from the specified address before it is passed to the output port. This Verilog design is structured into major blocks: the input and output port declarations, internal wire declarations, the instantiating of the altsyncram component with pertinent parameters defined such as mode of operation (ROM), device specific features, and initialization from a memory initialization file 'index_logo.mif'. This structural organization ensures clarity in data handling, specifying component behavior and interfacing with a defined memory structure for image data retrieval.",

The input address, ranging from 0 to 255, is provided through an 8-bit input. The module outputs a 24-bit data corresponding to the address on every rising edge of the clock. The output data represents pixel data, presumably for an image or display, loaded from an initialization file (`index_logo.mif`).

When a particular address is supplied, it fetches the corresponding 24-bit pixel data.\n- clock: This is a clock input used to synchronize the reading of data from the memory.
