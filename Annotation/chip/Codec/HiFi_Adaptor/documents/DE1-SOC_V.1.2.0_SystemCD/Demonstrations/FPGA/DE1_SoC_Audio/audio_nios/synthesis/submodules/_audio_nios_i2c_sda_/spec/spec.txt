Module name: audio_nios_i2c_sda.

Module specification: The `audio_nios_i2c_sda` module manages I²C communication specifically for audio control on a Nios platform within a system-on-chip (SoC) architecture. It utilizes a bidirectional Serial Data Line (SDA) for reading and writing operations. Input ports include a 2-bit `address` to select the operational function, `chipselect` to enable the module, a system `clk` (clock), an active-low `reset_n`, an active-low `write_n` for defining read or write mode, and a 32-bit `writedata` for data to be written to the I²C bus. The output ports are `bidir_port` which acts as the bidirectional I²C SDA and a 32-bit `readdata` that holds the data read from the I²C bus. Internal signals include `clk_en` that is always enabled, `data_dir` for controlling the direction of the `bidir_port`, `data_in` for capturing incoming data from `bidir_port`, `data_out` for data to be sent via `bidir_port`, and `read_mux_out` which determines the source of data directed to `readdata`. The code has three main always blocks: the first handles the reset condition and the data flow to `readdata`, the second defines conditions to write data on the I²C bus, and the third controls the data direction (`data_dir`). All operations are synced with the system clock, and the module responds to reset conditions promptly to ensure stable operation.
