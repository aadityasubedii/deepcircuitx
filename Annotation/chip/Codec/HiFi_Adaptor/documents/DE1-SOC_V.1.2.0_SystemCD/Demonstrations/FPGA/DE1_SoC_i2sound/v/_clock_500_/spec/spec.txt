Module name: CLOCK_500. 
Module specification: The CLOCK_500 module is designed for clock division, data management, and memory manipulation in embedded systems. It takes three input ports: CLOCK, a primary clock signal that drives the counting operation within the module; END, which is used to signify the end of an operation and triggers memory and address updating; and RESET, which resets address and counter registers. The module outputs four signals: CLOCK_500, a slower clock derived from the 9th bit of a counter for various timed operations; CLOCK_2, another divided clock sourced from the counter’s 1st bit; DATA, a 24-bit output combining a constant with data from ROM meant for interfacing with external systems; and GO, a signal indicating certain operational statuses based on ROM address and END signal. Internally, the module utilizes a counter (COUNTER_500) for generating the output clocks and determining logic conditions, a ROM array storing configurations, a data register (DATA_A) fetching content from ROM, an address register managing ROM access, and a volume register (vol) along with its associated wire (volume) for audio or signal levels which are used to update ROM values dynamically. The key code blocks include clock signal generation through counter incrementation, an address and volume control mechanism responsive to END and RESET signals, and predefined ROM data setting triggered by the END signal, enhancing the module’s functionality in scenarios requiring precise timing and ROM data manipulation.
