It allows for setting a timer with distinct high and low period registers, can be controlled through start and stop commands, and can be configured to operate continuously. The timer generates an interrupt signal when a timeout event occurs (counter reaches zero). The module also provides features to read and write data synchronized with the clock signal; these operations are further facilitated by the designated addressable registers."
