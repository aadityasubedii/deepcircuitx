Module name: sdr_data_path. Module specification: The 'sdr_data_path' module is designed for handling data channels in SDRAM applications, specifically managing data input and the associated data masking. This module takes serial data input (DATAIN) along with a data mask input (DM). It outputs the data directly to the output port (DQOUT) and controls the data output mask (DQM) based on the module's state. Input ports include CLK (clock signal for synchronization), RESET_N (active-low reset signal for initializing outputs or internal state), DATAIN (serial data for direct output), and DM (specifies data masking). Output ports are DQOUT (mirrors DATAIN) and DQM (masks data based on the reset state and DM). Internally, DQM is a registered signal determined by the reset state: all bits are masked when RESET_N is low, and it mimics DM when RESET_N is high. The code includes an always block triggered by the positive edge of CLK or the negative edge of RESET_N, responsible for setting the state of DQM, and a direct assignment for DQOUT from DATAIN. This setup ensures efficient data and mask handling for SDRAM interfacing.
