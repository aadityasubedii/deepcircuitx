It utilizes an instance of another module, presumably a PLL or clock generator, named VGA_Audio_0002. This instance takes a reference clock (refclk) and a reset signal (rst) as inputs and provides three different output clocks (outclk_0, outclk_1, and outclk_2) along with a lock indicator (locked). The lock indicator typically signifies that the output clocks are stable and the module is functioning as expected."
