Module name: audio_nios_key. 

Module specification: The `audio_nios_key` module acts as an interface for processing key inputs in a digital audio system coupled with an Altera NIOS II processor. It addresses detecting and managing key presses and releases, generating interrupts for the processor based on configured edge detection settings. The input ports include `address` (selects between various register access within the module), `chipselect` (enables the device on the bus), `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `in_port` (current state of key inputs), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `write_n` (selects between read and write operations), and `writedata` (data to be written into registers). Output ports are `irq` (interrupt request signal) and `readdata` (data output from the module based on address selected). Internal signals such as `clk_en` always enable certain operations, `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in` (hold delayed states of input), `data_in` reflects current key inputs, `edge_capture` records detected edges, and `irq_mask` stores interrupt mask settings. The module is structured into blocks handling read and write operations, resetting conditions, edge detection logic, and generation of output signals based on internal states and input configurations. Each section ensures the module effectively captures, manages, and communicates key press states and edges to the system.
