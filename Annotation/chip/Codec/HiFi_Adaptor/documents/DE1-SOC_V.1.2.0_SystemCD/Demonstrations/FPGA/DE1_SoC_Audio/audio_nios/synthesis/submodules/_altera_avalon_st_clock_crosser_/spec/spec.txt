Module name: `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser`.

Module specification: The `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser` module is designed for data transfer across different clock domains, specifically in FPGA implementations, ensuring stable and reliable communication by managing clock domain crossing complexities. The module employs synchronization techniques and buffering to safely handle data between an input clock domain (`in_clk`) and an output clock domain (`out_clk`). Input ports include `in_clk` (input domain clock), `in_reset` (asynchronous reset for input domain), `in_valid` (indicates if input data is valid), `in_data` (the actual input data), `out_clk` (output domain clock), `out_reset` (asynchronous reset for output domain), and `out_ready`(indicates readiness to accept data in the output domain). Output ports are `in_ready` (indicates readiness to receive new input data), `out_valid` (shows if output data is valid), and `out_data` (outputted data after successful domain crossing). Internal signals like `in_data_buffer`, `out_data_buffer`, `in_data_toggle`, `out_data_toggle`, and synchronization flags (`in_data_toggle_returned`, `out_data_toggle_flopped`) facilitate the correct staging and transfer of data. The module includes synchronizers for stabilization between domains and an optional output pipelining stage (`USE_OUTPUT_PIPELINE` parameter) to enhance throughput and interface compatibility with downstream elements. The Verilog code efficiently organizes the flow through initialization, data buffering, synchronization, and conditional output pipelining, demonstrating a robust design suitable for high-performance digital systems that involve multiple clock domains.
