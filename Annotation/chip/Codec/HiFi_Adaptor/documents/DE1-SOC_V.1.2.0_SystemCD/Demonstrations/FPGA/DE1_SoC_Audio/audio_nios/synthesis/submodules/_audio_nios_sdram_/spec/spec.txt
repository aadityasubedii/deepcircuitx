Module name: `audio_nios_sdram`.
Module specification: The `audio_nios_sdram` module is designed to interface with an SDRAM specifically for audio processing applications. It integrates a range of functionalities including memory management and interfacing with an SDRAM via input and output commands governed by internal state machines. The input ports include `az_addr`, `az_be_n`, `az_cs`, `az_data`, `az_rd_n`, `az_wr_n`, `clk`, and `reset_n`, which facilitate the addressing, control, data input, and synchronization necessary for reading from and writing to the SDRAM. Output ports like `za_data`, `za_valid`, and `za_waitrequest` provide data read from SDRAM and status signals, while `zs_*` ports directly interface with the SDRAM's pins. Internally, the module utilizes numerous signals, such as `refresh_counter` and `init_done`, to manage refresh cycles and initialization processes, while data flow is controlled using FIFOs, where signals like `f_pop` and `f_empty` manage FIFO state. The code can be conceptually divided into initialization, main operation, and refresh handling blocks. Initialization block prepares the SDRAM for operation. The main operation block actively handles read or write commands based on the system's state, which could include waiting for availability signaled by the FIFO component. The refresh handling block ensures the SDRAM's refresh commands are issued at appropriate intervals to maintain data integrity. This comprehensive structure allows for efficient data management and command processing, tailored for audio applications utilizing SDRAM.
