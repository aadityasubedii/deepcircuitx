Module name: DE1_SoC_Audio. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_Audio module serves as a comprehensive interface for audio and peripheral functionalities on the DE1-SoC board. It enables ADC for audio input and DAC for audio output, controls SDRAM, drives HEX displays, manages LEDs, and configures a NIOS II processor for handling audio and other I/O operations. The module includes a variety of input ports like ADC_DOUT and AUD_ADCDAT for receiving audio and digital data, and CLOCK_50 for clock input. Output ports include ADC_DIN and AUD_DACDAT for sending data to DAC and ADC, and HEX0 to HEX5 for HEX display outputs. Internal signals like HEX0P to HEX5P are intermediate values presumably for processing display outputs, and reset_n is an active-low reset signal set to a constant high to prevent hardware reset. The module encompasses several functional blocks such as audio_nios, which handles the core audio processing and I/O management in conjunction with connected devices through predefined interfaces for clocks, resets, SDRAM, and frontend I/O like LEDs and switches. This structured integration facilitates efficient data handling and peripheral control optimized for audio processing tasks on the DE1-SoC hardware platform.
