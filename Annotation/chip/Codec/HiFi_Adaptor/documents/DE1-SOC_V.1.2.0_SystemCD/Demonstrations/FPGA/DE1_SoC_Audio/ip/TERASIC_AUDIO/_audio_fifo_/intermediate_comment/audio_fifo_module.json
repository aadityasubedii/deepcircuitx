    "module": "Module-level comment: The `audio_fifo` module serves as a dual-clock FIFO buffer for audio data, interfacing across different clock domains using a `dcfifo` tailored for the Cyclone IV E family. It handles audio data flow via signals for asynchronous clearing (`aclr`), data reading (`rdreq`, `rdclk`), and writing (`wrreq`, `wrclk`). Output states (`rdempty`, `wrfull`) and data (`q`) are managed through internal wiring to `dcfifo` outputs, ensuring synchronized and efficient data transfers."
