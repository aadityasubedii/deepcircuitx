Module-level comment: The AUDIO_IF module interfaces with external ADC and DAC for audio data handling using FIFOs. It synchronizes via clock signals and controls data flow via input and output ports linked to transmitting and receiving functions. Internally, it features logic for FIFO management and signal operations to regulate reading from and writing to FIFOs, ensuring effective digital audio conversion coordination.
