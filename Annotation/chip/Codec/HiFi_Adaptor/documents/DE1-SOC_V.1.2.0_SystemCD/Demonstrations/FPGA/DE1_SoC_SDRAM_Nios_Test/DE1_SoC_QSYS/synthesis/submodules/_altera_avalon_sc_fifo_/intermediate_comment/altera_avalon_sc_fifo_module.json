    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable FIFO buffer for FPGA designs. It supports various data widths, depths, and optional packet-based operations. The FIFO uses either embedded memory blocks or shift registers for storage, depending on configuration. It handles data transfer, error detection, and provides control interfaces. The module implements fill level tracking, almost full/empty signaling, and store-and-forward functionality. It uses pointers for read/write operations in memory-based mode and a shift register approach for register-based mode, with configurable empty latency and cut-through threshold for optimized performance."
