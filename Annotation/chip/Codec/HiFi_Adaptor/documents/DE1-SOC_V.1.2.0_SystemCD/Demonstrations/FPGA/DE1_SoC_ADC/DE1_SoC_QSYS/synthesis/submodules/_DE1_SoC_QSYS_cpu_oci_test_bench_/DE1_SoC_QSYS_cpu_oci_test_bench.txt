Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_oci_test_bench is a Verilog test module for handling DCT buffer data tests. The module includes four input ports: 'dct_buffer' (30-bit DCT data), 'dct_count' (4-bit index/counter), 'test_ending' (indicates a test is ending), and 'test_has_ended' (signals test completion). No outputs or internal signals are defined, indicating its role is limited to monitoring or state adjustments based on inputs without producing outputs.
