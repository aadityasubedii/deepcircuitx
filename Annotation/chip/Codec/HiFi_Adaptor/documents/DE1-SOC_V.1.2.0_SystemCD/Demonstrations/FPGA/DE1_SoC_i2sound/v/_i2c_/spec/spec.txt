Module name: i2c.
Module specification: The i2c module simulates an I2C controller for facilitating communication between devices over an I2C bus, primarily for inter-device data transfers with a focus on managing serial data and clock, acknowledging signals, and controlling the entire data transaction flow. The input ports include CLOCK (main clock signal for synchronization), I2C_DATA (24-bit data for transmission), GO (initiates communication), RESET (resets internal states), and W_R (determines operation mode: read or write). The output ports are I2C_SCLK (serial clock line), I2C_SDAT (bidirectional serial data line), END (signals transaction completion), ACK (acknowledgment signal), SD_COUNTER (state counter), and SDO (serial data output). Internally, this module uses registers like SDO (holds bits being driven onto I2C_SDAT), SCLK (manages clock signal on the I2C bus), SD (holds entire transaction data), and flags ACK1, ACK2, ACK3 (for acknowledgments in transaction phases). The code has various blocks including initialization on reset, state management during the transaction through an always block keyed to CLOCK and RESET, data transfer logic divided into phases handled by conditional cases within these always blocks, and feedback through ACK1, ACK2, ACK3 combined into an output ACK signal. The states of the transaction are tracked by incrementing SD_COUNTER, and transitions between phases, based on counter values, control data sampling, data output staging, and transition to idle state post-transaction completion.
