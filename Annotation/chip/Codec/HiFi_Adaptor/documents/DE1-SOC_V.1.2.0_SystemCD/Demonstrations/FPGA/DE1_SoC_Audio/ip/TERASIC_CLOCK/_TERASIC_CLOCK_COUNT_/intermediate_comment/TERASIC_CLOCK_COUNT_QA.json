It features functionality for starting and stopping the counting via specific control signals and addresses, and allows the latched counts to be read back via a specific memory-mapped interfacing. The counting operation starts when a specific value is written to a designated address, and the counts for each clock are stored separately when the counting stops. This module can be utilized in systems requiring precise monitoring and control of clock pulse counts for timing or synchronization purposes."

It is set or cleared based on the value written to the REG_START address or when the count down (cnt_down) reaches zero.\n- **cnt_down**: A 16-bit register used as a countdown timer. It is loaded with a value when a write operation occurs to the REG_START address, and decrements with each system clock pulse until it reaches zero, signaling the end of a counting sequence.\n- **clk1_cnt**: A 16-bit register that counts the pulses of the external clock signal CLK_1 when the module is in counting mode (i.e., when counting_now is high).\n- **clk1_cnt_latched**: A 16-bit register that latches the value of clk1_cnt when the counting stops (i.e., counting_now transitions to low). This value is held until the counting is restarted or the system is reset.\n- **clk2_cnt**: Similar to clk1_cnt, this is a 16-bit register that counts the pulses of the external clock signal CLK_2 during counting mode.\n- **clk2_cnt_latched**: This 16-bit register latches the value of clk2_cnt when the counting stops, similar to clk1_cnt_latched, preserving the count of CLK_2 pulses until the next counting session or a system reset occurs."
