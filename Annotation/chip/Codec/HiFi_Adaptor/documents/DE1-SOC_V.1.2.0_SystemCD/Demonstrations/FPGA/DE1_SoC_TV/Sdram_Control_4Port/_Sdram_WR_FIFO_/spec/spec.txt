Module name: Sdram_WR_FIFO. Module specification: The Sdram_WR_FIFO module is designed to interface with Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) through a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer management system, synchronizing data exchange between different clock domains or components. The module uses asynchronous FIFO configurations with two clocks: a read clock (rdclk) and a write clock (wrclk). It accepts several input ports including aclr (asynchronous clear), data (16-bit input data for FIFO), rdreq (read request), and wrreq (write request). Output ports consist of q (16-bit output data from FIFO), rdempty (signals if read buffer is empty), wrfull (signals if write buffer is full), rdusedw (9-bit output indicating words in the read buffer), and wrusedw (9-bit output indicating words in the write buffer). Internal signals such as sub_wire0 to sub_wire4 facilitate connectivity between the FIFO's internal component and the module's input/output ports. For instance, sub_wire1 carries data from the FIFO's internal dcfifo component to the q output port. The code integrates a dcfifo component configured with specifics like device family, memory type, and buffer sizes optimized for performance requirements. Additional parameters set include overflow and underflow checking, synchronization parameters, and FIFO data management features. This structure assures comprehensive management of read and write operations, addressable directly through high-level module ports and encapsulated within robust internal signal wiring and FIFO logic configuration.
