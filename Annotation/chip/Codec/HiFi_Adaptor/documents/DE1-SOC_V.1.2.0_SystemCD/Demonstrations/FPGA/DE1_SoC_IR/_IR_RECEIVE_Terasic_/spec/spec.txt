Module name: IR_RECEIVE. 

Module specification: The IR_RECEIVE module is responsible for receiving and decoding infrared (IR) signals, specifically handling the synchronization, processing, and output of decoded 32-bit data packets. It utilizes a state machine approach with three primary states: IDLE, GUIDANCE, and DATAREAD. Various input ports include iCLK (clock input for synchronization), iRST_n (active-low reset for initialization and error recovery), and iIRDA (IR data input). Output ports comprise oDATA_READY (indicates data availability) and oDATA (holds the 32-bit decoded data packet). Internally, the module leverages several signals like idle_count, state_count, and data_count to track different durations critical for state transitions and data decoding, while state signals manage the current machine state. Flags such as idle_count_flag, state_count_flag, and data_count_flag help enable respective counters based on state and input conditions. The bitcount signal counts the number of bits received to ensure a complete data packet. The module reacts in real-time to changes, utilizing always blocks to change states based on conditions like reaching specific duration thresholds or completing bit counts. Each always block is meticulously designed to reset states and counters on reset, handle transitions between states based on the duration of signals, serialize data bit by bit into a temporary register, and check for data correctness before setting data as ready. This structured design ensures accurate reception and processing of IR data, tailored to specific signal timing requirements.
