Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_mult_cell.
Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_mult_cell is a Verilog module designed to perform multiplication of two 32-bit input signals, A_mul_src1 and A_mul_src2. It outputs a 32-bit result, A_mul_cell_result, which is a product of the inputs. The inputs A_mul_src1 and A_mul_src2 serve as the operands for the multiplication process, while clk is the input clock signal that coordinates the timing of internal operations, and reset_n is an active-low reset input signal that initializes the multiplication result when de-asserted. The output A_mul_cell_result holds the final multiplication result after combining partial results generated within the module. Internally, the module uses signals such as A_mul_cell_result_part_1 and A_mul_cell_result_part_2 to store partial multiplication results from two instances of the altera_mult_add IP core module, which perform multiplication on the lower and upper bits of A_mul_src1 with the lower bits of A_mul_src2, respectively. The internal mul_clr signal, derived from the negated reset_n, controls the asynchronous clear function of these multipliers. The module is divided into blocks responsible for the following functions: defining the input and output ports of the module, declaring internal signals, instantiating the altera_mult_add modules with appropriate parameters for optimized operation on Cyclone V FPGAs, and combining the partial results to achieve the final output. The code is structured to first handle the lower bits multiplication, then the upper bits multiplication, and finally to merge the results to output the completed product.
