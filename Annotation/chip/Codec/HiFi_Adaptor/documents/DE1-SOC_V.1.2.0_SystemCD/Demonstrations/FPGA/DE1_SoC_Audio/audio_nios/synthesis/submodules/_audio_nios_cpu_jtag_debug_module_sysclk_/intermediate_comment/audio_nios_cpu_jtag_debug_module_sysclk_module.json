    "module": "Module-level comment: The `audio_nios_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk` manages CPU debugging via JTAG synchronized to the system clock. It stabilizes asynchronous signals (`vs_udr`, `vs_uir`), detects edges for updates, and controls debug actions based on the instruction inputs and internal conditions. Implementation includes dual flip-flops for signal synchronization, edge detection for handshaking, and combinational logic to drive decision-making outputs."
