    "spec": "Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_wrapper.\n\nModule specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_wrapper is designed for JTAG-based debugging of a CPU on a DE1-SoC system. It manages the debugging interface through various input and output signals, interfacing with JTAG state machines and CPU signals. The input ports include signals like MonDReg and break_readreg for monitoring and breakpoint detection, clk for clocking, numerous dbrk_hitx_latch for debugging breakpoints hits, and commands like reset_n and tracemem_on for controlling reset behaviors and memory tracing. Output ports such as jdo for JTAG data output and signals like take_action_break_x for managing breakpoint actions are provided. The module uses internal signals like jdi_tck and vji_tdi for JTAG operations, and vji_rti representing the JTAG 'Run-Test/Idle' state. The code is primarily organized into two sections, with DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_tck and DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk instances handling the synchronization of trace and debug actions based on clock and JTAG state transitions, respectively. Further, manual assignments set basic operation states of JTAG signals to default lows or zeroes, ensuring controlled operation during uninitialized states. This structure facilitates comprehensive monitoring, control, and debugging functionalities critical for development and testing on the SoC system.",

It manages the debugging interface through various input and output signals, interfacing with JTAG state machines and CPU signals. The input ports include signals like MonDReg and break_readreg for monitoring and breakpoint detection, clk for clocking, numerous dbrk_hitx_latch for debugging breakpoints hits, and commands like reset_n and tracemem_on for controlling reset behaviors and memory tracing. Output ports such as jdo for JTAG data output and signals like take_action_break_x for managing breakpoint actions are provided. The module uses internal signals like jdi_tck and vji_tdi for JTAG operations, and vji_rti representing the JTAG 'Run-Test/Idle' state. The code is primarily organized into two sections, with DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_tck and DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk instances handling the synchronization of trace and debug actions based on clock and JTAG state transitions, respectively. Further, manual assignments set basic operation states of JTAG signals to default lows or zeroes, ensuring controlled operation during uninitialized states. This structure facilitates comprehensive monitoring, control, and debugging functionalities critical for development and testing on the SoC system."

It manages the debugging interface through various input and output signals, interfacing with JTAG state machines and CPU signals. The input ports include signals like MonDReg and break_readreg for monitoring and breakpoint detection, clk for clocking, numerous dbrk_hitx_latch for debugging breakpoints hits, and commands like reset_n and tracemem_on for controlling reset behaviors and memory tracing. Output ports such as jdo for JTAG data output and signals like take_action_break_x for managing breakpoint actions are provided. The module uses internal signals like jdi_tck and vji_tdi for JTAG operations, and vji_rti representing the JTAG 'Run-Test/Idle' state. The code is primarily organized into two sections, with DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_tck and DE1_SoC_QSYS_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk instances handling the synchronization of trace and debug actions based on clock and JTAG state transitions, respectively. Further, manual assignments set basic operation states of JTAG signals to default lows or zeroes, ensuring controlled operation during uninitialized states. This structure facilitates comprehensive monitoring, control, and debugging functionalities critical for development and testing on the SoC system."
