It takes a reference clock (refclk) as input and generates two output clocks (outclk_0, outclk_1) while also providing a 'locked' signal indicating when the PLL is locked to the input frequency. The PLL is configured not to use fractional VCO multiplier and operates normally providing exact output frequencies of 100 MHz for both outputs, but with a phase shift of -3000 ps applied to outclk_1. The functionality is achieved using an Altera-specific PLL component configured through various parameters governing frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles of the output clocks."

The `rst` port is a reset input that initializes the PLL, allowing it to start in a known state or recover from errors by resetting its internal logic.\n\nOutput ports: outclk_0, outclk_1, locked.\nExplanation: The `outclk_0` and `outclk_1` ports are the output clock signals generated by the PLL. Both are set to 100 MHz, but `outclk_1` has a phase shift of -3000 ps relative to `outclk_0`, allowing for specific timing requirements in SDRAM operation. The `locked` port is a signal output indicating when the PLL has successfully synchronized to the reference clock, meaning it's producing stable and correct output frequencies."
