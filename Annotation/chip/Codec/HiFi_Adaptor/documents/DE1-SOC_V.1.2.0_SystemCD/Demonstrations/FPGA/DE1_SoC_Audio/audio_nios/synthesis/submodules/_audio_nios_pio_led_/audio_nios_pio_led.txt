Module-level comment: The "audio_nios_pio_led" module serves as a peripheral interface for Nios systems, controlling LEDs via a 10-bit output. It accommodates write and read operations through inputs like `address`, `chipselect`, and `writedata`. On receiving a valid write command, it updates the `data_out` register, which directly maps to `out_port` and is formatted into `readdata` for reads. This setup efficiently handles peripheral data with clear operational distinction between address-based actions.
