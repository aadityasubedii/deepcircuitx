Module name: altera_avalon_st_handshake_clock_crosser. Module specification: The `altera_avalon_st_handshake_clock_crosser` module is designed to transfer data between two clock domains of different frequencies or phases while maintaining data integrity, leveraging the `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser` submodule for the core functionality. The module accepts data and controls signals at its input ports: `in_clk`, `in_reset`, `in_valid`, `in_data`, `in_channel`, `in_error`, `in_startofpacket`, `in_endofpacket`, and `in_empty`, which are synchronized to the input clock, `in_clk`. It outputs data through `out_valid`, `out_data`, `out_channel`, `out_error`, `out_startofpacket`, `out_endofpacket`, and `out_empty`, which are synchronized to the output clock, `out_clk`. The internal signals such as `in_payload` and `out_payload` aggregate various data and control inputs into a single bus for processing across clock domains, while parameters like `PACKET_WIDTH`, `PCHANNEL_W`, `PERROR_W`, and `PAYLOAD_WIDTH` dictate the structure of this payload based on module configuration. Significant sections of the code include signal assignments for constructing and deconstructing the payloads, the instantiation of the clock domain crossing core (`altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser`), and control structures (generate blocks) that configure the behavior based on parameters such as `USE_PACKETS`, `USE_CHANNEL`, and `USE_ERROR`. The module also contains a utility function, `log2ceil`, used for calculating widths related to empty signalling. This module is essential for robust data communication in systems with multiple operational clock domains, ensuring smooth and error-free data handling.
