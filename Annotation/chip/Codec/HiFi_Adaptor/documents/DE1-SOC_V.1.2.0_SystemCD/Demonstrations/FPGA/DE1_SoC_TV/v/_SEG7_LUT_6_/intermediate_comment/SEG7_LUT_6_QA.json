It takes a 32-bit input `iDIG`, segments it into six 4-bit groups, and for each group, a submodule (`SEG7_LUT`) processes it to drive the 7-segment outputs (`oSEG0` to `oSEG5`). Each output corresponds to one of the six 7-segment displays, showing the decoded binary input as a readable decimal or hexadecimal character on the display."

These values are divided into six 4-bit binary groups (slices of the 32-bit input), each of which will be decoded separately to drive a corresponding 7-segment display.\n\nOutput ports: [oSEG0, oSEG1, oSEG2, oSEG3, oSEG4, oSEG5].  \nExplanation: `oSEG0` to `oSEG5` are 7-bit output ports that drive the segments of six individual 7-segment displays. Each output port corresponds to one of the displays, and receives its values from the `SEG7_LUT` submodule, which processes the respective 4-bit section of the `iDIG` input. This processing decodes the binary input values into signals that can control the individual segments of the 7-segment display to represent hexadecimal characters and numbers visually. Each bit of these 7-bit outputs controls one segment of a 7-segment display, enabling them to show the desired character or number."
