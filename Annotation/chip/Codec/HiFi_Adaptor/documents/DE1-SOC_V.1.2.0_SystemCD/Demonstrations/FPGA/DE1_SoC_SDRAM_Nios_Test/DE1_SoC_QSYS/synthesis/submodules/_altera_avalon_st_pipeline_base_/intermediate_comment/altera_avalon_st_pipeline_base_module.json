    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base\" module manages streaming data in registered and unregistered modes dictated by PIPELINE_READY. In registered mode, it leverages dual-stage buffering (`data0`, `data1`) with corresponding fullness flags (`full0`, `full1`) to ensure data synchronization and flow control, passing data only when downstream readiness and internal conditions allow. In unregistered mode, it simplifies data handling with minimal buffering for lower latency, directing input directly to output based on readiness."
