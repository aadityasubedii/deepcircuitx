    "module": "Module-level comment: The `audio_nios_cpu_mult_cell` module performs a 32-bit multiplication of two input operands (`A_mul_src1`, `A_mul_src2`) using two `altera_mult_add` instances for efficient partial multiplications. It utilizes the lower and mixed upper-lower 16 bits of the inputs to generate intermediate results (`A_mul_cell_result_part_1` and `A_mul_cell_result_part_2`), which are combined to produce the final result (`A_mul_cell_result`). This design allows efficient use of hardware for high-bit-width multiplication by decomposing the operation into simpler tasks synchronized by a clock (`clk`) and managed under an active-low reset (`reset_n`)."
