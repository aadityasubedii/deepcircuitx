    "module": "Module-level comment: This module manages SDRAM operations for four ports (2 write, 2 read) using internal state machines and FIFOs. It handles read/write requests, SDRAM timing, and command generation. The module uses a PLL for clock generation, separate control and command interfaces for SDRAM operations, and individual FIFOs for each port to manage data flow. It supports concurrent operations, address management, and efficient SDRAM interfacing for high-throughput memory access in multi-port systems."
