It operates through a state machine with three states\u2014IDLE, GUIDANCE, and DATAREAD. The IDLE state waits for a signal, transitioning to GUIDANCE when it detects a continuous low IR signal exceeding a certain duration. GUIDANCE waits for a high signal of specified duration to switch to the DATAREAD where actual data bits are read and serialized. Each data bit's timing determines its value (1 or 0). The module counts these bits, checking for errors (by comparing two sections of the received data for complementarity). When all 32 bits are correctly received, the data is confirmed, stored in a buffer, and an indication that the data is ready is outputted. The system operates synchronously with a clock and has reset functionality."

It initializes or reset the module to a known state whenever it is pulled low.\n- iIRDA: This is the input receiving the IR signal. It is the digital representation of the IR data signal being decoded by the module.\n\nOutput ports: oDATA_READY, oDATA.\nExplanation:\n- oDATA_READY: This is a flag output indicating that the received data is ready and valid. It becomes high when a complete and correct 32-bit data packet has been received and validated, signaling to external systems that the data can be read.\n- oDATA: This is the output data port that holds the validated 32-bit data packet received via the IR signal. The data is presented here when oDATA_READY is high, making it available for other parts of the system to utilize."

It helps in determining when to transition to the GUIDANCE state.\n- idle_count_flag: This flag enables the idle_count counter.

This counter helps ensure that 32 bits are read to form a complete data message.\n- state: This is a state register that holds the current state of the state machine (IDLE, GUIDANCE, or DATAREAD). It determines the next operations based on IR signal conditions.\n- data: This is a temporary register where the individual bits of the incoming data are stored serially as they are decoded.\n- data_buf: This buffer holds the fully received and validated 32-bit data ready for output. It is used to store the data temporarily until it can be passed to the output port oDATA.\n- data_ready: A flag signal that indicates when the received data is completely ready and validated. It drives the output signal oDATA_READY to signal external components that data reception and validation are complete."
