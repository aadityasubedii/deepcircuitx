It uses an external FIFO (implemented in the submodule `audio_nios_sdram_input_efifo_module`) to manage data exchange with the SDRAM, handling both read and write operations. The module controls SDRAM operations based on the states of the refresh counter, initialization commands, and addresses, ensuring correct timing and sequencing for operations like refresh, activation, read, write, and precharge. These operations are determined by a finite state machine which adjusts the control signals and data flow appropriately, dictated by clock cycles and reset conditions. The module accommodates memory commands and addresses setup and generates valid output data signals in synchronous with an internal refresh mechanism and FIFO status, ensuring smooth and efficient data handling for SDRAM based audio applications."
