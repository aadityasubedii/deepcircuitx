    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_dc_fifo` module implements a dual-clock FIFO system for reliable data transfer between different clock domains. It handles synchronization, data management, and error handling across asynchronous circuits. Key functionalities include configurable data depth, width, and advanced control features such as packet handling and status monitoring through CSR interfaces. Internally, it uses memory arrays and pointer logic to manage data storage and retrieval, ensuring data integrity and timely availability."
