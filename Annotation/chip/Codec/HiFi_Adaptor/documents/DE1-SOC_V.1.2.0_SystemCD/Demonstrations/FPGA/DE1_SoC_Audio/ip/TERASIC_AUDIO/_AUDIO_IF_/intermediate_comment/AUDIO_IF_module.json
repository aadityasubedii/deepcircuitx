    "module": "Module-level comment: The AUDIO_IF module interfaces the system with audio codecs, managing data transfer to/from ADC and DAC. It synchronizes operations via clock inputs, handles data through FIFO control signals, and adjusts based on command inputs. Internally, it includes separate logic for writing to the DAC and reading from the ADC, ensuring data integrity by monitoring FIFO statuses. The module employs sub-modules for DAC and ADC for specific audio handling, configured for 32-bit data operations to maintain audio quality."
