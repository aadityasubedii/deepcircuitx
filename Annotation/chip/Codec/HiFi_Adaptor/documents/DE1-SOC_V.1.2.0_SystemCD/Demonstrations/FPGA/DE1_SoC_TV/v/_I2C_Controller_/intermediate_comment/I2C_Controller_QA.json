It manages sending and receiving data over the I2C bus using a combination of input conditions and internal state management. The controller interacts with an I2C device by generating the necessary signals for clock (SCLK) and data transmission (SDAT), handling different phases of data transmission based on a counter (SD_COUNTER). It sends a 24-bit data (I2C_DATA) in chunks and reads acknowledgments (ACK) from the I2C device. The controller also manages the start and end of the transmission indicated by the signals GO and END respectively."
