Module-level comment: The I2C_Controller module acts as an I2C master controller, managing data transfers over an I2C bus via a state-driven finite state machine. It uses input signals like CLOCK for timing, GO to start operations, RESET for initialization, and W_R for mode selection, while interfacing through bidirectional SDAT and output SCLK lines. The internal logic includes a state counter (SD_COUNTER), data registers, and acknowledgment handling to ensure proper sequence, synchronization, and communication integrity in both write and read operations.
