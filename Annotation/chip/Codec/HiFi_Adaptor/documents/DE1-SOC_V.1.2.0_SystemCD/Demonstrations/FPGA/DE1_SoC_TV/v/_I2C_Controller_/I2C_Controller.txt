Module-level comment: The I2C_Controller module manages I2C communication by transmitting 24-bit I2C_DATA and controlling I2C_SCLK and I2C_SDAT lines. Utilizing input signals like CLOCK and GO, it operates through a state machine managed by SD_COUNTER to sequence data output, acknowledgments, and signal handling. Internal signals like SDO, SCLK, and SD facilitate bit-wise data transmission and synchronization, achieving efficient data handling and device interaction within the I2C protocol standards.
