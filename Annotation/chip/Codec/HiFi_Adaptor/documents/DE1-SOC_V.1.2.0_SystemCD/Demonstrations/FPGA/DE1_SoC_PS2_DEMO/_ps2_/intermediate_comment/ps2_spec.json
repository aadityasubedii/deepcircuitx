    "spec": "Module name: ps2.\n\nModule specification: The 'ps2' module is designed to interface with PS/2 devices such as a mouse or keyboard, enabling data communication over PS2_CLK and PS2_DAT lines. It employs a finite state machine to manage state transitions and data synchronization across input and output operations. The module processes input signals iSTART (initiating communication), iRST_n (active low reset), and iCLK_50 (50 MHz clock input). Output signals include oLEFBUT, oRIGBUT, and oMIDBUT (indicators for left, right, and middle mouse buttons pressed, respectively) and oX_MOV1, oX_MOV2, oY_MOV1, oY_MOV2 (representing x and y movements divided into higher and lower 7 bits). Additionally, the inout ports PS2_CLK and PS2_DAT are maneuvered based on internal controls for bidirectional communication. Key internal signals utilized within the module are cur_state and nex_state (tracking current and next state of FSM), byte_cnt (bit counter for data transitions), and multiple synchronization, control, and data handling registers of various sizes. The code is structured into several blocks focusing on clock division, input/output assignments, state transitions of the FSM with their respective functionalities, data reception and transmission handling, and reaction to conditions such as edge detections or achieving specific counts, all operating primarily on the rising edge of the clock or specific signal conditions. This structured approach efficiently handles the PS/2 protocol required for the bi-directional data transmission and ensures robust operation with PS/2 devices.",

It employs a finite state machine to manage state transitions and data synchronization across input and output operations. The module processes input signals iSTART (initiating communication), iRST_n (active low reset), and iCLK_50 (50 MHz clock input). Output signals include oLEFBUT, oRIGBUT, and oMIDBUT (indicators for left, right, and middle mouse buttons pressed, respectively) and oX_MOV1, oX_MOV2, oY_MOV1, oY_MOV2 (representing x and y movements divided into higher and lower 7 bits). Additionally, the inout ports PS2_CLK and PS2_DAT are maneuvered based on internal controls for bidirectional communication. Key internal signals utilized within the module are cur_state and nex_state (tracking current and next state of FSM), byte_cnt (bit counter for data transitions), and multiple synchronization, control, and data handling registers of various sizes. The code is structured into several blocks focusing on clock division, input/output assignments, state transitions of the FSM with their respective functionalities, data reception and transmission handling, and reaction to conditions such as edge detections or achieving specific counts, all operating primarily on the rising edge of the clock or specific signal conditions. This structured approach efficiently handles the PS/2 protocol required for the bi-directional data transmission and ensures robust operation with PS/2 devices."
