Module name: audio_nios_altpll_audio. 
Module specification: The 'audio_nios_altpll_audio' is a Verilog module designed for generating a specific frequency of 18.432 MHz from a 50.0 MHz reference clock using a phase-locked loop (PLL) tailored for audio applications. It consists of input ports `refclk` and `rst`, where `refclk` is the reference clock input set at 50.0 MHz and `rst` is used to reset the PLL settings. Output ports include `outclk_0`, which delivers the required 18.432 MHz clock for external use, and `locked`, which indicates the PLL's lock status demonstrating successful stabilization at the output frequency. Internal signals such as `outclk`, `locked`, `fboutclk`, and `fbclk` facilitate internal connections and control within the module. The module primarily uses the `altera_pll` instance, configured specifically for a single output though parameters for up to 18 outputs are included but inactive. This instance handles clock synthesis with various parameters including PLL type, frequency, phase shift, and duty cycle as per requirements, all while maintaining a straightforward connectivity schema for reset and clock feedback operations.
