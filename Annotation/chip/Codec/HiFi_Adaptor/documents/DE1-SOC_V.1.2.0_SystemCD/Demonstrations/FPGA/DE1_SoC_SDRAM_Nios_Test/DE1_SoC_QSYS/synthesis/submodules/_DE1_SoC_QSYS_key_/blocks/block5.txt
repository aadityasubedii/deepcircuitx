Comment: 
This block of code performs signal detection on a positive edge of the clock or a negative edge of the reset signal. On detecting a negative edge of the reset signal, it forces the 'edge_capture' bit to 0. When the clock is enabled, it then monitors the 'edge_capture_wr_strobe'. If the strobe indicates to write, 'edge_capture' bit is again made 0. Alternatively, if an edge is detected, 'edge_capture' bit is set to -1.
