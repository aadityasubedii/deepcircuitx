    "spec": "Module name: ISP1362_IF. Module specification: The ISP1362_IF is a Verilog module designed to act as an interface between a host controller (HC) and a device controller (DC), conducting data transactions with a USB device. It handles input ports such as 16-bit data lines `avs_hc_writedata_iDATA` and `avs_dc_writedata_iDATA` for writing data to the USB, address lines `avs_hc_address_iADDR` and `avs_dc_address_iADDR`, read and write enable signals like `avs_hc_read_n_iRD_N` and `avs_dc_read_n_iRD_N`, chip select signals `avs_hc_chipselect_n_iCS_N` and `avs_dc_chipselect_n_iCS_N`, reset signals `avs_hc_reset_n_iRST_N` and `avs_dc_reset_n_iRST_N`, clock signals `avs_hc_clk_iCLK` and `avs_dc_clk_iCLK`, and interrupt inputs `USB_INT0` and `USB_INT1`. The output ports include 16-bit data lines `avs_hc_readdata_oDATA` and `avs_dc_readdata_oDATA` for reading data from USB, interrupt outputs `avs_hc_irq_n_oINT0_N` and `avs_dc_irq_n_oINT0_N`, USB control signals and data lines like `USB_DATA`, `USB_ADDR`, `USB_RD_N`, `USB_WR_N`, `USB_CS_N`, and `USB_RST_N`. Internally, the module uses several signals such as `USB_DATA` for bidirectional data transfer, `USB_ADDR` to determine target locations for reading or writing, control signals `USB_RD_N`, `USB_WR_N`, `USB_CS_N`, and `USB_RST_N` to manage USB operations, and outputs for reading data `avs_hc_readdata_oDATA` and `avs_dc_readdata_oDATA`. The code further maps these internal and external connections through assignments that effectively direct data flow dependent on the active controller, ensuring proper read or write operations and selection management for the connected USB device. The module's structure efficiently allows for clear delineation and interaction between the respective host and device controllers and the USB device while addressing signal integrity and synchronization needs.",

Module specification: The ISP1362_IF is a Verilog module designed to act as an interface between a host controller (HC) and a device controller (DC), conducting data transactions with a USB device. It handles input ports such as 16-bit data lines `avs_hc_writedata_iDATA` and `avs_dc_writedata_iDATA` for writing data to the USB, address lines `avs_hc_address_iADDR` and `avs_dc_address_iADDR`, read and write enable signals like `avs_hc_read_n_iRD_N` and `avs_dc_read_n_iRD_N`, chip select signals `avs_hc_chipselect_n_iCS_N` and `avs_dc_chipselect_n_iCS_N`, reset signals `avs_hc_reset_n_iRST_N` and `avs_dc_reset_n_iRST_N`, clock signals `avs_hc_clk_iCLK` and `avs_dc_clk_iCLK`, and interrupt inputs `USB_INT0` and `USB_INT1`. The output ports include 16-bit data lines `avs_hc_readdata_oDATA` and `avs_dc_readdata_oDATA` for reading data from USB, interrupt outputs `avs_hc_irq_n_oINT0_N` and `avs_dc_irq_n_oINT0_N`, USB control signals and data lines like `USB_DATA`, `USB_ADDR`, `USB_RD_N`, `USB_WR_N`, `USB_CS_N`, and `USB_RST_N`. Internally, the module uses several signals such as `USB_DATA` for bidirectional data transfer, `USB_ADDR` to determine target locations for reading or writing, control signals `USB_RD_N`, `USB_WR_N`, `USB_CS_N`, and `USB_RST_N` to manage USB operations, and outputs for reading data `avs_hc_readdata_oDATA` and `avs_dc_readdata_oDATA`. The code further maps these internal and external connections through assignments that effectively direct data flow dependent on the active controller, ensuring proper read or write operations and selection management for the connected USB device. The module's structure efficiently allows for clear delineation and interaction between the respective host and device controllers and the USB device while addressing signal integrity and synchronization needs."
