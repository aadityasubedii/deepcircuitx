    "module": "Module-level comment: The `audio_nios_key` module interfaces with key inputs in a digital audio system, detecting key presses/releases and generating processor interrupts based on edge conditions. It utilizes registers for capturing edge detections, managing interrupt masks, and outputting states or configurations based on input addresses. Internal clock-based logic manages state transitions and captures, ensuring accurate edge and interrupt signaling."
