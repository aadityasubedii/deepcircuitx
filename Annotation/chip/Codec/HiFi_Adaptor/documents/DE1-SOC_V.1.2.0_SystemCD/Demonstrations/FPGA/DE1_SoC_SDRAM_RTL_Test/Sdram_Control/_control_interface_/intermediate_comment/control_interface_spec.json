    "spec": "Module name: control_interface. Module specification: The `control_interface` is a Verilog module designed to manage operations for SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory), handling commands such as NOP, READ, WRITE, REFRESH, PRECHARGE, and LOAD_MODE based on the input CMD. Its functionality includes translating input ADDR to an internal SDRAM address (SADDR) and managing the initialization and refresh cycles with two timers (timer and init_timer). The input ports include CLK (clock), RESET_N (active-low reset), CMD (3-bit command input), ADDR (input address), REF_ACK (refresh acknowledge), INIT_ACK (initialization acknowledge), and CM_ACK (command acknowledge from an external source). The output ports are NOP, READA, WRITEA, REFRESH, PRECHARGE, LOAD_MODE, SADDR, REF_REQ (refresh request), INIT_REQ (initialization request), and CMD_ACK (command acknowledge). Internally, the module uses the signals such as timer for refresh management, init_timer for initialization procedures, along with control and status signals such as REF_REQ, and CMD_ACK. The code is structured into several always blocks, handling external reset and clock conditions, command decoding and execution, refresh operations, and initialization sequences, ensuring the module reacts correctly to system states and inputs to manage the SDRAM effectively. This design encapsulates all necessary logic for interfacing and managing an SDRAM system efficiently and reliably.",

It is reset on either a refresh acknowledgment (REF_ACK) or upon specific conditions during SDRAM initialization. It decrements with every clock cycle until it reaches zero, at which point a refresh request (REF_REQ) is issued if no other refresh or initialization is ongoing.\n- **init_timer**: Another 16-bit register that functions as a counter specifically for the SDRAM initialization period.

It facilitates the sequential steps needed to properly initialize the SDRAM.\n- **CMD_ACK**: This signal serves as an acknowledgment that a command has been executed successfully, aligning internal activities with external confirmations through CM_ACK.

Module specification: The `control_interface` is a Verilog module designed to manage operations for SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory), handling commands such as NOP, READ, WRITE, REFRESH, PRECHARGE, and LOAD_MODE based on the input CMD. Its functionality includes translating input ADDR to an internal SDRAM address (SADDR) and managing the initialization and refresh cycles with two timers (timer and init_timer). The input ports include CLK (clock), RESET_N (active-low reset), CMD (3-bit command input), ADDR (input address), REF_ACK (refresh acknowledge), INIT_ACK (initialization acknowledge), and CM_ACK (command acknowledge from an external source). The output ports are NOP, READA, WRITEA, REFRESH, PRECHARGE, LOAD_MODE, SADDR, REF_REQ (refresh request), INIT_REQ (initialization request), and CMD_ACK (command acknowledge). Internally, the module uses the signals such as timer for refresh management, init_timer for initialization procedures, along with control and status signals such as REF_REQ, and CMD_ACK. The code is structured into several always blocks, handling external reset and clock conditions, command decoding and execution, refresh operations, and initialization sequences, ensuring the module reacts correctly to system states and inputs to manage the SDRAM effectively. This design encapsulates all necessary logic for interfacing and managing an SDRAM system efficiently and reliably."
