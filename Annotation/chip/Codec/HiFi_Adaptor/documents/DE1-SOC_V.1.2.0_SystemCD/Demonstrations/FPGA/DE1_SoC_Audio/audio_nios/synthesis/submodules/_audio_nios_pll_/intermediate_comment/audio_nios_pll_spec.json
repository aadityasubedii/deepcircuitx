Module specification: The `audio_nios_pll` module leverages an internal instance of the `altera_pll` component to generate three distinct clock outputs (`outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`) from a single reference clock input (`refclk`). These outputs are designed to operate at 100 MHz with different phase shifts for the first two clocks, and 10 MHz for the third clock, serving various clocking needs in an audio processing system. It accepts an input `refclk`, which is a reference clock signal utilized by the PLL to derive the output clocks, and a reset signal `rst` to reset the internal PLL states. The module outputs three clocks and a `locked` signal indicating the PLL's lock status to the reference clock. Internally, unused feedback signals `fboutclk` and `fbclk` (tied to `1'b0`) are defined, pointing to specific PLL configurations where they are not needed for operation. The `altera_pll` instantiation is configured with a large array of parameters specifying the operation mode, number of clocks, frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles, along with PLL type specifics, indicating a comprehensive setup for reliable clock generation tailored to system requirements.",
