    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'SEG7_IF' module interfaces with 7-segment display units, managing data I/O via a register file. It operates on the negative clock edge, handling reset, read, and write operations using signals like 's_reset', 's_read', and 's_write'. The outputs to displays are managed based on the 'LOW_ACTIVE' setting, and the internal register file system stores and retrieves segment data efficiently, ensuring dynamic control over displayed information."
