    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_altpll_0 module utilizes an altera_pll block to generate two distinct clock frequencies (100 MHz and 40 MHz) from a reference clock. It includes inputs for resetting and reference clock, outputs for the generated clocks and a lock status. The setup ensures stable clock outputs for systems needing multiple clock domains, relying on minimal internal feedback signaled by fbclk tied to zero."
