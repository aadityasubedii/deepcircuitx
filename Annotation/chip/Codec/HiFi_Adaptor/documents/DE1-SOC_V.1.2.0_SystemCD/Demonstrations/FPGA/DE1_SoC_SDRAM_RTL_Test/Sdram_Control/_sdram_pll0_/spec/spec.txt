Module name: sdram_pll0.
Module specification: The "sdram_pll0" module is a Verilog module designed to generate two distinct output clock signals from a single reference clock input, incorporating a locked status indication. It effectively serves as a wrapper for "sdram_pll0_0002," an internally instantiated module named "sdram_pll0_inst." The input ports are `refclk`, which provides the reference clock signal necessary for deriving the output clocks, and `rst`, which is utilized for resetting the phase-locked loop (PLL) within the module to ensure it initiates correctly or recovers from faults. The output ports include `outclk_0` and `outclk_1`, which are the generated clock signals from the input reference and are utilized where multiple clock domains are necessary, such as in SDRAM applications. Additionally, the `locked` output signal indicates the reliability and stability of the output clocks, turning high when the PLL is properly locked. There are no internal signals within this module as it principally functions as a pass-through or wrapper, with all signals directly interfaced with the instantiated module "sdram_pll0_inst". The module's code is straightforward, housing only the instantiation of "sdram_pll0_0002" that connects the input and output ports directly to the respective ports of the internal instance, emphasizing its simplicity and specific utility.
