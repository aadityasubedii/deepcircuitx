Module-level comment: The control_interface module handles control signaling for an SDRAM system, managing operations such as reading, writing, refreshing, and initializing based on input commands and addresses. It uses internal timers for conditioning the timing of refresh and initialization requests, while output control signals are generated based on the command input and system state. Key operational blocks manage command processing, command acknowledgment, refresh request timing, and initialization sequencing to ensure synchronized and efficient SDRAM operations.
