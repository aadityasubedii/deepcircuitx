Module-level comment: 
/* This module implements a complex audio processing system-on-chip.
   It integrates a CPU, memory interfaces (SDRAM, on-chip), audio I/O,
   I2C communication, and various peripherals (LEDs, switches, 7-segment displays).
   The design uses multiple clock domains, reset controllers, and data width adapters.
   It implements a memory-mapped architecture with address decoding and routing logic
   to facilitate communication between the CPU and peripherals via an interconnect system. */
