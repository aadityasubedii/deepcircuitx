    "module": "Module-level comment: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_mult_cell module performs 32-bit multiplication of two input signals (A_mul_src1, A_mul_src2) and outputs the result (A_mul_cell_result). It utilizes Altera's altera_mult_add IP cores to calculate partial products (A_mul_cell_result_part_1, A_mul_cell_result_part_2) based on lower and upper segment multiplications, with synchronization via clk and asynchronous reset using reset_n. Final result assembly is accomplished through concatenation and addition of partial products."
