It utilizes an `altera_pll` component configured to provide three distinct output clocks (`outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, and `outclk_2`) with specified frequencies and characteristics. The module takes a reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset signal (`rst`) as input. The output clocks are used to drive other parts of a larger system, presumably for audio processing given the module's name. Additionally, the module outputs a `locked` signal indicating whether the PLL has successfully locked to the input reference clock."

It serves as the primary clock source that the PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) uses to generate multiple synchronized output clocks at different frequencies.\n- `rst`: This is the reset input for the module. It is used to reset the internal state of the PLL, ensuring it starts in a known state and can resynchronize when needed.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`, `locked`.\nExplanation:\n- `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`: These are the output clocks generated by the PLL. Each clock can have different frequencies and phases, configured according to the needs of the application. For instance, `outclk_0` and `outclk_1` are configured to operate at 100 MHz but with different phase shifts, while `outclk_2` is set to 10 MHz.\n- `locked`: This port outputs a signal indicating whether the PLL has successfully synchronized its output to the reference clock (`refclk`). A high level (1) on this signal indicates that the PLL is locked and the output clocks are stable."
