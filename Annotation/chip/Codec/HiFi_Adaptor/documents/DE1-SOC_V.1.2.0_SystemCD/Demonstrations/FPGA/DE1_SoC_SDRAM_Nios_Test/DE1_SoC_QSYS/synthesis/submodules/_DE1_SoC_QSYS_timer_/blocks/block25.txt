Comment: 
The block initiates the start of a counter based on an input strobe signal. By using a simple continuous assignment statement, the `do_start_counter` control signal is directly assigned the value of the `start_strobe` input, indicating that the counter should begin counting when the strobe signal is active. To understand the exact triggering conditions and scope of the counter, further examination of related code and context is necessary.
