    "block_comment": "This block is a multiplexer selecting and outputting values based on an address input. The output, `read_mux_out`, depends on the `address` value: at address 2, it outputs `period_l_register`; at address 3, `period_h_register`; at address 4, the lower 16 bits of `snap_read_value`; at address 5, the upper 16 bits of `snap_read_value`; at address 1, `control_register`; and at address 0, a combination of the `counter_is_running` and `timeout_occurred` signals. The selection is implemented using bitwise operations where each address corresponds to a mask that, when matched, uses a bitwise AND operation to select the specific register or value to output."
