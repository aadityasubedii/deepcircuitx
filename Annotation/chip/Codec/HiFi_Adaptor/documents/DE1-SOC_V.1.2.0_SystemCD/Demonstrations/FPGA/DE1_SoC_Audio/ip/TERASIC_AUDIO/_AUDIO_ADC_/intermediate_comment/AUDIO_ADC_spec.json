    "spec": "Module name: AUDIO_ADC. Module specification: The AUDIO_ADC module is designed to interface with an audio Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) by converting serial audio data into a parallel format and storing it into a FIFO buffer. The module operates under input ports including the main system clock 'clk', an active high 'reset', a 'read' signal for FIFO data read operations, 'clear' for clearing FIFO contents, a bit clock 'bclk' for data synchronization, an audio data word select 'adclrc' to differentiate audio channels, and 'adcdat' for serial audio data input. Output ports consist of 'readdata' delivering data from the FIFO, 'empty' indicating FIFO status, and 'adcfifo_full' showing if the FIFO is full. Internal signals such as 'bit_index', 'valid_bit', 'reg_adc_left', 'reg_adc_serial_data', 'adcfifo_writedata', 'adcfifo_write', 'wait_one_clk', and 'is_left_ch' are utilised for processing data bits, managing FIFO operations, and tracking channel states. The module includes blocks responsible for data management with specific roles: resetting conditions, identifying channel changes, shifting data bits, managing FIFO writes, and interfacing with the 'audio_fifo' which handles data buffering and retrieval operations based on the FIFO principle.",

It converts the serial audio data input from the ADC (from the 'adcdat' input) into a parallel format and stores this data into a FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer. The module operates by synchronizing with the 'bclk' (bit clock) and 'adclrc' (audio data word select) signals to identify and align the left and right audio channels. It processes the incoming serial data bit by bit, storing complete audio samples into the FIFO whenever a sample is fully received and the FIFO is not full. The FIFO's outputs are then made available as 'readdata' when read operations are signaled. The module handles resets via the 'reset' and 'clear' inputs to reinitialize internal states and clear FIFO content respectively. This design is typically used in digital audio processing systems where audio data needs to be captured and buffered for further processing."
