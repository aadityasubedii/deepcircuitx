Module-level comment: The altera_reset_synchronizer synchronizes an asynchronous reset signal to a clock, preventing metastability. It uses a parameter-controlled mechanism where, if ASYNC_RESET is enabled, an incoming reset instantaneously sets an internal shift register, aligning the signal with the clock through consecutive stages determined by DEPTH. With ASYNC_RESET disabled, the shift register directly assimilates and aligns each reset signal at clock edges, treating it as already synchronized.
