When the input reset is de-asserted (low), it synchronously resets a 22-bit counter (Cont) and all output reset signals to 0. As the clock cycles, the counter increments until it reaches a predefined maximum (22'h3FFFFF). The output reset signals are then individually set to high at staggered counter thresholds: oRST_0 goes high when the counter is beyond 22'h1FFFFF, oRST_1 after 22'h2FFFFF, and oRST_2 after reaching the maximum. This creates a sequence of delayed reset outputs which can be used to control the start-up behavior of other parts of a larger system in a controlled, phased manner."

It plays a critical role in the timing and sequencing of the output reset signals. When the external reset input (iRST) is low, this counter is synchronously reset to 0, ensuring the module starts from a known state.
