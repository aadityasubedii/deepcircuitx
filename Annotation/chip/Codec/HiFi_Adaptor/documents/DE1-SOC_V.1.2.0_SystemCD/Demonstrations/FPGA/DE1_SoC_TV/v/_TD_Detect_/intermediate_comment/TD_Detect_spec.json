    "spec": "Module name: TD_Detect. Module specification: The TD_Detect module is crafted to identify the type of video signal (either NTSC or PAL) based on the input vertical (iTD_VS) and horizontal synchronization (iTD_HS) signals from a video source. It operates with three inputs: iTD_VS and iTD_HS, which are the vertical and horizontal synchronization signals respectively, and iRST_N, a reset signal that when low, resets the module\u2019s internal states and counters. The outputs of the module include oTD_Stable, which indicates if a stable video signal has been detected, and oNTSC and oPAL, which specify whether the detected signal conforms to NTSC or PAL standards respectively. Internally, the module utilizes a set of registers (NTSC, PAL, Pre_VS) and a counter (Stable_Cont). The Pre_VS register is used to store the previous state of iTD_VS to detect rising edges, and the Stable_Cont counts the cycles between such edges. These internal signals help evaluate whether the incoming video conforms to NTSC or PAL standards by comparing the count of vertical synchronization pulses between horizontal synchronization pulses against predefined thresholds. The module primarily consists of an initialization block triggered on the negative edge of iRST_N, which resets all internal states, and a detection block which operates on the positive edge of iTD_HS. This detection block manages synchronization signal transitions, counters updates, and the setting of NTSC or PAL flags based on the counted cycles, ultimately determining the type and stability of the video signal.",

When the module detects a rising edge on the iTD_HS signal or a low level on the iRST_N reset signal, it performs operations to determine the stability and type of the video signal. The oTD_Stable output is set high if either NTSC or PAL format is detected as stable. The oNTSC and oPAL outputs specifically indicate whether the signal conforms to the NTSC or PAL standards, respectively, based on the count of vertical synchronization pulses detected between horizontal synchronization pulses.

It is set when the count of vertical synchronization pulses (kept by Stable_Cont) measured between horizontal synchronization pulses falls within a specific range indicative of the NTSC format.\n  \n- PAL: Similar to the NTSC register, this register indicates whether the detected video signal conforms to PAL standards. It is set based on a different range of count values in Stable_Cont, specific to the PAL format.\n  \n- Pre_VS: This register holds the previous state of the vertical synchronization signal (iTD_VS). It is used to detect transitions in this signal from low to high, which are critical for timing measurements that determine the video standard.\n  \n- Stable_Cont: This is an 8-bit counter used to count the number of cycle intervals between successive high transitions in the vertical synchronization signal iTD_VS. This counter is incremented on each cycle where the iTD_VS is low and is reset when iTD_VS transitions to high.
