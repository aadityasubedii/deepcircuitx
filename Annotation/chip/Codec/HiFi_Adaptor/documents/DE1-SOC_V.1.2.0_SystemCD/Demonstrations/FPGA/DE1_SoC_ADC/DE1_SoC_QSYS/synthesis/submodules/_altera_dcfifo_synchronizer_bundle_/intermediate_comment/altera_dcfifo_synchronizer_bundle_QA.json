Each bit of the input signal is processed by instantiating a standard synchronizer component `altera_std_synchronizer` for each bit. The parameter `WIDTH` determines the number of bits in the input and output signals, while `DEPTH` specifies the depth of synchronization stages used in the standard synchronizer for each bit to mitigate metastability issues. The operation is clocked by a signal `clk` and it includes a reset function governed by `reset_n`. This is achieved through a generate and loop structure cycling through each bit of the input `din` and applying synchronization, ultimately outputting to `dout`."

It provides the timing signal for synchronization operations.\n- **reset_n**: This is the active-low reset input. It is used to initialize or reset the internal state of the synchronizers in the module, ensuring they start in a known state.\n- **din**: This is the digital input signal, consisting of multiple bits (defined by the parameter WIDTH). Each bit of this signal will be synchronized from one clock domain to another within the module.\n\nOutput ports: dout. \nExplanation: \n- **dout**: This is the digital output signal. It is the synchronized version of the input signal `din`. Its structure is similar to `din`, containing the same number of bits (also defined by WIDTH).
