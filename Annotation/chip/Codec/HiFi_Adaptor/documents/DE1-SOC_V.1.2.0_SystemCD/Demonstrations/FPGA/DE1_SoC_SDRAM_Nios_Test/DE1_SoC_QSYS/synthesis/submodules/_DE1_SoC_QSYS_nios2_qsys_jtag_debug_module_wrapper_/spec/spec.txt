Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_wrapper.
Module specification: This module encompasses the functionality necessary for JTAG debugging within a NIOS II system implemented on a DE1-SoC FPGA. It handles data and control flows essential for sophisticated debugging operations. Input ports include MonDReg and break_readreg for handling monitoring and debug data; clk, a clock input; multiple dbrk_hit#_latch signals indicating breakpoint hits; debugack for acknowledging debug mode; multiple monitoring and reset signals (monitor_error, monitor_ready, reset_n, resetlatch); tracemem_on, tracemem_trcdata, and tracemem_tw for trace memory control. Outputs include jdo for JTAG Data Out, jrst_n for JTAG Reset, st_ready_test_idle signifying test or idle readiness, and a variety of take_action_# and take_no_action_# signals to control debug actions concerning breaks and memory operations. Internal signals, like jdo, sr, and various vji_# signals, manage JTAG states, data shifting, and instruction configurations. The module consists of two primary blocks: DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_tck, which manages JTAG clock, input/output data, and resetting operations; and DE1_SoC_QSYS_nios2_qsys_jtag_debug_module_sysclk, focusing on functional actions triggered by external signals and internal state control. This structure supports direct integration into broader FPGA-based systems requiring robust debugging capabilities.
