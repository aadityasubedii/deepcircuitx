It manages both IR receiving and transmitting using sub-modules IR_RECEIVE and IR_TRANSMITTER_Terasic, which handle incoming data from an IR receiver and sending data through an IR transmitter, respectively. The module also manages LED displays by converting input switch signals into hexadecimal output on seven-segment displays, indicating decoded IR data or perform operations based on switches state (ON/OFF). Additionally, the module controls and monitors other peripherals including audio, DRAM, hex displays, clock signals, and various I/O tasks, providing a comprehensive control system on a single SoC FPGA configuration."

This data is apparently encoded in some specific format, potentially HEX format, and used for display on the HEX outputs.\n- test_data: A 16-bit wide register is used internally to hold data for transmission via the IR transmitter.
