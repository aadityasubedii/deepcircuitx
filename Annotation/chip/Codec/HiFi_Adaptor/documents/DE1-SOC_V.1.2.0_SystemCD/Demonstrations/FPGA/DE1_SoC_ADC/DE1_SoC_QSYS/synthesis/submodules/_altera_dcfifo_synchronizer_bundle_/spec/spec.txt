Module name: altera_dcfifo_synchronizer_bundle. 
Module specification: The `altera_dcfifo_synchronizer_bundle` module is designed to synchronize a multi-bit digital input signal `din` across a clock domain boundary to produce a synchronized output signal `dout`. The module uses the `altera_std_synchronizer` component for each bit of the input signal, ensuring mitigation of metastability issues through parameterizable synchronization depth (`DEPTH`). It operates under the control of a clock signal `clk` and an active-low reset signal `reset_n`. The module handles input and output data via `din` and `dout` ports, both of which are vectors with a size determined by the parameter `WIDTH`. Internally, the module employs a generate loop controlled by the loop variable `i`, which iterates from 0 to `WIDTH-1` to instantiate a synchronizer for each bit of `din`, outputting the synchronized result to the corresponding bit in `dout`. This structured approach in Verilog facilitates compact and efficient synchronization of each bit of the input signal.
