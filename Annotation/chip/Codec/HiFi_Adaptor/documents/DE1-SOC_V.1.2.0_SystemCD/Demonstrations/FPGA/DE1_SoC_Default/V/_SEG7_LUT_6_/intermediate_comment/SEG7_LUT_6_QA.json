Each 4-bit segment of the input is independently decoded by instances (`u0` to `u5`) of another module (`SEG7_LUT`), which presumably converts the 4-bit binary input into 7-segment display codes. This allows the hexadecimal values presented in `iDIG` to be displayed across six 7-segment displays (`oSEG0` to `oSEG5`)."

This data represents six hexadecimal digits (as six 4-bit segments), where each segment is subsequently decoded to drive a seven-segment display.\n\nOutput ports: [oSEG0, oSEG1, oSEG2, oSEG3, oSEG4, oSEG5]. Explanation: The output ports `oSEG0` to `oSEG5` are each 7-bit wide signals. These outputs connect to six separate seven-segment displays. Each port carries the display code necessary to represent the hexadecimal digit provided to the corresponding section of the `iDIG` input. The specific decoding of each 4-bit segment of `iDIG` to the respective 7-bits output is handled by instances of another module `SEG7_LUT`. Each output `oSEG0` through `oSEG5` drives one of the six displays, showing the hexadecimal values instantaneously."
