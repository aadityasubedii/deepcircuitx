    "module": "Module-level comment: The SEG7_IF module interfaces with 7-segment displays, handling data for display control via read and write operations. It uses input controls (s_clk, s_address, s_read, s_write, s_writedata, s_reset) and outputs (s_readdata, SEG7). Internally, it processes data using base_index, write_data, read_data, and a reg_file to store segment states, supporting dynamic and configurable display control. The implementation involves synchronization on a negative clock edge with operations conditioned on reset, read, and write signals."
