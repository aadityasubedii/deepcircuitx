    "spec": "Module name: Reset_Delay. Module specification: The Reset_Delay module utilizes a clock signal input `iCLK` to generate a reset signal `oRESET` after a predefined number of clock cycles. Specifically, it features an input port `iCLK`, which is the clock signal necessary for timing the operations inside the module. The output port `oRESET` outputs a reset signal; initially, it remains low (`0`) and goes high (`1`) once the internal counter reaches a specific condition. Internally, the module employs a 20-bit register `Cont` used to count clock cycles up to a maximum of `20'hFFFFF`. The main procedural block, triggered on the positive edge of `iCLK`, checks if `Cont` has reached its maximum value. If not, `Cont` increments, and `oRESET` stays low. Once `Cont` hits its maximum, `oRESET` is set high, signaling that the delayed reset period has elapsed. This structured operation ensures a reliable reset timing mechanism which can be crucial for system stability and synchronization after an initial power-up or in other reset scenarios.",

It contains a 20-bit register `Cont` that is used to count clock cycles. On every positive edge of the clock, if `Cont` has not yet reached its maximum value (`20'hFFFFF`), it increments `Cont` by 1, and keeps the `oRESET` output at `0`. Once `Cont` reaches this maximum value, it stops incrementing and sets `oRESET` to `1`.
