It leverages input signals such as \"address\", \"chipselect\", \"clk\" (clock), and \"reset_n\" to interact with audio data and control the reading, masking, and capture of edges related to audio signal events. \n\nIt outputs an \"irq\" (interrupt request) when certain edge conditions are detected and captured, based on the input signal levels and corresponding address selections. The IRQs are masked and managed, allowing for selective interrupt handling. The module reads and processes audio input data (\"in_port\"), controls data flow with the clock signal, and manages system resets. The \"readdata\" output is mapped based on the address input to control what data or controls are being read from the module."

It is asserted when any of the edge-capture conditions are met and is masked by the corresponding bits in irq_mask.\n- readdata: A 32-bit output that carries the module\u2019s internal state or data based on the current value of the address.
