Module name: SEG7_IF. Module specification: The SEG7_IF module is designed to interface with a 7-segment display, managing data read and write operations to control the segments based on input data and control signals. The module uses input ports such as s_clk (clock signal for synchronization), s_address (specifies the segment address for operations), s_read (enables read operations), s_write (enables write operations), s_writedata (data to be written to segments), and s_reset (resets the state). The output ports include s_readdata (outputs the data read from the internal register), and SEG7 (controls the state of all display segments). Internal signals like base_index (calculates the index in the register for operations), write_data (holds data to be written into the register), read_data (holds the data to be read from the register), and reg_file (internal register that stores the state of each segment) facilitate these operations. The code contains several blocks managing reset conditions, data writing through looping and bit manipulation, and data reading. The final output to the display is determined by the active low/high configuration setting, allowing flexible control over the display appearance.
