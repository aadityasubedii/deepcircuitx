Module-level comment: The 'Sdram_PLL' module serves as a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for SDRAM timing management, utilizing an input reference clock (`refclk`) and reset signal (`rst`) to produce three variant output clocks (`outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`). Internally, it instantiates `Sdram_PLL_0002` for handling clock generation and reset functionalities, effectively managing critical timing requirements for SDRAM systems without explicit internal signals.
