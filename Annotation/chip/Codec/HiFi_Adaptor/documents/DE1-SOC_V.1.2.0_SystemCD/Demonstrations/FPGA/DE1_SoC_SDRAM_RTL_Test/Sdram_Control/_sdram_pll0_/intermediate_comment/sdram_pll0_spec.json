    "spec": "Module name: sdram_pll0.\nModule specification: The \"sdram_pll0\" module is a Verilog module designed to generate two distinct output clock signals from a single reference clock input, incorporating a locked status indication. It effectively serves as a wrapper for \"sdram_pll0_0002,\" an internally instantiated module named \"sdram_pll0_inst.\" The input ports are `refclk`, which provides the reference clock signal necessary for deriving the output clocks, and `rst`, which is utilized for resetting the phase-locked loop (PLL) within the module to ensure it initiates correctly or recovers from faults. The output ports include `outclk_0` and `outclk_1`, which are the generated clock signals from the input reference and are utilized where multiple clock domains are necessary, such as in SDRAM applications. Additionally, the `locked` output signal indicates the reliability and stability of the output clocks, turning high when the PLL is properly locked. There are no internal signals within this module as it principally functions as a pass-through or wrapper, with all signals directly interfaced with the instantiated module \"sdram_pll0_inst\". The module's code is straightforward, housing only the instantiation of \"sdram_pll0_0002\" that connects the input and output ports directly to the respective ports of the internal instance, emphasizing its simplicity and specific utility.",

It is used for generating two output clock signals from a single reference clock input, while also providing a locked signal that indicates when the output clocks are stable. The module takes a reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset signal (`rst`) as inputs, then outputs two clock signals (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`) and a status signal (`locked`) to indicate when the output clocks are stable and valid. The functionality is significant in applications involving SDRAM where different clock phases or frequencies might be needed."

It is the primary clock signal from which the output clocks are derived. Typically, it provides the timing reference needed for generating synchronized output clocks.\n- `rst`: This is the reset input to the module. It is used to reset the internal state of the PLL inside the module. When the reset is activated, it initializes or resets the configuration, ensuring the PLL starts correctly or recovers from fault conditions.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `locked`.  \nExplanation:  \n- `outclk_0` and `outclk_1`: These are the output clock signals generated by the module from the reference clock `refclk`. These clocks can have different frequencies or phases and are typically used where multiple clock domains are required, such as in SDRAM applications.\n- `locked`: This is a status output signal that indicates whether the output clocks (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`) are stable and valid. The `locked` signal typically becomes high (logic 1) when the PLL has successfully locked to the desired frequencies. This signal is crucial as it tells other parts of the system that the clocks are reliable and can be used for further operations."
