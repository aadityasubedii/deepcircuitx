Module-level comment: The `audio_nios_i2c_sda` module provides IÂ²C SDA communication for audio control on a Nios SoC. It handles bi-directional data flow using input signals like `address`, `chipselect`, and `write_n` to manage reading and writing operations. Outputs and internal states are conditionally controlled based on the clock and reset inputs, with `readdata` being selectively determined by the addressed register. The module uses `data_dir` to switch `bidir_port` between input and output modes.
