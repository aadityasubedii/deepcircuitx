Module name: RW_Test

Module specification: The RW_Test module is a Verilog design aimed at simulating a read-write test for memory or storage systems using a finite state machine (FSM) approach. The module operates based on input signals from a clock (`iCLK`), an active-low reset (`iRST_n`), and a user-triggering button (`iBUTTON`). For output, it provides signals to control memory operations (`write` and `read`), the data to be written (`writedata`), and the status of the test (`drv_status_pass`, `drv_status_fail`, `drv_status_test_complete`). It also outputs a comparator result (`same`) and the current state of the FSM (`c_state`).

The internal signals such as `pre_button` (used for edge detection on the button input), `trigger` (a pulse indicating a button press), `c_state` (the current state of the FSM), `address` (the current memory address for operations), and `writedata` (the data to be written to memory), alongside control flags `write` and `read`, assist in the module's operation. Parameters like `write_count` manage the duration for operations, and signals `max_address` and `same` are used for flow control and verification, respectively. Combinatorial paths involving `cal_data`, `y0`, `y1`, `y2`, `z`, and `y` determine the values and manipulations for writing operations based on current conditions and states.

The code structure has a main always block triggered by the clock, handling state transitions, data processing, and conditional checks. It starts with reset conditions, followed by cases of the FSM that control the sequence of memory testing through writing, verifying, and reading. Assignments manage output status flags based on the test results and control the read and write operations. Thus, RW_Test is a comprehensive implementation to verify the integrity of memory read-write operations through automated state transitions and checks, yielding indications of success, failure, or ongoing test status, enhancing debugging and verification processes for memory systems.
