Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_altpll_0.  
Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_altpll_0 is a Verilog module designed for FPGA or ASIC applications to generate multiple clock frequencies from a single reference clock using an Altera-specific PLL component. The module features input ports: 'refclk,' a reference clock signal that acts as the baseline frequency for the PLL, and 'rst,' a reset input to clear the PLL configuration. The outputs include 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1,' which provide clock frequencies of 100 MHz and 40 MHz respectively, and a 'locked' signal that indicates whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the 'refclk.' Internally, the module has signals 'fboutclk,' an unused feedback output clock, and 'fbclk,' which is tied to logic zero, signifying the absence of dynamic feedback in the PLL operation. The module utilizes an `altera_pll` block, which is parameterized to specify the clock generation requirements and connected to handle resetting, outputs, and feedback mechanisms. This setup aids in establishing different clock domains for various system components efficiently and reliably.
