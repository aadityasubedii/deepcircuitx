This is achieved through partial multiplications using two instances of the `altera_mult_add` component. The first instance multiplies the lower 16 bits of both inputs, and the second instance multiplies the upper 16 bits of the first input with the lower 16 bits of the second input. The results of these multiplications are then combined to form the final 32-bit result. The module operates with a clock (`clk`) and an active-low reset (`reset_n`). The reset signal is used to clear the multiplication operation through the active low clear signal (`mul_clr`)."
