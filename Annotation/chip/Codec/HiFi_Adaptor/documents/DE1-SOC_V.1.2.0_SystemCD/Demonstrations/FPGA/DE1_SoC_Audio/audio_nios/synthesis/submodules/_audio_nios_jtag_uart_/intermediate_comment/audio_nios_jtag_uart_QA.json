It interacts with external components or systems using Avalon interface signals. The module manages data reads and writes, handles interrupts based on FIFO buffer thresholds, and controls data flow using flags such as empty and full indicators for FIFOs. The module also implements some control functionality, such as pause handling and data availability notification, ensuring reliable data communication and synchronization with attached components."
