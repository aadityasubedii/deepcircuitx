    "module": "Module-level comment: The VGA_Audio module generates multiple output clocks for VGA and audio applications using the sub-module VGA_Audio_0002. It accepts a reference clock 'refclk' and a reset 'rst', outputting three distinct clocks and a lock status. This module acts as a wrapper, primarily routing signals to and from VGA_Audio_0002, which internally manages clock synthesis and stability."
