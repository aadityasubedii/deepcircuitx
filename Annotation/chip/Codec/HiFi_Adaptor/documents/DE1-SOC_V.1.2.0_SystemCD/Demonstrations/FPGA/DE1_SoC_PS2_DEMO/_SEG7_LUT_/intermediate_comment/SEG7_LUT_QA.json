Different segments of a 7-segment display are controlled based on this input to display the corresponding hexadecimal digit visually. The module uses a case statement within an always block, triggered by changes in iDIG, to assign the appropriate pattern to oSEG for display. Each pattern is defined using a 7-bit binary code where each bit represents a segment of the display, turning it on or off to form the numeral representation of the input hex digit."

This input is used to select which numeral is to be displayed on the 7-segment display based on the encoded patterns defined in the module.\n\nOutput ports: [oSEG]. Explanation: The output port oSEG is a 7-bit output where each bit corresponds to a specific segment of a 7-segment display (segments A to G). The logic levels (0 or 1) assigned to each bit in the oSEG determine whether a particular segment is turned on or off, thereby visually representing the hexadecimal digit received at the input iDIG on the display."

The module reads the input `iDIG` and based directly on this input, through combinational logic within a `case` statement inside the always block, it determines the value of the output `oSEG`. Thus, the logic does not utilize any intermediate internal signals or registers for storing or processing data. The input directly influences the output with defined mappings for each hexadecimal digit, showcasing a straightforward combinational logic design."
