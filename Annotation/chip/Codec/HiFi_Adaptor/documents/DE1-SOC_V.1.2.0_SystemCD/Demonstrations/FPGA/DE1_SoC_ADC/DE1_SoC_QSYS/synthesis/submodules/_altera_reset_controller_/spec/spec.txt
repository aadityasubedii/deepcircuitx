Module name: altera_reset_controller. Module specification: The 'altera_reset_controller' is a Verilog module that synchronizes up to 16 reset input signals and up to 16 reset request signals to a system clock, outputting single consolidated and stabilized reset and reset request signals. The module has input ports including `reset_in0` to `reset_in15` for the reset inputs, `reset_req_in0` to `reset_req_in15` for optional reset request inputs, and `clk` for the clock signal. It outputs `reset_out` for the synchronized reset signal and `reset_req` for the synchronized reset request signal. Internal signals such as `merged_reset` and `merged_reset_req_in` aggregate the respective reset and reset request inputs. Signals like `reset_out_pre` and `reset_req_pre` provide intermediate synchronization states. The design encompasses blocks such as reset and reset request synchronization, reset assertion delay management, and conditional adaptations for output edge behavior and request synchronization leveraging flags like `ADAPT_RESET_REQUEST` and `OUTPUT_RESET_SYNC_EDGES`. These different sections ensure the module can flexibly and reliably manage reset signals across diverse system requirements, maintain synchronization with the system clock, and minimize potential metastability issues.
