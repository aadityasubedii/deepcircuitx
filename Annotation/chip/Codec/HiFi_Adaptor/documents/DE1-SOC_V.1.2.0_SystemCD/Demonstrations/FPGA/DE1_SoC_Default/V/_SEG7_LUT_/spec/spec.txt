Module name: SEG7_LUT. Module specification: The SEG7_LUT module is a Verilog design serving as a lookup table specifically for decoding hexadecimal digits into patterns suitable for a 7-segment display. The module receives a 4-bit input through the `iDIG` port, which is capable of representing hexadecimal digits from 0 to F. This input data determines which pattern will be displayed, correlating each digit with a unique 7-segment display symbol. The output is given through the `oSEG` port, this output, consisting of 7 bits, each bit mapping directly to one segment of the 7-segment display; a '0' indicates an active segment (on), and a '1' indicates an inactive segment (off). Internally, the module utilizes a 7-bit register `oSEG` for storing the output pattern which is manipulated based on the input. The primary logic is contained within an `always` block that triggers on changes to `iDIG`. A `case` statement within this block evaluates the input and sets `oSEG` accordingly to reflect the appropriate display pattern for each hexadecimal digit. This systematic assignment ensures that each pattern output matches the respective hexadecimal input, effectively controlling what is displayed.
