It acts as a bridge that handles clock domain crossings for read and write operations in Avalon memory-mapped (MM) interfaces. The module uses FIFO buffers, namely command and response FIFOs, to manage and synchronize transactions, ensuring data integrity when moving data across domains with different clock frequencies. It handles details such as generating the correct burst counts for reads and writes, interfacing with the internal command and response signals, and managing pending read counts to prevent buffer overflows and maintain system stability."
