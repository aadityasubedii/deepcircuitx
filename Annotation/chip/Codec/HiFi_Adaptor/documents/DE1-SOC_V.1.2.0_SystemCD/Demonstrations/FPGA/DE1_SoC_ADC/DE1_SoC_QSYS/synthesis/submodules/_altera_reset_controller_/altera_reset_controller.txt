Module-level comment: The 'altera_reset_controller' synchronizes up to 16 external reset and reset request signals to a system clock, producing stable, clock-aligned output signals. It leverages internal signal merging, synchronization chains, and conditional logic blocks adjusting output behavior based on configuration parameters. This design ensures robust handling of resets across different operational scenarios, minimizing risks of metastability.
