Module-level comment: The 'img_data' module manages image data retrieval from predefined ROM in FPGA's memory, tailored for Cyclone IV E. It reads data through a 19-bit 'address' and operates synchronized with a 'clock'. Utilizing an altsyncram configured as ROM, it outputs 8-bit data via 'q'. Key configurations in altsyncram ensure ROM operation, optimized by parameters like block type, no write permissions, and specified memory size.
