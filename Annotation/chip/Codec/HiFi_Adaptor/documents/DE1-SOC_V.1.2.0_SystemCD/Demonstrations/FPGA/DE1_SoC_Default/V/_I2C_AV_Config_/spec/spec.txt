Module name: I2C_AV_Config. Module specification: The I2C_AV_Config module is designed to configure audio and video settings through the I2C protocol by utilizing a lookup table containing specific configurations. The module has two input ports: iCLK, which is the system clock that drives the timing of internal operations, and iRST_N, an active-low reset that initializes internal states. It outputs two signals: I2C_SCLK, the clock for I2C synchronization, and I2C_SDAT, a bidirectional data line for I2C communication. Internally, the module employs several signals: mI2C_CLK_DIV for dividing the input clock to generate an appropriate I2C clock, mI2C_DATA storing data for transmission, mI2C_CTRL_CLK controlling the I2C clock, mI2C_GO to trigger transmission start, mI2C_END indicating the completion of transmission, mI2C_ACK for acknowledging data reception, LUT_DATA holding configuration data from the lookup table, LUT_INDEX tracking the current entry in the table, and mSetup_ST managing the state of the configuration process. The module's operation is segmented into blocks responsible for clock division, I2C communication set up and control through an I2C_Controller instance, and lookup table management for selecting pertinent configuration data based on the current state and responses from the I2C bus. These blocks collectively enable the dynamic and controlled configuration of external audio and video settings directly via the I2C bus.
