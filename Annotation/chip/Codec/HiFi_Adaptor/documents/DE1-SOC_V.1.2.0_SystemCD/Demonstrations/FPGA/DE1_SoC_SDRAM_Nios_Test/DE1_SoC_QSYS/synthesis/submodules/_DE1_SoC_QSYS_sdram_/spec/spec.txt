Module name: DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram. Module specification: The DE1_SoC_QSYS_sdram module functions as an SDRAM controller that facilitates read and write operations to Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) using a sophisticated state machine to handle the timing and protocol required by SDRAM devices. It includes input ports such as `az_addr`, `az_be_n`, `az_cs`, `az_data`, `az_rd_n`, and `az_wr_n` for addressing, data input, control, and selecting read or write operations respectively, along with a `clk` for clock input and `reset_n` for resetting the module's states. The output ports include `za_data`, `za_valid`, and `za_waitrequest` that output the data read from SDRAM and signal data integrity and operation readiness. Signals to the SDRAM like `zs_addr`, `zs_ba`, `zs_cas_n`, and others, control the physical memory interactions. Internal signals such as `CODE`, `cmd_all`, `init_done`, `pending`, and `refresh_request` manage various operational states, status reporting, and command decoding, reflecting the dynamic control logic used for memory management. The module comprises several blocks: an initialization and refresh control state machine, explicit control for handling reads and writes via FIFO buffering mechanisms to ensure data coherency and flow control, and robust handling of memory operations with real-time decision-making based on the state of the FIFOs, memory commands, and refresh requirements. This module is crucial for reliable data storage and retrieval operations in systems requiring SDRAM.
