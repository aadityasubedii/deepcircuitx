Module name: vga_controller. 
Module specification: The 'vga_controller' module is designed for managing VGA signal timing and displaying image data by coordinating synchronization signals and data retrieval. It accepts an active-low reset input `iRST_n` and a VGA clock input `iVGA_CLK`. The module outputs two synchronization signals (`oHS` for horizontal synchronization, `oVS` for vertical synchronization) and a blanking signal `oBLANK_n` (active low) which indicates no data should be sent to the display. Color data outputs are managed through three 8-bit buses: `b_data`, `g_data`, and `r_data` for blue, green, and red components respectively. Internally, the module uses a register `ADDR` to hold the memory address of the pixel data, `bgr_data` to store the BGR color data, and `VGA_CLK_n`, a negated form of `iVGA_CLK`. Auxiliary wires like `index` and `bgr_data_raw` fetch and store raw image data. The `video_sync_generator` submodule manages the generation of the internal sync signals `cBLANK_n`, `cHS`, and `cVS`, which help in syncing and addressing calculations. Other internal operations include edge-triggered processes for updating address registers and output synchronizations based on clock and reset conditions, alongside data-fetching from memory mapped by addresses stored in `ADDR`. The module effectively mixes image data management with VGA signal requirements to facilitate proper image display timing and synchronization across VGA-compatible devices.
