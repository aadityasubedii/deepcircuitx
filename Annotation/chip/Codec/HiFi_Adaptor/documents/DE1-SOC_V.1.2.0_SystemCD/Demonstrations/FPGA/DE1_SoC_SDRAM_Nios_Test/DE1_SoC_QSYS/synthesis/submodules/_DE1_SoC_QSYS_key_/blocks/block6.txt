Comment: 
This block of code in Verilog relates to an edge capture function that's synchronised with a system clock. It implements a system reset, an enable clock and a write strobe for the edge capture system. Under reset conditions, the initial value of the edge capture system is set to logic '0'. During the positive edge of the system clock, if the clock is enabled and there's a write strobe for the edge capture system, the edge capture system is also reset to '0'. If there's a detected edge, the edge capture is set to logic '-1'.
