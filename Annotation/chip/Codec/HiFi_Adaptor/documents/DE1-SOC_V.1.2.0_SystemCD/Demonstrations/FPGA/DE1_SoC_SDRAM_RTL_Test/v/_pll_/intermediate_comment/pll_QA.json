It has inputs for a reference clock (refclk) and a reset signal (rst). It generates an output clock (outclk_0) that is a manipulated version of the reference clock, typically used for frequency synthesis or clock domain adjustments. It also outputs a 'locked' signal, indicating that the PLL's output frequency is stable and synchronized with the input reference clock.
