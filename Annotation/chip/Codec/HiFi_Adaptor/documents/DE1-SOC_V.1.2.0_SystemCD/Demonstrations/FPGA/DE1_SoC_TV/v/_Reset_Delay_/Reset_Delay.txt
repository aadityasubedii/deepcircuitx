Module-level comment: The Reset_Delay module generates staggered reset outputs (oRST_0, oRST_1, oRST_2) from an input reset (iRST) and clock (iCLK). It uses a 22-bit counter (Cont) which resets to 0 when iRST is low and increments on each clock edge otherwise. Outputs are set high at specific counter thresholds, enabling sequential system initialization. This implementation ensures a phased reset release based on predetermined counter values within a singular always block sensitive to clock and reset conditions.
