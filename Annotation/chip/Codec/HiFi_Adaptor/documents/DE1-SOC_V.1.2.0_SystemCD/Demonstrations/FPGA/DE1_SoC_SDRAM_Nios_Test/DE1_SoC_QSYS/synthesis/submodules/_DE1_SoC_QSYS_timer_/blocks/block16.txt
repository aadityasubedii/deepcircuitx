Comment: 
This block generates a write strobe signal for the period register low. It uses a logical AND operation combining the chip select signal, the negation of the write enable signal, and an address comparison to ensure that the write strobe is activated only when the specified conditions are met: chipselect is active, write operation is asserted, and the target address is 2.
