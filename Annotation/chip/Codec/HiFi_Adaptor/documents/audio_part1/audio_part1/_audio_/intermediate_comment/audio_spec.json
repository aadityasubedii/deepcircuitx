    "spec": "Module name: audio. Module specification: The \"audio\" module is designed to interface with audio data processing components, managing audio data capture from an ADC, and outputting to a DAC while synchronizing everything using various clock signals. The module's input ports include `adcdat` for receiving audio data from ADC, `swt` as a reset control, `clk` as the main clock, `bclk` as the bit clock, `adclrck` and `daclrck` for ADC and DAC latch clock controls respectively, and `sdat` as bidirectional serial data for I2C communication. The output ports are `aud_xclk` for a derived audio clock, `sclk` for the serial clock in I2C, `dacdat` as the digital audio output, and an 8-bit `gpio` for various status and control signals. Internally, the module uses signals like `sclk` and `sdat` for serial clocking and data in I2C, `ACK` for acknowledgment in I2C transactions, `ACK_enable` to enable the acknowledgment mechanism, `TRN_END` to signify the end of an I2C transmission, `ctrl_clk` as a controlled clock derived from the input clock, and `clk_div` as a register for clock division calculations. The module's code is organized into blocks including an instantiation of an `I2C_programmer` submodule for handling I2C communications, a parameter definition block for setting clock frequencies, a clock management `always` block that implements clock division for generating the `aud_xclk`, and assignments that connect internal registers and conditions to output ports reflecting the module's operation status and control.",

The module also incorporates an I2C programmer submodule, which might be used for configuring audio codec settings. To ensure precise timing and synchronization, the module generates a divided clock signal and controls it based on a clock frequency parameter versus an I2C clock frequency parameter. It checks and manages several signal states to ensure proper data handling and serialization via I2C and other interfacing techniques.
