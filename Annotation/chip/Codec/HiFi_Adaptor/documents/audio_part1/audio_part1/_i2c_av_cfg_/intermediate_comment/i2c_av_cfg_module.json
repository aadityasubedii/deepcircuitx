    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'i2c_av_cfg' module configures an I2C device using a sequence from a Look-Up Table. It is driven by a clock ('clk') and manages states with 'mstep'. The module sends configuration data from the LUT via 'i2c_data', controlled by 'mgo'. It progresses through configuration settings, updating 'LUT_index', and checks for transaction completions ('mend') and acknowledgments ('mack'). The operations are structured into two main blocks, handling synchronous state transitions and asynchronous LUT data updates."
