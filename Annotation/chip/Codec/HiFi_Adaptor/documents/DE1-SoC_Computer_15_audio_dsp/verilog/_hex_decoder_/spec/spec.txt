Module name: HexDigit. Module specification: The 'HexDigit' module is designed to interact with a 7-segment display by converting a 4-bit binary input, representing a hexadecimal digit (0-F), into a 7-bit output pattern which controls individual segments of the display. Its input port 'num' accepts a 4-bit value that serves as the hexadecimal digit to be displayed. The output port 'segs' delivers a 7-bit pattern corresponding to the segments A-G of the display, where each bit activates or deactivates a specific segment to accurately portray the hexadecimal digit on the display. Internally, the module utilizes a register 'segs' to hold and dynamically update this 7-bit pattern based on the hexadecimal input. The computational logic is primarily encapsulated within an 'always' block that triggers on changes to 'num'. This block contains a 'case' statement mapping each possible hexadecimal input to its respective segment configuration for display. This mapping ensures that digits and certain alphabetic characters are visually represented on digital screens, making the module essential for applications such as digital watches and calculators.
