    "module": "Module-level comment: The VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Char_Buffer module handles character buffering for VGA displays, managing updates and read/write operations to an altsyncram-based buffer. It processes input commands to control buffer interactions and generates corresponding output streams with signals controlling display attributes using a character ROM. The module meticulously synchronizes data transition and display updates through clock-driven state machines and dual-port memory management."
