    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_video_alpha_blender_simple. Module specification: The altera_up_video_alpha_blender_simple is a Verilog module designed to blend two sets of RGB data depending on an alpha or control bit. The module has two input ports: `background_data` (30 bits) carrying RGB components for the background (10 bits each for red, green, and blue components) and `foreground_data` (40 bits), containing an additional alpha or control bit (MSB) along with RGB data for the foreground (10 bits each for RGB). Depending on the control bit in `foreground_data`, either the foreground or background colors are selected for output. The outputs of the module are `new_red`, `new_green`, and `new_blue` (each 10 bits), which provide the blended RGB values as determined by the control bit. Internally, this module does not define or utilize any additional signals; it directly computes outputs using conditional assignment operations. These operations essentially utilize bitwise AND and bitwise NOT operations to select between foreground and background color channels based on the state of the control bit in `foreground_data`. This module is efficiently structured in a straightforward manner without internal blocks or intermediate computations, focusing directly on the conditional assignments for the output color blending.",

The module checks the most significant bit (MSB) of the `foreground_data` to determine if the foreground or background color should be displayed. If the MSB of `foreground_data` (indicating an alpha or control signal) is high, the foreground color is used; otherwise, the background color is displayed.
