Module name: altera_up_avalon_video_vga_timing. 

Module specification: The `altera_up_avalon_video_vga_timing` module is designed to generate and manage VGA timing signals for driving a VGA display, handling synchronization and color data input processing. It accepts inputs through `clk` (clock signal), `reset` (resets internal states), `red_to_vga_display`, `green_to_vga_display`, `blue_to_vga_display` (color inputs for red, green, and blue data), and `color_select` (selects color outputs). The module outputs include `read_enable` (enables data reading), synchronization signals (`vga_h_sync`, `vga_v_sync`, `vga_c_sync`), signals for end of active video frame and complete frame (`end_of_active_frame`, `end_of_frame`), and VGA color outputs (`vga_red`, `vga_green`, `vga_blue`, `vga_color_data`). Internally, the module uses counters like `pixel_counter` and `line_counter` to track positions within a frame, and pulses such as `hsync_pulse`, `vsync_pulse`, and `blanking_pulse` to control synchronization and blanking intervals. The code features blocks for resetting states, updating VGA output signals based on blanking conditions, managing pixel and line counting, and controlling synchronization pulses, combining to systematically output aligned VGA signals regarding both timing and color data for video displays.
