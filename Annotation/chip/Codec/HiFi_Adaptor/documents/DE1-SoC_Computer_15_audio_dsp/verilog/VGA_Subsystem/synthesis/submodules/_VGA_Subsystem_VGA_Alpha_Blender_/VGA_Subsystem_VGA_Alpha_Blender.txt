Module-level comment: The VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Alpha_Blender module blends foreground and background VGA video streams. It processes input streams with synchronization signals and outputs a blended video stream. The module uses internal synchronization signals and an alpha_blender component for color blending based on the validity and synchronization state of input data, ensuring the output is correct and timely.
