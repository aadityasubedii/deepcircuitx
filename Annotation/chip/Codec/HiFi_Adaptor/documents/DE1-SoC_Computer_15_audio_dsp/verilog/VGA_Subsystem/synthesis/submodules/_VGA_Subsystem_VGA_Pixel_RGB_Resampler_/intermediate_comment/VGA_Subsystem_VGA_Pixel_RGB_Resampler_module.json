    "module": "Module-level comment: The VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Pixel_RGB_Resampler module converts low bit-width RGB pixel data to a higher bit-width format synchronized via a clock. It responds to control signals marking packet boundaries and data validity. Inside, r, g, b, and a channels are expanded and assembled into an output data stream, managed through conditional logic in synchronous blocks concerning input data readiness and reset conditions."
