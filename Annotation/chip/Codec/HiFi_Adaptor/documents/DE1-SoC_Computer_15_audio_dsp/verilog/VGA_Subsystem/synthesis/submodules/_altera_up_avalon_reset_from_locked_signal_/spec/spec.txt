Module name: altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal. Module specification: The `altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal` module is designed to generate a reset signal based on the inversion of the input signal 'locked'. The input port 'locked' is typically connected to a phase-locked loop (PLL) or other synchronization mechanism and indicates whether the input clock is stable. The sole output port 'reset' is generated by directly inverting the 'locked' signal, meaning that it will be high (true) when 'locked' is low (false), providing a reset signal for system components during unstable or unlocked clock conditions. The module does not use any internal signals, as it performs a straightforward inversion operation. The Verilog code consists of the module declaration, input and output port declarations, and a simple assignment statement that defines the relationship between 'locked' and 'reset'. This makes the module compact and efficient for use in systems requiring reset functionality dictated by clock stability.
