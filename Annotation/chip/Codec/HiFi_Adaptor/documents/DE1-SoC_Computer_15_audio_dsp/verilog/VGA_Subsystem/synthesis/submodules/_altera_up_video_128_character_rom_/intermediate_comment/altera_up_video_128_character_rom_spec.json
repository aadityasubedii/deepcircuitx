Module specification: The 'altera_up_video_128_character_rom' module is designed for generating pixel data for character display in video applications. It utilizes a character ROM, fetching data based on character code and pixel coordinates provided. The module takes five input signals: 'clk' (clock) which synchronizes operations, 'clk_en' (clock enable) which conditions the clock triggering on data processing, 'character' (7-bit character code) that determines which character's data to fetch, 'x_coordinate' and 'y_coordinate' (3-bit each) which select the specific pixel within the character grid. The sole output, 'character_data', delivers the pixel state (on/off) for the specified character and position. An internal signal, 'character_address' (13-bit), is formulated by concatenating the 'character', 'y_coordinate' and 'x_coordinate' to address the ROM block precisely. Within the module, an 'altsyncram' block acts as the character data ROM, configured to operate in ROM mode with a setup specified by a series of parameters, determining aspects like device compatibility and operational modality. This block fetches the stored font data based on 'character_address' provided, outputting the result through 'character_data'. This module is fundamental in controlling pixel data output for rendering specific characters on a display.",

It synchronizes the internal operations of the module.\n- **clk_en** (clock enable): This signal enables the operation of the clock, allowing data to be processed only when the clk_en is high. It helps in controlling the operations to specific clock cycles, thus saving power and managing the flow effectively.\n- **character** (7-bit): This input specifies the character code. It's used to identify which character's data needs to be fetched from the ROM.\n- **x_coordinate** and **y_coordinate** (3-bit each): These specify the pixel coordinates within the character cell. They are used to select the specific row (y_coordinate) and bit position within that row (x_coordinate) for the desired character, thus pinpointing the exact pixel data to be fetched.\n\n**Output ports**: character_data.\n**Explanation**:\n- **character_data**: This output port provides the pixel data for the specified character and pixel coordinates. It indicates whether the pixel is on or off (i.e., binary 1 or 0) for given coordinates in the selected character, as fetched from the character ROM. This binary output can be directly used to control pixel states (on/off) in a video display application."

This concatenated address points to the specific location in the ROM where the relevant pixel data for the requested character and coordinate is stored. This address is then used to access the ROM to retrieve the character_data, which is the pixel's binary state (on or off) for the given character at the specified position.
