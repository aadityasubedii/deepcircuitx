    "module": "Module-level comment: The VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Dual_Clock_FIFO is a dual-clock FIFO designed for VGA subsystems, synchronizing data between different clock domains. It uses input/output ports for data handling and control signals, and a `dcfifo` component configured for optimal speed and size, managing data flow with internal signals like `fifo_wr_used` and `fifo_empty` to control buffer status and transfers."
