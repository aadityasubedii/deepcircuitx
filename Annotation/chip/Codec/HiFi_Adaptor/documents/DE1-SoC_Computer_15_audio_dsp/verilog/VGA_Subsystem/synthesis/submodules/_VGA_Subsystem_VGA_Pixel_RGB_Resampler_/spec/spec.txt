Module name: VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Pixel_RGB_Resampler.
Module specification: The VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Pixel_RGB_Resampler is designed for resampling RGB pixel data, particularly converting a low bit-width input RGB format to a higher bit-width output. The module synchronizes with a clock signal and manages data based on multiple input and output streams, obeying a reset condition. Input ports include the clock (clk), reset, and the RGB pixel data stream itself (stream_in_data) along with additional control signals such as stream_in_startofpacket, stream_in_endofpacket, stream_in_empty, and stream_in_valid, which manage packet boundaries and data validity. The corresponding outputs are stream_in_ready, stream_out_data, stream_out_startofpacket, stream_out_endofpacket, stream_out_empty, and stream_out_valid; these outputs mirror input functionalities and signal downstream readiness and data validity. Internally, the module uses signals r, g, b for the respective red, green, and blue pixel components, and a, holding a constant alpha value. These are extracted and scaled from the input data to form the expanded RGB outputs. Another internal signal, converted_data, consolidates these color components into the resampled output stream. The code includes mainly a synchronous block, triggered by the rising edge of the clock, responsible for resetting outputs to default states or updating them based on the resampling logic and control signals. Additional assignments outside this block handle the conditional readiness of the module to accept new data and the specific color bit manipulations needed to convert the input pixel data format to the desired output format.
