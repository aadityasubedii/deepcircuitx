Module name: altera_reset_controller. 
Module specification: The 'altera_reset_controller' is a Verilog module designed to handle and synchronize various reset signals and requests in FPGA designs. This module consolidates up to 16 external reset inputs (`reset_in0` to `reset_in15`) and up to 16 reset request inputs (`reset_req_in0` to `reset_req_in15`), manages their synchronization through parameterized settings, and outputs a single synchronized reset signal and a reset request signal. Input `clk` serves as the system clock against which resets are synchronized to avoid metastability issues. The outputs include `reset_out` and `reset_req`, which are the synchronized signals processed from the combined input conditions. Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `merged_reset` to combine all reset inputs and `merged_reset_req_in` for combined reset requests. Synchronization logic often involves multiple instances of an internal module `altera_reset_synchronizer`, adjusting synchronization depth based on configurations. Furthermore, the module contains multiple internal registers and conditional constructs (`generate`, `case` statements) to handle advanced configurations like minimum reset assertion time and adaptive reset request processing. The module efficiently manages configurable, dynamically adjustable reset synchronization and assertion, catering to various operational requirements of FPGA-based systems.
