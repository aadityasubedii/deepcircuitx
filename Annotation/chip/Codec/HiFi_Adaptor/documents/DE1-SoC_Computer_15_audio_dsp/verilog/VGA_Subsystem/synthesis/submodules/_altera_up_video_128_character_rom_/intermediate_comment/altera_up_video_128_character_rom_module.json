    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'altera_up_video_128_character_rom' module generates pixel data for video displays by referencing a ROM configured for character data. It inputs character codes and pixel positions, processes them through internal logic to form a ROM address, and retrieves the corresponding pixel data using an 'altsyncram' configured as ROM. This setup ensures synchronized, coordinate-specific character display on video outputs."
