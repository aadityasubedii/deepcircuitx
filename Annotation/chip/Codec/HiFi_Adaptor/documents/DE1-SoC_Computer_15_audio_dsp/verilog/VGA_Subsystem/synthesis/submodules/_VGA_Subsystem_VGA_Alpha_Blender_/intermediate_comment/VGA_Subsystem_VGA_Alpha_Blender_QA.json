It takes input data streams for both the background and foreground, including start and end of packet signals, and outputs blended video data. The module uses an instance of an alpha blending component (`altera_up_video_alpha_blender_normal`) to compute the blended red, green, and blue color values based on the input data. It manages data synchronization and valid signal generation to ensure that the video streams are combined correctly, considering start and end of packet conditions. Output signals include blended video data, packet control signals, and an indication of when the output is valid."

These ensure correct packet data handling and synchronization.\n- `output_ready` signals whether the output module can accept more output data, ensuring proper flow control.\n\nOutput ports: \n- `background_ready`: Indicates the module can accept more background data.\n- `foreground_ready`: Indicates the module can accept more foreground data.\n- `output_data`: The blended output video data.\n- `output_startofpacket`: Indicates the start of a blended output packet.\n- `output_endofpacket`: Indicates the end of a blended output packet.\n- `output_empty`: Indicates the number of empty/unused bytes in the current output data word.\n- `output_valid`: Indicates that the output data is valid.\n\nExplanation: \n- `background_ready` and `foreground_ready` are readiness signals indicating if the module is able to accept more data from the respective streams, which helps in managing the data flow efficiently.\n- `output_data` and associated signals (`startofpacket`, `endofpacket`, `empty`, `valid`) manage the output video stream with blended foreground and background data.

They are computed within the alpha_blender component and represent the color values that will be passed on as part of the `output_data`.\n\n- `sync_foreground`: This signal is used to handle synchronization discrepancies primarily driven by differences in `startofpacket` and `endofpacket` signals between the foreground and background data inputs. When the foreground video is ready but out of sync with the background (e.g., foreground starts or ends a packet while the respective start or end does not align with the background), this signal ensures that data handling and output remain consistent.\n  \n- `sync_background`: Similar to `sync_foreground`, this signal manages synchronization but focuses on scenarios where the background stream is ready and out of sync with the foreground stream. It ensures that the foreground and background video streams are smartly managed, so one does not advance while the other remains in an inconsistent state.\n\n- `valid`: This is a crucial control signal that determines when output data should be regarded as valid and hence be forwarded further in the video pipeline. The `valid` signal is asserted only if both foreground and background data are valid and neither are in a state of synchronization conflict as indicated by `sync_foreground` or `sync_background`. This setup ensures that the output is stable and valid only when appropriate, avoiding corrupt or partial data streams from propagating."
