It handles the reading of pixel data from a buffer memory and outputs it as a stream of pixel data. The module controls the reading process based on the state of FIFO (First In, First Out) buffers and the availability of the master memory interface. It supports functions such as address calculation for pixel data, buffer swapping, and synchronization between reading and sending pixel data. The design aims to maintain efficient pixel data flow for display purposes by dynamically controlling the read and write processes based on buffer states and external signals."
