    "spec": "Module name: VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL.\nModule specification: The VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL is a Verilog module designed to function as a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for a Video Graphics Array (VGA) subsystem. This module takes two input signals: `ref_clk_clk`, which serves as the reference clock driving the PLL and `ref_reset_reset`, a reset signal that initializes or resets the PLL in fault conditions. It produces two output signals: `vga_clk_clk`, a clock signal tailored for VGA operations derived from the reference clock through the PLL, and `reset_source_reset`, a reset signal synchronized with the VGA clock indicating the PLL's lock status and ensuring stable and synchronized reset behavior in VGA operations. Internally, the module uses a signal called `video_pll_locked_export` to monitor the lock status of the PLL. This locked status is crucial as it drives the reset synchronization mechanism in the module. The code includes two primary blocks: the `VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL_video_pll` specifically configured to generate the VGA clock and track the PLL lock status; and the `altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal` that utilizes the PLL's lock status to issue resets synchronized with the PLL's stability. This organized structure ensures that the VGA display operations maintain consistent timing with reliable reset conditions.",

It takes a reference clock (`ref_clk_clk`) and a reset signal (`ref_reset_reset`) as inputs. The module generates a VGA-specific clock signal (`vga_clk_clk`) and a corresponding reset signal (`reset_source_reset`). Inside the module, a PLL component (`VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL_video_pll`) is used to generate multiple clock outputs, although only one (`vga_clk_clk`) is designated for use in this specific instance. The PLL's lock status is output to a reset module (`altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal`), which ensures that the reset signal associated with the VGA clock is properly synchronized and conditioned based on the PLL's lock status. This setup is crucial for stable video output timing in VGA applications."
