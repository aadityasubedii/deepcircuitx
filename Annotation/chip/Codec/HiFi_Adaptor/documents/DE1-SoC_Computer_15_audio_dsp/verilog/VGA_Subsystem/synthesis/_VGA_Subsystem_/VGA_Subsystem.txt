Module-level comment: The VGA_Subsystem manages video output for VGA displays by integrating sub-modules such as a VGA controller, character buffer, pixel DMA, alpha blender, and various FIFOs. It processes and streams video data through controlled interfacing of these sub-modules, handling input configurations, clock management, and synchronization for efficient video display on hardware devices.
