Module name: VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL.
Module specification: The VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL is a Verilog module designed to function as a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for a Video Graphics Array (VGA) subsystem. This module takes two input signals: `ref_clk_clk`, which serves as the reference clock driving the PLL and `ref_reset_reset`, a reset signal that initializes or resets the PLL in fault conditions. It produces two output signals: `vga_clk_clk`, a clock signal tailored for VGA operations derived from the reference clock through the PLL, and `reset_source_reset`, a reset signal synchronized with the VGA clock indicating the PLL's lock status and ensuring stable and synchronized reset behavior in VGA operations. Internally, the module uses a signal called `video_pll_locked_export` to monitor the lock status of the PLL. This locked status is crucial as it drives the reset synchronization mechanism in the module. The code includes two primary blocks: the `VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL_video_pll` specifically configured to generate the VGA clock and track the PLL lock status; and the `altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal` that utilizes the PLL's lock status to issue resets synchronized with the PLL's stability. This organized structure ensures that the VGA display operations maintain consistent timing with reliable reset conditions.
