It takes a reference clock input and generates three different output clocks, along with a locked signal indicating the PLL has successfully synchronized to the input reference clock. The PLL is set with specific frequencies for each output and includes settings for phase shifts and duty cycles, though the phase shifts are all set to zero and the duty cycles to 50 percent in this configuration. This setup might be used to generate clocks needed for different video processing tasks within a VGA subsystem."

This clock typically originates from a stable, fixed-frequency source.\n- `rst` is the reset input that, when asserted, initializes or resets the PLL circuitry, effectively resetting its state and output clocks.\n\nOutput ports: outclk_0, outclk_1, outclk_2, locked.\nExplanation:\n- `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, and `outclk_2` are the output clock signals generated by the PLL. These clocks are derived from the reference clock (`refclk`) and are configured with specific frequencies relevant to the VGA subsystem's requirements. For instance, `outclk_0` and `outclk_1` are both set to 25.0 MHz, which might be suitable for specific video processing or display tasks.\n- `locked` is a status output that indicates whether the PLL has successfully synchronized its output to the input reference clock. A high signal (logic '1') on `locked` typically means that the PLL is correctly synchronized and stable, providing reliable clock outputs."
