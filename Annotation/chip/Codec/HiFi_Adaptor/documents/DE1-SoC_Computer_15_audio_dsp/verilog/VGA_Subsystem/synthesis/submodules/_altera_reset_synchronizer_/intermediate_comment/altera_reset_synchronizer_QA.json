It uses a shift register, `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain`, parameterized by `DEPTH`, to delay the reset signal to ensure it is synchronized with the system's clock, `clk`. The parameter `ASYNC_RESET` determines the behavior of the reset signal: if `ASYNC_RESET` is enabled (set to 1), the reset signal is immediately set high for the entire chain when the `reset_in` signal is asserted. Conversely, when `ASYNC_RESET` is disabled (set to 0), the input reset signal, `reset_in`, is propagated through the shift register on each clock edge. The output, `reset_out`, is controlled to either immediately reflect the input reset or a delayed version based on this shift register, effectively synchronizing the reset signal to the clock."

It outputs a reset signal that has been adjusted by either immediate assertion or delayed propagation through a shift register, such that it is synchronized to the rising edge of the clock signal, `clk`.

It is used to delay the propagation of the reset signal through successive clock cycles, managing how the reset signal is adjusted to be in sync with the clock.\n\n- `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out`: This register holds the final output of the shift register chain, representing the synchronized reset signal.
