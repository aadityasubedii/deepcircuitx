It consists of inputs `background_data` and `foreground_data`, where each input carries color information separated into RGB components. The module checks the most significant bit (MSB) of the `foreground_data` to determine if the foreground or background color should be displayed. If the MSB of `foreground_data` (indicating an alpha or control signal) is high, the foreground color is used; otherwise, the background color is displayed.
