Module-level comment: The altera_up_video_alpha_blender_normal module blends foreground and background colors based on alpha transparency. It takes 30-bit background RGB and 40-bit foreground RGB with alpha, producing new 10-bit RGB outputs. Internally, it uses LPM multipliers to compute RGB products with the alpha and its complement, achieving color mixing with configurable transparency, optimized for speed using LPM configurations.
