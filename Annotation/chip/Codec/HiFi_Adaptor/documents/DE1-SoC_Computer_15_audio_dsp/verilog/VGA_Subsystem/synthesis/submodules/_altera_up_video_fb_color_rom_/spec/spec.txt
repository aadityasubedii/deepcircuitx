Module name: altera_up_video_fb_color_rom. Module specification: The `altera_up_video_fb_color_rom` module serves as a color lookup table specialized for video frame buffer applications, utilizing a read-only memory constructed using the `altsyncram` component. It inputs a `clk` (clock) signal which drives synchronous ROM operations, a `clk_en` (clock enable) signal that activates ROM reading capabilities when high, and a `color_index` (4-bit), which acts as an address to fetch specific color data entries from the ROM. The outputs of the module are `red`, `green`, and `blue` (each 10-bit), which represent the respective RGB color components derived from the ROM based on the current `color_index`. An internal 30-bit wide wire `color_data` holds the combined RGB color data fetched from the ROM. The Verilog configuration uses `defparam` to specify important firmware specific parameters such as the initialization file, the device model, and memory settings among others. Key blocks in the code include the instantiation of the `altsyncram` module configured for ROM operation, defining each port's functionality, and the splitting of `color_data` to provide RGB outputs. This setup is tightly integrated into the realm of FPGA design specific to Altera's hardware, catering to efficient and synchronously-timed fetch operations required in video processing.
