    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_up_video_fb_color_rom` module acts as a color lookup table for video applications, mapping a 4-bit `color_index` to 10-bit RGB outputs using a ROM implemented with `altsyncram`. It is synchronized by `clk` and `clk_en`, where `color_data` carries the RGB values split into outputs as `red`, `green`, and `blue`. Configurations in `defparam` specify ROM properties and device specifics for optimized performance on Cyclone II FPGA."
