    "module": "Module-level comment: The VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL_video_pll module serves as a PLL for VGA applications, generating three output clocks from a single reference clock. Inputs include a reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset (`rst`). Outputs are three specific frequency clocks (`outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`) and a lock status (`locked`). It achieves this through direct instantiation and configuration of an `altera_pll` block, specifying frequencies, phases, and duty cycles suitable for video processing tasks."
