If 'locked' is high (true), the reset output is low (false), and if 'locked' is low (false), the reset output is high (true), effectively creating a negative logic reset signal derived from the 'locked' input."

Explanation: The 'locked' input is a signal typically coming from a phase-locked loop (PLL) or another synchronization mechanism. It indicates whether the input clock is in a stable and locked condition with the required frequency and phase.\n\nOutput ports: reset. Explanation: The 'reset' output is generated based on the inverted state of the 'locked' input. This output actively goes high (true) when 'locked' is low (false), serving as a reset signal that can be used to reset other components or modules in the system. This ensures that the associated components are reset when the input clock isn't stable or locked."

The use of internal signals is not required in this module as it performs a straightforward inversion operation to generate the reset signal."
