The blending calculation takes into account the alpha value and its complement ('one_minus_alpha') to determine the strength of the foreground and background colors in the final mix. The module utilizes several LPM (Library of Parameterized Modules) multiplication operations to compute the products of RGB values with the alpha and its complement. The resulting pixel color values (new_red, new_green, new_blue) are a combination of these computed products, effectively merging the two images with controllable transparency."

For this specific instance, the RGB values are used in the blending process.\n- `foreground_data` (40-bit): This input comprises RGB values along with an alpha channel value that describes the transparency level of the foreground image pixel. The alpha value (most significant 10 bits) controls how the blending of foreground and background colors is weighted.\n\nOutput ports: new_red, new_green, new_blue.\nExplanation: \n- `new_red` (10-bit), `new_green` (10-bit), `new_blue` (10-bit): These outputs represent the blended RGB values resulting from the module's computations. The final color of a pixel displayed is determined by combining the weighted contributions of both background and foreground data based on the alpha value.
