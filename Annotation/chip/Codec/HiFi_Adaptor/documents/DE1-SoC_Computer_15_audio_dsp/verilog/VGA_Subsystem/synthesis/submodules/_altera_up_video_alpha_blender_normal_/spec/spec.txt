Module name: altera_up_video_alpha_blender_normal. 

Module specification: The altera_up_video_alpha_blender_normal module performs color blending between a foreground image and a background image using alpha blending techniques. The input ports include `background_data` (30-bit) which contains RGB values of the background image pixel, and `foreground_data` (40-bit) that comprises RGB values alongside an alpha channel value dictating the transparency level of the foreground image pixel. The output ports are `new_red`, `new_green`, and `new_blue` (each 10-bit), representing the computed RGB values post-blending. The module uses internal signals such as `one_minus_a` (10-bit) to represent the complement of the alpha value. Additionally, signals like `r_x_alpha`, `g_x_alpha`, `b_x_alpha`, `r_x_one_minus_alpha`, `g_x_one_minus_alpha`, and `b_x_one_minus_alpha` (each 18-bit) are used to store interim products of RGB values multiplied by the alpha channel and its complement, affecting the blending strength. Within the module, several LPM multiplication instances (`lpm_mult`) are employed to perform the product computations, configured for optimization towards speed with parameters like `lpm_hint` set to "MAXIMIZE_SPEED=5". Each multiplier is responsible for a specific color channel calculation either with the alpha value or its complement, ultimately leading to the blended outputs. This arrangement ensures precision in color mixing, allowing for varied transparency effects in composite images.
