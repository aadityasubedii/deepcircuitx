Module name: altera_up_video_128_character_rom. Module specification: The 'altera_up_video_128_character_rom' module is designed for generating pixel data for character display in video applications. It utilizes a character ROM, fetching data based on character code and pixel coordinates provided. The module takes five input signals: 'clk' (clock) which synchronizes operations, 'clk_en' (clock enable) which conditions the clock triggering on data processing, 'character' (7-bit character code) that determines which character's data to fetch, 'x_coordinate' and 'y_coordinate' (3-bit each) which select the specific pixel within the character grid. The sole output, 'character_data', delivers the pixel state (on/off) for the specified character and position. An internal signal, 'character_address' (13-bit), is formulated by concatenating the 'character', 'y_coordinate' and 'x_coordinate' to address the ROM block precisely. Within the module, an 'altsyncram' block acts as the character data ROM, configured to operate in ROM mode with a setup specified by a series of parameters, determining aspects like device compatibility and operational modality. This block fetches the stored font data based on 'character_address' provided, outputting the result through 'character_data'. This module is fundamental in controlling pixel data output for rendering specific characters on a display.
