    "spec": "Module name: VGA_Subsystem. \n\nModule specification: The VGA_Subsystem is designed to manage the display of pixel data on a VGA (Video Graphics Array) monitor by handling communication and control signals through various slave and master interfaces. This module includes input ports such as `char_buffer_control_slave` for character buffer control inputs, `char_buffer_slave` for character buffer data inputs, `pixel_dma_control_slave` for pixel DMA control inputs, and `pixel_dma_master` for DMA data transfer operations. System clocks and reset signals are also pivotal inputs, ensuring proper timing and synchronization. Output ports comprise `char_buffer_control_slave_readdata`, `char_buffer_slave_readdata`, `pixel_dma_control_slave_readdata`, alongside VGA-specific outputs like `vga_CLK`, `vga_HS`, and RGB color data outputs. Internal signals like `<connected-to-char_buffer_control_slave_address>` and `<connected-to-pixel_dma_master_read>` tie these inputs to the functional blocks handling the respective data manipulations and VGA output generation. Each internal signal is vital to directionally connect inter-modular actions and system peripherals. Finally, the code sections are organized to define each connection's bind point between system functionalities and the module's interfacial ports, crucial for integrating the VGA_Subsystem within a broader system architecture designed for efficient video data display on VGA interfaces.",

                    "text": "Module name: VGA_Subsystem. \n\nModule specification: The VGA_Subsystem is designed to manage the display of pixel data on a VGA (Video Graphics Array) monitor by handling communication and control signals through various slave and master interfaces. This module includes input ports such as `char_buffer_control_slave` for character buffer control inputs, `char_buffer_slave` for character buffer data inputs, `pixel_dma_control_slave` for pixel DMA control inputs, and `pixel_dma_master` for DMA data transfer operations. System clocks and reset signals are also pivotal inputs, ensuring proper timing and synchronization. Output ports comprise `char_buffer_control_slave_readdata`, `char_buffer_slave_readdata`, `pixel_dma_control_slave_readdata`, alongside VGA-specific outputs like `vga_CLK`, `vga_HS`, and RGB color data outputs. Internal signals like `<connected-to-char_buffer_control_slave_address>` and `<connected-to-pixel_dma_master_read>` tie these inputs to the functional blocks handling the respective data manipulations and VGA output generation. Each internal signal is vital to directionally connect inter-modular actions and system peripherals. Finally, the code sections are organized to define each connection's bind point between system functionalities and the module's interfacial ports, crucial for integrating the VGA_Subsystem within a broader system architecture designed for efficient video data display on VGA interfaces."
