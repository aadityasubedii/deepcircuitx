    "spec": "Module name: altera_reset_synchronizer. \nModule specification: \nThe `altera_reset_synchronizer` module is specifically developed for synchronizing asynchronous reset signals with a particular clock domain, thus mitigating potential metastability issues in digital circuits. The module operates on an input asynchronous reset signal, `reset_in`, and a clock signal, `clk`. It outputs a synchronized reset signal `reset_out`. Internally, the module utilizes a shift register named `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain`, which is parameterized by `DEPTH` to determine the length of the delay for the reset signal. This shift register sequentially propagates the reset signal across clock cycles, depending on the `ASYNC_RESET` parameter. If `ASYNC_RESET` is enabled, the reset signal is immediately driven high across all cells of the shift register upon assertion of `reset_in`. Conversely, if `ASYNC_RESET` is disabled, the register chain delays the propagation of the `reset_in` signal according to the clock edges. Another internal signal, `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out`, captures the delayed reset signal which is then routed to the output `reset_out`. The Verilog code is organized with a `generate if-else` block to handle the two different synchronization behaviors (`ASYNC_RESET` enabled or not), using sequential logic inside `always` blocks triggered on edge conditions. This logic effectively aligns the reset signal to the clock, ensuring stable and reliable reset operations in synchronous digital systems.",

Conversely, when `ASYNC_RESET` is disabled (set to 0), the input reset signal, `reset_in`, is propagated through the shift register on each clock edge.
