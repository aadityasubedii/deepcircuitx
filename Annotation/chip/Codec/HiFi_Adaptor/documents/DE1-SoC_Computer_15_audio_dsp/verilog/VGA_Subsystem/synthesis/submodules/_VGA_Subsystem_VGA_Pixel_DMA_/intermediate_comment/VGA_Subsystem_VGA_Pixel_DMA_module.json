    "module": "Module-level comment: The VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Pixel_DMA module manages DMA for pixel data in a VGA interface, reading from memory and streaming out pixels. It uses input ports for control signals and data, and output ports for communication with memory and video stream consumers. Internal FIFO buffers and state machines control data flow based on buffer states and external requests, while handling address calculations and buffer swaps, ensuring efficient and dynamic pixel data management essential for seamless VGA display operations."
