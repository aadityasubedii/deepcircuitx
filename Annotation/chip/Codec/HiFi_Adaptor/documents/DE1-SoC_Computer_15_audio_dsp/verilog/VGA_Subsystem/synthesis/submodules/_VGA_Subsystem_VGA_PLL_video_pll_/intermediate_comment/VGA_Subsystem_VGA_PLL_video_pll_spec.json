    "spec": "Module name: VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL_video_pll. Module specification: The VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL_video_pll is a Verilog module designed to serve as a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for video applications, specifically tailored for VGA subsystem usage. It leverages an external PLL configuration (via the altera_pll instance) to generate three different output clocks from a single reference clock. The module has two input ports: `refclk`, which is the reference clock input responsible for providing the basic timing signal for the PLL, and `rst`, a reset input that initializes the PLL's state and output clocks when asserted. The output ports include `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, and `outclk_2` which are the generated clock outputs set to specific frequencies needed for video processing, and `locked`, which is a status signal indicating whether the PLL has successfully locked to the reference clock. Internally, the module does not declare any intermediary signals but directly connects inputs to the `altera_pll` block, which handles all frequency synthesis, phase shift, and duty cycle configurations. The module is primarily composed of the instantiation of the `altera_pll` block, which is parameterized to output specific clock frequencies and settings and is directly wired to the module's ports, reflecting a straightforward structural organization focused on external configuration and minimal internal logic.",

It takes a reference clock input and generates three different output clocks, along with a locked signal indicating the PLL has successfully synchronized to the input reference clock. The PLL is set with specific frequencies for each output and includes settings for phase shifts and duty cycles, though the phase shifts are all set to zero and the duty cycles to 50 percent in this configuration.

For instance, `outclk_0` and `outclk_1` are both set to 25.0 MHz, which might be suitable for specific video processing or display tasks.\n- `locked` is a status output that indicates whether the PLL has successfully synchronized its output to the input reference clock.
