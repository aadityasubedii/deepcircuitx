Module-level comment: The `altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal` module generates a reset signal by inverting the 'locked' input, typically from a PLL. This output 'reset' ensures system stability by becoming high when 'locked' is low. The implementation involves a direct assignment of the inverted 'locked' signal to 'reset', without using internal signals, ensuring simplicity and efficiency in functionality.
