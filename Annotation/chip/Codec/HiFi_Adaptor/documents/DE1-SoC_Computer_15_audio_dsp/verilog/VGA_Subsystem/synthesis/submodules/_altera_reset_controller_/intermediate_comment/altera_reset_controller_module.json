    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'altera_reset_controller' manages and synchronizes up to 32 reset and request signals for FPGA systems. It combines input signals, synchronizes them to a system clock, and emits stable reset outputs. Internally, the module employs conditional logic, configurable parameters, and instances of 'altera_reset_synchronizer' for precise reset handling and timing adjustments, ensuring robust performance across various deployment scenarios."
