Module name: VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL_video_pll. Module specification: The VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL_video_pll is a Verilog module designed to serve as a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for video applications, specifically tailored for VGA subsystem usage. It leverages an external PLL configuration (via the altera_pll instance) to generate three different output clocks from a single reference clock. The module has two input ports: `refclk`, which is the reference clock input responsible for providing the basic timing signal for the PLL, and `rst`, a reset input that initializes the PLL's state and output clocks when asserted. The output ports include `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, and `outclk_2` which are the generated clock outputs set to specific frequencies needed for video processing, and `locked`, which is a status signal indicating whether the PLL has successfully locked to the reference clock. Internally, the module does not declare any intermediary signals but directly connects inputs to the `altera_pll` block, which handles all frequency synthesis, phase shift, and duty cycle configurations. The module is primarily composed of the instantiation of the `altera_pll` block, which is parameterized to output specific clock frequencies and settings and is directly wired to the module's ports, reflecting a straightforward structural organization focused on external configuration and minimal internal logic.
