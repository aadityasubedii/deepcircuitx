It operates with several states to manage the process of waiting for data, receiving data bits, checking parity, and confirming the stop bit, using state machine principles. The transitions between states are triggered by edge detections of the PS/2 clock. The module captures and constructs the incoming data bits from the PS/2 device and signifies when a complete byte of data has been successfully received."

It increments each time a bit is received on the positive edge of the PS/2 clock (ps2_clk_posedge) during the DATA_IN state and resets when not in the DATA_IN state or upon reset.\n- data_shift_reg: An 8-bit shift register that accumulates the bits of data received from the PS/2 data line (ps2_data). Bits are shifted in from the least significant end as new data bits are read on the rising edge of the PS/2 clock during the DATA_IN state. This register holds the forming data byte as bits are received serially.\n- ns_ps2_receiver: This register holds the next state of the PS/2 receiver's state machine. Combinational logic sets this register based on the current state (s_ps2_receiver), PS/2 clock edges, and data line status, determining the next state transition.\n- s_ps2_receiver: The current state register of the PS/2 receiver state machine. It is updated with the value of ns_ps2_receiver at every positive clock edge, transitioning the state machine from one state to another. This register's value determines the operation and response of the module to inputs and internal conditions during the current clock cycle."
