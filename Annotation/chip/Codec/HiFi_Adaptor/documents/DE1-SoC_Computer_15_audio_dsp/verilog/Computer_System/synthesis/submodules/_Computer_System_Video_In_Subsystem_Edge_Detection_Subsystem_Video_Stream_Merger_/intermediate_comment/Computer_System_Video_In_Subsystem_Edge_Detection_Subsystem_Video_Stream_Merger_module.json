    "module": "Module-level comment: The `Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Edge_Detection_Subsystem_Video_Stream_Merger` module merges two video streams based on synchronization signals and internal state decisions. It selects between streams based on `sync_data` when `sync_valid` is high, using internal registers `stream_select_reg` and `between_frames` to manage switching during inter-frame intervals. Merging is controlled by stream availability (`stream_in_valid_`) and ouput readiness (`stream_out_ready`), ensuring smooth transitions and maintenance of data integrity."
