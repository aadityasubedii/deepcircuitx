Module-level comment: The 'fpoint_wrapper' module selectively instantiates either 'fpoint_hw_qsys' or 'fpoint_qsys' based on 'useDivider'. It processes floating-point operations using inputs 'dataa', 'datab', and 'n', outputting 'result' and 'done' upon completion. Utilizes conditional generation for efficient module instantiation and operation synchronization through signals like 'clk', 'reset', and 'start'.
