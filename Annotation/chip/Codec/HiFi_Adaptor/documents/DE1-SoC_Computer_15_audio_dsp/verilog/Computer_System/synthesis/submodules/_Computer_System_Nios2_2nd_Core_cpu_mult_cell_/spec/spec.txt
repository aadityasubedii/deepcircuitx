Module name: Computer_System_Nios2_2nd_Core_cpu_mult_cell. 

Module specification: The 'Computer_System_Nios2_2nd_Core_cpu_mult_cell' is a multiplication cell specifically designed for CPU implementations, handling partial products of multiplication. It accepts two 32-bit source inputs, `E_src1` and `E_src2`, deciding the sign of each based on the control signals `E_ctrl_mul_src1_signed` and `E_ctrl_mul_src2_signed`. The operation is clock-driven (`clk`) and only occurs when enabled by the signal `M_en`. A reset signal `reset_n` (active-low) is used to clear operations. The outputs of the module are four 32-bit signals, `M_mul_cell_p1` to `M_mul_cell_p4`, each showing results from specific segment multiplications between `E_src1` and `E_src2`. Internal signals include `mul_clr` (generated from `reset_n`), `mul_src1`, `mul_src1_signed`, `mul_src2`, and `mul_src2_signed`, which facilitate accurate data transfer and manipulation within the circuit. Four blocks of `altera_mult_add` are employed, each configured with particular parameters such as pipelining and multiplier adjustments, to optimize the operations based on the segments of the inputs used and their signed or unsigned states efficiently. Each block corresponds to combinations of the upper and lower 16 bits of the inputs, with a characterization of the signs from the control inputs.
