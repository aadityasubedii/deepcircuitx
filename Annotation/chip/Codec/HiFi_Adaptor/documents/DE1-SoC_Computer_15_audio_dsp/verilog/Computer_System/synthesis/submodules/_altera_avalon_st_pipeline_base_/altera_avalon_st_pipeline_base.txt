Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base` module implements a two-stage pipeline buffer for enhancing data stream transfers. It uses parameters `SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT` and `BITS_PER_SYMBOL` to define data width. The pipeline controls data flow via internal `full0`, `full1`, `data0`, and `data1` registers, supporting both registered and unregistered logic configurations for signal readiness, enabling efficient data handling and throughput optimization in various conditions.
