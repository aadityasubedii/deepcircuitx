Module name: Computer_System_Nios2_2nd_Core_cpu_debug_slave_wrapper. 

Module specification: The Computer_System_Nios2_2nd_Core_cpu_debug_slave_wrapper is designed to provide debugging functionalities specifically interfacing with trace memory and breakpoint operations for the second core in a Nios II computer system architecture. Its key purpose is to facilitate efficient debugging operations by handling breakpoints, monitoring errors, and executing debug actions while interfacing with a JTAG for in-depth debugging. It manages input signals like ‘MonDReg’ for monitor data and ‘break_readreg’ for breakpoint reads, among others such as clock (clk), resets (reset_n and resetlatch), and a variety of control inputs for trace and debug operations. The module emits output signals such as ‘jdo’ for debug operation codes and ‘jrst_n’ for the JTAG reset, alongside various signals to indicate the need for action or inaction regarding breakpoints and trace memory operations. Internally, the module uses signals like ‘sr’ for status data, ‘vji_*’ signals (e.g., vji_tck, vji_tdi, vji_rti) for handling different stages of JTAG operations, all pivotal to the functioning of the debugging interface. It encapsulates two primary blocks, the Computer_System_Nios2_2nd_Core_cpu_debug_slave_tck which primarily deals with setting up and handling the JTAG interface and related operations, and the Computer_System_Nios2_2nd_Core_cpu_debug_slave_sysclk which operates based on the system clock, coordinating actions based on debug inputs and statuses. The module thoroughly integrates these functionalities into a cohesive unit aimed at enhancing the debugging capabilities and response in a multi-core CPU setup within the Nios II architecture.
