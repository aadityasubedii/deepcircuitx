It manages the pixel stream between input (ingress) and output (egress) interfaces, which are likely operating at different clock rates or have differing data handling speeds. The module reads pixel data along with start and end of packet flags from the input stream when valid data is available and the FIFO is not full. Conversely, it outputs data when the outgoing stream is ready and the FIFO is not empty. This setup helps in ensuring a smooth data flow between producer and consumer modules at potentially mismatched processing rates."
