Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ltm. 
Module specification: The `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ltm` module is designed for initializing configurations for an audio/visual component using a lookup table mechanism. The module takes a single input, `rom_address`, a 5-bit wide signal used as an index to access specific configuration settings within a `case` statement. The output, `rom_data`, is a 24-bit wide signal that outputs the configuration data corresponding to the `rom_address` input index. This output is generated by selectively manipulating bits of an internal 24-bit wide register `data`. The `data` register temporarily holds the configuration settings, which are predefined and loaded based on the `rom_address`. The overall module consists of two primary blocks: an `assign` statement which formats the output `rom_data` using a specific bit selection and reordering from `data`, and an `always @(*)` block containing a `case` statement which maps `rom_address` to specific values loaded into `data`. These sections work together to ensure the correct initialization values are quickly and efficiently set according to the provided `rom_address` index. The design provides a structured approach to setting up predetermined configurations essential for the correct operation of connected audio/visual hardware components.
