It employs sequential logic circuit (flip-flops) triggered by the primary clock (clk) to sample the test clock (test_clk) levels at different times, storing the current and the previous states of the test clock. It then determines rising and falling edges by comparing these consecutive states. The rising edge is flagged when there is a transition from low to high between past and current states, while the falling edge is flagged when the transition is from high to low. These edge detections are crucial in digital circuits for triggering specific actions aligned with clock changes, ensuring synchronous operation."

Specifically, it performs an XOR operation between `cur_test_clk` and `last_test_clk`, which will be high when there's a change, indicating an edge.\n- cur_test_clk: This register temporarily stores the current state of the test clock (`test_clk`) when the primary clock (`clk`) rises. It allows the state of `test_clk` to be used consistently during the evaluation of a single cycle and provides a reference point for edge detection with the previous value stored in `last_test_clk`.\n- last_test_clk: This register stores the state held in `cur_test_clk` at the last positive edge of the primary clock (`clk`). It's used to compare against `cur_test_clk` at the next clock cycle to identify any changes, indicating an edge.
