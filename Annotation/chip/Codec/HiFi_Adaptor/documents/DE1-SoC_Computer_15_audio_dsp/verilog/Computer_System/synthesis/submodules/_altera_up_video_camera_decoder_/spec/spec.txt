Module name: altera_up_video_camera_decoder. 

Module specification: The altera_up_video_camera_decoder is a digital logic module designed in Verilog, which processes incoming video signals by handling pixel data along with associated control signals, ensuring the framing, synchronization, and validation of data. The module operates on a rising edge clock signal and incorporates a reset functionality for initializing states. It accepts various inputs: 'clk' (clock), 'reset' (resets internal states), 'PIXEL_DATA' (carries pixel data), 'LINE_VALID' and 'FRAME_VALID' (control signals indicating valid lines and frames of video data respectively), and 'ready' (indicates downstream readiness for processed data). The outputs include 'data' (processed pixel data), 'startofpacket' (indicates the start of a video frame), 'endofpacket' (signifies the end of a video frame), and 'valid' (asserts the validity of outgoing data). Internally, the module uses signals such as 'io_pixel_data', 'io_line_valid', 'io_frame_valid', 'frame_sync', and temporary registers like 'temp_data', 'temp_start', 'temp_end', and 'temp_valid' to capture and buffer input data for processing. The module logic is divided into multiple always blocks: one for capturing inputs into internal registers, others for handling the reset conditions and updating outputs based on 'read_temps', which determines the readiness of data for output based on frame and line validity and readiness of the downstream components. Finally, there are combinational logic sections that compute conditions like when to read from the temporary registers. The elaborate structure ensures reliability in synchronizing and outputting video data in a controlled digital environment.
