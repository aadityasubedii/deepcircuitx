Module-level comment: This module implements a testbench for a Nios II CPU core, monitoring and validating CPU signals during simulation. It filters input signals to remove 'x' values, checks for errors in critical signals, and monitors various CPU operations. The module uses always blocks triggered by clock edges to continuously verify signal integrity and CPU behavior, reporting any unexpected states or invalid values.
