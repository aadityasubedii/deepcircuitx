Module name: Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Edge_Detection_Subsystem_Edge_Detection_Router_Controller.  
Module specification: This module primarily functions as a controller for edge detection in a video processing system. It determines data routing based on address inputs for operations such as writing and reading to and from an internal register. The input ports include: `address (2-bit)` to target specific operations, `chipselect` acting as an enable signal, `clk` for clock synchronization, `reset_n` for resetting the module's internal states, `write_n` as a write enable signal, and `writedata (32-bit)` containing the data to be written into the module. The output ports are: `out_port` that mirrors the internal `data_out` register for external use, and `readdata (32-bit)` which outputs data based on address conditions using internal logic. Internally, the module utilizes `clk_en` set permanently high (albeit redundant), `data_out` as a storage register for incoming data which also feeds `out_port`, and `read_mux_out` to direct the flow of data to `readdata` based on address input. The code includes an always block that handles data writing under specific conditions and module reset, and continuous assignments for `readdata` and `out_port` reflecting the module's internal state for external interfacing. This setup effectively harnesses fundamental Verilog functionalities to manage data flow, essential for video edge detection processes within larger computational systems.
