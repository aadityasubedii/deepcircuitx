    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"hps_sdram_p0_clock_pair_generator\" module processes a single-bit input (`datain`) to produce differential output signals (`dataout` and `dataout_b`). It utilizes a cyclonev_pseudo_diff_out block for generating pseudo-differential signals, which are then buffered by cyclonev_io_obuf blocks, ensuring reliable high-speed data transmission for SDRAM clocking applications. The output enables are actively managed by internal logic controls for consistent module operation."
