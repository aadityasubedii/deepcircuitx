It utilizes a ROM address to select and output specific configuration data. The data output format is adjusted by separating bytes with zeros to match a 36-bit bus width required, likely by the connected hardware. The module takes input `exposure` and incorporates it into the camera settings, allowing dynamic adjustment based on external inputs. Configuration options include various camera settings like exposure, row/column size, binning settings, and test patterns governed by a preprocessing directive `ENABLE_TEST_PATTERN`. This conditional compilation allows for flexibility in testing and operational modes."

Each address corresponds to a unique set of configuration data.\n- `exposure`: This 16-bit input is used to dynamically set the exposure level of the camera, allowing the module to adjust camera settings based on external conditions or requirements.\n\nOutput ports: `rom_data`.\nExplanation:\n- `rom_data`: This 36-bit output port sends configuration data to the camera or related hardware.
