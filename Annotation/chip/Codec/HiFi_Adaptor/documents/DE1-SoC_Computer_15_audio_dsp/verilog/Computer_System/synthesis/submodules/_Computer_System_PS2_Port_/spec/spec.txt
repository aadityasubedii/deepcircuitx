Module name: Computer_System_PS2_Port. 
Module specification: The Computer_System_PS2_Port module is designed to facilitate communication between a CPU and PS/2 devices such as keyboards and mice through a PS/2 port. It manages bidirectional data interchange and control using signals for reading, writing, and status management. Input ports include clk (clock signal for synchronization), reset (resets internal states), address, chipselect (enables the module), byteenable (activates data lanes), read, write (signals indicating read or write operations), writedata (data being written into the module), and bidirectional PS2_CLK and PS2_DAT lines for PS/2 communication. Output ports include irq (interrupt request to CPU), readdata (data output from the module), and waitrequest (delays the CPU during specific operations). Internal signals, such as data_from_the_PS2_port (8-bit received data), data_from_the_PS2_port_en (signal indication of new data), get_data_from_PS2_port (control read from PS/2), and data_fifo_is_empty/full (FIFO buffer status flags), manage data flow and error states. The module includes several blocks: an external PS/2 communication component (altera_up_ps2) for handling lower-level PS/2 protocol specifics, and a FIFO buffer (Incoming_Data_FIFO) for queuing data as it is received from the PS/2 port. The control logic contained within always blocks regulates the read and write operations to and from component registers and FIFO, handles control registers, and updates module outputs based on statuses and interrupts. This structured approach enables robust and orderly communication handling with connected PS/2 devices, ensuring effective device interfacing and data integrity in hardware systems.
