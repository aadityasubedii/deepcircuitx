Module-level comment: The `Computer_System_ARM_A9_HPS_hps_io` module functions as an interface for ARM A9 HPS, managing external connectivity for memory and peripherals through a variety of I/O ports. It predominantly acts as a signal pass-through, routing inputs and outputs directly to the `Computer_System_ARM_A9_HPS_hps_io_border` submodule, which handles signal integrity and isolation, facilitating organized and efficient interconnections within complex systems.
