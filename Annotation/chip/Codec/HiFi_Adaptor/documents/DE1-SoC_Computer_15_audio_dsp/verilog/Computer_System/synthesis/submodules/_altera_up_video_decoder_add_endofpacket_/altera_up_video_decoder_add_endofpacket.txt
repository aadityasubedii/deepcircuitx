Module-level comment: The `altera_up_video_decoder_add_endofpacket` module processes incoming video streams, marking packet boundaries by adding 'end of packet' as new packets begin. It syncs via `clk`, resets with `reset`, and handles I/O data and packet control signals through internal registers. Logic within `always` blocks controls data transfer and signal generation, conditional on synchronization signals like `stream_in_valid` and `stream_out_ready`, enhancing robust streaming data protocol adherence.
