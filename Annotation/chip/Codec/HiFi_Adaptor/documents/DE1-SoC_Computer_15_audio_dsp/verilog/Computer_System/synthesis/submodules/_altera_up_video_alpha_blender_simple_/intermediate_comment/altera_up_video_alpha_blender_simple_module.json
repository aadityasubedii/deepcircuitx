    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'altera_up_video_alpha_blender_simple' module performs alpha blending between background and foreground RGB colors. It takes 30-bit background and 40-bit foreground inputs, with the alpha bit in the foreground determining output selection. Three assignment blocks compute the outputs 'new_red', 'new_green', and 'new_blue', blending colors based on the alpha bit using bitwise operations and conditional selection. This results in a simple, direct implementation for effective color blending."
