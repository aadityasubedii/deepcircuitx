Module-level comment: The "altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal" module generates an active-low reset signal based on the locked status. It inverts the input "locked" signal to produce the "reset" output. If "locked" is high, indicating stability, "reset" is low; if "locked" is low, indicating instability, "reset" is high. This direct negation ensures simple and efficient functionality without internal signals.
