Module name: altera_up_video_128_character_rom. Module specification: The altera_up_video_128_character_rom is a Verilog module designed to function as a read-only memory (ROM) for storing and retrieving bitmap data for 128 different characters, suitable for use in video display systems. It includes several input ports: 'clk' (clock input for synchronization), 'clk_en' (clock enable for controlling operations), 'character' (a 7-bit input specifying the character code), 'x_coordinate' (a 3-bit input specifying the horizontal pixel position), and 'y_coordinate' (a 3-bit input specifying the vertical pixel position). The module has one output port, 'character_data', which outputs a single bit representing the on/off state of a specific pixel based on the character code and x, y coordinates received. The module employs an internal signal 'character_address', a 13-bit wire that calculates the ROM address to access the bit for the specified character and coordinates. This address calculation combines the 7-bit character code with the 3-bit values of y_coordinate and x_coordinate. The ROM storage is implemented using an 'altsyncram' block configured through parameters for specific usage like device family and memory size. This ROM block maps addresses to the stored character data. Specific configurations ensure that the ROM operates correctly within designated hardware limits and behaves optimally in terms of timing and power usage under different operational conditions.
