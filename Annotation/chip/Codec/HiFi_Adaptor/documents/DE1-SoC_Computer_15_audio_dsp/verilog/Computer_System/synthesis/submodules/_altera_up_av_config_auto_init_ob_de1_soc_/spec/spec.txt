Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de1_soc.
Module specification: The "altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de1_soc" module is integral in initializing configuration data for audio and video components on the DE1-SoC board. The module utilizes the 6-bit input port `rom_address` to select specific audio and video configuration setups from internal ROMs based on the specified address. This configuration information is retrieved independently by two submodules: `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_audio` for audio settings and `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7180` for video settings. Each submodule outputs a 27-bit configuration data (`audio_rom_data` and `video_rom_data` respectively), which are temporarily stored in two internal signals. These signals are then combined using a bitwise OR operation, resulting in the 27-bit output port `rom_data`, which is subsequently used to configure the various audio and video components. Within the module, there are specific parameter declarations that define the configuration constants for audio, like input and output levels and paths for ADC and DAC. The module contains two major code sections: instantiation of audio and video ROM submodules, where these submodules are configured using defined parameters, and the logic to combine their outputs to drive the main output signal. This structured setup ensures efficient initialization and configuration of the DE1-SoC board's multimedia components based on the received address input.
