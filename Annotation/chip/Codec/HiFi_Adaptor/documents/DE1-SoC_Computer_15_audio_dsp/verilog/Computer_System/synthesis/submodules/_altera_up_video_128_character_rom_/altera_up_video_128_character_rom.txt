Module-level comment: The `altera_up_video_128_character_rom` module serves as a character generator ROM for video displays, storing bitmaps of 128 characters. It takes inputs for character code and pixel coordinates, outputs the state of the specific pixel. Internally, it calculates the memory address using inputs and accesses the data using a configured synchronous RAM (`altsyncram`) block set for ROM operation.
