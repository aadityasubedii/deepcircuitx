This module takes a reference clock signal (`ref_clk_clk`) and a reset signal (`ref_reset_reset`) as inputs. It generates two output clock signals (`sys_clk_clk` for system clock, and `sdram_clk_clk` for SDRAM clock) based on the reference clock. Additionally, it provides a reset signal (`reset_source_reset`) which is driven by the PLL lock status (`sys_pll_locked_export`). The module contains internal connections to a PLL component (`sys_pll`) that manages the clock generation and a reset component (`reset_from_locked`) which ensures the system and SDRAM clocks are stable and synchronized after the PLL locks successfully."

This clock is crucial for the operation of SDRAM components, ensuring they operate at a synchronized rate with the system.  \n- `reset_source_reset`: Provides a reset signal output that represents the PLL's lock status (locked or not).
