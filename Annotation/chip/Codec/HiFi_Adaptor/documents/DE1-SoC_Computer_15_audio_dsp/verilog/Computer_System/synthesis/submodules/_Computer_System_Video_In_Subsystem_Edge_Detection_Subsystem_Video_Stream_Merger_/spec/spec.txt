Module name: Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Edge_Detection_Subsystem_Video_Stream_Merger. Module specification: This module is responsible for switching between two input video streams based on synchronization signals and internal state decisions, merging these streams into a single output. It handles the input ports `clk` (clock signal), `reset` (system reset), `sync_data` (used for stream selection), `sync_valid` (validates synchronization signal), two sets of video stream data inputs (`stream_in_data_0`, `stream_in_data_1`) along with their associated control signals (`stream_in_startofpacket_`, `stream_in_endofpacket_`, `stream_in_empty_`, `stream_in_valid_` for streams 0 and 1), and `stream_out_ready` (readiness signal for output data). The output ports include `sync_ready` (readiness for new sync data), `stream_in_ready_0` and `stream_in_ready_1` (readiness to receive new data for each stream), and outputs `stream_out_data`, `stream_out_startofpacket`, `stream_out_endofpacket`, `stream_out_empty`, and `stream_out_valid`, which represent the merged output stream data and its status. Internal signals such as `enable_setting_stream_select`, `between_frames`, and `stream_select_reg` manage the logic for when and how stream switching occurs, maintaining the status between video frames and controlling the stream selection based on sync inputs. The Verilog code is structured in blocks handling the reset state and data processing for each of its input streams, updating internal states to correctly manage frame transitions and stream selection in accordance with synchronization and temporal boundaries of the video packets.
