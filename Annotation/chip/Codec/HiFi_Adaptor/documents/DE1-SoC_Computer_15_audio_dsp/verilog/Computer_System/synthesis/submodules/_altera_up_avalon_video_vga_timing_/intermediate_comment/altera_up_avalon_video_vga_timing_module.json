    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_up_avalon_video_vga_timing` module generates VGA timing signals for video displays on a VGA monitor. It controls synchronization, timing, and color data output through internal timing mechanisms orchestrated by pixel and line counters. It manages active and total frame boundaries and ensures signal integrity during sync and blanking intervals using several internal signals and conditions set by the input and state transitions."
