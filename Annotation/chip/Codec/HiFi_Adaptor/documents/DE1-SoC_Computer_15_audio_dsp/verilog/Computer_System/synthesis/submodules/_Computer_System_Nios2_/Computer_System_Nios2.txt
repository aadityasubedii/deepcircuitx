Module-level comment: The `Computer_System_Nios2` module acts as a top-level entity, facilitating interaction between CPU operations and external interfaces for data and instruction handling, and debugging. It serves as a direct pass-through for input and output signals to the CPU submodule `Computer_System_Nios2_cpu`, which manages all the computation and process control. This design ensures minimal internal logic overhead, focusing on efficient signaling and streamlined communication within the system.
