    "module": "Module-level comment: The altera_up_irda_in_deserializer deserializes infrared data using a shift register and a FIFO buffer. It synchronizes with a clock input and handles resets. Incoming serial data is stored and organized through shift operations enabled by internal timing counters, while FIFO management tracks data availability and environmental status, coordinating read and write processes based on buffer conditions."
