Module name: Computer_System_mm_interconnect_2. Module specification: This module implements an interconnect for a computer system, specifically handling memory-mapped connections between various components. It includes logic for address decoding, data routing, and arbitration between multiple masters and slaves. The module has input ports for clock, reset, and various AXI and Avalon interface signals from the ARM A9 processor and other peripherals. Output ports include signals for controlling and communicating with various slave interfaces such as audio subsystem, VGA subsystem, LEDs, and pushbuttons. Internal signals like cmd_demux_src*, rsp_demux_src*, and router_*_src* are used for packet routing and command/response handling. The module implements AXI and Avalon interfaces, handles burst adapters, and includes components like demultiplexers, multiplexers, and response FIFOs. It's organize
