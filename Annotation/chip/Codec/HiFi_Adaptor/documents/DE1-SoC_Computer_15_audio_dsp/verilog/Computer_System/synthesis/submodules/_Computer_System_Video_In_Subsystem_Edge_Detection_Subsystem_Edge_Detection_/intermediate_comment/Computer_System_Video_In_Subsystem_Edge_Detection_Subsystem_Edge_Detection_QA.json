It processes incoming pixel data to detect edges by applying a series of image filtering techniques. Specifically, the module implements a Gaussian smoothing filter, a Sobel operator for edge enhancement, nonmaximum suppression to thin out the edges, and hysteresis to help define and retain significant edges. The module handles data flow control, ensuring proper synchronization and pipelining of data through these filters to output processed edge-detected video data. Additionally, it manages signals such as start and end of packets to maintain integrity across video frames."
