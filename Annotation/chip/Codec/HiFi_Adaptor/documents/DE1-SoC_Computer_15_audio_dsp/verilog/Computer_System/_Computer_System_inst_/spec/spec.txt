Module name: Computer_System. Module specification: The "Computer_System" module acts as an integration hub for various peripherals and internal components within a computer system, managing data exchanges and control signals across these various elements. It handles connections to audio interfaces such as ADCs and DACs, memory components, and various serial communication interfaces including I2C, SPI, and USB. The module connects clocks and reset signals as input ports which are critical for timing and synchronization among subsystems. Its output ports likely include data transmission lines for peripherals and control signals for memory operation. Internally, signals like `audio_ADCDAT` and `memory_mem_dqs` facilitate specific interfacing functions for audio processing and memory control, respectively. The module features an elaborate setup of internal connections such as Ethernet and USB channels for network and data connectivity, demonstrated by signals like `hps_io_hps_io_emac1_inst_TXD0` through `hps_io_hps_io_emac1_inst_TXD3` for Ethernet, and similar arrangements for USB and memory. This detailed setup ensures robust interfacing and operational management across the diverse components of the system, aiming for efficient and synchronized function within the computing environment.
