It takes multiple reset signals as inputs (up to 16), processes them based on configured parameters, and produces synchronized reset outputs. The module can handle asynchronous input resets and synchronize them based on a configurable depth. Several parameters allow customization of behavior such as handling reset request signals, minimum reset assertion times, and whether to adapt reset requests based on the edge type of outputs. Using internal chains and state machines, it ensures that reset outputs are properly managed and timed to meet system stability requirements and avoid metastability issues. This flexible reset handling is crucial in complex digital designs requiring stable and dependable reset operations across various subsystems."

The module can accept up to 16 individual reset signals, allowing it to manage reset conditions from multiple sources within a digital system.\n- reset_req_in0 through reset_req_in15: These are reset request input signals corresponding to each reset input. Each reset request input allows the module to handle additional reset control sequences specific to each input if configured to do so.\n- clk: This is the clock input. It is used to synchronize the reset signals to the system clock, ensuring that the outputs are stable and aligned with the clock's edges to prevent metastability.\n\nOutput ports: reset_out, reset_req.\nExplanation:\n- reset_out: This is the primary synchronized reset output. It produces a consolidated and synchronized reset signal based on all active input resets and internal synchronization logic.\n- reset_req: This is the reset request output. It indicates a request for a reset, derived from the input reset requests and internal conditions defined by module configuration and synchronization logic. It is used to signal that a reset condition is requested or is imminent, based on the synchronized processing of the input reset requests."

It is used as the input to reset synchronizers and represents the aggregate reset condition across all inputs.\n- merged_reset_req_in: Similar to merged_reset, this signal consolidates all reset request inputs based on enabled configurations. It helps in processing reset requests appropriately across multiple sources.\n- reset_out_pre: This is an intermediate reset signal after initial synchronization but before final output assignment. It is used to propagate a stable reset signal across the synchronization stages.\n- reset_req_pre: Like reset_out_pre, this is an intermediate reset request signal after synchronization and before final output determination.\n- altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain: A shift register chain used for implementing the delay necessary for reset synchronization. It helps to stabilize the input reset signal over multiple clock cycles to avoid issues such as metastability.\n- r_sync_rst_chain: Another shift register chain responsible for extending the reset pulse to meet the minimum reset assertion time as specified by module parameters.\n- r_sync_rst: This is a register holding the final synchronized reset state, determined after appropriate processing through internal shift registers. It considers previous states to ensure a stable transition.\n- r_early_rst: A register managing the reset request output with added logic for early assertion if required. It helps in making a reset request output more responsive based on the internal state and input conditions."
