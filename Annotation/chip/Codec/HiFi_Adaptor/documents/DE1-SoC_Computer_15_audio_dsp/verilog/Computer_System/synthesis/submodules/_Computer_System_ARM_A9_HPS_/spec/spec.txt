Module name: Computer_System_ARM_A9_HPS. Module specification: This module serves as a comprehensive interface between hardware components and an ARM A9 Hard Processor System (HPS) within an FPGA environment. It manages various functionalities including AXI transactions, memory control, and peripheral interfaces (UART, SPI, USB, I2C, GPIO, etc.). The module has numerous input and output ports for handling AXI channel signals, interrupts, and I/O device interfaces. Key input ports include clock signals (f2h_axi_clk, h2f_lw_axi_clk, h2f_axi_clk), AXI transaction signals (e.g., AWID, AWADDR, WDATA), and various peripheral interface signals. Output ports include reset signals, AXI response signals, and memory interface controls. The module uses two parameters,
