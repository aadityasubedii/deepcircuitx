It operates with clock signal `clk` and can be reset using `reset` input. Data can be written into the FIFO when `write_en` is triggered and read from the FIFO when `read_en` is activated. The module provides status outputs like `fifo_is_empty` and `fifo_is_full` to indicate if the FIFO is empty or full, respectively, and `words_used` to show the number of words currently stored in the FIFO. The FIFO has configurable depth and data width, set by parameters DATA_DEPTH and DW, and utilizes a sync FIFO component (`scfifo` from the Altera library) to manage the FIFO operations internally."

When activated, it clears all data in the FIFO, essentially reinitializing the FIFO's state.\n- **write_en**: This is the write enable input. When set to high (`1`), it allows data on the `write_data` input to be written into the FIFO at the next clock edge.\n- **write_data**: This data input carries the data to be written into the FIFO when `write_en` is active. The width of the data is defined by the parameter `DW`.\n- **read_en**: This is the read enable input. When set to high (`1`), it allows data to be read from the FIFO at the next clock edge.\n\nOutput ports: fifo_is_empty, fifo_is_full, words_used, read_data.\nExplanation:\n- **fifo_is_empty**: This output indicates whether the FIFO is empty. It is high (`1`) if there are no elements in the FIFO.\n- **fifo_is_full**: This output indicates whether the FIFO is full. It becomes high (`1`) when the FIFO has reached its capacity, and no further data can be written until some data is read out.\n- **words_used**: This output provides the current number of words stored in the FIFO. It helps in understanding how full the FIFO is at any given point in time.\n- **read_data**: This output carries the data read from the FIFO when `read_en` is activated.
