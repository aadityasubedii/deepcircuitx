    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_ps2_command_out.\n\nModule specification: The `altera_up_ps2_command_out` module manages the transmission of commands to a PS/2 device like a keyboard or mouse. It effectively controls the entire communication lifecycle including command initiation, data transmission, clock signal management, acknowledgment waiting, and error handling if a timeout occurs. The input ports include `clk` (clock input), `reset` (to reset the internal states), `the_command` (8-bit command data), `send_command` (control signal to start transmission), `ps2_clk_posedge` and `ps2_clk_negedge` (for detecting edges of the PS/2 clock line). The output ports are `command_was_sent` (indicates successful command transmission) and `error_communication_timed_out` (indicates a timeout error). The `PS2_CLK` and `PS2_DAT` are bidirectional ports used for synchronization and data exchange with the PS/2 device. Internal signals such as `cur_bit`, `ps2_command`, `command_initiate_counter`, `waiting_counter`, `transfer_counter`, `ns_ps2_transmitter`, and `s_ps2_transmitter` manage the detailed state machine transitions, bit tracking, and timing counters. The code is organized into several always blocks that update these internal states and counters based on clock inputs and current module states, handling initialization, data transfer, and command acknowledgment phases through an elaborate finite state machine.",

It effectively controls the entire communication lifecycle including command initiation, data transmission, clock signal management, acknowledgment waiting, and error handling if a timeout occurs. The input ports include `clk` (clock input), `reset` (to reset the internal states), `the_command` (8-bit command data), `send_command` (control signal to start transmission), `ps2_clk_posedge` and `ps2_clk_negedge` (for detecting edges of the PS/2 clock line). The output ports are `command_was_sent` (indicates successful command transmission) and `error_communication_timed_out` (indicates a timeout error). The `PS2_CLK` and `PS2_DAT` are bidirectional ports used for synchronization and data exchange with the PS/2 device. Internal signals such as `cur_bit`, `ps2_command`, `command_initiate_counter`, `waiting_counter`, `transfer_counter`, `ns_ps2_transmitter`, and `s_ps2_transmitter` manage the detailed state machine transitions, bit tracking, and timing counters. The code is organized into several always blocks that update these internal states and counters based on clock inputs and current module states, handling initialization, data transfer, and command acknowledgment phases through an elaborate finite state machine."
