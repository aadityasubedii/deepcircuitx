It takes two 32-bit source inputs, E_src1 and E_src2, which can be signed or unsigned as determined by E_ctrl_mul_src1_signed and E_ctrl_mul_src2_signed inputs. There are four outputs, M_mul_cell_p1 to M_mul_cell_p4, each connected to a multiplication and addition component (altera_mult_add). The module handles partial products of multiplication where different segments of the input data are processed. The calculations occur only when the module is enabled by the M_en signal, and all operations can be cleared using the reset signal (reset_n). This modular approach allows for simultaneous multiple product calculations which can be particularly useful for complex arithmetic operations required within a CPU. Through the configurability offered by the defparams, these components can leverage dedicated multiplier circuitry for efficient FPGA resource utilization. Each output represents the result from multiplying specific segments of the inputs, factoring in whether the segment must be treated as signed or unsigned."
