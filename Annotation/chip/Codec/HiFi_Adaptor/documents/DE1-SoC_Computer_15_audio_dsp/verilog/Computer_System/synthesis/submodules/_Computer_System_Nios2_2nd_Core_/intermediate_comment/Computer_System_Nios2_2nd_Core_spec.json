    "spec": "Module name: Computer_System_Nios2_2nd_Core.\nModule specification: The `Computer_System_Nios2_2nd_Core` is a Verilog module designed to serve as an interfacing layer around a second core of a Nios II processor within a larger computer system. This module handles various tasks including synchronization, interfacing with memory, managing interrupts, and facilitating debug operations. It works with input signals such as the main clock (`clk`), reset signal (`reset_n`), and data from both instruction and data memory interfaces (`i_readdata`, `d_readdata`). Outputs include memory addresses and control signals for both instruction and data memory (`i_address`, `d_address`, `i_read`, `d_read`, `d_write`), along with signals related to debugging and a custom interface module that potentially connects to a hardware accelerator or coprocessor. The module directly instantiates and wires its inputs and outputs to a submodule `Computer_System_Nios2_2nd_Core_cpu`, which presumably contains the core computational logic and state machine of the CPU core. This submodule is crucial for extending the CPU functionalities, including dealing with custom operations hinted by ports like `A_ci_multi_*`. There are no explicit internal signals declared in the module, indicating that its primary role is to act as a routing layer without additional processing logic between ports and the CPU submodule. This makes the top module particularly streamlined, focusing solely on port management and direct signal pass-through, enhancing clarity and maintenance efficiency.",

This module handles various tasks including synchronization, interfacing with memory, managing interrupts, and facilitating debug operations. It works with input signals such as the main clock (`clk`), reset signal (`reset_n`), and data from both instruction and data memory interfaces (`i_readdata`, `d_readdata`). Outputs include memory addresses and control signals for both instruction and data memory (`i_address`, `d_address`, `i_read`, `d_read`, `d_write`), along with signals related to debugging and a custom interface module that potentially connects to a hardware accelerator or coprocessor. The module directly instantiates and wires its inputs and outputs to a submodule `Computer_System_Nios2_2nd_Core_cpu`, which presumably contains the core computational logic and state machine of the CPU core. This submodule is crucial for extending the CPU functionalities, including dealing with custom operations hinted by ports like `A_ci_multi_*`. There are no explicit internal signals declared in the module, indicating that its primary role is to act as a routing layer without additional processing logic between ports and the CPU submodule. This makes the top module particularly streamlined, focusing solely on port management and direct signal pass-through, enhancing clarity and maintenance efficiency."
