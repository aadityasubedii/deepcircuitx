It specifically checks multiple parameters like bit symbols, data widths, error handling capabilities, etc., to ensure they meet predefined criteria, stopping the system and flagging errors if mismatches are found. If parameters are correctly set, the module facilitates data transfer, validating and ready-signaling each data transaction while also managing error outputs."
