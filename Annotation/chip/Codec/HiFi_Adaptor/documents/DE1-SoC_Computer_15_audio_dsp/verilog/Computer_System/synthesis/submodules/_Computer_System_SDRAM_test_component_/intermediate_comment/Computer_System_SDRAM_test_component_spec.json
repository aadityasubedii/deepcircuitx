Module specification: The Computer_System_SDRAM_test_component is designed to simulate the interactions with Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM). It receives memory operation commands such as read and write via input ports and executes these operations on an SDRAM. Input ports include a system clock (`clk`), memory address (`zs_addr`), bank address (`zs_ba`), column and row address strobes (`zs_cas_n`, `zs_ras_n`), chip select (`zs_cs_n`), clock enable (`zs_cke`), write enable (`zs_we_n`), and data mask (`zs_dqm`). The module communicates data with the external system through an inout port (`zs_dq`). Internally, the module uses signals like command codes (`cmd_code`, `CODE`), address components (`addr_col`, `addr_crb`), and pipeline registers (`rd_addr_pipe_`, `rd_mask_pipe_`, `rd_valid_pipe`) to manage read/write operations and address handling across different stages of memory access latency. Other significant code blocks include command decoding, initialization routines to load memory data, read and write operation mechanisms, and pipeline control for managing SDRAM operation latencies. Each block is crafted to comply with typical SDRAM operational requirements such as timing and data alignment, enhancing the chip's efficiency in handling memory operations.",

The module integrates with a sub-module named `Computer_System_SDRAM_test_component_ram_module` to access a virtual memory array, simulating the actual reading from and writing to SDRAM. Additionally, it defines various stages and pipelines to process addresses, data masking, and SDRAM command execution based on the system clock.

It synchronizes all operations of the module, including data reading, writing, and command processing in the SDRAM.\n- `zs_addr`: Memory address input. Specifies the address location in the SDRAM to either read from or write data to.\n- `zs_ba`: Bank Address. Used to select which bank in the SDRAM the operation will target, enabling the SDRAM to operate more efficiently by spreading out the data.\n- `zs_cas_n`: Column Address Strobe (active low). This strobe enables the column address to be latched when accessing the SDRAM.\n- `zs_cke`: Clock Enable. It is used to enable (when high) or disable (when low) the clock signal to the SDRAM. Disabling the clock allows the SDRAM to enter a low-power state.\n- `zs_cs_n`: Chip Select (active low). This signal enables (when low) or disables (when high) the SDRAM chip for any operation.\n- `zs_dqm`: Data Input/Output Mask. It is used to mask certain bits during a data transfer, allowing partial data writes or reads.\n- `zs_ras_n`: Row Address Strobe (active low). This strobe allows the row address to be latched when accessing the SDRAM.\n- `zs_we_n`: Write Enable (active low). It controls whether the current operation is a read (high) or a write (low) to the SDRAM.\n\n**Output ports:** \n- zs_dq\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `zs_dq`: Data bus (inout). This is a bidirectional port used for transferring data to and from the SDRAM. Its mode (input or output) and the data it carries depend on whether the current operation is a read or a write. The data masking during write operations and high-impedance state during read idle times are controlled by the `zs_dqm`."

It is used to mask certain bits during a data transfer, allowing partial data writes or reads.\n- `zs_ras_n`: Row Address Strobe (active low). This strobe allows the row address to be latched when accessing the SDRAM.\n- `zs_we_n`: Write Enable (active low). It controls whether the current operation is a read (high) or a write (low) to the SDRAM.\n\n**Output ports:** \n- zs_dq\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `zs_dq`: Data bus (inout). This is a bidirectional port used for transferring data to and from the SDRAM. Its mode (input or output) and the data it carries depend on whether the current operation is a read or a write. The data masking during write operations and high-impedance state during read idle times are controlled by the `zs_dqm`."

Module specification: The Computer_System_SDRAM_test_component is designed to simulate the interactions with Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM). It receives memory operation commands such as read and write via input ports and executes these operations on an SDRAM. Input ports include a system clock (`clk`), memory address (`zs_addr`), bank address (`zs_ba`), column and row address strobes (`zs_cas_n`, `zs_ras_n`), chip select (`zs_cs_n`), clock enable (`zs_cke`), write enable (`zs_we_n`), and data mask (`zs_dqm`). The module communicates data with the external system through an inout port (`zs_dq`). Internally, the module uses signals like command codes (`cmd_code`, `CODE`), address components (`addr_col`, `addr_crb`), and pipeline registers (`rd_addr_pipe_`, `rd_mask_pipe_`, `rd_valid_pipe`) to manage read/write operations and address handling across different stages of memory access latency. Other significant code blocks include command decoding, initialization routines to load memory data, read and write operation mechanisms, and pipeline control for managing SDRAM operation latencies. Each block is crafted to comply with typical SDRAM operational requirements such as timing and data alignment, enhancing the chip's efficiency in handling memory operations."
