Module-level comment: The 'Computer_System_Pushbuttons' module interfaces with pushbuttons to detect and generate interrupts on rising edges. It supports reading and writing of button states, interrupt masks, and edge captures using a multiplexer controlled by a 2-bit address input. Internally, it uses two-stage synchronization of button states to detect edges, manages interrupt generation based on edge detection and mask settings, and allows manual edge capture reset. The module is activated by a high 'chipselect' and manages operations synchronously with the 'clk' signal.
