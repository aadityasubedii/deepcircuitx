Module name: Computer_System_Nios2_cpu_test_bench. Module specification: This module serves as a testbench for a Nios II CPU core, monitoring various signals and registers to detect and report unexpected behavior or invalid states during simulation. It has numerous input ports including CPU signals, comparison results, exception flags, write data, branch history information, memory addresses, instruction words, status registers, and control signals. Output ports provide filtered versions of some input signals, removing potential 'x' (unknown) values, and a test_has_ended signal to indicate simulation completion. Internal signals track states and values throughout the CPU pipeline stages. The module consists of several blocks: signal filtering for write data and branch history, error checking for critical signals, and monitoring of CPU operations such as write operations, status registers, exceptions, and memory accesses. It employs always blocks triggered by clock edges to continuously check for 'x' values in important signals,
