Module-level comment: The "Computer_System_Nios2_cpu_debug_slave_wrapper" module orchestrates debugging for a Nios II CPU, interfacing via JTAG and handling debug signals. It ingests control and status signals to manage breakpoints, trace memory, and system readiness through two sub-modules: "Computer_System_Nios2_cpu_debug_slave_tck" for JTAG clock operations and "Computer_System_Nios2_cpu_debug_slave_sysclk" for system clock-aligned debugging functionalities. This setup efficiently coordinates CPU state monitoring and debugging actions.
