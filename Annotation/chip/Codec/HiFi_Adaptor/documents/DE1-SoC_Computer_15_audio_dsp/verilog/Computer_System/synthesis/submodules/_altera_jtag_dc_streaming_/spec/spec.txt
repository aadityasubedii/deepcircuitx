Module name: altera_jtag_dc_streaming.

Module specification: The altera_jtag_dc_streaming module is specifically designed for controlling JTAG data streaming and synchronization between multiple clock domains, particularly between JTAG and system clock domains in testing and debugging scenarios. The input ports include `tck`, `tdi`, `ir_in` for JTAG operations, `virtual_state_cdr`, `virtual_state_sdr`, `virtual_state_udr` for state machine synchronization, `clk` for system operations, `reset_n` for resetting the module, `sink_data`, and `sink_valid` for data input management. The output ports comprise `tdo` for the output data from JTAG, `source_data`, `source_valid` for sending data to system domain, `sink_ready` to accept more data, `resetrequest`, `debug_reset` for various reset functions, and `mgmt_valid`, `mgmt_channel`, `mgmt_data` for management operations. Internal signals such as `jtag_clock_reset_n` ensure reset operations are synced with the JTAG clock domain, while `jtag_source_data`, `jtag_source_valid`, `jtag_sink_data`, `jtag_sink_valid`, and `jtag_sink_ready` manage data integrity and flow control across domains. Key blocks in the code include `altera_std_synchronizer` for synchronization, `altera_jtag_streaming` for JTAG operations, and `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser` and `altera_jtag_src_crosser` for clock domain data transfer. Each of these components is integral to maintaining data accuracy and timing across complex clock domain interactions.
