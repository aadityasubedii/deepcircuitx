    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'altera_up_ps2_data_in' module interfaces with PS/2 devices to receive data, handled by a state machine with idle, data reception, parity check, and stop bit confirmation states. Operated by a system clock, it uses edge detections and internal registers to manage and assemble the incoming data bits into a complete byte, outputting through 'received_data' when 'received_data_en' is asserted, indicating valid data reception."
