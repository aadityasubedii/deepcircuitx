It uses counters to generate timing signals such as baud clock edges (both rising and falling), and also to capture input bits and manage transmitting status. The code includes parameters for setting specific tick counts for baud rate generation and other timing critical operations, indicating its application in communication systems where precise timing is crucial. The module manages counters for baud rates, input capturing, and communication status. Additionally, it controls transmission bits and indicates when all bits have been transmitted with the `all_bits_transmitted` signal, important for synchronization in data transfers."

It ensures the module starts operation in a known state.\n- `reset_counters`: Specific signal to reset only the counters within the module. It's useful for reinitializing the counting mechanisms without affecting other parts of the system.\n\nOutput ports: baud_clock_rising_edge, baud_clock_falling_edge, capture_in_bit, transmitting_bit, all_bits_transmitted.\nExplanation: \n- `baud_clock_rising_edge`: Indicates the rising edge of the baud clock, which is critical for timing in serial communications.\n- `baud_clock_falling_edge`: Indicates the falling edge of the baud clock, used similarly to the rising edge for precise timing requirements in synchronized communications.\n- `capture_in_bit`: This signal becomes active when it's time to capture an input bit, based on the baud rate and specific counter settings.\n- `transmitting_bit`: Indicates whether the module is currently in the process of transmitting a bit. This is key for managing data flow and ensuring proper transmission timings.\n- `all_bits_transmitted`: A status signal that becomes active when all designated bits have been transmitted, signaling the end of a transmission cycle and potentially triggering further actions or status checks."

It increments on each clock cycle until it reaches predefined tick counts such as `BAUD_TICK_COUNT`, at which points it triggers various other actions and then resets.\n- `bit_counter`: This counter keeps track of the number of bits transmitted so far. It increments each time a baud tick count cycle completes, and resets either when it equals the transmission width (`TDW`) or when counters are globally reset. This is key for controlling the transmission process and determining when all bits have been transmitted.\n- `ns_counter` and `s_counter`: These registers are declared but not used explicitly in the further logic provided within the module.
