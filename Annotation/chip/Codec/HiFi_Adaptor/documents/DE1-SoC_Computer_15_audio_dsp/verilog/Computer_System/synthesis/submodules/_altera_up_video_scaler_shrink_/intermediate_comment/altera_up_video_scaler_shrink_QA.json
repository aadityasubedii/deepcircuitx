It operates in a streaming fashion where the input is processed and the output is generated based on readiness signals and valid data flags. The module manages dropping pixels based on a predefined mask, which is used to select which pixels and lines are omitted from the output based on the position within the frame. The module ensures that these operations synchronize with the start and end of video packets, maintaining the integrity of the frame data in the output."
