Module name: Computer_System_HEX3_HEX0. Module specification: The Computer_System_HEX3_HEX0 is a Verilog module designed to simulate a simple computer system interface that handles data based on the hexadecimal positions from HEX3 to HEX0. The module has input ports which include a 2-bit 'address' for selecting operational modes or data sections, a 1-bit 'chipselect' that acts as an enable signal, a 1-bit 'clk' (clock) for synchronizing operations, a 1-bit active-low 'reset_n' for resetting internal states, a 1-bit active-low 'write_n' for enabling write operations, and a 32-bit 'writedata' for inputting data to be written. The output ports consist of a 16-bit 'out_port' that mirrors the 'data_out' register and a 32-bit 'readdata' providing a zero-extended output of 'data_out', depending on the 'address'. Internally, the module uses several signals: 'clk_en', permanently set to 1, implying continuous enablement of associated operations; a 16-bit register 'data_out' for storing and outputting data; and 'read_mux_out', which gates 'data_out' based on 'address'. The principal operational blocks in the code include the reset and write functionality executed in an always block triggered on the positive clock edge or negative reset edge, ensuring correct data handling and initial conditions. An assignment statement maps the zero-extended data output through the 'read_mux_out' signal, which selectively gates the 'data_out' based on the address, mainly outputting zeros when the address is nonzero.
