Module name: altera_up_video_alpha_blender_normal.

Module specification: The `altera_up_video_alpha_blender_normal` module performs alpha blending between a background and a foreground color. The module takes two primary inputs: `background_data` (30 bits) representing the RGB values of the background with 10 bits for each color channel, and `foreground_data` (40 bits) consisting of RGB values for the foreground (9 bits per color channel) plus an extra 10 bits for the alpha (transparency) channel. The outputs are `new_red`, `new_green`, and `new_blue`, each 10 bits, representing the computed color values after blending. Internally, the module uses signals like `one_minus_a` for calculating `1 - alpha`, and multiple 9-bit multipliers (`lpm_mult`) for calculating the products of RGB values with the alpha or `1-alpha` values (`r_x_alpha`, `g_x_alpha`, `b_x_alpha`, `r_x_one_minus_alpha`, `g_x_one_minus_alpha`, `b_x_one_minus_alpha`). These multipliers help in determining the contribution of each color from both foreground and background in creating the resultant pixel color after blending. The code is structured into sections that define the inputs/outputs, compute internal signal values, and use several instances of parameterized multipliers (`lpm_mult`) for processing the RGB calculations aligned with the blending logic. This design allows precise handling of transparency effects in overlaying images or graphics by blending colors based on their alpha values.
