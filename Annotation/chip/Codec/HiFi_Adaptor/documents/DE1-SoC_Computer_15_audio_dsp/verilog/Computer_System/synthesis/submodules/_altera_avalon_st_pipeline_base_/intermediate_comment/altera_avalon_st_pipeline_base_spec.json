    "spec": "Module name: `altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base`.\n\nModule specification: The `altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base` is a Verilog module designed to implement a basic two-stage pipeline buffer for streaming data transfers, aimed at increasing throughput and aligning data timing between incoming and outgoing streams. The module accepts an input clock (`clk`), a reset signal (`reset`), a valid data signal (`in_valid`), actual data (`in_data`), and a readiness signal from downstream (`out_ready`). It outputs a signal (`in_ready`) indicating its readiness to accept new data, a validity signal for the outgoing data (`out_valid`), and the actual outgoing data (`out_data`). The data width is parameterized based on `SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT` and `BITS_PER_SYMBOL`. Internally, the module utilizes two registers (`full0` and `full1`) to indicate whether each of its two pipeline stages is full, and two registers (`data0` and `data1`) to store the data at each stage. The code features two main blocks controlled by the `PIPELINE_READY` parameter: one using registered logic to determine the `in_ready` signal (`REGISTERED_READY_PLINE`) and another using unregistered logic (`UNREGISTERED_READY_PLINE`). Depending on the configuration and state of these internal signals, the necessary data and status transfers between the stages and to the outputs are managed effectively, allowing for controlled data flow throughout the pipeline under various operating conditions.",

It outputs a signal (`in_ready`) indicating its readiness to accept new data, a validity signal for the outgoing data (`out_valid`), and the actual outgoing data (`out_data`). The data width is parameterized based on `SYMBOLS_PER_BEAT` and `BITS_PER_SYMBOL`. Internally, the module utilizes two registers (`full0` and `full1`) to indicate whether each of its two pipeline stages is full, and two registers (`data0` and `data1`) to store the data at each stage. The code features two main blocks controlled by the `PIPELINE_READY` parameter: one using registered logic to determine the `in_ready` signal (`REGISTERED_READY_PLINE`) and another using unregistered logic (`UNREGISTERED_READY_PLINE`). Depending on the configuration and state of these internal signals, the necessary data and status transfers between the stages and to the outputs are managed effectively, allowing for controlled data flow throughout the pipeline under various operating conditions."
