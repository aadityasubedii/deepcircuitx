Module name: altera_up_sync_fifo.

Module specification: The 'altera_up_sync_fifo' is a Verilog module designed for FPGA implementations, specifically targeting the Cyclone II family via a parameterized instantiation of Altera's synchronous FIFO component, `scfifo`. The module serves as a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer, allowing data to be stored and retrieved in a sequential manner, with operations synchronized to an external clock input `clk`. The input ports include `clk` (clock signal), `reset` (resets FIFO content), `write_en` (enables data writing on rising edge of `clk`), `write_data` (data to be written to FIFO), and `read_en` (enables data to be read from FIFO on rising edge of `clk`). Output ports consist of `fifo_is_empty` (indicates FIFO is empty), `fifo_is_full` (indicates FIFO is full), `words_used` (shows number of words stored in the FIFO), and `read_data` (data output from FIFO). For internal operations, the module configures an internal `scfifo` instance with specific parameters to manage data handling, including setting FIFO depth, data width, and other operational settings. The code includes definitions of parameters like `DW` (data width), `DATA_DEPTH` (number of words in FIFO), and `AW` (address width), and sets various properties of the `Sync_FIFO` internal component to align with design requirements (e.g., output register usage, FIFO depth, and data width). These configurations ensure that the FIFO performs efficiently and accurately according to the specified parameters, making 'altera_up_sync_fifo' a reliable and customizable FIFO implementation for digital systems requiring sequential data storage and retrieval.
