    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_video_decoder_add_endofpacket. \nModule specification: The `altera_up_video_decoder_add_endofpacket` module processes incoming video data streams and manages packet boundaries by adding an 'end of packet' signal when a new packet begins during ongoing data transfer. The module has a set of input ports that include `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset` (resets internal states), `stream_in_data` (input data stream), `stream_in_startofpacket` (indicates the beginning of a new packet), `stream_in_endofpacket` (marks the end of a current packet), `stream_in_valid` (flags the validity of the input data), and `stream_out_ready` (indicates output stream readiness to accept data). The output ports are `stream_in_ready` (controls acceptance of incoming data), `stream_out_data` (processed output data stream), `stream_out_startofpacket`, `stream_out_endofpacket` (control signals to mark the beginning and end of packets respectively in the output stream), and `stream_out_valid` (flags the validity of the output data). Internal to the module, registers such as `internal_data`, `internal_startofpacket`, `internal_endofpacket`, and `internal_valid` buffer input signals to facilitate data processing. The module comprises multiple always blocks: one that handles the reset condition and another that processes incoming data and controls output flow. An assign statement adjusts the `stream_in_ready` signal based on `stream_out_ready` and `stream_out_valid` status, providing a backpressure mechanism. The module\u2019s design ensures that it adheres to streaming protocols, correctly handles packet boundaries, and maintains data integrity across different operating conditions.",

It is tailored to handle video data packing where the start of a new packet might coincide with the termination of the current one. The module accomplishes this using input data (`stream_in_data`) along with control signals such as `startofpacket` and `endofpacket` to manage the data flow. When conditions are appropriate (i.e., when both input data is valid and ready signals are asserted), it modifies the output stream signals accordingly. This includes potentially setting the `endofpacket` output signal based on the incoming data and control flow, ensuring the output stream correctly reflects the transitions in the packet data. The utilization of internal registers allows for temporary holding and manipulation of data, adhering to the streaming protocol. The module operates under the synchronous control of a clock signal and includes provisions for a reset condition, ensuring proper initialization and operational reliability in a typical hardware design environment."
