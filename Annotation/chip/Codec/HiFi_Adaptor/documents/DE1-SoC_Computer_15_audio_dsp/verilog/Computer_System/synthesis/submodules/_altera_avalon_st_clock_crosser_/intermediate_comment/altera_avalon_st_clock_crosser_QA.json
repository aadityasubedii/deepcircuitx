It is designed to ensure that data passed from a source clock domain (`in_clk`) to a destination clock domain (`out_clk`) is done without data corruption, which can occur due to clock domain asynchrony. The module employs toggling signals (`in_data_toggle` and `out_data_toggle`) to indicate the presence of new data, and synchronizers (`altera_std_synchronizer`) to align these toggles safely across the clock domains. Optional pipelining in the output domain can be enabled to meet timing requirements or improve throughput. The module provides interfaces for data input and output, as well as readiness and validity indicators to manage the flow and integrity of data through the system."

It controls the timing of data entering the module.\n- `in_reset`: Asynchronous reset signal for the input domain, used to initialize or reset the module's input side.\n- `in_valid`: Indicates whether the accompanying data (`in_data`) is valid and should be considered by the module.\n- `in_data`: The actual data being transferred from the source clock domain to the destination clock domain.\n- `out_clk`: The clock signal for the output domain. It dictates the timing of data exiting the module.\n- `out_reset`: Asynchronous reset signal for the output domain, used to initialize or reset the module's output side.\n- `out_ready`: Signal from the downstream module indicating it is ready to receive data. This feedback affects flow control. \n\n**Output Ports:** `in_ready`, `out_valid`, `out_data`.  \n**Explanation:**\n- `in_ready`: Indicates whether the module is ready to accept new data. This signal helps in managing the flow control by interacting with the `in_valid` signal.\n- `out_valid`: Indicates if the data on `out_data` is valid and can be consumed by the downstream elements in the design.\n- `out_data`: The actual data being handed off to the next stage in the destination clock domain after safely crossing from the source domain."

This buffer helps in decoupling the input rate from the output rate.\n- `out_data_buffer`: Temporarily stores the data that has crossed from the input domain to the output domain. It holds the data until it is ready to be sent to the output port when `out_ready` is asserted.\n- `in_data_toggle`: A toggle signal (or flag) that changes state whenever new valid data is buffered in the `in_data_buffer` from the input domain. This toggling is used to signal the presence of new data.\n- `in_data_toggle_returned`: This is the toggle signal `in_data_toggle` after it has been synchronized to the input domain clock. It is used to detect changes in the buffer state from the perspective of the input clock domain.\n- `out_data_toggle`: A counterpart to the `in_data_toggle` but for the output domain, it toggles whenever new data is taken out of the `out_data_buffer`.\n- `out_data_toggle_flopped`: The `out_data_toggle` after being synchronized and flopped in the output domain clock. Helps in maintaining synchronization across domains and controlling the output data flow.\n- `take_in_data`: A control signal that indicates when the module should capture the incoming data into `in_data_buffer`. It is asserted when the input data is valid and the module is ready to accept it.\n- `out_data_taken`: A control signal that indicates when the output data has been taken (acknowledged) by the downstream element. It ensures that the `out_data_buffer` is ready for new data.\n- `out_valid_internal`: This internal signal is used to track the validity of data in the output data path before it may be pipelined or processed. It uses the toggle information to manage the proper output data validity state.\n- `out_ready_internal`: Represents the internal readiness to send data to the output port or next stage, factoring in any internal conditions or processes such as synchronization or output pipelining status."
