Module-level comment: /*
This module performs floating-point multiplication and addition/subtraction on 32-bit inputs.
It uses separate sub-modules for multiplication and addition/subtraction operations, selected
by the 'n' input. A counter controls operation timing, and the module provides a 'done' signal
upon completion. Input operands are registered, and the result is output as a 32-bit floating-point number.
