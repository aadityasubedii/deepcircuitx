It takes in a data stream along with a data enable signal. The primary operations involve shifting incoming data through registers and evaluating it against predefined thresholds to detect high values, which could indicate an edge. The data line and thresholds are conditionally updated based on the clock and reset signals, ensuring synchronized and reliable edge detection. Finally, the result is output, determined by whether the data surpasses the defined thresholds. This module utilizes shift registers to aid in detecting changes or 'edges' in the incoming data."

All state changes occur on the rising edge of this clock.\n- reset: This input is used to reset the internal state of the module. When asserted high (1'b1), it initializes or resets the module's internal registers and data paths to their default state.\n- data_in: This is the primary data input to the module, consisting of an 8-bit value. It represents the stream of data in which edges are to be detected.\n- data_en: This is the data enable signal. When high, it allows the module to process the incoming data_in. When low, the processing of data_in is halted.\n\nOutput ports: data_out.\nExplanation:\n- data_out: This is an 8-bit output port. It outputs the resultant data after edge detection and hysteresis operations are applied. The output represents the detected edge values, or zeros if no significant edge is detected based on the threshold evaluation performed within the module."
