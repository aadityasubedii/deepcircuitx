Module-level comment: The Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Video_In_RGB_Resampler converts RGB video stream resolution by adjusting color bit widths. It accepts RGB data, control signals, and uses internal signals to resample each RGB component, controlled by clock edges and readiness signals. Outputs are processed data with corresponding control signals, ensuring consistent operations with upstream and downstream modules.
