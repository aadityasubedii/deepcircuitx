Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_lcm.  
Module specification: The `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_lcm` module is used for auto-initializing the configuration of an LCD module by mapping predefined configuration parameters to specific ROM addresses. It exclusively takes a 5-bit `rom_address` as its input, which is used to fetch the related configuration settings for the LCD. The module outputs a 16-bit `rom_data` that combines a parameter-specific identifier (upper 6 bits) and the actual configuration data (lower 8 bits) with two high-order zeros ensuring data format compliance for LCD operations. Internally, the module employs a 14-bit register `data` that temporarily stores the configuration data concatenated from a 6-bit identifier and an 8-bit parameter value. This value, when requested through `rom_address`, determines the specific display settings such as brightness, contrast, or orientation. The code is logically divided into two main sections: the `assign` statement that formats the internal `data` for output, and the `always @(*)` block containing a `case` statement which selects the output data based on the `rom_address` input, defaulting to `14'h0000` on invalid inputs. This ensures that each possible address directly relates to a specific LCD configuration setting, thus optimizing the initial setup process for clarity and effectiveness in LCD module management.
