    "spec": "Module name: Computer_System_Slider_Switches.\nModule specification: The Computer_System_Slider_Switches module is designed to interface with, and interpret the states of physical slider switches within a computer system. It reads a ten-bit input (`in_port`) that represents the state of these switches and, based on a two-bit address (`address`), selectively outputs part of this input as a 32-bit value (`readdata`) after zero extension. The module operates on the positive edge of a clock input (`clk`) and clears its output when a reset (`reset_n`) signal is low. The input ports include `address`, which determines which portion of the input data is output; `clk`, the clock signal that dictates the timing of data sampling and output updates; `in_port`, which carries the 10-bit state of the slider switches; and `reset_n`, an active-low reset that clears the output when triggered. Internal signals such as `clk_en`, always set high, ensure the clock is always enabled; `data_in`, which directly carries the slider switch states; and `read_mux_out`, where multiplexed data based on the address is temporarily held before being output. The code contains a multiplexing block using a masking operation (`{10 {(address == 0)}} & data_in`) which selects data based on the address and an always block that handles the output logic contingent on the clock and reset signals, updating `readdata` accordingly. The integration of these blocks ensures that the output data reflects current slider switch settings each clock cycle, contingent upon the system not being in reset.",

Depending on the address, it selects part of the input data and outputs it as a 32-bit value, zero-extended to fit the output width.

The multiplexing in the code `{10 {(address == 0)}} & data_in` applies a mask to `data_in`, controlled by the `address`.
