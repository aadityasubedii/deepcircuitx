Module name: altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal. Module specification: The module "altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal" functions to generate an active-low reset signal based on the negation of its input "locked". The input port "locked" indicates whether a system or component such as a phase-locked loop (PLL) is stable ('1') or not ('0'). The output port "reset" produces an active-low reset signal that is high ('1') when "locked" is low ('0'), and low ('0') when "locked" is high ('1'), which is critical for resetting functionalities in other system parts upon instability. The module operates without the use of internal signals, utilizing a direct logical negation of the "locked" signal to assign the "reset" output, thereby simplifying the design. The code consists of port declarations and a single continuous assignment statement that negates the "locked" input to produce the output "reset". This structure makes it efficient and straightforward for embedding in larger system designs requiring dependency on locked conditions.
