    "module": "Module-level comment: The altera_up_video_dma_to_memory module transfers video stream data into memory. It handles data stream inputs with control signals regarding packet boundaries and validity, manages internal staging with temporary registers (`temp_data`, `temp_valid`), and outputs control signals for data flow and address management. The module processes data readiness and memory write-backpressure, facilitating efficient packet-aware memory storage."
