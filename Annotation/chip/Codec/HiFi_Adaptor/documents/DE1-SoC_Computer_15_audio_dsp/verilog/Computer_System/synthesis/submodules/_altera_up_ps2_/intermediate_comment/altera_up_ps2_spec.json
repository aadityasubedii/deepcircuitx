    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_ps2. \nModule specification: The altera_up_ps2 module is designed for interfacing with PS/2 devices such as keyboards and mice. It handles communication by managing the PS/2 protocol, particularly focusing on clock signals and data transfer synchronization through state machine transitions. The module handles input ports: 'clk' (the primary clock signal), 'reset' (signals internal reset), 'the_command' (8-bit command sent to the PS/2 device), and 'send_command' (trigger signal for starting command transmission). The output ports include 'command_was_sent' and 'error_communication_timed_out' (indicators of transmission success and failure), 'received_data' (8-bit data received from the PS/2), and 'received_data_en' (validity indicator of the received data). Inout ports 'PS2_CLK' and 'PS2_DAT' connect directly to the PS/2 device for bidirectional data and clock signal communication. Internal signals such as 'ps2_clk_posedge' and 'ps2_clk_negedge' help in detecting the clock's edge transitions. Signals like 'start_receiving_data', 'wait_for_incoming_data', and various counters and registers (e.g., 'idle_counter', 'ps2_data_reg') support state machine operations and data handling. The code structure includes several blocks: edge detection, state machine logic, data handling, and integration with submodules for data reception and command transmission\u2014each crucial for the module\u2019s operation in different stages of PS/2 communication. This structured approach ensures reliable data transfer with appropriate handling of various states and events within PS/2 communications.",

                    "text": "Module name: altera_up_ps2. \nModule specification: The altera_up_ps2 module is designed for interfacing with PS/2 devices such as keyboards and mice. It handles communication by managing the PS/2 protocol, particularly focusing on clock signals and data transfer synchronization through state machine transitions. The module handles input ports: 'clk' (the primary clock signal), 'reset' (signals internal reset), 'the_command' (8-bit command sent to the PS/2 device), and 'send_command' (trigger signal for starting command transmission). The output ports include 'command_was_sent' and 'error_communication_timed_out' (indicators of transmission success and failure), 'received_data' (8-bit data received from the PS/2), and 'received_data_en' (validity indicator of the received data). Inout ports 'PS2_CLK' and 'PS2_DAT' connect directly to the PS/2 device for bidirectional data and clock signal communication. Internal signals such as 'ps2_clk_posedge' and 'ps2_clk_negedge' help in detecting the clock's edge transitions. Signals like 'start_receiving_data', 'wait_for_incoming_data', and various counters and registers (e.g., 'idle_counter', 'ps2_data_reg') support state machine operations and data handling. The code structure includes several blocks: edge detection, state machine logic, data handling, and integration with submodules for data reception and command transmission\u2014each crucial for the module\u2019s operation in different stages of PS/2 communication. This structured approach ensures reliable data transfer with appropriate handling of various states and events within PS/2 communications."
