Module name: Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Video_In_RGB_Resampler. 

Module specification: The Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Video_In_RGB_Resampler module is designed to convert an input RGB video stream data from one color resolution to another, effectively changing the bit width of each color channel and thus the data density. The module takes several input signals including clk (clock signal), reset (resets internal states), stream_in_data (RGB data), stream_in_startofpacket, stream_in_endofpacket (indicators for packet boundaries), stream_in_empty (indicates unused bits), and stream_in_valid (validity of the input data), along with stream_out_ready (ready signal from downstream). The outputs of the module include stream_in_ready (indicates readiness to receive more data), stream_out_data (processed RGB data), stream_out_startofpacket, stream_out_endofpacket, stream_out_empty (mirrors corresponding input signals after processing), and stream_out_valid. Inside, the module utilizes internal signals such as r, g, b (10-bit extensions of the RGB components), a (constant alpha value), and converted_data (resampled output before assignment to stream_out_data). The Verilog code is structured into blocks for signal assignments, data processing in response to clock edges, and handling of control signals which orchestrate data processing according to the readiness of the module and validity of the incoming data.
