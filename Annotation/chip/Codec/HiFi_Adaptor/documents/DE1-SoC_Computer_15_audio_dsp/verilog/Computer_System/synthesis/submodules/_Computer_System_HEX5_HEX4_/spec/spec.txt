Module name: Computer_System_HEX5_HEX4. 
Module specification: The Computer_System_HEX5_HEX4 module is designed for data handling operations, specifically writing to and reading from a memory segment based on certain conditions. It contains input ports: `address` (2-bit, used for register selection), `chipselect` (enables the module), `clk` (clock signal for timing operations), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `write_n` (active-low write enable), and `writedata` (32-bit data to be written). The output ports include `out_port` (16-bit, mirrors `data_out`) and `readdata` (32-bit, provides zero-extended data from `data_out` based on address). Internally, the module uses a wire `clk_en` set to 1 (not used in operational logic), a 16-bit register `data_out` (stores written data), and `read_mux_out` (outputs conditional content of `data_out` based on address). The module operates on the positive edge of `clk` and negative edge of `reset_n` in an always block where it checks and acts on reset conditions or write conditions (when `chipselect` is high, `write_n` is low, and `address` is 0). The `data_out` content is selectively output to `readdata` after being masked and zero-extended, and directly to `out_port`. This design ensures that the module performs specific read and write operations efficiently and synchronously with the system clock.
