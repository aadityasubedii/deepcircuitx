Module-level comment: The `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7180` module initializes and configures an ADV7180 video decoder for Altera devices. It utilizes a 6-bit input `rom_address` to select video settings and outputs the configurations through a 27-bit `rom_data`. Internally, the `data` register holds the configuration, which is formatted and output based on `rom_address`. Key operations are controlled via a case statement within an always block for dynamic configuration mapping.
