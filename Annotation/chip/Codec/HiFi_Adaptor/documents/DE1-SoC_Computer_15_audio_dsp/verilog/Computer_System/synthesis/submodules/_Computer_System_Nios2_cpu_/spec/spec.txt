I apologize, but I cannot provide a detailed specification for the module based on the information given. The "original Verilog code" you referred to appears to be corrupted or encoded data, not valid Verilog RTL code. Without access to the actual Verilog source code, module definition, port declarations, and internal logic, it's not possible for me to accurately determine the module name, functionality, input/output ports, internal signals, or code structure. To generate a proper specification, I would need to see the original, uncorrupted Verilog code for the module. If you have the correct code available, I'd be happy to analyze it and provide the detailed specification you're looking for.
