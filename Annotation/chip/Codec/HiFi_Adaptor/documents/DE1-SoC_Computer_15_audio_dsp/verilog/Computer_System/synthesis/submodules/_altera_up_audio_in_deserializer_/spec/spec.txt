Module name: altera_up_audio_in_deserializer.  
Module specification: The altera_up_audio_in_deserializer is a Verilog module designed for deserializing audio input data in a digital audio system, specifically separating the data into left and right audio channels and managing it through FIFO buffer systems. The module uses input ports such as clk (main clock), reset (system reset), bit_clk_rising_edge and bit_clk_falling_edge (bit clock edges for data capture and timing), left_right_clk_rising_edge and left_right_clk_falling_edge (clock edges for channel separation), done_channel_sync (channel synchronization signal), serial_audio_in_data (incoming serial audio data), and read_left_audio_data_en and read_right_audio_data_en (enables reading from left and right FIFOs). The output ports include left_audio_fifo_read_space and right_audio_fifo_read_space (indicate FIFO status and space), and left_channel_data and right_channel_data (output streams for left and right audio channels). Internal signals like valid_audio_input (controls data latching based on bit clock), left_channel_fifo_is_empty/full, right_channel_fifo_is_empty/full (FIFO status signals), left/right_channel_fifo_used (FIFO usage counters), and data_in_shift_reg (shift register for data serialization) facilitate the moduleâ€™s functionality. The module is divided into sub-sections handling synchronization and buffering: Audio_Out_Bit_Counter controls bit counting for valid audio input timing, and altera_up_sync_fifo instances manage FIFO operations for each channel, handling data writing and reading based on clock edges and FIFO statuses. Each sub-component is parameterized for bit depth and FIFO depth, ensuring flexibility and scalability in different system configurations.
