Module name: Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Video_In_Chroma_Resampler.
Module specification: This module is responsible for chroma resampling within a video processing system, primarily designed to handle and reformat chrominance data streams (Cr and Cb components) for synchronous computing environments. Key input ports include `clk` (the system clock), `reset` (to reset internal states), and `stream_in_data` along with control signals like `stream_in_startofpacket`, `stream_in_endofpacket`, `stream_in_empty`, and `stream_in_valid`. These ports manage data boundaries and validity. The module's output ports consist of `stream_in_ready` and `stream_out_data` with similar control signals that indicate packet framing, readiness, and data validity in the output stream. Internal signals such as `converted_data`, `saved_CrCb`, and `cur_is_Cr_or_Cb` play pivotal roles; `converted_data` holds the resampled chrominance data ready for output, `saved_CrCb` stores alternating chrominance components, and `cur_is_Cr_or_Cb` toggles between Cr and Cb processing. The module is structured into several blocks handling different facets of functionality: initialization/resetting to ensure reliable start states, data transfer control dependent on output readiness, buffering of incoming data, and the actual data conversion mechanism that rearranges and alternates the Cr and Cb data as necessary per output specifications. This module ensures effective synchronization between input and output data flows and maintains data integrity across the video processing pipeline.
