Module-level comment: The "Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Pixel_DMA" module controls DMA for VGA display, transferring pixel data from memory to a VGA interface. It utilizes input/output communication with memory and downstream VGA components, managed by an internal state machine coordinating FIFO buffers for data synchronization and flow control. The module handles frame buffer management, pixel addressing, and the seamless update of display frames, ensuring robust video output without tearing.
