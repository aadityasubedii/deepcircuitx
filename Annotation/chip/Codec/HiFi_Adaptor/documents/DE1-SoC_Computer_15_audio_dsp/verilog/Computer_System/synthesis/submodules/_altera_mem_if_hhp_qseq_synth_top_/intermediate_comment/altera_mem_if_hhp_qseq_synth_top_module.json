    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_mem_if_hhp_qseq_synth_top` module serves as a configurable template for memory interfacing in Altera FPGA designs. It defines key parameters for various data and address widths (APB, AVL, and memory signals like DQS, DQ, DM, CS) without specific input/output ports or internal signals, hinting at usage within a larger, encapsulated memory system. This offers flexible synthesis options tailored to specific memory interfacing needs."
