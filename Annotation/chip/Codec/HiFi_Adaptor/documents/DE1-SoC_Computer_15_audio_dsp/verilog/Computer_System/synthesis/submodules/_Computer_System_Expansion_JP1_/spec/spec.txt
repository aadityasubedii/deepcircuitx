Module name: Computer_System_Expansion_JP1. Module specification: The Computer_System_Expansion_JP1 is a Verilog module designed to serve as an interface for managing bi-directional data flow and interrupt handling between external hardware and the system's internal logic. It uses input ports including `address` (2-bit signal for register selection), `chipselect` (signal activation for module selection), `clk` (system clock), `reset_n` (active low reset), `write_n` (active low write enable), and `writedata` (32-bit input data bus). The output ports are `bidir_port` (a 32-bit bidirectional port for data I/O), `irq` (interrupt request output), and `readdata` (32-bit data from internal registers). Internally, the module leverages signals such as `clk_en` (clock enable), `data_in/out` (data being read from/written to the bidir_port), `data_dir` (direction control for bidir_port), `edge_capture` (captures edge detections), `edge_detect` (detection logic for rising edges), and others like `irq_mask` and `read_mux_out` which respectively manage the interrupt masking and output data multiplexing based on the `address`. The code composes multiple procedural blocks driven by positive edge of `clk` or negative edge of `reset_n`, accomplishing tasks like read/write operations on internal registers, edge detection, interrupt handling, and data direction configuration. This structured approach allows the module to effectively handle real-time data and interrupt management requirements in embedded systems.
