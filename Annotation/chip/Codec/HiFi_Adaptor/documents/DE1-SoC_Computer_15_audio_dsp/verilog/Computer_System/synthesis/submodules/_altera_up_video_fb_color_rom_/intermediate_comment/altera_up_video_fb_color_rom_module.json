    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"altera_up_video_fb_color_rom\" module serves as a color lookup table in video processing, mapping a 4-bit color index to 10-bit RGB outputs using a ROM. It operates synchronized to 'clk' and controlled by 'clk_en'. The ROM, initialized from \"altera_up_video_fb_color_rom.mif\", is interfaced through an 'altsyncram' instance set for ROM mode, outputting color data split into RGB components via internal signal 'color_data'."
