    "module": "Module-level comment: The Computer_System_PS2_Port module interfaces with PS/2 ports for communication with peripherals like keyboards. It synchronizes operations via clk, handles data/command exchange via bidirectional PS2_CLK and PS2_DAT lines, and manages data with FIFO buffers. The module also includes control registers for error management and interrupt handling, which ensures data integrity and responsive interaction. Implements logic for data reading/writing, leveraging internally managed signals and conditions to effectively control data flow and device interactions."
