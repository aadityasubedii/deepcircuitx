The module provides the option to handle both asynchronous and synchronous reset behaviors based on the parameter ASYNC_RESET. If ASYNC_RESET is set to 1, it handles an asynchronous reset, and all stages in the synchronizer chain are set to 1 when a reset is detected. If ASYNC_RESET is 0, it synchronizes the incoming reset signal through a shift register chain. The DEPTH parameter determines the length of this shift register chain, thus configuring the depth of synchronization to ensure the reset signal is stable across the clock domains. The reset output is driven by the last element of this synchronization chain, ensuring that the reset signal is properly synchronized to the system's clock."

This register shifts its contents with each clock cycle, either propagating the reset signal through each stage (in the case of an asynchronous reset) or shifting the reset input directly into the last stage of the chain (in synchronous mode).\n- **altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out**: This is a single-bit register that outputs the synchronized reset signal from the module. It directly takes its value from the first bit (LSB) of the altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain, and hence, represents the final output of the reset synchronization process.
