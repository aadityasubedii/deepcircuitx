Module name: altera_avalon_packets_to_master. Module specification: This module is a packet-to-master converter for Altera Avalon interfaces, designed to receive packet data through an input interface, process it, and convert it into Avalon master read/write transactions. It supports two operational modes: a fast version using separate submodules (packets_to_fifo, fifo_to_packet, and fifo_buffer) for packet conversion and buffering, and a standard version using a single packets_to_master module for direct conversion. The module handles various command types for read and write operations, supporting both incrementing and non-incrementing address modes. Input ports include clk, reset_n, in_valid, in_data, in_startofpacket, in_endofpacket, out_ready, readdata, waitrequest, and readdatavalid, while output ports include
