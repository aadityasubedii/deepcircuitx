Module-level comment: This module implements a testbench for a Nios II CPU core, monitoring and validating various CPU signals. It filters input signals to remove 'x' values, performs error checking on critical operations, and manages pipeline stages. The testbench uses always blocks to detect unexpected 'x' values, reports errors, and stops simulation when issues are found, ensuring proper CPU functionality and signal integrity throughout the simulation process.
