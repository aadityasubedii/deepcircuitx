    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_up_video_dma_control_slave` module manages DMA operations for video data, using clocked processes to handle tasks such as reading/writing register values, swapping buffer addresses, and setting DMA enable state. It accepts control inputs and outputs data based on internal register conditions, facilitating fast video processing by bypassing CPU interactions."
