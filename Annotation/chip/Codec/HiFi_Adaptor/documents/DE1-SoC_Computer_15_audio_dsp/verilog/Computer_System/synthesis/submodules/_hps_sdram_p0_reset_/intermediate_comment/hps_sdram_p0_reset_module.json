    "module": "Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_reset` module synchronizes resets across various SDRAM clock domains in an FPGA's HPS. It inputs multiple clocks and reset signals, generating synchronized reset outputs using instances of `hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync` submodules. Each submodule is tailored with specific reset synchronization stages to ensure stability and prevent metastability by aligning resets with the respective clock domains effectively."
