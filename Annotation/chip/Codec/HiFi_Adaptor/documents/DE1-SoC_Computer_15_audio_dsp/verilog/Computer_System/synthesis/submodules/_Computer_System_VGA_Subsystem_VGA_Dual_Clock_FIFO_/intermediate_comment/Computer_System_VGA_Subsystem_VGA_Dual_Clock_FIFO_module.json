    "module": "Module-level comment: The Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Dual_Clock_FIFO module acts as a dual-clock FIFO for interfacing different clock domains in a VGA subsystem. It handles synchronized data transfer using input signals (`clk_stream_in`, `stream_in_valid`) and outputs data based on the output clock (`clk_stream_out`). Implemented with a parameterized `dcfifo` block, it manages FIFO operations with internal control logic for data readiness and availability, ensuring seamless data flow and integrity across domains."
