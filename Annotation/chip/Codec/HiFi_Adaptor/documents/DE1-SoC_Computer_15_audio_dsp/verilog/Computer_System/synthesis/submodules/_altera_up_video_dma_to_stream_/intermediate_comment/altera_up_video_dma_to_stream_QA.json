It primarily operates by buffering incoming data and managing its flow based on the status of the FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer and the readiness of the downstream consumer (stream_ready signal). The module manages various states to effectively control the streaming process, including handling initial and final pixel transfers to delineate frames, and pausing or activating data transfer based on buffer fullness and pending read operations. This ensures continuous and controlled data streaming for video frames under varying system loads."

It helps manage the read operations and synchronization between data availability and data request.\n- **startofpacket**: Flag used to indicate the start of a new video packet (frame). It is set when the first pixel of a frame is reading and cleared when data transfer begins, helping to correctly mark packet boundaries in the stream.\n- **s_dma_to_stream**: Current state register for the module's finite state machine (FSM). It holds the current operational state of the module, guiding the overall behavior and transitions based on conditions.\n- **ns_dma_to_stream**: Next state logic for the FSM.
