It transfers signals from ci_slave interfaces to comb_ci_master and multi_ci_master outputs based on the parameter `SHARED_COMB_AND_MULTI`. When `SHARED_COMB_AND_MULTI` is 0, the module operates in a mode where the combinatorial and multi-cycle custom instruction interfaces are handled separately, directly mapping each set of signals to their respective outputs. Otherwise, the module handles the interfaces in a shared mode, using the same signals for combinatorial and multi-cycle operations except for the result selection, which depends on the completion status of the multi-cycle operation. This facilitates the integration of both types of custom instructions (combinatorial and multi-cycle) in systems using Altera's FPGA architecture."

They are differentiated mainly between regular (combinatorial) and multi-cycle operations.\n\n**Output ports:**\n- ci_slave_result, ci_slave_multi_result: 32-bit outputs where results from the master interfaces are written back to the slave.\n- ci_slave_multi_done: Indicates the completion of multi-cycle operation.\n- comb_ci_master_dataa, comb_ci_master_datab: Forwarded data operands for the master in combinatorial operations.\n- comb_ci_master_n, comb_ci_master_readra, comb_ci_master_readrb, comb_ci_master_writerc, comb_ci_master_a, comb_ci_master_b, comb_ci_master_c, comb_ci_master_ipending, comb_ci_master_estatus: Various control and configuration signals for combinatorial operations mapped from slave inputs.\n- multi_ci_master_clk, multi_ci_master_reset, multi_ci_master_reset_req, multi_ci_master_clken, multi_ci_master_start: Clock and control signals for multi-cycle operations mapped from slave inputs.\n- multi_ci_master_dataa, multi_ci_master_datab, multi_ci_master_n, multi_ci_master_readra, multi_ci_master_readrb, multi_ci_master_writerc, multi_ci_master_a, multi_ci_master_b, multi_ci_master_c: Data and control outputs for multi-cycle operations mapped from either plain slave inputs or shared between combinatorial and multi-cycle operations depending on `SHARED_COMB_AND_MULTI`.\n\n**Explanation of Output Ports:**\nOutputs facilitate the completion of the operations started by the inputs.
