    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/* This module implements a memory physical layer (PHY) interface for an SDRAM controller in a Hard Processor System (HPS). It manages low-level communication between the memory controller and SDRAM chips using DDIO interfaces, clock management, and reset control. The module handles data transfer, addressing, and timing for various memory operations, incorporating features like DLL and OCT control. It uses multiple clock domains and can be configured for different memory parameters and interface widths. */"
