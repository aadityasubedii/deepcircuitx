The clipping parameters, such as the number of pixels to drop from the start and end of each line, and the number of lines to drop from the start and end of each frame, are configurable. The module handles video stream control signals like start of packet (SOP) and end of packet (EOP) intelligently to manage frames efficiently. It operates in different states to wait for a starting packet, run the clipper, or add missing parts to the stream if required, ensuring the output stream is properly formatted for subsequent processing or display. The module works with synchronized data inputs and outputs based on the system clock and a reset condition."

It is crucial for correctly flagging the start of output packets.\n- **new_endofpacket:** Similarly, this signal marks the end of a clipped video packet. It ensures that the clipped video stream is correctly segmented into packets.\n- **pass_inner_frame:** A decision-making signal used to determine if the current video data within the inner boundaries (after considering the drop parameters) should be passed to the output. It controls the condition whether data is within the valid clipped region.\n- **s_video_clipper_drop:** The current state of the finite state machine (FSM) which governs the main operational logic of the module. This state is stored and used to make decisions on processing at each clock cycle.\n- **ns_video_clipper_drop:** The next state of the FSM. This signal is calculated based on the current state and the inputs, determining the subsequent operational state of the module in the next clock cycle."
