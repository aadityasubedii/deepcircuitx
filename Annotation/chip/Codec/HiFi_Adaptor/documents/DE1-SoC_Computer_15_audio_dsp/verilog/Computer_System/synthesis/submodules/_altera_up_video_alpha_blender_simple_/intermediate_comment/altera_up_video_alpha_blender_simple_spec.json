Module specification: The 'altera_up_video_alpha_blender_simple' module performs color blending between a background and a foreground color based on the alpha bit of the foreground color data. The module accepts two input ports: `background_data` (30 bits wide, containing RGB data with each color represented as 10 bits) and `foreground_data` (40 bits wide, with the highest bit as the alpha control bit and the rest containing RGB data). There are three 10-bit output ports: `new_red`, `new_green`, and `new_blue`, which output the blended color based on the alpha bit's value. If the alpha bit is high, the color component from `foreground_data` is output; otherwise, the color component from `background_data` is used. The module does not utilize any internal signals, operating purely on direct assignments and conditional checks through combinatorial logic. The code includes three 'assign' blocks, one for each output color (`new_red`, `new_green`, `new_blue`), where each block uses conditional logic to select appropriate bits from the input ports based on the alpha bit. This structure ensures that the module is simple yet effective for blending two RGB colors based on alpha blending rules.",
