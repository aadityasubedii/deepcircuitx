It handles input from the pushbuttons through an \"in_port\", manages interrupt masking, detects rising edges of button presses for edge-triggered interrupts, and supports the reading of data which corresponds to pushbutton states, interrupt masks, and edge captures, based on addresses provided. The module operates synchronously with a clock signal and has a reset mechanism. Additionally, it allows writing to registers to control interrupt masks and manually reset edge capture bits. The final output includes an interrupt signal and a read output for data retrieval based on the address selection."

The `readdata` port outputs information from the module depending on the `address` input, which could be the state of buttons, the status of interrupts, or edge detection. This data facilitates external systems in determining how to respond to changes detected by the module."
