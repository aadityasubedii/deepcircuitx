It does this by providing ROM data to other sub-modules for audio and video configurations, based on their corresponding ROM addresses. The module outputs combined configuration data by logically OR-ing audio and video ROM data, facilitating simultaneous audio-video setup during initialization. This combined data is likely used to configure the respective audio and video hardware components in accordance with predefined settings specified by different parameters (like AUD_LINE_IN_LC, AUD_DAC_PATH, etc.)."

This signal is filled by the `Auto_Init_Audio_ROM` submodule based on the `rom_address` input. It contributes to forming part of the final output `rom_data` by storing the audio configuration settings needed for initializing audio components.  \n- `video_rom_data`: Similarly, this 27-bit internal wire signal holds the configuration data fetched from the video ROM.
