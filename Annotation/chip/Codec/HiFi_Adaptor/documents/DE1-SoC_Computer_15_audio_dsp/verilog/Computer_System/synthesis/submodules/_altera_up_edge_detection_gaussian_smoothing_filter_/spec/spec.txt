Module name: altera_up_edge_detection_gaussian_smoothing_filter. 

Module specification: The altera_up_edge_detection_gaussian_smoothing_filter is a Verilog module designed to apply a Gaussian smoothing filter on input image data to reduce noise and detail, which aids in tasks like edge detection by highlighting pixel intensity changes. It processes 8-bit pixel intensity values using a series of shift registers and multiple computational stages to produce a 9-bit smoothed output. The module includes input ports for clock (clk) to synchronize data processing, reset to clear internal states, data_in which takes the 8-bit pixel data, and data_en that enables the processing of incoming data. The output port, data_out, delivers the smoothed pixel intensity. Internally, the module utilizes arrays of shift registers (`shift_reg_out`) and registers (`original_line_1` through `original_line_5`) to manage the flow and manipulation of image rows and pixel data. It employs a series of summing levels (`sum_level_1` through `sum_level_7`) to progressively compute and reduce data into the final smoothed output. The code is structured into initialization under reset conditions, data processing under data enable condition, and a series of instantiated shift registers each managed by separate always blocks facilitating a pipeline that contributes to forming the final Gaussian smoothed results.
