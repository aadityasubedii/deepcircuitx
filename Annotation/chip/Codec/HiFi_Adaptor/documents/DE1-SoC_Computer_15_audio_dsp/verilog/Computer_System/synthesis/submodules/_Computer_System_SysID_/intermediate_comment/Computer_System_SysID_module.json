    "module": "Module-level comment: The Computer_System_SysID module outputs a predefined system ID value (1468349175) on 'readdata' when 'address' is high and 0 when low, suitable for system identification tasks. It employs a combinational logic assignment where 'readdata' directly responds based on the 'address' input, while 'clock' and 'reset_n' are included as standard digital design practice without current functional use."
