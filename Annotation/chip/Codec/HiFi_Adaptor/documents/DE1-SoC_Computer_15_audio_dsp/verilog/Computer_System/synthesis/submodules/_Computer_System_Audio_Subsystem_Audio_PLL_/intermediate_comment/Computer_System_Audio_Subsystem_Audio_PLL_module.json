    "module": "Module-level comment: The module \"Computer_System_Audio_Subsystem_Audio_PLL\" functions as a PLL for audio systems, generating a stable audio clock from a reference signal. It features input for the reference clock (`ref_clk_clk`) and system reset (`ref_reset_reset`), outputs an audio clock (`audio_clk_clk`) and a conditional reset signal (`reset_source_reset`). Internally, it uses a PLL component for clock generation and a signal (`audio_pll_locked_export`) to manage reset conditions based on lock status."
