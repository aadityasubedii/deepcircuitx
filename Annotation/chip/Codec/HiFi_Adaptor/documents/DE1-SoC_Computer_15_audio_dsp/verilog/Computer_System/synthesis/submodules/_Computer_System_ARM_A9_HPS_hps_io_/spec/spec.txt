Module name: Computer_System_ARM_A9_HPS_hps_io.

Module specification: The `Computer_System_ARM_A9_HPS_hps_io` module serves as a vital I/O interface for the ARM A9 HPS (Hard Processor System), facilitating connectivity between the processor and various external interfaces such as memory components and peripheral devices. It encompasses multiple input, output, and bidirectional ports such as `mem_a` and `mem_ba` for memory addressing, `mem_ck` and `mem_ck_n` for memory clock operations, and specific ports for Ethernet MAC, SPI, SDIO, USB, UART, I2C, GPIO such as `hps_io_emac1_inst_RXD0` (Ethernet MAC receive data line 0) and `hps_io_spim1_inst_MISO` (Master In Slave Out for SPI), among others. There are no explicitly defined internal signals within the module; instead, it acts as a pass-through entity channeling signals directly to a sub-module named `Computer_System_ARM_A9_HPS_hps_io_border`. This submodule is likely responsible for managing signal integrity and isolation. The code structure includes the definition of the module with its I/O ports followed by the instantiating of the border submodule, mapping the respective signals directly to maintain a clean and organized interfacing arrangement, crucial for signal routing in complex systems like ARM A9 based computer systems. The module facilitates organized connectivity and clean interfacing with external components, critical for the system architecture's integrity and functionality.
