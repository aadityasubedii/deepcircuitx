    "spec": "Module name: Computer_System_Interval_Timer. Module specification: The Computer_System_Interval_Timer is designed to provide interval timing functionality in computer systems by managing a countdown counter through various control operations. It features several inputs: `address [2:0]` for selecting specific registers or actions; `chipselect` to enable module interactions; `clk` for synchronizing operations; `reset_n` for initializing module states; `write_n` as a write enable signal; and `writedata [15:0]` for data intended to be written into registers. The main outputs are `irq`, an interrupt request signal generated during a timeout event, and `readdata [15:0]`, which outputs data from internal registers based on the current address. Internally, the module uses signals such as `clk_en` (always on, enabling clock-dependent logic), `control_continuous` (determines if the counter reloads automatically upon reaching zero), and `internal_counter [31:0]` for the main countdown operation. The code is organized into blocks handling events like counter operations, reset conditions, interrupt management, and snapshot functionality which allows capturing and reading the counter's value at specific instances. This comprehensive setup empowers the module to efficiently handle timing operations enhanced by flexibility and external control capabilities.",

Module specification: The Computer_System_Interval_Timer is designed to provide interval timing functionality in computer systems by managing a countdown counter through various control operations. It features several inputs: `address [2:0]` for selecting specific registers or actions; `chipselect` to enable module interactions; `clk` for synchronizing operations; `reset_n` for initializing module states; `write_n` as a write enable signal; and `writedata [15:0]` for data intended to be written into registers. The main outputs are `irq`, an interrupt request signal generated during a timeout event, and `readdata [15:0]`, which outputs data from internal registers based on the current address. Internally, the module uses signals such as `clk_en` (always on, enabling clock-dependent logic), `control_continuous` (determines if the counter reloads automatically upon reaching zero), and `internal_counter [31:0]` for the main countdown operation. The code is organized into blocks handling events like counter operations, reset conditions, interrupt management, and snapshot functionality which allows capturing and reading the counter's value at specific instances. This comprehensive setup empowers the module to efficiently handle timing operations enhanced by flexibility and external control capabilities."
