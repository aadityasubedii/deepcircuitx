It processes incoming serial data using an IrDA deserializer and transmits outgoing data through an IrDA serializer. The module also manages interrupt signals based on specific conditions in the data buffers, keeps track of available read and write spaces, and ensures data integrity by handling parity checks. The operation of this module is clocked and sensitive to a reset signal, and it has facilities for interaction with a larger system through addressable registers that allow reading status and control registers, appropriately responding to different chipselect, read, and write operations."
