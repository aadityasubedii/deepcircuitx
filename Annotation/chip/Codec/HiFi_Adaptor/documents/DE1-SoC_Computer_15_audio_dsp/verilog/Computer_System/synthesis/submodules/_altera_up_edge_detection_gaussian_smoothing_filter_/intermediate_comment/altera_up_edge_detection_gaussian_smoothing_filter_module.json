    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_up_edge_detection_gaussian_smoothing_filter` module implements a Gaussian smoothing filter for image noise reduction and edge enhancement. It ingests 8-bit pixel data, processing through cascaded shift registers and multi-stage accumulations to deliver a 9-bit smoothed output. The module utilizes internal arrays for storing pixel rows and intermediate sums, and employs a clock-driven pipeline to manage data flow and smoothing computations efficiently."
