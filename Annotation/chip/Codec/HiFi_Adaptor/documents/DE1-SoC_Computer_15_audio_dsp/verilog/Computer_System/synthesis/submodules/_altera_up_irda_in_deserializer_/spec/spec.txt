Module name: altera_up_irda_in_deserializer. Module specification: The altera_up_irda_in_deserializer module is designed primarily for deserializing infrared communication data by managing serial data reception, storing it in a shift register, and transferring it to a FIFO buffer. The module has input ports namely 'clk' (clock input for synchronization), 'reset' (resets internal states and registers), 'serial_data_in' (receives serial data bits from the IR channel), and 'receive_data_en' (enables reading from the FIFO). The output ports include 'fifo_read_available' (an 8-bit indication of FIFO's status), 'received_data_valid' (indicates validity of the output data), and 'received_data' (carries the deserialized data, size parameterized by DW). Internal signals such as 'shift_data_reg_en' (enables data shift into the shift register), 'all_bits_received', 'fifo_is_empty', 'fifo_is_full', and 'fifo_used' provide status and control for data handling. The module includes capabilities handling timing parameters and data buffering by interfacing with 'altera_up_irda_counters' for managing counters and 'altera_up_sync_fifo' for FIFO operations. Overall, the module ensures effective data deserialization and reliable data availability for IR communication systems.
