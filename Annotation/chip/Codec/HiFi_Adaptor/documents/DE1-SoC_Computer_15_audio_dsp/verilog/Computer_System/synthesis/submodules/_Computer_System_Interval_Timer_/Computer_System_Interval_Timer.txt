Module-level comment: The Computer_System_Interval_Timer manages interval timing for computer systems using a countdown counter with adjustable settings. It handles start, stop, and auto-reload operations based on input commands and register settings. Counting synchronized to `clk`, the module generates an `irq` upon timeout, adjustable via control registers. Read and write operations to registers are facilitated by `address` and `chipselect` signals, accommodating dynamic configuration and state querying.
