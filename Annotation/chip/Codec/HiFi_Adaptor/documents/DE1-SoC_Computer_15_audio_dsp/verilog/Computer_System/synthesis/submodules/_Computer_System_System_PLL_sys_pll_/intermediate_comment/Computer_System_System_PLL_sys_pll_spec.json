    "spec": "Module name: Computer_System_System_PLL_sys_pll. Module specification: The 'Computer_System_System_PLL_sys_pll' is a Verilog module designed to generate two synchronized 100 MHz output clocks (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`) from a single reference clock (`refclk`) using an `altera_pll` component configured for fixed frequency synthesis without fractional multiplication. The module includes input ports for the reference clock (`refclk`), used to derive the system clocks, and reset (`rst`), which allows the PLL to be reinitialized or reset. The `rst` and `refclk` are directed to the PLL from these inputs. The output ports include the two 100 MHz clocks and a `locked` signal, indicating if the PLL has successfully locked onto the reference frequency. Apart from these connections, there are no other internal signals specifically defined within the module, as the `altera_pll` component manages all necessary internal signaling. The code structure consists mainly of the instantiation of the `altera_pll` component, which encompasses parameter settings such as clock frequencies, phase shifts, and operational mode, followed by mapping these configurations along with the module's ports (`rst`, `refclk`, `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `locked`) to the internal pins and outputs of the PLL. This setup ensures timing stability and synchronization crucial for dependable system operations where precise clock synchronization is mandatory.",

The module ensures that the outputs are synchronized to the reference clock, with `outclk_0` and `outclk_1` both set to 100 MHz.
