This is achieved by manipulating the rows of video data. The module reads video data frames, potentially stores and duplicates them to scale up the height based on certain conditions tracked by internal state machines (defined by the states `STATE_0_GET_CURRENT_LINE`, `STATE_1_LOOP_FIFO`, and `STATE_2_OUTPUT_LAST_LINE`). Data handling is managed using a FIFO buffer to accommodate the changes in video stream pacing due to the modification process. Operations are synchronized to the clock signal and are responsive to reset conditions, ensuring robustness in dynamic environments. The module interfaces indicate readiness to accept data and signal validity and boundaries (start/end of packet) of the output video data stream."
