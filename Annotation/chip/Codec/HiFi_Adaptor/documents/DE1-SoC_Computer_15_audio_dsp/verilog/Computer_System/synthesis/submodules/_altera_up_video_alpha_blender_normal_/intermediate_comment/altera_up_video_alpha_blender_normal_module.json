    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_up_video_alpha_blender_normal` module implements alpha blending between foreground and background colors. Inputs are RGB values for both layers with an alpha channel for the foreground. It outputs the blended RGB values. Internally, it uses `lpm_mult` multipliers for RGB calculations with alpha and `1-alpha`, combining these results to produce the final blended colors. This approach ensures precise control over color blending based on transparency levels."
