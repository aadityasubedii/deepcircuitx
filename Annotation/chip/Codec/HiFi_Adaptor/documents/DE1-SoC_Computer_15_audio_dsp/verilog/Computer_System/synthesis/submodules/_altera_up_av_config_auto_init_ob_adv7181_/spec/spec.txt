Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7181. 
Module specification: The altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7181 is a Verilog module designed for initializing configuration settings of a video processing chip, likely ADV7181, using a ROM lookup method. It receives a 6-bit input through the `rom_address` port, which selects configuration data from a predefined set mapped internally. The module then outputs a 27-bit formatted configuration word via the `rom_data` output port. This output is derived by interspersing each byte of a 24-bit internal register `data` with a zero bit, expanding the original 24 bits to 27 to meet specific communication or data format requirements. The `data` internal register serves as the medium to store the respective configuration setting, which is pre-determined in the module by a case statement within an 'always' block. This case statement maps each `rom_address` to a corresponding 24-bit dataâ€”from setting input controls to adjusting chroma gains, detailed with prefixed addresses and command bytes. Default data is presented if the `rom_address` does not match any predefined configurations.
