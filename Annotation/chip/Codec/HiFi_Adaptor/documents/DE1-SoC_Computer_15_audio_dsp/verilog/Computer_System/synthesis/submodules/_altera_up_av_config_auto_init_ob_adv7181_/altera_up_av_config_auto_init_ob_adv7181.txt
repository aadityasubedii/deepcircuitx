Module-level comment: The `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7181` module initializes configuration settings for a video processing chip using a ROM lookup method. It takes a 6-bit `rom_address` to select predefined configurations, which are stored in a 24-bit `data` register. The module formats this data into a 27-bit `rom_data` output by interspersing zero bits, effectively customizing chip settings such as input controls and chroma gains based on the address input.
