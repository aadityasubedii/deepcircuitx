Module name: `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser`. Module specification: The `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser` module is designed for safe data transfer across different clock domains in hardware designs, which helps in preventing data corruption due to clock domain asynchrony. This module takes two input clocks, `in_clk` (input domain clock) and `out_clk` (output domain clock), and respective reset signals `in_reset` and `out_reset`. Input ports include `in_valid`, which signals valid data accompanying `in_data`, and `out_ready`, which indicates downstream readiness to receive data. The output ports comprise `in_ready`, suggesting the moduleâ€™s readiness to accept new data, `out_valid`, signaling the validity of outgoing data, and `out_data`, the synchronized data to the destination domain. Internal signals such as `in_data_buffer` and `out_data_buffer` temporarily store data during transfer; `in_data_toggle`, a toggle indicating new data in the input buffer; and synchronization toggles `in_data_toggle_returned` and `out_data_toggle_flopped` help in managing data integrity and readiness across domains. The module incorporates synchronizers `altera_std_synchronizer` for toggles and conditionally includes output pipelining (`altera_avalon_st_pipeline_base`) based on configuration to align with timing requirements. The code effectively structures data buffering, synchronization, and optional pipelining to ensure robust and efficient data transfer across clock domains.
