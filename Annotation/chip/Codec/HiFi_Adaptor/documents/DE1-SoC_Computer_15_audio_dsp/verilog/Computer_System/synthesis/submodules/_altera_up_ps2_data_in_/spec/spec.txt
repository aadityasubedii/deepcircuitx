Module name: altera_up_ps2_data_in.
Module specification: The 'altera_up_ps2_data_in' module interfaces with a PS/2 device to receive serial data, handling it through a state machine with multiple states: idle, wait for data, data reception, parity handling, and stop bit confirmation. It synchronizes operations via the 'clk' input port and also supports manual resets through the 'reset' port. The module begins either waiting for incoming data ('wait_for_incoming_data') or immediately starts data reception ('start_receiving_data') based on control signals. The PS/2 clock's positive ('ps2_clk_posedge') and negative edges ('ps2_clk_negedge') help detect transitions, and 'ps2_data' reads in the actual data bits. The output is handled through an 8-bit 'received_data' register and an enabling signal 'received_data_en' that flags when the byte assembly is complete and valid. Internally, the module uses 'data_count' to track received bits, 'data_shift_reg' to assemble the data byte, 'ns_ps2_receiver' for determining the next state, and 's_ps2_receiver' indicating the current state. The Verilog code is structured into sections managing state transitions, bit counting, data shifting, and output flag control, ensuring operations adhere strictly to the PS/2 communication protocol and timing requirements. This design encapsulates effective PS/2 data handling with robust state machine architecture, facilitating reliable data reception in digital systems using PS/2 peripherals.
