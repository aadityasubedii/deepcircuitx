Module name: Computer_System_Audio_Subsystem_Audio_PLL_audio_pll.

Module specification: The `Computer_System_Audio_Subsystem_Audio_PLL_audio_pll` is a Verilog module designed to generate a stable clock signal of 12.288135 MHz for audio applications within a computer system's audio subsystem, using a reference clock of 50.0 MHz provided to a phase-locked loop (PLL). It consists of two main input ports: `refclk` (Reference Clock), which supplies the essential reference clock to the PLL, and `rst` (Reset), which is used to reset the PLL configurations. The output ports are `outclk_0` (Output Clock), the generated clock signal, and `locked` (Locked Signal), a status signal indicating the PLL's locked state. Internally, the module uses no user-defined signals but utilizes an instance of `altera_pll` configured with specific parameters defining frequency, phase, duty cycle for a single output clock while leaving others at zero defaults. This instance (named `altera_pll_i`) directly handles the `refclk`, `rst`, and additional control signals, and also outputs the ‘outclk_0’ and ‘locked’ states. The entire operation is executed within this PLL configuration block, without extra signal manipulation or generation in the module itself, leading to direct mapping from input to output through the `altera_pll_i` instantiation.
