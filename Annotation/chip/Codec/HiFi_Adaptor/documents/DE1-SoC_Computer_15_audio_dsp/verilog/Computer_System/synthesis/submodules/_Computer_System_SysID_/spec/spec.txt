Module name: Computer_System_SysID. Module specification: The Computer_System_SysID module is designed to provide a specific system identification value based on the state of an input address signal. It has three input ports: 'address', 'clock', and 'reset_n'. The 'address' input, when high, triggers the output 'readdata' to deliver a predefined system ID value of 1468349175, and when low, it outputs zero. The 'clock' and 'reset_n' inputs are provided standard to most digital systems, although they are not utilized in the current logic. The output port, 'readdata', is a 32-bit wide wire which directly represents the system ID or zero based on the input conditions. Internally, the module uses a single wire internal signal 'readdata', which is defined and assigned a value through a combinational logic statement using the ternary operator based on the state of the 'address'. This structure ensures immediate response to changes in input conditions. The code includes declarations of the module, definitions of input and output ports, instantiation of internal signal, and the primary functional assignment for the 'readdata' signal, all organized within straightforward and minimalistic combinational logic design blocks. This module is pivotal for checking system integrity or presence in larger hardware systems where a known identifier is essential for system validation and identification tasks.
