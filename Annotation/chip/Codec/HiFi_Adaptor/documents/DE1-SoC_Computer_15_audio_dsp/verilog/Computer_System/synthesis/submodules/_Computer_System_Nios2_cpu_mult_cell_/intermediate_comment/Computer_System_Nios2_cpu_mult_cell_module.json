    "module": "Module-level comment: The `Computer_System_Nios2_cpu_mult_cell` module performs 32-bit multiplications on inputs, supporting both signed and unsigned data. It utilizes four `altera_mult_add` instances to handle segment-based operations, dividing the input data into 16-bit parts for parallel processing. This setup enables efficient computation with configuration options via input signals indicating the signedness of the data, synchronized using a clock and an active-low reset. Outputs are four 32-bit products from different input segment combinations."
