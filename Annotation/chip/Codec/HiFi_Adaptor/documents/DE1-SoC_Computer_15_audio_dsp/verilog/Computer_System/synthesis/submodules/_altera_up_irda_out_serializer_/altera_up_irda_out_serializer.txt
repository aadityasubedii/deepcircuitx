Module-level comment: The 'altera_up_irda_out_serializer' serializes data for IR transmission using a FIFO. It handles data input through `transmit_data` when `transmit_data_en` is high, outputs serialized data via `serial_data_out`, and indicates FIFO status through `fifo_write_space`. Internal counters and FIFO manage data flow, state transitions, and timing. Ideal for IRDA compliant serial communication facilitated by synchronizing, shifting, and managing transmission statuses.
