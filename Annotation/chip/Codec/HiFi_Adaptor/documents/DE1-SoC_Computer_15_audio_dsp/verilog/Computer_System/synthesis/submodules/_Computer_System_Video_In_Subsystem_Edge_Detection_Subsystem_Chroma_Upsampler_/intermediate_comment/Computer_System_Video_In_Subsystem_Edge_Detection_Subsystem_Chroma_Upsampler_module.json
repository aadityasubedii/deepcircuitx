    "module": "Module-level comment: The Chroma Upsampler module performs chroma upsampling in a video stream by processing an input chroma signal into a formatted output where certain chroma values are standardized. It handles synchronization with a clock signal and allows resetting. Utilizes dual always blocks for data handling: one for capturing and resetting input and the other for output control based on conditions like reset states and output readiness. Upsampling logic fixes some output bits to preset values while passing input luminance directly."
