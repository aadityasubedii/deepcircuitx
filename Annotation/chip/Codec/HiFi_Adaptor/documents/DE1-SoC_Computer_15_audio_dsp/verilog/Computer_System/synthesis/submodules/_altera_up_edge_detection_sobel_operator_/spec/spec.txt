Module name: altera_up_edge_detection_sobel_operator. 
Module specification: The 'altera_up_edge_detection_sobel_operator' Verilog module is designed to detect edges within image data using the Sobel operator, specifically tailored for hardware implementations like FPGAs. It operates on pixel data that is synchronously processed at every positive edge of the `clk` based on the enable signal `data_en`. The module processes 9-bit input pixel data (`data_in`), and the output edge detected result is a 10-bit value (`data_out`). Key internal signals include `shift_reg_out` that captures shifted pixel data from two instantiated shift registers, `original_line_1, original_line_2, original_line_3` which store consecutive lines of pixel data, and `gx_level_1, gx_level_2, gx_level_3`, `gy_level_1, gy_level_2, gy_level_3` that store intermediate sums and differences during the Sobel operation for horizontal and vertical edges respectively. The results from calculating horizontal and vertical gradients are stored in `gx_magnitude` and `gy_magnitude`, with signs in `gx_sign` and `gy_sign`. The module defines the overall edge strength (`g_magnitude`) and direction (`gy_over_gx`) in its result. The code includes block instances for shift registers that shift incoming data, forming a pipeline that assists in accessing neighboring pixel values, crucial for the Sobel computation.
