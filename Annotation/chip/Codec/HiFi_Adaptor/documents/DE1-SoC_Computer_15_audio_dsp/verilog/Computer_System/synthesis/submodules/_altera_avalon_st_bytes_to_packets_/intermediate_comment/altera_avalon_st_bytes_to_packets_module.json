    "module": "Module-level comment: The altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets module converts byte-stream data into packetized data, adhering to predefined packet delimiters and channel encoding rules. It manages packet integrity through internal flags for escape and channel processing, conditional handling based on input validity and readiness, and dynamically adjusts its operation based on parameter settings for channel width. The module ensures smooth data transformation and communication flow within packet-based systems."
