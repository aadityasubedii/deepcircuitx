Module-level comment: The "altera_customins_master_translator" module functions as a configurable interface translator between custom instruction master and slave interfaces in Altera FPGA architectures. It accepts various control, data, and clock signals, channeling them into either combinatorial or multi-cycle master outputs based on the `SHARED_COMB_AND_MULTI` parameter. This parameter enables separate or shared signal handling between interfaces, adapting to specific operational requirements and ensuring efficient and flexible custom instruction management.
