Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de2_115. 
Module specification: The 'altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de2_115' module is designed for initializing audio and video configurations on FPGA systems by providing ROM data to audio and video sub-modules. It features a 6-bit input port 'rom_address' used to specify ROM addresses that fetch configuration data for audio and video settings. The output from this module is a 27-bit 'rom_data' signal, which results from a logical OR operation between the audio and video configuration data fetched from their respective ROMs. Internally, the module utilizes two 27-bit signals: 'audio_rom_data' and 'video_rom_data', which store the configuration data from the audio ROM and video ROM, respectively. These data are fetched by two submodules: 'Auto_Init_Audio_ROM' and 'Auto_Init_Video_ROM', which are configured via parameters for specific audio settings (such as line inputs, DAC path, ADC path, etc.) and handle video settings correspondingly. The core functionality of the module is to combine the configuration data from these two submodules and to provide a unified configuration output for initializing the audio-video hardware on the board.
