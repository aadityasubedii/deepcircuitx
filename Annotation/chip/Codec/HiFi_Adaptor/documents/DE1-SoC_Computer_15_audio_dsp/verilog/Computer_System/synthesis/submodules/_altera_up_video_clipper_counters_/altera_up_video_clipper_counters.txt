Module-level comment: The "altera_up_video_clipper_counters" module manages frame counting for video processing through synchronized counters for horizontal (width) and vertical (height) dimensions driven by a clock signal. It supports resetting counters and selectively increments based on control inputs, ultimately providing start/end signals for both the outer and designated inner frames, and validates the current position within the inner frame using internally managed validity flags, facilitating dynamic boundary tracking in video clipping applications.
