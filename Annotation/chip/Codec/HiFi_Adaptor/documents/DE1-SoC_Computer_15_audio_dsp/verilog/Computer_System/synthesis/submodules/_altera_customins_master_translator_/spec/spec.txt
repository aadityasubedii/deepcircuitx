Module name: altera_customins_master_translator.
Module specification: The "altera_customins_master_translator" is a Verilog module designed for interfacing and translating signals between custom instruction master and slave interfaces in Altera FPGA architectures. It selectively routes input signals from the slave interface across either combinatorial or multi-cycle master outputs depending on the configuration specified by the module parameter `SHARED_COMB_AND_MULTI`. Input ports include various data, control, and clock signals such as `ci_slave_dataa`, `ci_slave_datab` (32-bit data operands), control signals (`ci_slave_readra`, `ci_slave_readrb`, `ci_slave_writerc` for read/write operations), and clock and control signals for multi-cycle operations (`ci_slave_multi_clk`, `ci_slave_multi_clken`, etc.). Output ports include the results back to slave interfaces (`ci_slave_result`, `ci_slave_multi_result`) and transferred signals to the master interfaces like `comb_ci_master_dataa`, `comb_ci_master_datab` for combinatorial operations, and `multi_ci_master_dataa`, `multi_ci_master_datab` for multi-cycle operations. An internal signal, `SHARED_COMB_AND_MULTI`, dictates operational mode, determining whether combinatorial and multi-cycle interfaces share signals or operate independently. The code features two main conditional blocks managed by a `generate if` statement, which adaptively reroutes the handling of input/output signal assignment based on the active mode indicated by `SHARED_COMB_AND_MULTI`. This organization facilitates flexible, accurate signal translation essential for custom instruction operations in diverse FPGA configurations.
