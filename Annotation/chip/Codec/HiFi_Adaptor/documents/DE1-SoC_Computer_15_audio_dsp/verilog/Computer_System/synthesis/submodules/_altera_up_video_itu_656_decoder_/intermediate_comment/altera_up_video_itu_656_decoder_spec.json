    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_video_itu_656_decoder.\nModule specification: The `altera_up_video_itu_656_decoder` is a Verilog module designed to decode ITU-R BT.656 formatted serialized video data into processed video streams with control signals indicating the data validity and packet boundaries. The inputs include `clk` (synchronizing clock), `reset` (which resets the module state), `TD_DATA` (8-bit serialized video data), and `ready` (downstream component's readiness). The outputs are `data` (16-bit processed video data), `startofpacket` (marks beginning of a video packet), `endofpacket` (marks the end of a video packet), and `valid` (indicates validity of the output data). Internally, the module utilizes signals like `timing_reference`, `start_of_an_even_line`, `start_of_an_odd_line`, `last_data`, `io_register`, and several others to manage data processing, line start detection, and video data alignment. Its logic is divided into blocks handling data latching in shift registers, detection of timing references, monitoring line start conditions based on timing references, generating processed video data and control packets, and an instantiated submodule `altera_up_video_decoder_add_endofpacket` which further processes the signals to add end-of-packet flags. This submodule is parameterized with a defined width of 15 bits for compatibility with the internal data size. Overall, this decoder module effectively manages the decoding and formatting of incoming serialized video streams for applications aligned with the ITU-R BT.656 standard.",

The module takes in serialized video data (TD_DATA) and the clock signal (clk), and outputs processed video data (data) along with control signals like startofpacket, endofpacket, and valid to indicate the start and end of video packets and the validity of the output data respectively.

                    "text": "Module name: altera_up_video_itu_656_decoder.\nModule specification: The `altera_up_video_itu_656_decoder` is a Verilog module designed to decode ITU-R BT.656 formatted serialized video data into processed video streams with control signals indicating the data validity and packet boundaries. The inputs include `clk` (synchronizing clock), `reset` (which resets the module state), `TD_DATA` (8-bit serialized video data), and `ready` (downstream component's readiness). The outputs are `data` (16-bit processed video data), `startofpacket` (marks beginning of a video packet), `endofpacket` (marks the end of a video packet), and `valid` (indicates validity of the output data). Internally, the module utilizes signals like `timing_reference`, `start_of_an_even_line`, `start_of_an_odd_line`, `last_data`, `io_register`, and several others to manage data processing, line start detection, and video data alignment. Its logic is divided into blocks handling data latching in shift registers, detection of timing references, monitoring line start conditions based on timing references, generating processed video data and control packets, and an instantiated submodule `altera_up_video_decoder_add_endofpacket` which further processes the signals to add end-of-packet flags. This submodule is parameterized with a defined width of 15 bits for compatibility with the internal data size. Overall, this decoder module effectively manages the decoding and formatting of incoming serialized video streams for applications aligned with the ITU-R BT.656 standard."
