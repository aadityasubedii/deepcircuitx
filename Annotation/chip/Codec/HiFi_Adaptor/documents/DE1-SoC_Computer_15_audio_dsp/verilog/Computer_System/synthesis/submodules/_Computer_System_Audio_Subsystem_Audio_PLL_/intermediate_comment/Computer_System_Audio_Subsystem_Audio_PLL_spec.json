Module specification: The \"Computer_System_Audio_Subsystem_Audio_PLL\" module is designed as a phase-locked loop (PLL) specifically for generating a stable audio clock signal from a reference clock in audio applications. This module takes two input signals: `ref_clk_clk`, which serves as the reference clock signal for the PLL, and `ref_reset_reset`, which is a reset signal to initialize the PLL's internal state. The outputs of the module are `audio_clk_clk`, the audio-specific clock signal produced by the PLL, and `reset_source_reset`, a reset signal that depends on the PLL's lock status. Internally, the module utilizes a signal named `audio_pll_locked_export` to indicate the lock status of the PLL, essential for managing the reset condition of dependent systems. The module includes two major components \u2013 `Computer_System_Audio_Subsystem_Audio_PLL_audio_pll` that handles the main PLL operations including clock generation and lock status, and `altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal` responsible for generating the output reset signal (`reset_source_reset`) based on the PLL's lock condition, ensuring the system remains in reset until the clock signal is stable.",

It takes an input reference clock (`ref_clk_clk`) and a reset signal (`ref_reset_reset`). It outputs an audio clock signal (`audio_clk_clk`) and a reset signal (`reset_source_reset`).
