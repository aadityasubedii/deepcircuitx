It uses a shift register component (`altshift_taps_component`) to manage the input data `shiftin` using a clock signal `clock`. The module enables the shifting operation when the enable signal `clken` is high. It outputs shifted data through `shiftout` and 'taps' which represents a specific bit or set of bits tapped from the shift register. The shift operation's specifics, such as the width of data and the number of taps (which is set to 1 in this case), are configured through parameters. The `SIZE` parameter controls the tap distance, effectively setting the depth of the shift operation in relation to pixel processing requirements in edge detection. This setup is typically used in video or image processing contexts where pixel data needs to be manipulated or analyzed sequentially."

It allows the shift operation to proceed when set to high, acting as a control to enable or disable the shifting mechanism based on external conditions or requirements.\n- `clock`: This is the primary clock signal for the shift register. It governs the timing of the data shifting operation, ensuring that data shifts synchronously with this clock signal.\n- `shiftin`: This input represents the 2-bit data that is to be shifted into the register. In the context of edge detection in image processing, this data would typically be pixel-related information fed into the shift register for processing.\n\nOutput ports: `shiftout`, `taps`. \nExplanation: \n- `shiftout`: This output provides the 2-bit data that has been shifted out following the processing in the shift register. It represents the processed data which can be used for further analysis or operations.\n- `taps`: This output offers a tapped 2-bit data from the shift register. The taps are specific bits or sets of bits tapped from intermediate points (or the final point) in the shift register. In this particular implementation, it is a way to monitor or utilize intermediate data states within the shift register during the edge detection process."
