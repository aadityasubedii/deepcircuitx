Module-level comment: The "altera_jtag_streaming" module manages JTAG data streaming within FPGA systems, supporting operations across data, debug, and control contexts. It uses input ports like `tck`, `tdi`, and `ir_in` to control data flow through state machines and internal logic, handling states such as Capture-DR, Shift-DR, and Update-DR. Output data is managed via synchronization blocks and stream manipulators like idle inserters and removers, enabling effective data alignment and handling for multiple JTAG functionalities. This structured approach ensures precise control and diagnostics in real-time JTAG operations.
