Module name: credit_producer. Module specification: The `credit_producer` is a Verilog module designed to manage and increment credit counters for symbols and packets based on input data conditions. It operates under the synchronization of a system clock (`clk`) and an active-low reset (`reset_n`). Inputs include `in_valid` (data validity), `in_ready` (system readiness to accept data), and `in_endofpacket` (signal indicating the end of a packet). The outputs are `symbol_credits` and `packet_credits`, which track the number of symbol and packet credits, respectively. Internally, the module utilises signals such as `beat` (indicating an active data transfer), `eop_beat` (indicating an end-of-packet during an active transfer), `sym_count` and `next_sym_count` (temporary counters for symbols processed), and `rollover` (determining resets and credit increments based on symbol count thresholds). The code comprises different sections handling specific tasks: initialization and resetting of outputs on signal or clock changes, calculating credits for each beat based on symbols per beat and symbols per credit, managing symbol and packet credit increments based on conditions like end-of-packet or calculated thresholds. The design effectively combines parameterized configurations, conditional logic, and regular clock-edge triggered blocks to manage and compute credits accurately within a data processing environment.
