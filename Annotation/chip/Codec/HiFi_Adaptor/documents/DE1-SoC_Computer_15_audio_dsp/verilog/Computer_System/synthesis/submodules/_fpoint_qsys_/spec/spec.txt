Module name: fpoint_qsys. Module specification: This module implements a floating-point arithmetic unit capable of performing multiplication and addition/subtraction operations on 32-bit floating-point numbers. It takes input operands (dataa and datab), a 2-bit operation selector (n), and control signals (clk, clk_en, reset, start). The module outputs a 32-bit result and a done signal. Internally, it uses registered versions of input operands (dataa_regout and datab_regout), a counter (counter_out) for operation timing, and separate sub-modules for multiplication (the_fp_mult) and addition/subtraction (the_fp_addsub). The module selects between multiplication and addition/subtraction based on the n input, with n=0 for multiplication and n=1 or n=2 for addition/subtraction. The add_
