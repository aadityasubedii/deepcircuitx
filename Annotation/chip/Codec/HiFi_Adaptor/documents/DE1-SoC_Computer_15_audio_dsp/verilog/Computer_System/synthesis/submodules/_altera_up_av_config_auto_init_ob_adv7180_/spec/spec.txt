Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7180. Module specification: The `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7180` module is designed for initializing and configuring an ADV7180 video decoder chip specifically for use with Altera devices. It incorporates a single input port `rom_address` which is a 6-bit input used to select specific video configuration settings. Each address points to a particular parameter or setting in the ADV7180 chip such as input control, output control, brightness, hue and more. The corresponding data for these parameters is output through a 27-bit output port `rom_data`. This output is the formatted configuration data, where each 16-bit parameter from an internal signal registry is prefixed by an 8-bit code and interspersed with zero bits for alignment. The internal signal `data` is a 24-bit register utilized to hold and manipulate the configuration data based on the `rom_address` provided. The main Verilog code block includes parameter definitions specifying various configuration constants, an assignment statement constructing the output `rom_data` from `data`, and an always block with a case statement used to assign the correct parameters to `data` as per the `rom_address`. The design facilitates dynamic, address-based configuration setup for the video decoder within a hardware description context.
