The module takes two inputs, `background_data` and `foreground_data`, where the highest bit (bit 39) of `foreground_data` determines if the corresponding foreground or background color's bit should be used in the output. If the alpha bit is high, the respective 10-bit segment (red, green, or blue) from the `foreground_data` is output; if the alpha bit is low, the respective segment from the `background_data` is used. The result is a new set of RGB values, `new_red`, `new_green`, and `new_blue`, each derived by combining the background and foreground information based on the alpha blending rule."

The `foreground_data` input is a 40-bit port where the highest bit (bit 39) serves as an alpha bit to determine the blending of foreground and background colors. The remaining bits provide the RGB data for the foreground color, also segmented into 10 bits per color channel.\n\nOutput ports: `new_red`, `new_green`, `new_blue`.  \nExplanation: The outputs `new_red`, `new_green`, and `new_blue` are each 10-bit ports representing the red, green, and blue components of the blended color, respectively. These outputs are computed based on the alpha bit from the `foreground_data`. If the alpha bit is set, the foreground color is used; if the alpha bit is clear, the background color is taken."
