    "module": "Module-level comment: This Verilog module, Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Video_In_Chroma_Resampler, handles chroma resampling by alternating Cr and Cb components in a video stream. Utilizing inputs like `stream_in_data` with control signals, and outputs that maintain data integrity and flow control, it performs data buffering, conditional data transfer, and arranges chrominance bytes based on a toggle mechanism. This synchronization ensures seamless integration within video processing systems.\n"
