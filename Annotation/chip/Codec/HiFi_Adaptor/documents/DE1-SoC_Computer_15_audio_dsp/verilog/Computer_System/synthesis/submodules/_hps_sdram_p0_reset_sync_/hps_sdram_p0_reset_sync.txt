Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync` module synchronizes an asynchronous active-low reset signal (`reset_n`) to a clock domain driven by `clk`. It uses `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` flip-flops to filter glitches and stabilize the reset, outputting the processed signal via `reset_n_sync`. The synchronization is handled through a dynamic series of stages within a generate block, ensuring robust, glitch-free operation in downstream synchronous logic.
