    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL_video_pll' module uses a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) to generate three VGA-compatible clock outputs from a 50 MHz input reference clock ('refclk'). It contains an `altera_pll` instance configured to produce specified frequencies (25.0 MHz for outclk_0 & outclk_1, 33.0 MHz for outclk_2), and a `locked` signal indicating stable output. The PLL is managed through inputs for reset (`rst`) and reference clock to synchronize and stabilize the output clocks effectively for VGA applications."
