Alpha blending is a process that combines an overlay color (foreground) with a base color (background), resulting in a mix that depends on the level of transparency of the foreground. The foreground color's alpha (transparency) value is included in the `foreground_data` input, driving how much of the background color should be visible. The module computes the new red, green, and blue values based on these inputs using specified multipliers that manage the alpha weighting, and outputs the blended color values."

It also includes an additional 10 bits for the alpha channel.

Each port outputs 10 bits, which are the result of mixing the background and foreground colors taking into account the alpha value from the foreground data.

It represents the portion of the background color that will influence the final blended color, essentially serving as the coefficient for the background contribution in the blending equation.\n- r_x_alpha: Represents the result of multiplication of the red component from the foreground color data with the alpha value. It determines how much of the foreground's red color will influence the final blended red color.\n- g_x_alpha: Similar to `r_x_alpha`, but for the green component. This product calculates how much of the foreground's green color affects the final blended green color.\n- b_x_alpha: Corresponds to the blue component, functioning just like the previous signals but for the blue color. It dictates the contribution of the foreground's blue color in the final color output.\n- r_x_one_minus_alpha: This signal is the multiplication result of the red component of the background color and `one_minus_a`. It shows how much of the background's red color will impact the resulting red color on blending.\n- g_x_one_minus_alpha: Functions the same as `r_x_one_minus_alpha` but for the green component, calculating the contribution of the background's green color.\n- b_x_one_minus_alpha: Similarly for the blue component, it computes the contribution of the background's blue color after being scaled by the value of `one_minus_a`.\n\nThese internal signals effectively calculate the influence of each color component from both the foreground and background, scaled by their respective weight defined by the alpha and its complement. The final blended colors (new_red, new_green, new_blue) are obtained by adding the corresponding results from these calculations."
