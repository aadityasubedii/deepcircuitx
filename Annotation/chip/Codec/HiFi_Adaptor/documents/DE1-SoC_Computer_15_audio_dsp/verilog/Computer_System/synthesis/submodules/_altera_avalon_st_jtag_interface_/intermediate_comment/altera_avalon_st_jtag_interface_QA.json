The parameters allow customization of FIFO sizes, management data channel widths, and the ability to integrate with software simulations through a PLI (Programming Language Interface). It supports handling JTAG operations in two parts: normal operation and PLI-based simulation. In normal operation, it uses \"altera_jtag_dc_streaming\" to handle data streaming across JTAG. In PLI mode, it employs simulation-specific tasks using `$do_transaction`.\n\nIn the control path, it checks for different states of JTAG transitions (like Capture-DR, Shift-DR, etc.) and reacts accordingly based on whether JTAG is exported directly or the system is under simulation. The module provides output signals like JTAG IRQ and data flow controls which are essential for integrated systems testing and debugging."
