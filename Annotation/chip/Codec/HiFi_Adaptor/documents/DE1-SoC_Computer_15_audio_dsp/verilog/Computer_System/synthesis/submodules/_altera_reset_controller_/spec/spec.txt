Module name: altera_reset_controller. Module specification: The 'altera_reset_controller' module is crucial for managing and synchronizing up to 16 reset signals from various subsystems in a digital design, ensuring system stability and preventing metastability issues. It features input ports named 'reset_in0' to 'reset_in15' for the incoming reset signals, as well as 'reset_req_in0' to 'reset_req_in15' for reset request signals, and a 'clk' input for the clock. The module outputs consist of a synchronized reset output ('reset_out') and a reset request signal ('reset_req'). Internally, the module uses signals such as 'merged_reset' and 'merged_reset_req_in' to combine all reset inputs and reset requests, respectively, and 'reset_out_pre' and 'reset_req_pre' for intermediate synchronization results. The code includes blocks like conditional generation sections based on parameters which control the synchronization depth and reset request processing behavior using internal shift registers ('altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain', 'r_sync_rst_chain') for extending and managing reset timings effectively. The parameters set the operational characteristics such as the number of reset inputs, minimum reset assertion time, and whether reset requests adapt based on output edge types, reflecting a highly configurable and adaptable module architecture.
