Module name: Computer_System_AV_Config. Module specification: The Computer_System_AV_Config serves as an I2C interface management system that handles the configuration of audio and video settings for a computer system. Primary functionalities include reading and writing to configuration registers and managing state transitions based on these operations. It manages auto-initialization through ROM data and supports dynamic adjustments to AV configuration settings through external I2C communication, ensuring proper synchronization and error handling.

This module's **input ports** include `clk` (the main clock signal), `reset` (resets internal states and registers), `address`, `byteenable`, `read`, `write` (manage specific data transfer operations), `writedata` (holds data to be written into registers), and `I2C_SDAT` (bidirectional line for data transmission). The **output ports** are `readdata` (carries data read from target registers), `waitrequest` (controls the read or write operations based on module availability), `irq` (interrupt request for designated conditions), `I2C_SCEN`, and `I2C_SCLK` (control and synchronize data transmission via I2C).

**Internal signals** such as `internal_reset`, `rom_address`, `ack`, and others interact with data and help control the flow and state of data transmissions internally, for instance, `ack` is used for acknowledgment from I2C devices. The `auto_init_error`, `transfer_mask`, and `start_transfer` variables play roles in managing data integrity and operational flow during data transfers. 

The **code structure** consists of several parts allocated for state management (`ns_serial_transfer` and `s_serial_transfer`), data reading and writing blocks, and configuration handling. The external modules like `altera_up_av_config_auto_init` and `altera_up_av_config_serial_bus_controller` are instantiated for initialization and I2C bus control functionalities respectively, expanding the capabilities of managing ROM data and I2C communications efficiently. The module leverages parameters such as `DW`, `CFG_TYPE`, and states (`STATE_0_IDLE` to `STATE_6_POST_READ`) to control the logic and operational behavior effectively. This thorough integration of controllers, state machines, and signal management enables the Computer_System_AV_Config module to efficiently control AV configurations through robust I2C communication protocols.
