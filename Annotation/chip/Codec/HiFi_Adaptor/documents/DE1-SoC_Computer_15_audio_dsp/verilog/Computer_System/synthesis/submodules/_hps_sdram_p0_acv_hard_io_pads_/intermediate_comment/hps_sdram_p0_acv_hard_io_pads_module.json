    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_io_pads\" module interfaces DDR SDRAM by transforming input signals into DDR-compatible signals and managing their timings via PHY interfaces. It handles diverse inputs like reset signals, clock inputs, and DDR commands/constants, managing signal optimization and integrity. Various internal signals and generate constructs maneuver data and control paths dynamically, particularized by parameters for system specifications."
