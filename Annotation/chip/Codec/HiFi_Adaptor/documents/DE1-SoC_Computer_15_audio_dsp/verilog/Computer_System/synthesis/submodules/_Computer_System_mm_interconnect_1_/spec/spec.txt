Module name: Computer_System_mm_interconnect_1. Module specification: This module is an interconnect component in a computer system, managing connections and data transfers between various system components such as the ARM A9 HPS, VGA subsystem, SDRAM, and on-chip SRAM. It handles address translation, data width adaptation, burst transfers, and arbitration between multiple masters and slaves. The module has numerous input and output ports, including AXI master interfaces for the ARM A9 HPS, Avalon-MM interfaces for other components, and various control signals. Internal signals are used for routing, demultiplexing, and adapting data between different interfaces. The module is composed of several sub-blocks, including AXI and Avalon-MM agents, routers, demultiplexers, width adapters, burst adapters, and response FIFOs. These components work together to facilitate efficient communication
