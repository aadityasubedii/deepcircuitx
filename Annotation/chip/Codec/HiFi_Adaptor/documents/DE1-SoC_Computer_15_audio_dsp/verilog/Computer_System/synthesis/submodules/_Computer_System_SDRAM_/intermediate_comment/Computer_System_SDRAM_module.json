    "module": "Module-level comment: This module interfaces with SDRAM for read/write operations. It manages complex command sequences including initialization, refresh, and data transactions. The module uses FSMs for initialization and main operations, handles input through an embedded FIFO, and controls SDRAM timing and commands. It processes address/data inputs, manages refresh cycles, and orchestrates read/write operations while adhering to SDRAM protocols and timing requirements."
