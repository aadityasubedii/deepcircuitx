Module name: Computer_System_Nios2_2nd_Core_cpu_test_bench. Module specification: This module serves as a testbench for a CPU core, likely part of a Nios II processor system. It monitors various CPU signals and performs error checking on key operations. The module has numerous input ports for CPU signals, including comparison results, exception handling signals, write data, branch prediction information, memory access signals, and instruction word details. Output ports provide filtered versions of certain input signals, removing 'x' (unknown) values to ensure clean data for testing. Internal signals are used for exception handling, instruction decoding, and pipeline control. The module implements several always blocks that check for 'x' values on critical signals during simulation, reporting errors and stopping the simulation if unexpected values are detected. It also includes logic for filtering data signals, handling branch prediction, and managing the CPU's pipeline stages (A, M, and W stages).
