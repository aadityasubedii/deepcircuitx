Module name: Computer_System_mm_interconnect_0. Module specification: This module serves as an interconnect component for a computer system, managing communication between various parts including an ARM A9 processor, audio subsystem, and AV configuration interface. It handles address translation, data routing, and protocol conversion between different bus interfaces such as AXI and Avalon. The module has input ports for AXI master signals from the ARM A9 processor, system clock, reset signals, and Avalon master signals from the audio bus master. Output ports include AXI master signals back to the ARM A9 processor, signals for the audio subsystem slave interface, AV configuration slave interface, and response signals for the audio bus master. Internal signals are used for various purposes including protocol translation, response multiplexing, agent communication, data buffering, and routing management. The module is structured with several sub-blocks including AXI and Avalon
