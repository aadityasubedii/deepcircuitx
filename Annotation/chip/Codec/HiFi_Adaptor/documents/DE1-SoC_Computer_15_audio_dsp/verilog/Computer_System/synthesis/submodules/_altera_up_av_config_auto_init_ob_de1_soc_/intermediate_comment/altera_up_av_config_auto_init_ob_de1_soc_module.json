    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de1_soc\" module initializes configuration data for audio and video systems on the DE1-SoC board. It employs a 6-bit address input to fetch specific setup values from two submodules, which manage audio and video configurations, respectively. These configurations are combined using a bitwise OR operation to produce a 27-bit output used for system settings. Each submodule parameters are set based on predefined constants related to audio and video components."
