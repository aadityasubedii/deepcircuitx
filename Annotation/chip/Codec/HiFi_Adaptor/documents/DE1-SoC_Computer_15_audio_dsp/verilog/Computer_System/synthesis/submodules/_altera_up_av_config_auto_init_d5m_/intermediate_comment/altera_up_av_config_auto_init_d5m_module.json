    "module": "Module-level comment: The altera_up_av_config_auto_init_d5m module initializes configuration settings for D5M cameras, adjusting settings based on the `rom_address` input. It dynamically sets exposure via the `exposure` input and formats the 32-bit configuration data into a 36-bit output, `rom_data`, to meet camera interface requirements. The configuration logic is managed through a case statement within an always block, ensuring the correct settings are produced for each camera function."
