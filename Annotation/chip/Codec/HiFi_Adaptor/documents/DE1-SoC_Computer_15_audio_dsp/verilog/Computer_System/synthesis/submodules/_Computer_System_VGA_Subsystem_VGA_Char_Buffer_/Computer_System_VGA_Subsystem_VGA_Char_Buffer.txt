Module-level comment: The `Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Char_Buffer` manages VGA display text by interfacing with character memory and control registers. It processes input control and buffer signals to handle read/write operations, synchronizes video data output based on stream readiness, and employs internal signals for timing and data organization. This module crucially supports VGA signal generation and display formatting, coordinated by clock-driven logic and memory operations within Verilog code.
