    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a floating-point arithmetic unit supporting multiplication, addition/subtraction, and division operations on IEEE 754 single-precision numbers. It uses separate sub-modules for each operation, selected by a 2-bit input. The module registers input operands, employs a counter for operation timing, and generates a done signal upon completion. It handles various edge cases and exceptional conditions as per IEEE 754 standards."
