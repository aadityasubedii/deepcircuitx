Module name: hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc. 
Module specification: The hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc module orchestrates clock management for SDRAM operations on high-performance systems which is indicated by the parameter "IS_HHP_HPS". This module accepts multiple clock inputs: pll_hr_clk for high-resolution applications, pll_dq_clk for data operations, and pll_dqs_clk for data strobe operations, alongside a delay control bus dll_phy_delayctrl to fine-tune clock phases. Output clocks include afi_clk for the FPGA-SDRAM interface, avl_clk and hr_clk for high-resolution operations, and adc_clk along with adc_clk_cps for address and command operations, where adc_clk can potentially be phase-inverted. Internal signals, like phy_clk_dqs and phy_clk_hr, are derived from the respective input clocks and are further engineered within the module through buffers and phase selectors to produce conditioned outputs. The module conditionally uses a clock buffer (cyclonev_phy_clkbuf) or sets phy_clk_dqs_2x to zero based on "IS_HHP_HPS". Clock leveling (cyclonev_leveling_delay_chain) and phase adjustment (cyclonev_clk_phase_select) blocks are used for generating different leveled and phase-managed clock signals which feed into the output ports. This detailed orchestration ensures that the clocks provided to SDRAM are suitably conditioned for optimal operation within the systemâ€™s high-performance parameters.
