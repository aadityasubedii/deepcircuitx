Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser` module ensures safe data transfer between different clock domains, preventing corruption due to asynchrony. It utilizes dual-domain data buffering (`in_data_buffer` and `out_data_buffer`), toggle-based synchronization (`in_data_toggle`, `out_data_toggle`), and signal synchronizers to manage data integrity. Optional output pipelining can be enabled to meet specific timing requirements, enhancing throughput and reliability.
