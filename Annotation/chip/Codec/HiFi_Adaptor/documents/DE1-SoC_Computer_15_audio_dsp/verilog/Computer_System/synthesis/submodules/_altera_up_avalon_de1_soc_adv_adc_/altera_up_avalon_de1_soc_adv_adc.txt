Module-level comment: The `altera_up_avalon_de1_soc_adv_adc` module serves as an ADC controller on the Altera DE1-SoC FPGA, managing the digital conversion of 8 analog input channels through a state-driven design. It interfaces with ADC hardware using SPI-like signals (`sclk`, `cs_n`, `din`), handling initialization, data transmission, and error management across several states (`resetState`, `waitState`, `transState`, `doneState`, `pauseState`, `initCtrlRegState`, `pauseStateNoAddrIncr`). Key internal mechanisms include shift registers for data handling, counters for timing control, and a state machine coordinating the sequence of operations, ensuring reliable data acquisition.
