Module name: Computer_System_mm_interconnect_4. 
Module specification: The "Computer_System_mm_interconnect_4" module serves as an interface for facilitating data transactions between the video DMA master and control slave within a computer system's video subsystem. It synchronously manages data transfers through two critical translator sub-modules, ensuring effective communication between interface standards. The module receives input ports including a system clock (`System_PLL_sys_clk_clk`), reset signals (`Video_In_DMA_Addr_Translation_reset_reset_bridge_in_reset_reset` and `Video_In_Subsystem_sys_reset_reset_bridge_in_reset_reset`), DMA master controller signals (address, byteenable, read, write, writedata), and slave read data. Additionally, it outputs DMA master control signals (waitrequest, readdata) along with slave control signals (address, write, read, writedata, byteenable). Internal signals, such as waitrequest, readdata, debugaccess, among others, manage the detailed handshake and data integrity checks required between the DMA master and slave transactions. The code architecture encompasses two main blocks: `altera_merlin_master_translator` and `altera_merlin_slave_translator`, which translate Avalon interface signals to universal standards and vice versa, respectively. This modular design ensures robust data transactions, appropriate synchronization, and compliance with interface protocols within the video subsystem operation.
