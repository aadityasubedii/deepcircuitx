It increments these credits either per symbol or per packet based on the given parameters and conditions. The module accounts for symbols per credit and packets, adjusting the `symbol_credits` and `packet_credits` accordingly every clock cycle where conditions are met.

This is used in conjunction with `in_ready` to manage the flow of data and the accumulation of credits.\n- `in_ready`: Input ready signal, indicates that the system is ready to accept data. When both `in_valid` and `in_ready` are high, it signifies that valid data is being transferred, impacting the credit computations.\n- `in_endofpacket`: End of packet signal, denotes the end of a data packet. Used to increment the packet credit counter upon the conclusion of a packet.\n\nOutput ports: symbol_credits, packet_credits.\nExplanation:\n- `symbol_credits`: Output register that holds the count of symbol credits. It is incremented based on a defined number of symbols processed per credit, influenced by whether the input data is valid and ready.\n- `packet_credits`: Output register that tracks the number of packet credits. It increments each time an end-of-packet condition is detected with valid and ready data, signifying the completion of a packet transmission.\n"

It is used to determine when the symbol and packet credits should be considered for incrementation based on the data transfer activity.\n- `eop_beat`: This signal combines the `beat` signal with the `in_endofpacket` flag. It is specifically used to identify the cycles in which an end-of-packet condition occurs during an active data transfer, playing a crucial role in controlling the increment of packet credits.\n- `sym_count`: This register holds the count of symbols processed temporarily; it is used in scenarios where credits are calculated over multiple beats.\n- `next_sym_count`: This signal predicts the next value of symbol count by adding the number of symbols per beat to the current `sym_count` when a beat occurs. It helps in deciding whether a rollover in the symbol count should occur (based on the number of symbols per credit).\n- `rollover`: This signal is used to determine whether the symbol counting has reached or surpassed the threshold set by `SYMBOLS_PER_CREDIT`, or if an end-of-packet condition occurs. It controls the reset of the `sym_count` and the increment of the `symbol_credits`."
