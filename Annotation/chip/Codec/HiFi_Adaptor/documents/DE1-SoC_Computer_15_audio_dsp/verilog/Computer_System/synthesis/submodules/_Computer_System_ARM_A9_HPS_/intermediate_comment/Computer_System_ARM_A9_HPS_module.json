    "module": "Module-level comment: This module interfaces an ARM A9 Hard Processor System (HPS) with FPGA fabric, managing AXI transactions, memory control, and various peripheral interfaces. It instantiates two sub-modules: fpga_interfaces for AXI and interrupt handling, and hps_io for memory and peripheral I/O operations. The module uses parameterized widths for FPGA-to-HPS and HPS-to-FPGA interfaces, with error checking for correct instantiation."
