Module-level comment: The Computer_System_JTAG_to_FPGA_Bridge serves as an interface between JTAG and an FPGA, managing data transactions via read and write operations. It features input and output ports for control signals and data handling, along with internal signals for data integrity and flow control. Sub-modules like JTAG interface, FIFO buffers, packet converters, and transaction controllers are integrated to ensure efficient data handling, synchronization, and parameter validation for system configuration and debug assistance.
