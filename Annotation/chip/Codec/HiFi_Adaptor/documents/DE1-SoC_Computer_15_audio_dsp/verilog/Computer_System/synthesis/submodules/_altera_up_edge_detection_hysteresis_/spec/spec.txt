Module name: altera_up_edge_detection_hysteresis.
Module specification: The altera_up_edge_detection_hysteresis module is designed to detect edges in an 8-bit input data stream using hysteresis to mitigate noise-induced errors. It consists of input ports: 'clk' (clock input for synchronization), 'reset' (high-active signal to initialize internal states), 'data_in' (8-bit input data for edge detection), and 'data_en' (data enable signal for processing control). The output port is 'data_out', an 8-bit output representing detected edges. Internal signals include 'shift_reg_out' (outputs from shift registers), 'data_above_high_threshold' (indicator if data_in is above a set threshold), 'data_to_shift_register_1', 'above_threshold' (consolidated threshold indicator), and arrays 'data_line_2', 'thresholds' (for storing intermediate states and threshold history, respectively). The module integrates two main blocks: 'shift_register_1' and 'shift_register_2', used for data propagation and processing within cycles, controlled by clock and data enable signals. The primary operational flow involves capturing and shifting incoming data, checking against thresholds, and updating outputs based on edge detection criteria established within the hysteresis mechanism.
