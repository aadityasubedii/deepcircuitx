Module name: altera_up_video_decoder_add_endofpacket. 
Module specification: The `altera_up_video_decoder_add_endofpacket` module processes incoming video data streams and manages packet boundaries by adding an 'end of packet' signal when a new packet begins during ongoing data transfer. The module has a set of input ports that include `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset` (resets internal states), `stream_in_data` (input data stream), `stream_in_startofpacket` (indicates the beginning of a new packet), `stream_in_endofpacket` (marks the end of a current packet), `stream_in_valid` (flags the validity of the input data), and `stream_out_ready` (indicates output stream readiness to accept data). The output ports are `stream_in_ready` (controls acceptance of incoming data), `stream_out_data` (processed output data stream), `stream_out_startofpacket`, `stream_out_endofpacket` (control signals to mark the beginning and end of packets respectively in the output stream), and `stream_out_valid` (flags the validity of the output data). Internal to the module, registers such as `internal_data`, `internal_startofpacket`, `internal_endofpacket`, and `internal_valid` buffer input signals to facilitate data processing. The module comprises multiple always blocks: one that handles the reset condition and another that processes incoming data and controls output flow. An assign statement adjusts the `stream_in_ready` signal based on `stream_out_ready` and `stream_out_valid` status, providing a backpressure mechanism. The moduleâ€™s design ensures that it adheres to streaming protocols, correctly handles packet boundaries, and maintains data integrity across different operating conditions.
