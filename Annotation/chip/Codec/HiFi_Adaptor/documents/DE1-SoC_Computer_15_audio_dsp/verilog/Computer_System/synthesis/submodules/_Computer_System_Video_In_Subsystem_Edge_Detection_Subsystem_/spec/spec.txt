Module name: Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Edge_Detection_Subsystem.

Module specification: The Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Edge_Detection_Subsystem is designed to detect edges in video frames using a series of submodules for chroma filtering, upsampling, and edge detection processing. The module operates synchronously with a system clock and includes reset control. Input ports include control interfaces (edge_detection_control_slave_*) for configuration, a system clock (sys_clk_clk), a system reset (sys_reset_reset_n), and video stream inputs (video_stream_sink_*). Output ports comprise control read data (edge_detection_control_slave_readdata), video stream output readiness (video_stream_sink_ready), and processed video stream outputs (video_stream_source_*), which indicate status and data flow for processed video frames.

Internal signals such as chroma_filter_avalon_chroma_source_* and chroma_upsampler_avalon_chroma_source_* manage the data flow from the chroma filter and upsampler submodules. Signals like edge_detection_avalon_edge_detection_source_* control the output from the edge detection processing. Additional signals from the video_stream_splitter_* manage input video streams and synchronization.

The module incorporates several key submodules outlined in the code: Chroma_Filter, Chroma_Upsampler, Edge_Detection, Edge_Detection_Router_Controller, and Video_Stream_Merger, each tasked with specific roles within video processing, ranging from filtering and upsampling to routing and merging processed video streams. This structure supports flexible, efficient edge detection in video processing applications, enabling further processing or display of video data with highlighted edges.
