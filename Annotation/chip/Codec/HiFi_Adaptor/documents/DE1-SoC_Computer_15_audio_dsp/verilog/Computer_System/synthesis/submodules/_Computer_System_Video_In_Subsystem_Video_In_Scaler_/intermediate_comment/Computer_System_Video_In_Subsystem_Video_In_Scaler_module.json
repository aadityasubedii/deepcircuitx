    "module": "Module-level comment: The Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Video_In_Scaler is designed to scale down video frames within a video input subsystem. It interfaces with upstream and downstream components through designated input and output ports and utilizes the `altera_up_video_scaler_shrink` component for scaling. Configuration parameters allow adaptation to various data widths and video dimensions, ensuring flexible control over the scaling process. The module manages signal validation and readiness to synchronize the flow of processed video data efficiently."
