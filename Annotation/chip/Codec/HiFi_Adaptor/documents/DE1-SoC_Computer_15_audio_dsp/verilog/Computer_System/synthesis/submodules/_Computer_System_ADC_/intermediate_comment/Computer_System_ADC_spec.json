    "spec": "Module name: Computer_System_ADC.  \nModule specification: The Computer_System_ADC module interfaces with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) in a computer system, primarily controlling the ADC's operations and handling data conversions. It manages signals such as the clock, chip select, and data inputs and outputs, facilitating the reading of analog values that are then converted to digital form. Input ports include `clock` (module's primary timing signal), `reset` (initializes module state), `read` and `write` (control signals for read/write operations), `writedata` (incoming data for settings), `address` (selects specific controls or channels), and `adc_dout` (digital data from ADAC). Output ports consist of `readdata` (outputs converted digital values), `waitrequest` (indicates module's readiness for new operations), `adc_sclk` (serial clock for data conversion synchronization), `adc_cs_n` (chip select signal, active low), and `adc_din` (sends control/configuration data to ADC). Internal signals include `go` (controls ADC conversion start), `values` (stores digital data from ADC channels), `auto_run` (enables automatic continuous conversions), and `done` (indicates completion of conversion). The module includes an instantiation of `altera_up_avalon_adv_adc` for the ADC control, parameterized for clock cycles, channel number, and board specifications. Code blocks handle different aspects: asynchronous read/write operations, reset and control signal handling, data updating upon conversion completion, and automatic operation control based on the `auto_run` setting. This detailed specification ensures that the module effectively serves as a robust interface for ADC within computer systems, managing all necessary operations for accurate and safe data handling.",
