    "module": "Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_addr_cmd_pads` module interfaces FPGA logic with SDRAM, managing address and command signals using DDR I/O. It handles various clocks for synchronization and uses internal generate blocks, DDR input/output components (e.g., `hps_sdram_p0_generic_ddio`), and delay adjustment mechanisms (`hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc`) to ensure accurate timing and signal integrity for high-performance memory operations."
