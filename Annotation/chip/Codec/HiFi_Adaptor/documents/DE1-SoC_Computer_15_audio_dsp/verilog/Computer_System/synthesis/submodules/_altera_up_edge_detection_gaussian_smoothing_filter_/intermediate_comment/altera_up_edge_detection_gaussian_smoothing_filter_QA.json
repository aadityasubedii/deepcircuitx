The module uses a series of shift registers to manipulate pixel data across multiple 'lines' of input, each representing a sequential row of pixel data from an image. This preprocessing accumulates through various summed stages, each contributing weighted values from pixels and their neighbors to achieve the Gaussian effect. The final output is a smoothed value for the center pixel of the filtered region, assisting in tasks like edge detection by emphasizing pixel intensity changes."

It acts as the timing pulse for the operations and state changes in the design.\n- reset: This active-high input performs a reset on the internal states and data within the module. Upon receiving a high signal, all the data elements in the design (like registers) are reset to their default state, ensuring a clear start or recovery from errors.\n- data_in: This input represents the pixel values coming into the Gaussian smoothing filter. Each 8-bit value corresponds to a single pixel's intensity, which is used in the filtering calculations to produce a smooth output.\n- data_en: Data enable signal; when high, it allows the processing of input data (data_in) through the shift registers and subsequent accumulation stages. Effectively, this signal controls whether new data should be processed or if the operations should be paused.\n\nOutput ports: data_out.\nExplanation:\n- data_out: This 9-bit output provides the gaussian smoothed pixel value. This smoothed value results from the extensive processing of the input pixel and its neighbors through multiple summing stages, effectively averaging surrounding pixel intensities in a weighted manner, resembling a Gaussian kernel operation. This output can be used for further image processing tasks such as edge detection."

This data is used in various parts of the calculations, simulating a read of pixel data from different rows and positions of the input image, aiding the convolution-like operations.\n- original_line_1 to original_line_5: These arrays of registers store pixel data from consecutive rows of the image being processed. They create a buffer that holds data while it's used in subsequent filtering operations, ensuring that the correct pixel data is used at each stage of the summing levels.\n- sum_level_1 to sum_level_6: These arrays of registers and individual registers are used to store intermediate sums at various stages of the filtering process. Each level aggregates computational results from earlier stages or directly from pixel data, progressively simplifying and reducing the data to a final sum. These help by compartmentalizing the stages of the computation to manage complexity and maintain order in processing.\n- sum_level_7: This register holds the final computed value after all stages of processing and summing. The result is a 9-bit wide value optimized from the previous 16-bit data through downsizing, ready to be output as the smoothed pixel intensity value."
