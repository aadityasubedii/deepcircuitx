Module name: altera_up_video_clipper_counters. Module specification: The "altera_up_video_clipper_counters" module is designed for controlling the frame dimension counting in video processing applications. It accurately tracks the current pixel position across both the horizontal (width) and vertical (height) dimensions based upon the rising edge of a clock signal, while also handling the reset functionality through a dedicated reset input. In terms of input ports, the module utilizes 'clk' for synchronizing the counting operations, 'reset' for initializing the counters, and 'increment_counters' for controlling when the pixel position should be updated. The output ports include 'start_of_outer_frame' and 'end_of_outer_frame' that indicate the beginning and end of the entire frame, as well as 'start_of_inner_frame' and 'end_of_inner_frame' which specify the start and finish of a designated inner frame area, finally, 'inner_frame_valid' confirms the validity of the inner frame dimension. Internal signals such as 'width', 'height', 'inner_width_valid', and 'inner_height_valid' maintain the current positions and validate the boundaries of the inner frame. The code is segmented into several blocks: synchronous process blocks for incrementing 'width' and 'height' registers, validation logic for inner frame boundaries, and combinatorial logic to generate the five main output signals based on the current counter values and valid flags. This structured approach provides robust control and tracking of frame dimensions essential for precise video clipping operations.
