The module uses parameters such as configuration for input, output, brightness, hue, and others, and sets these parameters based on the input ROM address. The ROM address selects the specific configuration, and corresponding data is set in a register which is then mapped to output `rom_data`. The module effectively maps input addresses to predefined video configuration data."

Explanation: This input port, `rom_address`, is used to select specific video configuration settings. Each address corresponds to a particular parameter that needs to be set in the ADV7180 video decoder chip. This approach allows for dynamic configuration based on sequential address input which controls what data or settings are being accessed and modified.\n\nOutput ports: [rom_data]. Explanation: The output port, `rom_data`, provides the resulting 27-bit data corresponding to the selected `rom_address`. This data is organized in a specific format, with interleaved 0s after every byte part of `data`. It maps configuration values into a specific data format for use by the video decoder. Each 16-bit parameter is preceded by an 8-bit prefix when sent to `rom_data`, with additional zero bits for proper formatting and alignment."

This signal functions as a temporary storage for the data assembled from the constants defined at the top of the module and the 8-bit prefix (0x40). In the module, depending on the selected `rom_address`, `data` gets assigned the corresponding configuration value which is then formatted and passed to the output `rom_data`.
