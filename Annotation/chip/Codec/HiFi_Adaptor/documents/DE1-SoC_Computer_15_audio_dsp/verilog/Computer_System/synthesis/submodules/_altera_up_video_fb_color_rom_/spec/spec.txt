Module name: altera_up_video_fb_color_rom. Module specification: The "altera_up_video_fb_color_rom" module is designed for use in video processing applications, functioning as a color lookup table that maps a 4-bit color index to corresponding 10-bit red, green, and blue (RGB) color values from a ROM initialized with a predefined set of colors. It accepts 'clk' (clock input) and 'clk_en' (clock enable signal) as input signals to synchronize and control the operations, along with 'color_index', a 4-bit input that specifies the index in the color lookup table. The outputs are 'red', 'green', and 'blue', each being 10-bit signals representing the respective color components extracted from the 30-bit 'color_data' fetched from the ROM. Internally, the 'color_data' signal is used as a 30-bit wire to hold the color data from the ROM. The code includes an instance of the "altsyncram" module configured as ROM, using a memory initialization file "altera_up_video_fb_color_rom.mif" and parameters suited for Cyclone II FPGA devices. This RAM block operates exclusively in read mode, with various parameters set for optimized performance and size to match the application's needs.
