Module-level comment: The "altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter" module inserts `idle` and `escape` characters into data streams. It checks each byte of `in_data` for these control characters, utilizing internal flags `received_esc`, `idle_char`, and `escape_char` to manage logic for insertion based on `in_valid`, `out_ready`, and state transitions. Outputs are controlled via procedural blocks reacting to the clock, ensuring synchronized data handling and flow control.
