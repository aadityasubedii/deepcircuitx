Module-level comment: This Verilog module, Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Edge_Detection_Subsystem_Video_Stream_Splitter, distributes a single video stream across two output streams based on a control signal (`stream_select`). It handles synchronization, data validity, and packet boundaries, enabling dynamic stream selection through registered signals (`stream_select_reg`) and internal logic ensuring updates occur between video packets. The distinct blocks in the code synchronize data, manage output streams, and handle state initializations and transitions, ensuring reliable and conditional data streaming.
