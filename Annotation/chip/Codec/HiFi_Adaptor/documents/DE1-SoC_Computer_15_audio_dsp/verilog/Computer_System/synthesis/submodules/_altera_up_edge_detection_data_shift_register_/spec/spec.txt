Module name: altera_up_edge_detection_data_shift_register. 
Module specification: The `altera_up_edge_detection_data_shift_register` is a parameterized Verilog module designed for Altera FPGAs, specifically using the `altshift_taps` component to implement a shift register with tap outputs. The module enables serial data input handling through the `shiftin` port, where data is shifted based on the rising edge of the `clock` signal, contingent upon the `clken` (clock enable) being high. The module outputs include `shiftout`, which provides a serial data output, showing the shifted version of the input data, and `taps`, which gives access to intermediate tapped outputs from the register. The internal signals `sub_wire0` and `sub_wire1` are crucial for managing data flow between the `altshift_taps` component and the module outputs, with `sub_wire0` routing tapped values to `taps` and `sub_wire1` routing the shifted data to `shiftout`. The module is parameterized by `DW` (Data Width) and `SIZE` (the size of the register), which are used to set properties of the `altshift_taps` component. This component is configured within the module to specify its operation specifics such as the number of taps and tap distance, directly influencing the behavior of the data shifting and output generation.
