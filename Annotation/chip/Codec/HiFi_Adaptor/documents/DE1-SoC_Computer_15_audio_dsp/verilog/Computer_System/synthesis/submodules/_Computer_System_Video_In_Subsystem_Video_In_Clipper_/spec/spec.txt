Module name: Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Video_In_Clipper. Module specification: The Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Video_In_Clipper is a Verilog module designed to intake a video data stream, modify it through two main clipping stages, and output the processed video stream. The **input ports** of the module include clk (clock signal), reset (for resetting internal states), stream_in_data (input video data), stream_in_startofpacket, stream_in_endofpacket (denote start and end of video frames), stream_in_empty (identifies unused bits in data), stream_in_valid (confirms data validity), and stream_out_ready (downstream readiness signal). The **output ports** are stream_in_ready (module's readiness to receive data), stream_out_data (processed output video data), stream_out_startofpacket, stream_out_endofpacket (start and end markers for output frames), stream_out_empty (flags unused bits at output), and stream_out_valid (validates output data). **Internal signals** include internal_data, internal_startofpacket, internal_endofpacket, internal_empty, internal_valid, and internal_ready, which facilitate data and control flow between the internal clipping stages, maintaining data continuity and alignment. The code contains two main blocks: `altera_up_video_clipper_drop` and `altera_up_video_clipper_add`, responsible for dropping and adding pixels and lines to frames as configured by the parameters for width, height, and pixel management. These stages process the video sequentially, first refining by dropping unwanted pixels and lines, then potentially adding specified elements before sending the processed video forward.
