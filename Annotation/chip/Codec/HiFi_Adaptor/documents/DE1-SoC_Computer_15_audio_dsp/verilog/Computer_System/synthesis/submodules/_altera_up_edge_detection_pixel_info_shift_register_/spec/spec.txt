Module name: altera_up_edge_detection_pixel_info_shift_register. 
Module specification: This Verilog module is utilized predominantly in edge-detection applications for shifting pixel data, leveraging the capabilities of an internal shift register mechanism. The module is governed by key input ports: `clken`, a clock enable signal that permits the shifting action when high; `clock`, the primary clock controlling the synchronization of the shifting process; and `shiftin`, a 2-bit input representing pixel data fed into the shift register. The output ports include `shiftout`, delivering the 2-bit shifted pixel data, and `taps`, which outputs a 2-bit tapped data from specified points in the shift register, both key in sequential pixel manipulation seen in video or image processing. Internally, the module employs two 2-bit signals: `sub_wire0` and `sub_wire1`, serving as conduits for the data from the shift registerâ€™s component to the module's outputs, `taps` and `shiftout` respectively. The main block within the code is the `altshift_taps_component`, an instantiated shift register managing the data input and tapping, as defined by its parameters: data width, tap distance (SIZE), and number of taps. This setup is facilitated by a `defparam` block that secures the configurations necessary for specific edge-detection implementations. This structured approach ensures effective manipulation and analysis of pixel data in real-time processing environments.
