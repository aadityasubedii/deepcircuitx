    "module": "Module-level comment: The `Computer_System_Nios2_2nd_Core_cpu_debug_slave_wrapper` facilitates debugging operations in a Nios II multi-core setup by managing breakpoints, trace controls, and errors. It processes various debug-related inputs and emits control signals, interfacing with JTAG for detailed debugging. Internally, it uses SR and JTAG signals for status and test control, organized into sub-modules for specialized JTAG and system clock handling, ensuring synchronization and efficient response in debugging scenarios."
