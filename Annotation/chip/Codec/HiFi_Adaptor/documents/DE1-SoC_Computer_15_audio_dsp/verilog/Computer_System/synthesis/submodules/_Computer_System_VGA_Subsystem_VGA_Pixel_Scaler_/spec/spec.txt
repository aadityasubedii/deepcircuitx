Module name: Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Pixel_Scaler.
Module specification: The Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Pixel_Scaler is a Verilog module tailored for scaling the pixel dimensions of video data for VGA displays. Its primary functions include receiving video data through input ports such as `stream_in_data`, `stream_in_startofpacket`, `stream_in_endofpacket`, `stream_in_empty`, and `stream_in_valid`, which signify the video data, start and end of data packets, emptiness of data buffer, and validity of the data respectively; and outputting the processed data through ports like `stream_out_data`, `stream_out_startofpacket`, `stream_out_endofpacket`, `stream_out_empty`, and `stream_out_valid` with similar signaling roles for the outgoing data. The module employs internal signals such as `internal_data`, `internal_startofpacket`, `internal_endofpacket`, `internal_valid`, and `internal_ready` that act as intermediaries between the height and width scaling stages, ensuring the transmission of valid data at a ready-to-process rate. This module encapsulates two major functional blocks: `Multiply_Height` and `Multiply_Width`, which specifically handle the vertical and horizontal scaling of the incoming VGA data stream, and use parameters like data width (`DW`), and control widths (`CW`) for custom configuration. This design enables seamless adjustments of video resolutions conducive to diverse VGA display requirements, leveraging clock (`clk`) and synchronous reset (`reset`) signals for controlled handling of critical operations across different stages of data scaling.
