    "spec": "Module name: Computer_System_System_PLL. Module specification: The 'Computer_System_System_PLL' is a Verilog module designed as a phase-locked loop (PLL) system for a computer system. It primarily processes input signals through two ports: 'ref_clk_clk,' which serves as the reference clock for the PLL and 'ref_reset_reset,' which is a reset signal used to maintain synchronization during errors or initialization. The module produces three outputs: 'sys_clk_clk,' a system clock synchronized with the reference clock, 'sdram_clk_clk,' a clock for SDRAM operations, and 'reset_source_reset,' which indicates the PLL lock status and controls system stability post-lock. Internally, the module utilizes 'sys_pll_locked_export' to monitor the PLL's lock status, which is crucial for enabling the reset logic via the reset_from_locked block. The code consists of two main blocks: 'Computer_System_System_PLL_sys_pll', responsible for generating the synchronized clock outputs and monitoring the PLL lock status, and 'altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal', which manages the reset signal based on the PLL's lock state, ensuring stable operations following a successful lock. This module ensures that the system and SDRAM clocks are stable and properly synchronized for reliable system performance.",
