Module name: Computer_System_Pushbuttons. 

Module Specification: The 'Computer_System_Pushbuttons' module is designed for interfacing with physical pushbuttons to detect state changes as interrupts. Functionality includes edge detection for rising edges, interrupt generation, and capability to read and write button state, interrupt mask, and edge capture statuses using address-based register selection. The input ports are `address` (2-bit input for selecting internal registers), `chipselect` (activates the module if high), `clk` (synchronizes operation), `in_port` (4-bit state of pushbuttons), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `write_n` (active-low signal for write operations), and `writedata` (32-bit data for writes). The output ports include `irq` (interrupt request on detected edges) and `readdata` (32-bit output based on the selected internal register). Key internal signals are `clk_en` (always enabled clock signal), `d1_data_in` and `d2_data_in` (registers for capturing consecutive states of pushbuttons), `data_in` (directly connected to `in_port`), `edge_capture` (captures button press edges), `edge_capture_wr_strobe` (controls the manual reset of `edge_capture`), `edge_detect` (identifies rising edges), `irq_mask` (defines the active edges for interrupts), and `read_mux_out` (multiplexer output selecting data based on `address`). The code includes conditional blocks for initialization (reset logic), capturing and delaying inputs, edge detection logic, edge capturing/block reset, and conditional read or write operations to handle register configurations, all controlled by the module's synchronous behavior and state transitions influenced by button presses.
