    "spec": "Module name: altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter. \nModule specification: The \"altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter\" module is designed for the insertion of special control characters\u2014specifically `idle` and `escape`\u2014into a data stream. This module has the following ports: `clk` (clock input for synchronization), `reset_n` (active-low reset for internal states), `in_valid` (indicates incoming data validity), `in_data` (8-bit input data), `out_ready` (indicates downstream component readiness to accept data), `in_ready` (signals upstream components when the module can accept more data), `out_valid` (indicates the validity of output data), and `out_data` (8-bit output data possibly modified to include special characters). Internally, the module utilizes `received_esc` (a register that indicates receipt of a control character), `idle_char` (a signal activated when `in_data` matches the idle character), and `escape_char` (activated when `in_data` matches the escape character). The module operates primarily through two major procedural blocks: The first block executes on the positive clock edge or negative reset edge to manage the `received_esc` flag based on data validity and readiness signals, handling scenarios involving special character detection. The second block determines the outputs (`out_valid`, `in_ready`, `out_data`) dependent on various conditions like input validity, data readiness, and control character detection, ensuring correct data flow and character insertion based on the current operational state and received data.",

The basic functionalities include checking each byte of incoming data and determining whether it's an idle or escape character. It handles conditions where special sequences need to be inserted or data needs to be modified before passing it to the output. This is managed based on the state of the input `in_valid`, the output `out_ready`, and the received escape flag `received_esc`. It also ensures that the output is ready only when the input conditions match set criteria, modifying the data accordingly and setting a flag whenever an escape or idle character is initially received, preventing immediate subsequent special actions on following characters unless conditions are reset."

This data is examined to determine if it includes special control characters.\n- `out_ready`: A control signal from the downstream component indicating that it is ready to accept data. This helps in managing flow control to prevent data loss.\n\nOutput ports: in_ready, out_valid, out_data. \nExplanation: \n- `in_ready`: A control signal that signifies to the upstream component that the module is ready to receive more data.
