Module name: altera_jtag_sld_node. 
Module specification: The `altera_jtag_sld_node` is a Verilog module crafted to interact with JTAG interfaces, predominantly designed for testing and debugging Altera hardware platforms through various JTAG states and transitions. The module accepts a 3-bit `ir_out` for capturing the current instruction and `tdo` (Test Data Out) for serial data from the JTAG chain. It outputs a 3-bit `ir_in` to submit new instructions, a `tck` (Test Clock) to synchronize JTAG operations, `tdi` (Test Data In) for serial input, and multiple state indicators (`virtual_state_cdr`, `virtual_state_cir`, etc.) representing various JTAG states. Internally, the module uses a simulated `simulation_clock` to mimic JTAG test clock behavior, state control bits like `sdrs`, `cdr`, `sdr`, and a `bit_index` for tracking shift operations. The code is divided into sections conditional on `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS`, managing simulation specifics (`simulation_clock`, task definitions, state assignments) when not defined, and the actual interfacing with an external JTAG component when defined. This structure supports flexible simulation and actual device interfacing, facilitating effective testing and debugging of hardware configurations.
