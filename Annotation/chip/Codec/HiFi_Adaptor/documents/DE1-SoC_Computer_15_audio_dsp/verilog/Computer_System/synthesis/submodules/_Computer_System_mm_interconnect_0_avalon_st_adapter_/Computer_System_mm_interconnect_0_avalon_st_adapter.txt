Module-level comment: The `Computer_System_mm_interconnect_0_avalon_st_adapter` is a parameterized adapter ensuring strict adherence to specified settings. It validates parameters against expected constants, stopping simulation on mismatches, thus maintaining system integrity. The module leverages an `error_adapter_0` submodule for Avalon-ST compliant data and signal processing, including synchronization and error handling by connecting various input and output signals.
