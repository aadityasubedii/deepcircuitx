Module-level comment: The Computer_System_SDRAM_test_component simulates SDRAM interactions by executing specified commands (read, write) based on input ports such as clock, address, control signals, and data mask. It incorporates internal pipelines for addressing and data masking to manage read/write operations over multiple cycles, reflecting typical SDRAM timing constraints. This module extensively utilizes command decoding and memory transaction handling to synchronously execute and simulate memory operations with high efficiency.
