    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_avalon_video_dma_ctrl_address_translation.\nModule specification: The 'altera_up_avalon_video_dma_ctrl_address_translation' is a Verilog module designed to perform address translation for Direct Memory Access (DMA) operations within a video processing system. It interfaces between a slave (such as a processor or another control unit) and a master (likely a DMA controller), facilitating data and control signal translations between these entities. It inputs include 'clk' (clock signal to synchronize operations), 'reset' (to initialize the module), 'slave_address', 'slave_byteenable', 'slave_read', 'slave_write', and 'slave_writedata', which are used for defining operations and data flow from the slave side. Additionally, it takes 'master_readdata' and 'master_waitrequest' from the master. The outputs include modified or directly forwarded versions of the input signals like 'slave_readdata', 'slave_waitrequest', serving as responses to the slave, and 'master_address', 'master_byteenable', 'master_read', 'master_write', 'master_writedata', which are directed towards the master. The main logic within the module incorporates conditional assignments based on the 'slave_address'. If the second bit of 'slave_address' is '0', it will modify the 'slave_readdata' and 'master_writedata' with an 'ADDRESS_TRANSLATION_MASK'. The assignments are straightforward, using basic Verilog constructs without additional internal storage or complex state machines, making the module compact and efficient for its intended signal translation function in DMA operations.",

The module reads and writes data to and from a master (likely a DMA controller) using a slave interface. It handles address translations based on a particular mask (ADDRESS_TRANSLATION_MASK). If the second bit of the slave address is '0', the module modifies the read and write data by applying the ADDRESS_TRANSLATION_MASK. This could be used to differentiate memory regions or perform conditional data manipulations based on the address. The module operates synchronously with a clock signal and includes reset functionality. It directly forwards read and write requests and wait signals between the slave and master while applying or not applying the mask based on the address conditions."
