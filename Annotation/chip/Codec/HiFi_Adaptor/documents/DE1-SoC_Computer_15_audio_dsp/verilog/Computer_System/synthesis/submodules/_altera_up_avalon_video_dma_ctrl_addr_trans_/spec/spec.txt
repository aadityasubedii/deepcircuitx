Module name: altera_up_avalon_video_dma_ctrl_addr_trans. 
Module specification: The 'altera_up_avalon_video_dma_ctrl_addr_trans' is a Verilog module designed to handle address translation and data transfer synchronization between a master and a slave interface in a DMA controller tailored for Altera's video processing pipeline. It directly processes various inputs and outputs: 'clk' and 'reset' are used for clock synchronization and resetting module operations respectively; 'slave_address', 'slave_byteenable', 'slave_read', 'slave_write', and 'slave_writedata' manage addressing, byte enabling, and data flow from the slave interface; 'master_readdata' and 'master_waitrequest' handle data incoming from the master and its readiness signal. Corresponding outputs include 'slave_readdata' and 'slave_waitrequest' reflecting the data to the slave and its wait signal; 'master_address', 'master_byteenable', 'master_read', 'master_write', and 'master_writedata' manage similar roles towards the master interface. Importantly, the module employs address translation using an `ADDRESS_TRANSLATION_MASK` to conditionally modify data passing between the interfaces based on the 'slave_address'. The code is organized simply without internal signals, utilizing direct assignments for translating and forwarding signals and data, ensuring streamlined and efficient module operations for specific conditions indicated by the addressing details.
