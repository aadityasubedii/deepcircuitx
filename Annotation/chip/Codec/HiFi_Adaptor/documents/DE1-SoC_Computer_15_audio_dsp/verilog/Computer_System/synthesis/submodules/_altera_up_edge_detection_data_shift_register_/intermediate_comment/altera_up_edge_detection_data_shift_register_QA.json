The shift register takes an input (shiftin), and outputs both a shifted version of this input (shiftout) and certain intermediate values (taps). The register is parameterized by the data width (DW) and the size of the shift register (SIZE). It operates only when the 'clken' (clock enable) signal is active, indicating that the data should be shifted on each rising edge of the provided 'clock' signal. This module captures data bits serially from 'shiftin' and allows access to intermediate stages (taps) based on the configuration."

When clken is high, the data in the shift register will shift based on the clock's rising edge.\n- **clock**: This is the main clock signal for the shift register. The registered data shifts on each rising edge of this clock, provided the clken signal is active.\n- **shiftin [DW:1]**: This is the serial data input to the shift register. It has a width defined by the parameter DW. Data entered here is shifted through the register bit by bit on each active clock cycle.\n\nOutput ports: shiftout, taps.\nExplanation:\n- **shiftout [DW:1]**: This output provides the serial data output of the shift register. It presents the shifted version of the data entered through shiftin.\n- **taps [DW:1]**: This output signal provides access to the tapped values of the shift register.

It is connected to the 'shiftout' output of the `altshift_taps_component` and drives the 'shiftout' output of the module itself.\n\nEach of these wires serves as an intermediary in retrieving and delivering respective outputs (either taps or shifted output data) from the embedded FPGA component (`altshift_taps_component`) and presenting them as module outputs (`taps` and `shiftout`).
