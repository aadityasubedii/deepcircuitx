Module-level comment: The altera_reset_synchronizer module synchronizes reset signals with the clock domain to avoid metastability in digital circuits. It supports asynchronous and synchronous resets via the ASYNC_RESET parameter. Internally, it uses a shift register ('altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain') to manage and propagate the reset state, controlled by clock events and the reset input. Depending on ASYNC_RESET, it directly sets the synchronization chain in asynchronous mode or shifts the reset input through the chain in synchronous mode, ensuring the output ('reset_out') is stable and synchronized.
