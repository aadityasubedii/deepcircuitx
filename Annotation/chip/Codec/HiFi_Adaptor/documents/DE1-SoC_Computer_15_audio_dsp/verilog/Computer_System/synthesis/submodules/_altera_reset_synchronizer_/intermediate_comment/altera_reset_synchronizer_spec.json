    "spec": "Module name: altera_reset_synchronizer. \n\nModule specification: The altera_reset_synchronizer is a Verilog module designed to synchronize reset signals with a system's clock domain, thereby mitigating metastability risks in digital circuits. It handles both asynchronous and synchronous reset signals based on the configuration set by the ASYNC_RESET parameter. The module inputs include 'reset_in', a reset signal that can be either asynchronous or synchronous, and 'clk', the clock signal that dictates the timing of the synchronization. The module outputs a single port, 'reset_out', which delivers the synchronized reset signal. Internally, the module utilizes a shift register array, 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain', which acts as a buffer to store and shift the reset state, and 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out', a single-bit register that outputs the final synchronized reset signal. The code includes two main blocks governed by the ASYNC_RESET parameter: one block handles the asynchronous reset logic by immediately setting the synchronization chain to a high state upon a reset signal, and another block handles the synchronous reset logic by sequentially shifting the reset state through the register chain on each clock edge. Both sections ensure that the output 'reset_out' accurately reflects the state at the last register of the internal chain, synchronized appropriately with the input clock signal.",

The module provides the option to handle both asynchronous and synchronous reset behaviors based on the parameter ASYNC_RESET. If ASYNC_RESET is set to 1, it handles an asynchronous reset, and all stages in the synchronizer chain are set to 1 when a reset is detected. If ASYNC_RESET is 0, it synchronizes the incoming reset signal through a shift register chain. The DEPTH parameter determines the length of this shift register chain, thus configuring the depth of synchronization to ensure the reset signal is stable across the clock domains. The reset output is driven by the last element of this synchronization chain, ensuring that the reset signal is properly synchronized to the system's clock."

Its length is determined by the DEPTH parameter. This register shifts its contents with each clock cycle, either propagating the reset signal through each stage (in the case of an asynchronous reset) or shifting the reset input directly into the last stage of the chain (in synchronous mode).\n- **altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out**: This is a single-bit register that outputs the synchronized reset signal from the module. It directly takes its value from the first bit (LSB) of the altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain, and hence, represents the final output of the reset synchronization process.
