It functions by connecting incoming slave signals (like address, byteenable, read/write commands, and data) to corresponding master signals directly. For read and write data operations, there's conditional address masking based on a part of the slave address, facilitating modified data routing or alteration for reads and writes when required. Additionally, it manages read data combination and handshakes the waitrequest signal between master and slave, ensuring synchronization and data integrity during transfer processes."
