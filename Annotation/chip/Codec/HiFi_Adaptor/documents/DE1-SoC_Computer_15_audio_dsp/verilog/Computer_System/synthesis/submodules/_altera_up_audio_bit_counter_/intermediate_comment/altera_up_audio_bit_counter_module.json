    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_up_audio_bit_counter` manages bit counting for audio processing in Altera devices. It triggers on bit clock and channel change edges, maintaining a 5-bit counter that decrements on bit clock falls. Resets occur on system reset or channel changes. A signal `counting` indicates active counting state. The implementation uses two always blocks to handle counter updates and state output based on clock and reset triggers."
