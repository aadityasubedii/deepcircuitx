It is designed to handle the transfer of pixel data from memory to a VGA display interface. The module operates on a pixel-by-pixel basis, controlling the read operations from a buffer (frame buffer) and managing data flow through FIFOs to synchronize with a VGA stream. State machines are employed to handle the various states of reading from the buffer, waiting for pixel data processing, and managing reading stalls if there are too many pending read operations. It facilitates the swapping of buffer addresses to update the displayed frame without tearing, and controls signals for read requests, address generation, and stream data validity to ensure correct display timing and data integrity."
