Module name: altera_up_video_clipper_drop. Module specification: The `altera_up_video_clipper_drop` module is designed for video stream clipping, adjusting video frames by configurable pixel and line boundaries. Input ports include `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset` (asynchronous reset), `stream_in_data` (incoming video stream data), `stream_in_startofpacket`, `stream_in_endofpacket`, `stream_in_empty` (indicators for packet start, end, and data occupancy within streams respectively), and `stream_in_valid` (validity of the input data). The output is managed via `stream_out_ready`. Outputs comprise `stream_in_ready`, `stream_out_data`, `stream_out_startofpacket`, `stream_out_endofpacket`, `stream_out_empty`, and `stream_out_valid`, which function to provide ready signals, processed video stream, packet indicators, and validity of outgoing data. Internal signals include `increment_counters` (controls data and signal counter increments), `full_frame_endofpacket`, `new_startofpacket`, and `new_endofpacket` (manage packet framing in processed streams), and `pass_inner_frame` (determines data passing based on clipping bounds). The module's functionality is divided across several blocks: an instantiation of an `altera_up_video_clipper_counters` block for managing frame and line strip management, flip-flops for state management of a finite state machine in two principal states (`STATE_0_WAIT_FOR_START`, `STATE_1_RUN_CLIPPER`, and `STATE_2_ADD_MISSING_PART`), and data flow control to facilitate the interchange and update of video stream data in accordance with packet transfer and processing requirements. This structured approach within the Verilog code ensures efficient video data management aligning with the stipulated frame and packet parameters.
