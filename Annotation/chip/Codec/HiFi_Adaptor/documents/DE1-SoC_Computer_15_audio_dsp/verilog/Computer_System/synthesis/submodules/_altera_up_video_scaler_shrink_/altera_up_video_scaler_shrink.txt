Module-level comment: The 'altera_up_video_scaler_shrink' module scales down video streams by selectively dropping pixels and lines using predefined masks. Operating on a clock signal, it handles video packets with precise start and end signals, managing pixel and line omission via 'WIDTH_DROP_MASK' and 'HEIGHT_DROP_MASK'. Internal counters and registers track and control data flow, maintaining frame integrity and synchronization. This module efficiently processes incoming video data in a streaming manner, scaling it as specified while communicating readiness and validity of data to ensuring seamless downstream processing.
