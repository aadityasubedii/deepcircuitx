    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface` module integrates JTAG communication with Avalon streaming, enabling system testing and debugging. It supports direct JTAG operations and PLI-based simulations for enhanced interfacing. Input signals control JTAG states and data flow, while outputs handle JTAG data, system responses, and management data. Two main blocks manage either direct JTAG functionality or PLI-controlled simulation depending on configuration, facilitating varied operational contexts."
