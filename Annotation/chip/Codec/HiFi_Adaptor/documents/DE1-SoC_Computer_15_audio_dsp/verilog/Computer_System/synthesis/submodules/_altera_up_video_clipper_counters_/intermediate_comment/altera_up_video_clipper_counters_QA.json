It uses counters to iterate through pixel positions in both horizontal (width) and vertical (height) dimensions of an image frame based on a clock signal. The module outputs signals indicative of the start and end of the entire frame (outer frame) as well as the start and end of a designated inner frame region, which are determined by specified offset parameters. The counters reset when they reach the end of the image dimensions or when a reset signal is received. It also manages validity signals for the inner frame dimensions based on these offsets, indicating when the positions fall within the specified inner frame."

It triggers the sequential processes in the counters on its rising edge.\n- reset: A signal used to reset the counters to their initial state (0 for width and height). This input is active high and sets the width, height, and other internal signals to their initial values upon activation.\n- increment_counters: A control signal that, when high, allows the counters for width and height to increment based on the clock signal; essentially controlling when the module should update the position counters.\n\nOutput ports: start_of_outer_frame, end_of_outer_frame, start_of_inner_frame, end_of_inner_frame, inner_frame_valid.\nExplanation:\n- start_of_outer_frame: A signal indicating the start of the outer frame, which goes high when both the width and height counters are at zero.\n- end_of_outer_frame: A signal indicating the end of the outer frame, which is asserted when the width and height counters reach the maximum values of the image dimensions (IMAGE_WIDTH - 1, IMAGE_HEIGHT - 1).\n- start_of_inner_frame: A signal that becomes high when the counters match the defined left and top offsets, marking the beginning of the inner frame.\n- end_of_inner_frame: This signal is high when the width and height match the values calculated by subtracting the right and bottom offsets from the image dimensions, effectively marking the inner frame's end.\n- inner_frame_valid: A boolean signal that indicates whether the current position specified by the width and height counters is within the bounds of the inner frame based on the calculated offsets."

It goes high when the width counter is between the LEFT_OFFSET and IMAGE_WIDTH minus RIGHT_OFFSET, considering the boundary conditions.\n- inner_height_valid: Similar to inner_width_valid, this register indicates the validity of the current height position with respect to the vertical boundaries of the inner frame.
