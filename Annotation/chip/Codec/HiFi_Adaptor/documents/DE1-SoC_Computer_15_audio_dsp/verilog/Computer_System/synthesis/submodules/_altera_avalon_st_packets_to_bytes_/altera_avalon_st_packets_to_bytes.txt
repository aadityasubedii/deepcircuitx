Module-level comment: The "altera_avalon_st_packets_to_bytes" module serializes packet data into a byte stream, handling packet boundaries (start, end) and escaping characters, with conditional channel encoding. It utilizes internal state flags (such as `sent_esc`, `sent_channel_char`) and operates under a clock-driven state machine structured with `if` and `generate` statements to manage data flow based on input readiness and validity. This setup ensures robust handling of data serialization across changing communication channels.
