This module takes three input ports: \"clk,\" the primary input clock signal; \"reset\" for resetting the module's outputs and internal counters; and \"enable_clk\" that controls whether the clock division process is active. It produces five outputs: \"new_clk,\" the slower clock signal; \"rising_edge\" and \"falling_edge\" to indicate the transitions of \"new_clk\"; and \"middle_of_high_level\" and \"middle_of_low_level\" to denote the middle stages of the high and low cycles of \"new_clk,\" respectively. Internally, the module utilizes a register array \"clk_counter\" which increments based on the \"clk\" when \"enable_clk\" is high. The code is organized into multiple blocks each triggered on the positive edge of \"clk\" performing specific tasks: one block updates the \"clk_counter,\" four separate blocks determine and update the outputs based on the current state of \"clk_counter\" and the existing outputs, ensuring accurate behavior following \"reset\" or during regular operation. These operations allow for precise timing and functional enhancements in electronic systems requiring synchronized slower clock signals along with detailed edge and mid-cycle indicators.",
