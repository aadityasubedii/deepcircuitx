It is designed to identify and suppress non-maximum pixel values based on their surroundings, effectively thinning out the edge areas detected in the image processing pipeline. Data is passed through shift registers and processed in a series of stages, where each stage refines the output by suppressing less significant data, ultimately outputting a more precise representation of edges in the image."

The data presented here is subsequently used in non-maximum suppression.\n- data_en: This enables the data processing when set high. If low, it disables further data handling, essentially pausing new data from being processed.\n\nOutput ports: data_out.\nExplanation: \n- data_out: This port outputs the result of the non-maximum suppression operation. If the current data point is identified as the maximum compared to its neighbors, it is passed through; otherwise, it is suppressed, resulting in a thinner edge representation."

It stores intermediate data that shifts through the subsequent processing stages.\n\n- original_line_1, original_line_2, original_line_3: These reg arrays hold the values of current and neighboring pixels in three successive lines being processed.

These flags indicate whether the central pixel is greater than or equal to the average of its surroundings, guiding the final decision on whether to suppress the central pixel or not.\n\n- result: This reg stores the outcome of the non-maximum suppression per pixel; it's either the value from suppress_level_3 if the central pixel is identified as a maximum or zero if it's not. This is the final output of the module after all suppression checks are conducted."
