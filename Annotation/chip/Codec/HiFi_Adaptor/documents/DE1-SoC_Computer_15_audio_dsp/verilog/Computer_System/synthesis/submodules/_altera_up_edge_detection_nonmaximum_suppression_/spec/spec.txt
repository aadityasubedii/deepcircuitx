Module name: altera_up_edge_detection_nonmaximum_suppression. 

Module specification: The altera_up_edge_detection_nonmaximum_suppression module is designed to perform non-maximum suppression on edge detection data to thin out edge areas in images. It receives pixel values through the 'data_in' input, enables processing with 'data_en', and is timed with the 'clk' input, alongside the capability to reset via the 'reset' input. The output, 'data_out', carries the final suppressed edge data. Internally, this module utilizes several storage elements ('original_line_1', 'original_line_2', 'original_line_3') to store current and neighboring pixel values, and temporary registers ('suppress_level_1', 'suppress_level_2', 'suppress_level_3') to hold intermediate suppressed results. It also uses 'average_flags' and 'result' to store comparison results and the final suppression decision, respectively. The module incorporates shift registers instantiated as 'shift_register_1' and 'shift_register_2' for data shifting purposes across pixel rows. The logic for processing involves loading pixel data into these shift registers, comparing pixel values to determine suppression, handling control logic based on results from suppression tests, and outputting the maximum values detected or zero for suppressed values. A systematic approach using nested loops and case statements provides a mechanism to compare and suppress non-maximum pixel values logically and sequentially.
