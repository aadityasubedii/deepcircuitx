It operates by ensuring that the input and output parameters such as bits per symbol, data width, error width, and others match the expected values. If any parameter does not comply, the module outputs an error via debug messages and halts execution to prevent incorrect module operation. This is crucial in complex systems to maintain data integrity and proper communication between different components or modules. Additionally, the module connects input signals to output signals while checking ready/valid handshaking signals, thus facilitating synchronous data transfer."
