It takes an RGB input stream along with control signals such as start and end of packet indicators. The module processes the RGB data by resampling and reducing the bit width of each color channel, thereby changing the data density. The output is a new stream of RGB data with control signals corresponding to the processing done on the input stream. This functionality is useful in video processing applications where different devices or stages require different color resolutions."
