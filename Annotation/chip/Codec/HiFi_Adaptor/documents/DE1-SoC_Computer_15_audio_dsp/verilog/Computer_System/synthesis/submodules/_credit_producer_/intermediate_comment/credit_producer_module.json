    "module": "Module-level comment: The `credit_producer` module manages and increments credit counters for symbols and packets based on input signals. It utilizes internal logic and condition checks (including beat detection and end-of-packet recognition) to adjust credits accordingly. The module reacts to clock edges and reset signals, using parameters to configure symbol and packet credit calculations, supporting flexible data processing scenarios."
