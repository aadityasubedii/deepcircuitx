It manages the data conversion process by controlling the ADC's signals such as the clock, chip select, and data input. The module captures converted analog values into an array, handles read and write operations from an external source, and can operate either manually or automatically based on control inputs. It includes parameter configurations for different operational settings like the board type or number of ADC channels. The module ensures that data transactions don't occur until previous operations are completed, managed by the `waitrequest` signal to coordinate the safe read or write operations."

It is mainly used to output the digital values converted from analog inputs.\n- `waitrequest`: A signal that indicates to an external controller whether the module is ready for another read or write operation. It is used to prevent data collision and ensures proper sequencing of operations.\n- `adc_sclk`: ADC serial clock; it drives the ADC's internal clock allowing synchronized data conversion processes.\n- `adc_cs_n`: ADC chip select (active low); it enables or disables the ADC device for communication, ensuring that the ADC is selected when needed for data conversion.\n- `adc_din`: Data input to the ADC; responsible for sending control or configuration data into the ADC from the module."
