Module name: Computer_System. Module specification: This module represents the top-level entity of a computer system design, integrating various components including an ARM A9 Hard Processor System (HPS), audio subsystem, AV configuration, bus master for audio, and system PLL. The module handles interconnections between these components, manages clock and reset signals, and provides interfaces for external connections such as memory, audio I/O, and various communication protocols (EMAC, QSPI, SDIO, USB, SPI, UART, I2C, and GPIO). Input ports include audio inputs, bus master control signals, Ethernet receive signals, USB control signals, SPI input, UART receive, memory calibration, and system clock/reset inputs. Output ports handle audio output, configuration clock, bus master responses, Ethernet transmit signals, QSPI control, SDIO clock, USB control, SPI output,
