Module-level comment: The Computer_System_JTAG_UART module facilitates JTAG UART communication, handling data via FIFO buffers. It interfaces with Avalon memory-mapped devices and supports operations with signals like av_read_n and av_write_n for input and output data control. Internally, it leverages FIFO status signals (e.g., fifo_FF, fifo_EF) and sub-modules for distinct read/write operations. This structure ensures synchronized, overflow-managed data transmission and reception under a system clock, additionally managing IRQs based on FIFO thresholds.
