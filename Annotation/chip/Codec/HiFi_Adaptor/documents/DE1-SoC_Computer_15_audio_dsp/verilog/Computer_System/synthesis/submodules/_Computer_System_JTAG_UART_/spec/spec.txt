Module name: Computer_System_JTAG_UART. Module specification: The Computer_System_JTAG_UART is a Verilog module designed for handling JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) operations, specifically focusing on managing data transmission and reception via FIFO (First In First Out) buffers. It interfaces with Avalon memory-mapped devices incorporating inputs such as av_address, av_chipselect, av_read_n, av_write_n, av_writedata, clk, and rst_n, and outputs such as av_irq, av_readdata, av_waitrequest, dataavailable, and readyfordata. The internal signals, including ac, activity, fifo_AE, fifo_AF, rfifo_full, wfifo_used, and others, aid in managing data flow, interrupt requests, and synchronizing operations controlled by fifo_rd, fifo_wr signals. The module also contains sub-modules such as Computer_System_JTAG_UART_scfifo_w and Computer_System_JTAG_UART_scfifo_r, each handling specific FIFO operations related to writing and reading data. Transitional states such as resets, interrupts, data availability, FIFO thresholds, and system clock synchronization are explicitly managed, providing error handling and buffer overflow prevention within sophisticated data communication environments.
