Module-level comment: The `altera_up_video_clipper_drop` module processes video streams by clipping frames based on configurable parameters. It synchronizes video data via a finite state machine, which handles states for waiting, running the clipper, and adding missing parts. It includes internal logic for generating control signals and utilizes the external `altera_up_video_clipper_counters` for precise frame and line management, ensuring output stream integrity and frame accuracy.
