Module name: altera_up_video_scaler_multiply_height. 
Module specification: The 'altera_up_video_scaler_multiply_height' module is designed for scaling the height of an incoming video stream by manipulating the rows of video data. It accepts input ports such as `clk` (the clock signal for synchronization), `reset` (to initialize states and counters), `stream_in_data` (carries the incoming video data), `stream_in_startofpacket` and `stream_in_endofpacket` (which mark the beginning and end of a video frame), `stream_in_valid` (indicates validity of the input data), and `stream_out_ready` (signals the readiness of downstream components to receive data). The output ports include `stream_in_ready` (signals if the module can accept more data), `stream_out_data` (scaled video data), `stream_out_startofpacket` and `stream_out_endofpacket` (define packet boundaries in the scaled output), and `stream_out_valid` (indicates data validity in the output stream). Internal signals such as `fifo_data_in`, `fifo_data_out`, `fifo_empty`, `fifo_full`, `fifo_read`, `fifo_write`, `width_in`, `width_out`, and `enlarge_height_counter` handle data processing within FIFO buffers, manage data width, and control the scaling process. The module features several key blocks: state machine handling scaling stages, FIFO buffering for data management, and output assignment adapted based on state and FIFO status. Parameters like data width and count settings are configurable, aligning the module's functionality to varying video processing needs.
