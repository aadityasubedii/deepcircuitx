Module name: Computer_System_Audio_Subsystem_Audio.

Module specification: The Computer_System_Audio_Subsystem_Audio module serves as an audio interface subsystem within a computer system, handling both audio input and output through serialization and deserialization processes. It features input ports including clk (external clock), reset (external reset signal), address (selects the target register or function), chipselect (enables the module), read/write signals (indicate read or write operations), writedata (data to write), and audio-specific inputs like AUD_ADCDAT (audio data from ADC), AUD_BCLK (bit clock), AUD_ADCLRCK, and AUD_DACLRCK (clocks for ADC and DAC). The output ports are irq (interrupt), readdata (output data from read operations), and AUD_DACDAT (serialized audio data to DAC). Internally, the module uses signals such as bclk_rising_edge and bclk_falling_edge to handle the timing of data serialization and other signals like adc_lrclk_rising_edge and dac_lrclk_rising_edge to detect clock edges needed for synchronization. The code integrates several functional blocks: rising and falling edge detectors for clock signals to capture audio data accurately, serializers and deserializers (like Audio_In_Deserializer, Audio_Out_Serializer) for audio data handling, and logic handling read/write operations depending on the module's current state and operational commands. These implementations ensure the module operates correctly to manage audio input and output, maintaining synchronization with external audio codec hardware using the provided clock signals.
