Module-level comment: The `altera_up_video_itu_656_decoder` decodes ITU-R BT.656 serialized video data into a parallel format with control signals. Using internal registers and logic, it captures data, evaluates timing references, and processes line starts to output valid video data with packet boundary flags. Includes a submodule for appending end-of-packet flags based on processed signals, aiding in downstream synchronization and processing.
