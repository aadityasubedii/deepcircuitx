    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a memory-mapped interconnect for a computer system, managing data transfers between ARM A9 HPS, VGA subsystem, SDRAM, and on-chip SRAM. It utilizes AXI and Avalon-MM interfaces, along with various adapters and arbiters, to handle address translation, data width conversion, burst transfers, and multi-master arbitration. The interconnect ensures efficient communication between components with different interface requirements."
