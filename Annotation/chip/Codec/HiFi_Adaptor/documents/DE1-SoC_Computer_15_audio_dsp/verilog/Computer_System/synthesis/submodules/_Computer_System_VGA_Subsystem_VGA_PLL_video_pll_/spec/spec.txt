Module name: Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL_video_pll.
Module specification: The module 'Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL_video_pll' is designed to generate multiple VGA-compatible output clock frequencies through a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) setup using the provided `refclk` (reference clock) input as a basis for synchronization. The `refclk` input port, operating at a specified frequency of 50.0 MHz, along with the `rst` input port, which handles the reset functionality of the PLL, exemplify the module's input configuration. The outputs are three distinct clocks (`outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `outclk_2`) specified at frequencies of 25.0 MHz for the first two and 33.0 MHz for the third, and a `locked` signal indicating the PLL's lock status. The PLL's instantiation, referred to as `altera_pll_i`, directly utilizes the module's ports for reset, clock output, and lock status, and employs numerous parameters like clock frequency and duty cycle settings that allow precise control of the output characteristics. There are no explicitly defined internal signals as all key signals interface directly with the PLL instance. The module encapsulates the PLL configuration and facilitates output clock generation tailored for VGA video applications, showcasing a clear division between input handling, PLL configuration, and output generation.
