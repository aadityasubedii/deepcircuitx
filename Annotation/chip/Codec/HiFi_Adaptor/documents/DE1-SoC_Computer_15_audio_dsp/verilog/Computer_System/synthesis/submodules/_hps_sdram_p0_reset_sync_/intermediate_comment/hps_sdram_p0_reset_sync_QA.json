It uses a chain of flip-flops to avoid metastability issues in the reset signal when crossing clock domains. The parameter `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` controls the number of flip-flop stages used for synchronization, typically to filter out any glitches in the reset signal. The output `reset_n_sync` provides a synchronized version of the input reset signal (`reset_n`) to downstream logic or modules, ensuring reliable and stable reset behavior in the logic that operates synchronously with the clock provided (`clk`)."

The `clk` is the clock input to which the reset signal `reset_n` is being synchronized. Both these ports are fundamental for the operation of this module to ensure signals are synchronized to the specified clock domain, preventing any potential metastability issues when crossing from an asynchronous reset domain to a synchronous operation domain.\n\nOutput ports: reset_n_sync.  \nExplanation: The `reset_n_sync` is the output port that outputs the synchronized version of the `reset_n` signal. It is derived after the reset signal has passed through several stages of flip-flops (as defined by `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` and `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT`), ensuring that the synchronization has adequately filtered any glitches and the signal is stable within the operating clock domain. The use of this stable and synchronized signal as a reset ensures that all downstream logic elements or modules operate reliably under the same clock domain."

Each index of this register array represents a stage in the synchronization process. The first stage (`reset_reg[0]`) captures the initial active-high response to the inactive (`reset_n = 0`) reset signal, setting it to `1'b0`. In successive stages, until the `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` boundary, each `reset_reg[i]` inherits the value from `reset_reg[i-1]`, effectively passing the reset condition through a series of flip-flops running on the edge of the clock signal (`clk`). This technique filters out any potential glitches and stabilizes the reset signal by the time it reaches the last stage (`reset_reg[RESET_SYNC_STAGES-1]`) used in the output `reset_n_sync`. This register array is essential for achieving reliable synchronization of the asynchronous reset input to the clock domain of the module."
