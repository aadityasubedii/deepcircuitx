It takes in a command and handles the entire lifecycle of sending this command including initiating communication, transmitting data, managing clock signals, waiting for acknowledgment, and handling errors in communication due to timeouts. The module utilizes several state machines to control the flow of data bits and clock signals over PS2_CLK and PS2_DAT lines based on the state of the PS/2 clock and its own internal timing mechanisms defined by specified clock cycle parameters. Outputs from the module indicate whether a command was successfully sent and if any communication timed out."

Used in synchronization of data reception.\n- ps2_clk_negedge: Indicates a negative edge detection of the PS/2 Clock (PS2_CLK) line. Used in synchronization of data transmission.\n\nOutput ports: command_was_sent, error_communication_timed_out. \nExplanation: \n- command_was_sent: A signal that indicates whether the command was successfully sent without any timeout error based on the result of the acknowledgment bit.\n- error_communication_timed_out: A signal that is asserted when the communication attempt exceeds a predefined timeout period indicating an error in communication which results in the halting of the attempt to send the command.\n\nInout ports: PS2_CLK, PS2_DAT.\nExplanation:\n- PS2_CLK: The clock line for PS/2 communication. Used to synchronize the data transmission and reception with the PS/2 device.\n- PS2_DAT: The data line for PS/2 communication. This line is used to transmit data bits to or receive bits from the PS/2 device depending on the state of the transmission process. \n\nThis structure ensures the module can both send commands and handle communication protocols with appropriate signaling and feedback on operation success and failure."

It is incremented each time a negative edge is detected on the PS2 clock during data transmission, ensuring correct sequencing of bit transmission.\n  \n- **ps2_command**: A 9-bit register that holds the command, including a start bit, to be transmitted to the PS/2 device. It is constructed from the input `the_command` with parity generation.\n\n- **command_initiate_counter**: This counter is used during the initiation of communication. It counts clock cycles to hold the PS2_CLK low for a defined period (101 microseconds), signaling the start of a communication sequence.\n\n- **waiting_counter**: Manages the duration to wait for the PS2 clock line to become active after the communication has been initiated. If it exceeds a predefined period (15 milliseconds), it triggers a state transition to handle communication errors or timeouts.\n\n- **transfer_counter**: This counter is used during the data transmission and acknowledgment phases. It ensures that the data and stop bits do not exceed certain time limits (2 milliseconds per transmitted bit sequence), helping manage the timing for sending each bit or receiving an acknowledgment.\n\n- **ns_ps2_transmitter**: A next-state logic signal for the internal state machine that determines the next state based on current conditions and state. This register represents the state to be transitioned to on the next clock cycle.\n\n- **s_ps2_transmitter**: The current state register of the internal finite state machine that controls the various phases of the command transmission process. It holds the present state of the communication protocol, dictating the operation at each phase of the command transmission.\n\nThese internal signals interact closely to manage the control flow and data integrity of the command transmission to the PS/2 device, ensuring that commands are sent correctly and robustly, with error handling for communication timeouts."
