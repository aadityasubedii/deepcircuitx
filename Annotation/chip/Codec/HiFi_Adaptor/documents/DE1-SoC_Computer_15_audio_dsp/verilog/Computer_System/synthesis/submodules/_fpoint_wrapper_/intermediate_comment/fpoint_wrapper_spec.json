    "spec": "Module name: fpoint_wrapper. Module specification: The 'fpoint_wrapper' module serves as a conditional instantiator for two different floating-point processing modules, dynamically chosen based on the parameter 'useDivider'. If 'useDivider' is set to 1, it instantiates 'fpoint_hw_qsys'; otherwise, it instantiates 'fpoint_qsys'. These modules perform floating-point operations determined by the inputs 'dataa', 'datab', and an operation selector 'n', outputting a result and a 'done' signal when the operation completes. The inputs include 'clk' (clock signal for synchronization), 'clk_en' (enables operation toggling without altering the clock), 'dataa' and 'datab' (operands for the floating-point operation), 'n' (operation selector), 'reset' (resets the module's state), and 'start' (initiates data processing). The outputs are 'done' (indicates completion of the operation) and 'result' (the computed floating-point result). Internally, 'done' and 'result' are implemented as wire signals linked to the output of the instantiated module and serve as interfaces for signaling and data output, respectively. The module leverages Verilog's 'generate' construct to conditionally compile and instantiate the correct processing module based on 'useDivider', effortlessly managing the underlying hardware resources and operational flow.",
