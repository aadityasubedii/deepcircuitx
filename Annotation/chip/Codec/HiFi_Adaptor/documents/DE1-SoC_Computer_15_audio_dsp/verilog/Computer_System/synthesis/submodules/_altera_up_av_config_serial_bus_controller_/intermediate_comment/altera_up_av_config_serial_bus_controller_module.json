    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"altera_up_av_config_serial_bus_controller\" is a Verilog module designed to manage serial bus communications for FPGA configurations. It serializes data and controls transitions across several internal states (initialize, start, transfer, stop) using input controls and masks. The module implements a slow clock and state machine to synchronize and manage data transmission, supporting conditional restarts based on specific inputs, ensuring robust serial data handling."
