This FIFO is capable of managing video data streaming where the write and read operations are controlled by separate clocks (`wrclk` and `rdclk`). The FIFO keeps track of the usage statistics like the number of words used (`wrusedw` and `rdusedw`), and flags to indicate when it's full (`wrfull`) or empty (`rdempty`). It efficiently handles data synchronization between the producer (write) and the consumer (read) to ensure stable data transfer without data loss or overflow, critical in video processing applications."
