Module-level comment: The Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Edge_Detection_Subsystem processes video for edge detection by incorporating submodules such as Chroma_Filter, Chroma_Upsampler, and Edge_Detection. It interfaces with control signals for configuration and manages video flow through input and output streams. The module operates synchronously with a system clock and includes provisions for reset control, ensuring robust, real-time video processing with edge emphasis.
