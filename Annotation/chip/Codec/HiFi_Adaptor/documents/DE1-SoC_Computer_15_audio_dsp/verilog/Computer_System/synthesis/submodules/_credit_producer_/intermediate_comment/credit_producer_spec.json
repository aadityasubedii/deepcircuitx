    "spec": "Module name: credit_producer. Module specification: The `credit_producer` is a Verilog module designed to manage and increment credit counters for symbols and packets based on input data conditions. It operates under the synchronization of a system clock (`clk`) and an active-low reset (`reset_n`). Inputs include `in_valid` (data validity), `in_ready` (system readiness to accept data), and `in_endofpacket` (signal indicating the end of a packet). The outputs are `symbol_credits` and `packet_credits`, which track the number of symbol and packet credits, respectively. Internally, the module utilises signals such as `beat` (indicating an active data transfer), `eop_beat` (indicating an end-of-packet during an active transfer), `sym_count` and `next_sym_count` (temporary counters for symbols processed), and `rollover` (determining resets and credit increments based on symbol count thresholds). The code comprises different sections handling specific tasks: initialization and resetting of outputs on signal or clock changes, calculating credits for each beat based on symbols per beat and symbols per credit, managing symbol and packet credit increments based on conditions like end-of-packet or calculated thresholds. The design effectively combines parameterized configurations, conditional logic, and regular clock-edge triggered blocks to manage and compute credits accurately within a data processing environment.",

It increments these credits either per symbol or per packet based on the given parameters and conditions. The module accounts for symbols per credit and packets, adjusting the `symbol_credits` and `packet_credits` accordingly every clock cycle where conditions are met.

This is used in conjunction with `in_ready` to manage the flow of data and the accumulation of credits.\n- `in_ready`: Input ready signal, indicates that the system is ready to accept data. When both `in_valid` and `in_ready` are high, it signifies that valid data is being transferred, impacting the credit computations.\n- `in_endofpacket`: End of packet signal, denotes the end of a data packet. Used to increment the packet credit counter upon the conclusion of a packet.\n\nOutput ports: symbol_credits, packet_credits.\nExplanation:\n- `symbol_credits`: Output register that holds the count of symbol credits. It is incremented based on a defined number of symbols processed per credit, influenced by whether the input data is valid and ready.\n- `packet_credits`: Output register that tracks the number of packet credits. It increments each time an end-of-packet condition is detected with valid and ready data, signifying the completion of a packet transmission.\n"

It is used to determine when the symbol and packet credits should be considered for incrementation based on the data transfer activity.\n- `eop_beat`: This signal combines the `beat` signal with the `in_endofpacket` flag. It is specifically used to identify the cycles in which an end-of-packet condition occurs during an active data transfer, playing a crucial role in controlling the increment of packet credits.\n- `sym_count`: This register holds the count of symbols processed temporarily; it is used in scenarios where credits are calculated over multiple beats.\n- `next_sym_count`: This signal predicts the next value of symbol count by adding the number of symbols per beat to the current `sym_count` when a beat occurs. It helps in deciding whether a rollover in the symbol count should occur (based on the number of symbols per credit).\n- `rollover`: This signal is used to determine whether the symbol counting has reached or surpassed the threshold set by `SYMBOLS_PER_CREDIT`, or if an end-of-packet condition occurs.
