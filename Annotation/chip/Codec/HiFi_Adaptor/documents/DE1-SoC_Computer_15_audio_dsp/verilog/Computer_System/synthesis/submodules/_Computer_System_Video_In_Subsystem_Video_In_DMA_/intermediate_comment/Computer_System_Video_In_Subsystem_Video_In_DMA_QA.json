The DMA facilitates the direct transfer of video stream data from a source (like a camera) to system memory, bypassing the CPU to reduce its workload and improve data handling efficiency. The module manages the capturing of video streaming data\u2014marked by start and end packet signals\u2014and writes this data into a memory buffer determined by width and height parameters. It handles video stream validation, empty indicators, and synchronization with the master component's wait requests. The module utilizes two submodules, a DMA control slave for managing buffer addresses and DMA settings, and a DMA writer for actual data transfer to memory, both regulated by the module's clock and reset operations."

It signifies the need to move to the next memory location.\n- **reset_address:** This signal is used to reset the address counters, `w_address` and `h_address`, to zero. It is activated when the system or subsystem needs to start writing data to the initial position in memory again, typically at the start of a new frame.\n- **buffer_start_address:** Holds the starting memory address where video data should be written. This base address can be updated through control operations via the DMA_Control_Slave submodule, depending on the system\u2019s configuration and use-case.\n- **dma_enabled:** A flag to indicate whether DMA operations are enabled or not. This controls whether data from the video stream will be written to memory, affecting operations in the 'From_Stream_to_Memory' submodule.\n- **w_address:** The current address position (width) within the data buffer where the next piece of data will be written. It increments with each data write until it reaches the boundary (WIDTH) and resets to zero, incrementing `h_address`.\n- **h_address:** The current line or height address position in the data buffer. It increments when `w_address` reaches the maximum width, indicating a move to the next line of video data in memory.\n\nThese internal signals together manage the direct memory access and data placement ensuring the video stream is accurately captured and stored in system memory.\n"
