It uses an `altera_pll` component configured to receive a reference clock (`refclk`) and to output two clocks with defined frequencies and phase characteristics. The module ensures that the outputs are synchronized to the reference clock, with `outclk_0` and `outclk_1` both set to 100 MHz. A reset input (`rst`) allows for reinitialization of the PLL, and a `locked` output indicates when the PLL has successfully locked onto the given reference frequency. The internal configuration is tailored to ensure stable output frequencies without fractional multiplication, and it operates directly without additional complex mode settings."

It provides the source frequency from which the PLL generates the synchronized output clocks. This clock acts as the baseline for the PLL's frequency synthesis and locking process.\n- `rst`: This is the reset input. When activated, it initializes or resets the PLL component, effectively restarting the frequency synthesis process and allowing the PLL to re-lock to the reference clock.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `locked`.\nExplanation:\n- `outclk_0` and `outclk_1`: These are the output clocks from the PLL. Both are configured to operate at 100 MHz as stated in the configuration of the `altera_pll` component. These clocks are derived from the reference clock and provide synchronized clock signals for use in other parts of the system.\n- `locked`: This is a status output that indicates whether the PLL has successfully synchronized to the reference clock. A high signal on this port signifies that the PLL is locked and the output clocks are stable and ready for use. This is crucial for system stability and reliability to ensure that downstream components receive a stable clock signal.\n"
