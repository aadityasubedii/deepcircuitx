Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init. 
Module specification: The `altera_up_av_config_auto_init` module manages the initialization of a configuration by reading data from read-only memory (ROM) via a systematic process. It accepts input signals such as `clk` (clock signal to synchronize operations), `reset` (resets module's states), `clear_error` (clears detected errors), `ack` (acknowledgment signal for data handling), `transfer_complete` (indicates completion of data transfer), and `rom_data` (configuration data from ROM). It produces output including `data_out` (output data forwarded from ROM), `transfer_data` (control signal to indicate data transfer status), `rom_address` (ROM address pointer), `auto_init_complete` (indicates completion of initialization), and `auto_init_error` (flags errors during initialization). Internally, the `toggle_next_transfer` signal controls the ROM address increment and updates output flags based on data transfer status and completion. The code features distinct blocks handling data output, data transfer control, address sequencing, completion signaling, and error management. Each block contains an always block subscribed to the positive edge of the `clk`, updating the state based on the reset conditions and logic gates, ensuring a sequential and error-free initialization process.
