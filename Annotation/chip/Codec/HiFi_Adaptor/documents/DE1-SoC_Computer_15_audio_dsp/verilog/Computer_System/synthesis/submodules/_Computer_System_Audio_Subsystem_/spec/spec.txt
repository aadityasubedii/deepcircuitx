Module name: Computer_System_Audio_Subsystem. Module specification: The Computer_System_Audio_Subsystem is designed to manage the audio subsystem of a computer system. It interfaces with audio-related signals and hardware components for audio data processing. This Verilog module has several input ports such as `audio_ADCDAT`, `audio_ADCLRCK`, and `audio_BCLK` which are used to receive audio data and synchronize the audio streams. The output ports like `audio_DACDAT` and `audio_clk_clk` provide processed audio data and a clock signal derived from the audio PLL, respectively. This module utilizes internal signals, notably `rst_controller_reset_out_reset`, which functions as a reset signal ensuring the audio subsystem starts in a known state upon system reset. The code is structured into three main blocks: `Computer_System_Audio_Subsystem_Audio` processing the audio signals, `Computer_System_Audio_Subsystem_Audio_PLL` managing the PLL configuration, and `altera_reset_controller` which provides the reset logic. Each block plays a crucial role in handling different aspects of audio data processing and synchronization, ensuring the subsystem operates efficiently and robustly.
