It handles synchronization with external systems using a sync signal, and maintains the integrity of video packet data (start and end of packet markers, data validity, etc.). The stream selection can be dynamically changed, potentially between frames, but is locked during packet transmission to ensure data consistency. This selective streaming enables the use in subsystems like video processing where different processing paths might be required for different video data."

It ensures that the stream selection can only be changed during the safe periods, specifically when a packet ends or in between frames when the input stream isn't starting a new packet. This helps prevent inconsistent data routing mid-packet and manages the transition between stream channels safely.\n\n- **between_frames**: This signal is a flag to indicate the state between video packets. It is set to high (1) when the input video stream is between packets (after an end of one packet and before the start of the next) or after a reset. It is used in conjunction with other conditions to manage the timing for updating the `stream_select_reg`.\n\n- **stream_select_reg**: A registered version of the input `stream_select`. This signal holds the selected output stream path which can be either stream 0 or stream 1. Once set, usually between video packets, this selection remains consistent during the transmission of a video packet, ensuring stable routing of data to the chosen output stream.
