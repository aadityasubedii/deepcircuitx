    "spec": "Module name: Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Alpha_Blender. Module specification: The \"Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Alpha_Blender\" module is designed for alpha blending of foreground and background video streams in VGA systems, ensuring synchronized and valid output for downstream consumption. It takes inputs such as `clk` (clock signal) and `reset` (reset signal), along with `background_data` and `foreground_data` representing the pixel data for background and foreground images. Control signals like `background_startofpacket`, `background_endofpacket`, `foreground_startofpacket`, and `foreground_endofpacket` help manage packet alignment and synchronization. The module outputs `output_data` blended from input streams, along with packet and validation signals `output_startofpacket`, `output_endofpacket`, and `output_valid`. Internal signals include `new_red`, `new_green`, `new_blue` for the color outputs from the blending process, `sync_foreground` and `sync_background` for synchronization control, and `valid` for indicating the validity of the output data. The main blocks include logic assignments for control signal generation based on synchronization status, and an instantiation of `altera_up_video_alpha_blender_normal` block that handles the core blending computation, producing separated color channels from the mixed input streams. The module prioritizes efficient handling of data validity and synchronization to ensure seamless video stream blending.",

It becomes active when there's a start or end of packet mismatch between the background and foreground streams, indicating that the foreground needs alignment with the background. If the background signals the start/end of a packet and the foreground does not, this synchronization logic ensures proper handling of stream boundaries.\n  \n- `sync_background`: Similar to `sync_foreground`, but it manages synchronizing the background stream with the foreground. It becomes active when there is an alignment issue that needs resolving on the background's side, based on the foreground's packet signals.\n\n- `valid`: This signal determines whether the output data from the blending process is valid. The output is considered valid only when both foreground and background streams are valid, and there are no synchronization issues as indicated by `sync_foreground` and `sync_background`. This signal helps the system avoid processing and transmitting unreliable data."
