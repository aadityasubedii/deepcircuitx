It includes mechanisms to send commands to and receive data from a PS/2 device. It functions by managing PS/2 communication protocols including handling clock signals and data transmission through state machine transitions. The module can detect positive and negative edges of the PS/2 clock signal and uses this for synchronizing data transfer. It maintains an idle counter and transitions through various states based on this counter, outgoing command signals, and the reception of data. This ensures that the module sends commands only when appropriate and correctly handles incoming data, including error detection when communication timeouts occur."
