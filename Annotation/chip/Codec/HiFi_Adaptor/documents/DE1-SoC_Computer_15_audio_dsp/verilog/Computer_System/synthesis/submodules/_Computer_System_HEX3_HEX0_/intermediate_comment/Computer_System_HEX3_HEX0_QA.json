It utilizes inputs such as an address, chipselect signal, clock, and reset signal for performing read or write operations on data. The module outputs a 16-bit 'out_port' which reflects the internal data_out register's value and a 32-bit 'readdata' which is the zero-extended 'data_out' based on the address input. The operations are synchronized with the clock and reset signals to ensure proper data handling and initialization."

It is the data output that can be linked to other parts of a system requiring the processed data.\n- 'readdata' (32-bit): Provides a read output which is the zero-extended version of the 'data_out'.

It is updated on the positive edge of the clock when the module is not in reset state, chipselect is active, and write operation is enabled (write_n is low).\n- 'read_mux_out' (16-bit): This signal is used to gate or mask the 'data_out' based on the address.
