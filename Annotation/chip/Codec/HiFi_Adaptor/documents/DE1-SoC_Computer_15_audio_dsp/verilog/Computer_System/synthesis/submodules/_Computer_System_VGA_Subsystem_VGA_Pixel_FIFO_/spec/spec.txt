Module name: Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Pixel_FIFO.

Module specification: The `Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Pixel_FIFO` is a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) buffer module specifically designed for managing pixel data in a VGA subsystem of a computer system. This module handles the data flow between input and output interfaces which may operate at different clock rates. Key input ports include `clk_stream_in`, `reset_stream_in`, and `stream_in_data`, among others, which together are responsible for synchronizing, resetting, and providing pixel data and control signals into the FIFO. The output ports such as `stream_out_data` and `stream_out_valid` send processed pixel data out of the FIFO. Internally, the module utilizes signals like `fifo_wr_used` to track the number of words in the FIFO to manage data acceptance, and `fifo_empty` to control data output based on FIFO's status. The primary block in the code, a `dcfifo` component, is configured with parameters for device family, speed, and memory architecture to create a FIFO suited for high-speed and efficient data handling. This FIFO interfaces directly with the input and output, managing the storage and retrieval of data packets to ensure steady data flow across potentially mismatched processing units.
