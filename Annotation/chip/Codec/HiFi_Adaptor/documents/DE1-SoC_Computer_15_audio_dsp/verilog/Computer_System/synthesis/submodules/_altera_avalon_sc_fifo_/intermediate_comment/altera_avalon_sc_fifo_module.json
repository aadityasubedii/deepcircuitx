    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable FIFO buffer for data streaming. It supports variable data width, depth, and optional features like packet handling and error tracking. The implementation uses either block memory or shift registers based on parameters. It manages read/write pointers, handles full/empty conditions, and provides optional CSR interface for configuration and status reporting. The module can operate in packet mode with store-and-forward capability, supporting cut-through operation and error handling."
