Module-level comment: The Computer_System_HEX3_HEX0 module interfaces a simple computer system handling HEX3 to HEX0 data operations. It accepts address, chipselect, clk, reset_n, write_n, and writedata inputs, managing internal data via data_out register. Operations are clock-synchronized, with write conditions checked actively. Outputs include a mirroring 16-bit out_port and a conditional 32-bit readdata, zero-extended based on the address. Essential functions occur within an always block, processing reset and write logic effectively.
