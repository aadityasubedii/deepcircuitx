    "module": "Module-level comment: The Computer_System_IrDA module handles IrDA communication by serializing and deserializing data. It monitors and controls data integrity and buffer status using internal signals and FIFO operations, responding to read and write commands via addressable registers. Interrupts are managed based on buffer conditions to maintain reliable data transmission. The module integrates deserializer and serializer blocks for processing incoming and outgoing data streams, ensuring efficient operation under a clocked environment with a reset capability."
