Module-level comment: The Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Pixel_Scaler module scales VGA video data dimensions via inputs (data stream and control signals) and outputs processed data stream and control signals. Implements scaling by interconnecting `Multiply_Height` and `Multiply_Width` components, leveraging internal signals to maintain data integrity and synchrony between processing stages, controlled by a clock and reset.
