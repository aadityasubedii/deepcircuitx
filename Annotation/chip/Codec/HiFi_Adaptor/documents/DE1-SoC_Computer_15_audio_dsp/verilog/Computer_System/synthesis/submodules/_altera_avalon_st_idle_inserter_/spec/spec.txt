Module name: altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter. 
Module specification: The "altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter" module is designed for the insertion of special control characters—specifically `idle` and `escape`—into a data stream. This module has the following ports: `clk` (clock input for synchronization), `reset_n` (active-low reset for internal states), `in_valid` (indicates incoming data validity), `in_data` (8-bit input data), `out_ready` (indicates downstream component readiness to accept data), `in_ready` (signals upstream components when the module can accept more data), `out_valid` (indicates the validity of output data), and `out_data` (8-bit output data possibly modified to include special characters). Internally, the module utilizes `received_esc` (a register that indicates receipt of a control character), `idle_char` (a signal activated when `in_data` matches the idle character), and `escape_char` (activated when `in_data` matches the escape character). The module operates primarily through two major procedural blocks: The first block executes on the positive clock edge or negative reset edge to manage the `received_esc` flag based on data validity and readiness signals, handling scenarios involving special character detection. The second block determines the outputs (`out_valid`, `in_ready`, `out_data`) dependent on various conditions like input validity, data readiness, and control character detection, ensuring correct data flow and character insertion based on the current operational state and received data.
