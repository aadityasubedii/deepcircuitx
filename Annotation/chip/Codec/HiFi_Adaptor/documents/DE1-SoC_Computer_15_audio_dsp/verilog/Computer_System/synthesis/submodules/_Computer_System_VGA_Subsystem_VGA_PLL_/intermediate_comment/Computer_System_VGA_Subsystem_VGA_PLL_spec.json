    "spec": "Module name: Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL.\nModule specification: The `Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_PLL` module is designed to provide a stable VGA clock signal for a VGA display subsystem within a computer system. It takes two input ports: `ref_clk_clk`, used as the reference clock for timing the PLL; and `ref_reset_reset`, used to reset the PLL on synchronization problems or initialization. The module outputs two signals: `vga_clk_clk`, the VGA clock signal generated by the PLL for the display timing; and `reset_source_reset`, a reset signal controlled based on the PLL lock status to ensure stable VGA subsystem operations. Internally, the module uses the signal `video_pll_locked_export` to monitor the PLL lock status, which indicates when the generated clocks are stable and hence, when the VGA subsystem can function reliably. The module includes a PLL component named `video_pll` with a locked export signal connected to a `reset_from_locked` block, which effectively manages the reset control correlated with the PLL's stability and lock status, ensuring synchronization and proper functionality across the VGA display subsystem.",
