    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_up_video_scaler_multiply_height` module scales the height of a video stream by duplicating rows as necessary. It operates based on input signals synchronized to a system clock, utilizing a FIFO for data buffering and a state machine for tracking three key operational states. These states manage reading, looping, and outputting of video lines, scaling the video accordingly, while interacting with output port signals to control data flow and ensure proper scaling output."
