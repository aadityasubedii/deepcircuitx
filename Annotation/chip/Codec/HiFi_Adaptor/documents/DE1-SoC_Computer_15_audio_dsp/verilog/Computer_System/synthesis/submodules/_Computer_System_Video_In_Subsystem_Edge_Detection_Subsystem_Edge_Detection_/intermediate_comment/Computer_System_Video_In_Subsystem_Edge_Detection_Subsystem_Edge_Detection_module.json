    "module": "Module-level comment: This module performs edge detection on video data using Gaussian smoothing, Sobel filtering, nonmaximum suppression, and hysteresis operations sequentially. It handles video frame synchronization and phrase signaling through input and output ports, implementing pipelines for efficient data flow management. Additionally, internal signals and registers synchronize and control data progression through varied processing stages, ensuring accurate edge enhancement and detection in video streams."
