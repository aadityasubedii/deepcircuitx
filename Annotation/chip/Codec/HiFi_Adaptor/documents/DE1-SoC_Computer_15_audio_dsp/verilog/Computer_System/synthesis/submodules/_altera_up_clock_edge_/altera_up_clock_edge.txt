Module-level comment: The "altera_up_clock_edge" module detects rising and falling edges of a test clock (test_clk) relative to a primary clock (clk). It uses sequential logic where 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk' registers store current and previous states of 'test_clk' sampled at clk's positive edge. Edge transitions are flagged through 'rising_edge' and 'falling_edge' outputs based on these stored values, with the help of XOR logic in 'found_edge' to detect state changes.
