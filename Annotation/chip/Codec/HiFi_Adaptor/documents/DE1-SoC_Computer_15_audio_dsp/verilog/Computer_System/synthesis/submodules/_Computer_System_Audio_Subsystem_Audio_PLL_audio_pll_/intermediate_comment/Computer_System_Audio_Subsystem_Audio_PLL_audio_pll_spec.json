    "spec": "Module name: Computer_System_Audio_Subsystem_Audio_PLL_audio_pll.\n\nModule specification: The `Computer_System_Audio_Subsystem_Audio_PLL_audio_pll` is a Verilog module designed to generate a stable clock signal of 12.288135 MHz for audio applications within a computer system's audio subsystem, using a reference clock of 50.0 MHz provided to a phase-locked loop (PLL). It consists of two main input ports: `refclk` (Reference Clock), which supplies the essential reference clock to the PLL, and `rst` (Reset), which is used to reset the PLL configurations. The output ports are `outclk_0` (Output Clock), the generated clock signal, and `locked` (Locked Signal), a status signal indicating the PLL's locked state. Internally, the module uses no user-defined signals but utilizes an instance of `altera_pll` configured with specific parameters defining frequency, phase, duty cycle for a single output clock while leaving others at zero defaults. This instance (named `altera_pll_i`) directly handles the `refclk`, `rst`, and additional control signals, and also outputs the \u2018outclk_0\u2019 and \u2018locked\u2019 states. The entire operation is executed within this PLL configuration block, without extra signal manipulation or generation in the module itself, leading to direct mapping from input to output through the `altera_pll_i` instantiation.",

It uses an Altera PLL component to generate a clock signal of 12.288135 MHz from a reference clock of 50.0 MHz. The module has inputs for a reference clock (`refclk`) and reset signal (`rst`), and it outputs a clock signal (`outclk_0`) and a locked signal (`locked`) to indicate that the PLL has successfully locked to the desired frequency. All other output clocks and phases are set to zero and their respective phase shifts and duty cycles are at default values, indicating no additional clocks are generated."

The provided Verilog code uses an instance of `altera_pll` which directly maps the input and output ports of the module to the respective ports of the PLL instance (`altera_pll_i`). All operation and configuration of signals happen inside this instantiated module, thus the lack of further internal signals in the top module. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown:\n- Connections to the PLL (`altera_pll_i`) use the direct input (`refclk`, `rst`) and output (`outclk_0`, `locked`) ports. There's no intermediate signal manipulation or generation within the `Computer_System_Audio_Subsystem_Audio_PLL_audio_pll` itself.\n- `fboutclk` and `fbclk` are PLL specific signals required for feedback mechanisms within the `altera_pll` instantiation, but as seen in this code, external handling or connection isn't performed (as evident by `fboutclk` being left unconnected and `fbclk` is set to a constant `1'b0`). Thus, they are not considered internal signals within the context of the `Computer_System_Audio_Subsystem_Audio_PLL_audio_pll` module.\n"
