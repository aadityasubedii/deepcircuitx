Module name: hps_sdram. Module specification: The hps_sdram module is a high-performance SDRAM controller for DDR3 memory in a hardware processor system. It manages memory operations, including timing, address mapping, and data transfer. The module has input ports for clock (pll_ref_clk), reset signals (global_reset_n, soft_reset_n), and OCT calibration (oct_rzqin). Output ports include memory interface signals such as address (mem_a), bank address (mem_ba), clock (mem_ck, mem_ck_n), and control signals (mem_cke, mem_cs_n, mem_ras_n, mem_cas_n, mem_we_n, mem_reset_n, mem_odt). Bidirectional ports (mem_dq, mem_dqs, mem_dqs_n
