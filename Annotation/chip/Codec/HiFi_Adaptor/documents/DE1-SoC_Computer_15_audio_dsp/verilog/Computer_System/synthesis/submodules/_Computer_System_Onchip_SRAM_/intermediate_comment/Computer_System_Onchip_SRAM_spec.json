    "spec": "Module name: Computer_System_Onchip_SRAM. \n\nModule specification: The Computer_System_Onchip_SRAM module is designed to interface with dual-port SRAM using the `altsyncram` component, facilitating bidirectional data flows and operations including read and write actions via two distinct ports. Input ports include 16-bit `address` and `address2` for locating data positions, 4-bit `byteenable` and `byteenable2` for byte-level data control, boolean `chipselect` and `chipselect2` to engage SRAM operations, system `clk` as the primary timing signal, `clken` and `clken2` as operational timers, `reset` for system initialization, `reset_req` for clock gating, boolean `write` and `write2` controlling data writing, and 32-bit `writedata` and `writedata2` serving as data inputs for each port. Output ports only comprise 32-bit `readdata` and `readdata2`, which deliver data read from specified addresses. Internally, the module uses signals such as `clocken0`, a reverse of `reset_req` for clock gating logic; `not_clken` and `not_clken2`, derived from negating `clken` and `clken2` to manage SRAM address line stability; `wren` and `wren2` formulating write enable indicators through logic gates, ensuring data integrity during writing processes. The `altsyncram` block as a main component uses parameters and signals to administer data storage and retrieval, configured with setup definitions like memory depth, width, and initial contents. The coherent organization of letting input controls dictate operational flow, alongside parameterized SRAM configuration, underscores efficient data management while upholding system integrity and performance.\n",

It manages data writing and reading operations from two different ports, each with their own dedicated inputs like address, byte enable, chip select, clock enable, write control, and data buses. The underlying `altsyncram` component allows for bidirectional data flow on these dual ports and can be configured through the parameters such as memory depth, data width, and initial content loaded from a specified HEX file. The module ensures correct data handling by managing write enable signals and providing output read data corresponding to the input addresses. Additionally, it handles clock gating and reset functionalities to maintain proper operational timing and system integrity."

Explanation: \n- `address` and `address2`: These are 16-bit wide ports used for specifying the memory addresses in the SRAM for read or write operations for port A and port B, respectively. \n- `byteenable` and `byteenable2`: These 4-bit wide ports allow byte-level control over the data being written to the SRAM, helping in partial updates of data for each port.\n- `chipselect` and `chipselect2`: These boolean inputs enable the SRAM operations (read or write) when high for their respective ports.\n- `clk`: This is the system clock input which drives the timing of read and write operations of the SRAM.\n- `clken` and `clken2`: These clock enable signals are used to control the operational timing for each port, allowing the SRAM to be selectively responsive to the system clock.\n- `reset`: A system reset input which might be used for initializing the system or SRAM to a known state, not used in this module directly but could impact module operation.\n- `reset_req`: This input is used for clock gating control. It's negation internally controls the `clocken0` signal, which likely affects the SRAM internal operations.\n- `write` and `write2`: Boolean signals that enable data writing to the SRAM when set high for the respective ports.\n- `writedata` and `writedata2`: These 32-bit wide buses carry the data to be written to the SRAM for each respective port.\n\nOutput ports: `readdata`, `readdata2`. Explanation:\n- `readdata` and `readdata2`: These 32-bit wide ports output the data read from the SRAM corresponding to the addresses specified on `address` and `address2`, respectively. These outputs depend on the state of other control signals and the SRAM's internal processing."

This helps in controlling the operational timing of the memory interface.\n- `not_clken` and `not_clken2`: These are the negated versions of `clken` and `clken2` respectively. They are used to stall the SRAM address lines for the corresponding ports when the clock enable signals (`clken` and `clken2`) are not active. This is important for ensuring that address lines are held stable and memory operations don't occur accidentally due to undefined clock enable states.\n- `wren` and `wren2`: These signals are the write enable controls for each SRAM port (A and B respectively). Each is computed as the logical AND of `chipselect`, `write`, and `clken` (similarly for port B with its respective signals). These signals determine when a write operation is allowed to proceed on each port, ensuring data is only written when explicitly enabled by the controlling logic.

Input ports include 16-bit `address` and `address2` for locating data positions, 4-bit `byteenable` and `byteenable2` for byte-level data control, boolean `chipselect` and `chipselect2` to engage SRAM operations, system `clk` as the primary timing signal, `clken` and `clken2` as operational timers, `reset` for system initialization, `reset_req` for clock gating, boolean `write` and `write2` controlling data writing, and 32-bit `writedata` and `writedata2` serving as data inputs for each port. Output ports only comprise 32-bit `readdata` and `readdata2`, which deliver data read from specified addresses. Internally, the module uses signals such as `clocken0`, a reverse of `reset_req` for clock gating logic; `not_clken` and `not_clken2`, derived from negating `clken` and `clken2` to manage SRAM address line stability; `wren` and `wren2` formulating write enable indicators through logic gates, ensuring data integrity during writing processes. The `altsyncram` block as a main component uses parameters and signals to administer data storage and retrieval, configured with setup definitions like memory depth, width, and initial contents. The coherent organization of letting input controls dictate operational flow, alongside parameterized SRAM configuration, underscores efficient data management while upholding system integrity and performance.\n"
