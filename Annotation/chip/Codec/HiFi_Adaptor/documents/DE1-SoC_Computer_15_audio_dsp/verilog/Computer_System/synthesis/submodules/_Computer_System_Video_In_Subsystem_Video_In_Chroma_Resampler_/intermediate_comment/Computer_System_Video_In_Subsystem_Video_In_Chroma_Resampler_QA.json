It handles the input stream of chrominance data (Cr and Cb components), resamples it according to a defined logic, and outputs the modified stream. The resampling occurs based on alternating input values of Cr and Cb which are buffered and then rearranged in the output stream. The system works synchronously with a clock signal and can be reset. It ensures correct data handling at the beginning and end of the packet through control signals, and handles empty or partial data scenarios using signal flags. The module interacts with other system components through ready/valid handshake protocols for both input and output data streams, ensuring inter-component synchronization and data flow control.\n"

It synchronizes the processing of input data and generation of output data.\n- **reset**: Reset signal to initialize or reset the internal states of the module, ensuring it starts in a known state when activated.\n- **stream_in_data**: Input data stream, carrying the chrominance component values (Cr and Cb) of a video signal.\n- **stream_in_startofpacket**: Signal indicating the beginning of a packet within the input data stream. It helps the module recognize packet boundaries.\n- **stream_in_endofpacket**: Signal indicating the end of a packet within the input data stream, used by the module to handle packet boundaries properly.\n- **stream_in_empty**: Flag showing the number of empty or invalid bytes in the incoming data word, which helps in processing partial data.\n- **stream_in_valid**: Signal that validates the data present on the input stream. The module processes data only when this signal is active.\n- **stream_out_ready**: Signal from the downstream module indicating that it is ready to accept data.
