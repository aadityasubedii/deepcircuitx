Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_dc2. 
Module specification: The altera_up_av_config_auto_init_dc2 is a digital hardware module primarily designed for initializing and configuring device settings based on various input addresses, specifically utilizing the `rom_address` input port to determine the correct settings. The module's main functionality includes loading these configuration parameters into an internal `data` register from a predefined set of constants, each corresponding to different device features like camera or display parameters. The `rom_address` input port is a 5-bit bus that specifies the address from which to fetch the configuration settings. The output port, `rom_data`, is a 36-bit bus that delivers the configuration data to external devices or systems. The `data` register, an internal signal of size 32-bit, temporarily stores these settings. The module uses an `always` block, which contains a `case` statement that decides the content to be loaded into `data` based on `rom_address`. The configuration data is then formatted by interspersing each byte with a zero bit to create the final 36-bit `rom_data` output using an `assign` statement outside the `always` block. This output formatting is crucial for aligning with specific communication or protocol requirements necessary in system operations. Each part of the module is designed to ensure efficient data handling, transition, and output generation for system configuration and initialization tasks.
