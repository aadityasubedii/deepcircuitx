Module-level comment: The "Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Alpha_Blender" blends foreground and background VGA streams, ensuring synchronized, valid outputs. Utilizes internal signals for color channel blending and synchronization checks (`sync_foreground`, `sync_background`). Features control logic for packet alignment and an embedded alpha blending block for color computation, maintaining robust data validity throughout the process.
