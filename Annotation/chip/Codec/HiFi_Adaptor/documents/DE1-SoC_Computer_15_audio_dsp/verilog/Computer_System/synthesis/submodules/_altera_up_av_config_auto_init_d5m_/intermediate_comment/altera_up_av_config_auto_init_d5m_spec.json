It utilizes a ROM address to select and output specific configuration data. The data output format is adjusted by separating bytes with zeros to match a 36-bit bus width required, likely by the connected hardware. The module takes input `exposure` and incorporates it into the camera settings, allowing dynamic adjustment based on external inputs.
