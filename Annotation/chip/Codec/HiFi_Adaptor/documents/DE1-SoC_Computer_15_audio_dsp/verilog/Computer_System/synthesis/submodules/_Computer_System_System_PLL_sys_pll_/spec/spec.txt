Module name: Computer_System_System_PLL_sys_pll. Module specification: The 'Computer_System_System_PLL_sys_pll' is a Verilog module designed to generate two synchronized 100 MHz output clocks (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`) from a single reference clock (`refclk`) using an `altera_pll` component configured for fixed frequency synthesis without fractional multiplication. The module includes input ports for the reference clock (`refclk`), used to derive the system clocks, and reset (`rst`), which allows the PLL to be reinitialized or reset. The `rst` and `refclk` are directed to the PLL from these inputs. The output ports include the two 100 MHz clocks and a `locked` signal, indicating if the PLL has successfully locked onto the reference frequency. Apart from these connections, there are no other internal signals specifically defined within the module, as the `altera_pll` component manages all necessary internal signaling. The code structure consists mainly of the instantiation of the `altera_pll` component, which encompasses parameter settings such as clock frequencies, phase shifts, and operational mode, followed by mapping these configurations along with the module's ports (`rst`, `refclk`, `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `locked`) to the internal pins and outputs of the PLL. This setup ensures timing stability and synchronization crucial for dependable system operations where precise clock synchronization is mandatory.
