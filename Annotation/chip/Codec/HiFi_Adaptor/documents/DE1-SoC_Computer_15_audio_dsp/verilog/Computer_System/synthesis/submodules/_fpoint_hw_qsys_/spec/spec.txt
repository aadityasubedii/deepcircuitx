Module name: fpoint_hw_qsys. Module specification: This module is a floating-point arithmetic unit that can perform multiplication, addition/subtraction, and division operations on 32-bit IEEE 754 single-precision floating-point numbers. It takes two input operands (dataa and datab), a 2-bit operation selector (n), and control signals (clk, clk_en, reset, start) as inputs. The module outputs a 32-bit result and a done signal. Internally, it uses registers to store input operands and a counter for operation timing. The module contains three main sub-modules: a floating-point multiplier, an adder/subtractor, and a divider. The operation is selected using the 'n' input, where 0 is multiply, 1/2 is add/subtract, and 3 is divide. The module uses a counter to control the
