It uses the `altsource_probe` component to connect the `probe_input` signal to internal debugging or test structures possibly accessible via JTAG or other test access mechanisms. The various parameters like `probe_width` and `instance_id` are configured, and settings including the avoidance of metastability issues (`enable_metastability = \"NO\"`) are specified. The `altsource_probe` is used without many of its optional connections (`source_clk`, `tdi`, `tdo`, etc.), suggesting a simplified usage focus mainly on probing."
