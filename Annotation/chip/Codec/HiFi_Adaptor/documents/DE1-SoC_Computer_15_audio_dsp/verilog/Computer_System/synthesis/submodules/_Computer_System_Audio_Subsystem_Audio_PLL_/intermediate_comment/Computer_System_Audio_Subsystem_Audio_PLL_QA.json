It takes an input reference clock (`ref_clk_clk`) and a reset signal (`ref_reset_reset`). It outputs an audio clock signal (`audio_clk_clk`) and a reset signal (`reset_source_reset`). The module utilizes a PLL component (`audio_pll`) to generate the audio clock based on the reference clock, ensuring it is locked to a specific frequency. An additional component (`reset_from_locked`) generates the reset output signal conditioned upon the PLL achieving and maintaining a lock on the desired frequency, ensuring the system operates reliably with a stable clock source."

Explanation: `ref_clk_clk` is the reference clock signal used by the PLL as the base frequency from which the audio clock is generated. `ref_reset_reset` is a reset signal that initializes the PLL's internal state, ensuring it starts in a known condition whenever the system reset is triggered.\n\nOutput ports: `audio_clk_clk`, `reset_source_reset`. Explanation: `audio_clk_clk` is the output clock signal generated by the PLL, specifically tuned for audio applications to ensure stable sound processing. `reset_source_reset` is the output reset signal, which is conditioned based on the PLL's lock status. It remains active (logic low) until the PLL locks onto the desired frequency, ensuring dependent subsystems stay in reset until the clock is stable."
