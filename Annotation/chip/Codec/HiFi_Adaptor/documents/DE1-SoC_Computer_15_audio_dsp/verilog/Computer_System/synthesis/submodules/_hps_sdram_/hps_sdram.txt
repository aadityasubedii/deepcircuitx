Module-level comment: This module implements a high-performance SDRAM controller for DDR3 memory in a hardware processor system. It manages memory timing, address mapping, and data transfer operations using multiple subcomponents: PLL for clock generation, AFI for memory interface, DLL for signal timing, and OCT for signal termination. The controller supports various configuration options and includes logic for calibration, power management, and error handling.
