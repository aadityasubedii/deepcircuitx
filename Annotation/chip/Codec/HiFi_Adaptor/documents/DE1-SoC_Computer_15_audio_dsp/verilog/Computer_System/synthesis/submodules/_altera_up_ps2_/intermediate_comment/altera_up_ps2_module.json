    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'altera_up_ps2' module interfaces with PS/2 devices to manage communication via a protocol that includes clock signal synchronization and data transaction handling. It uses a state machine to control transaction sequences and edge detection for precise timing, leveraging internal signals and submodules 'PS2_Data_In' and 'PS2_Command_Out' for handling data reception and sending commands respectively. This structured approach ensures reliability in communication with keyboards and mice."
