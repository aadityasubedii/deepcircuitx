Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_d5m.
Module specification: The altera_up_av_config_auto_init_d5m is a Verilog module designed primarily for configuring the D5M camera or analogous devices. It uses input ports `rom_address`, a 5-bit selector for different camera settings, and `exposure`, a 16-bit input that dynamically adjusts the camera's exposure levels. The only output port, `rom_data`, sends a 36-bit formatted configuration data to the camera. Internally, the module employs a 32-bit register named `data` to hold the temporary configuration data before its formatted transmission. The data stored in `data` is structured as `{8'hBA, 8-bit_command, 16-bit_value}`, allowing for organized handling of command identification and command values. The module logic is primarily encapsulated within an "always" block using a case statement based on `rom_address` to assign configuration settings to the `data` register. Furthermore, the code supports conditional compilation with `ENABLE_TEST_PATTERN` to switch between test and operational modes, proving essential for flexible testing and deployment. The signal `rom_data` is then derived from `data` by inserting zeros to match the 36-bit required bus width, ensuring compatibility with the camera's interfacing needs.
