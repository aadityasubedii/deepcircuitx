Module name: Computer_System_Nios2_cpu_debug_slave_wrapper. Module specification: The "Computer_System_Nios2_cpu_debug_slave_wrapper" is a Verilog module designed to facilitate debugging operations for a Nios II CPU through handling debug signals and interfacing with JTAG operations. The module takes a variety of input signals including data registers MonDReg and break_readreg, clock and reset signals, debug acknowledgement, monitoring status indicators, and trace memory controls, among others. Its outputs include signals like jdo for JTAG data output, various flags for tracing actions, and control signals for managing breakpoints and on-chip memory. Internally, the module leverages signals such as shift registers and JTAG-specific controls like vji_cdr (capture DR) and vji_sdr (shift DR) to manage the state and data flow within the debug operations. The Verilog code is structured around two main instantiated sub-modules: "Computer_System_Nios2_cpu_debug_slave_tck" dealing with JTAG clock-related logic, and "Computer_System_Nios2_cpu_debug_slave_sysclk" that handles debug operations synchronized to the system clock. These blocks integrate the debugging functionalities, enabling efficient management of the CPUâ€™s debug state through a structured interface of tracing and breakpoint management.
