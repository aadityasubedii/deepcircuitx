It maps a set of predefined configuration parameters to specific addresses for the LCD's ROM. When provided with an `rom_address`, the module outputs a corresponding 16-bit `rom_data` value, where the first 8 bits may include a parameter-specific command or identifier (with the upper 2 bits of these set to zero) and the lower 8 bits hold the configuration data (such as brightness level, contrast, etc.). This data construction aids in setting up the LCD according to specific operational characteristics like power settings, display orientation, gamma correction levels, and more."

Explanation: The `rom_address` input port is a 5-bit value used to specify the address in the ROM from which the configuration data needs to be fetched. This address directly correlates to a specific parameter or setting in the LCD configuration.\n\nOutput ports: [rom_data]. Explanation: The `rom_data` output port is a 16-bit value that is generated based on the `rom_address` input. It consists of a 14-bit data value and 2 high-order zeros, allowing it to carry both command/identifiers and the actual parameter data to be used in configuring the LCD module. This port effectively provides a formatted configuration value that is ready to be interpreted by the LCD hardware."

Explanation: The `data` signal is a 14-bit internal register used within the module to hold the LCD configuration values temporarily. It is constructed by appending a 6-bit identifier or command to an 8-bit configuration parameter value, which is selected based on the `rom_address` input. This register `data` acts as an intermediary storage that holds the combined value before it is extended and formatted into the 16-bit `rom_data` output, which is delivered to the LCD hardware for processing. This signal is crucial for mapping the specific configuration settings to the corresponding addresses, thereby ensuring that the LCD module is configured correctly."
