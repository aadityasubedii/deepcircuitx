This input is used to determine the state of the output reset signal. A high value (1) on \"locked\" indicates that a system, such as a phase-locked loop (PLL), is in a stable or \"locked\" state, while a low value (0) suggests it is \"unlocked\" or not stable.\n\nOutput ports: [reset]. Explanation: The \"reset\" port is the output signal from the module. It is an active-low reset signal, which means it is high (1) when the \"locked\" input is low (0), and low (0) when the \"locked\" input is high (1). This output is used to control the reset functionality in other parts of a system, typically to initialize or reset them when the \"locked\" condition is not met."
