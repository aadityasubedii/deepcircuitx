Module name: Computer_System_Onchip_SRAM. 

Module specification: The Computer_System_Onchip_SRAM module is designed to interface with dual-port SRAM using the `altsyncram` component, facilitating bidirectional data flows and operations including read and write actions via two distinct ports. Input ports include 16-bit `address` and `address2` for locating data positions, 4-bit `byteenable` and `byteenable2` for byte-level data control, boolean `chipselect` and `chipselect2` to engage SRAM operations, system `clk` as the primary timing signal, `clken` and `clken2` as operational timers, `reset` for system initialization, `reset_req` for clock gating, boolean `write` and `write2` controlling data writing, and 32-bit `writedata` and `writedata2` serving as data inputs for each port. Output ports only comprise 32-bit `readdata` and `readdata2`, which deliver data read from specified addresses. Internally, the module uses signals such as `clocken0`, a reverse of `reset_req` for clock gating logic; `not_clken` and `not_clken2`, derived from negating `clken` and `clken2` to manage SRAM address line stability; `wren` and `wren2` formulating write enable indicators through logic gates, ensuring data integrity during writing processes. The `altsyncram` block as a main component uses parameters and signals to administer data storage and retrieval, configured with setup definitions like memory depth, width, and initial contents. The coherent organization of letting input controls dictate operational flow, alongside parameterized SRAM configuration, underscores efficient data management while upholding system integrity and performance.
