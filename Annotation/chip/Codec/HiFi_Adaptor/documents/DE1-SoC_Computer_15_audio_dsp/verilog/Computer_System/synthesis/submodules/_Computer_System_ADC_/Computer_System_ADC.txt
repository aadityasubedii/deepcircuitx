Module-level comment: The Computer_System_ADC module interfaces with an ADC, managing analog to digital conversion using synchronization signals, handling data through read/write operations, and storing results. It controls ADC operations via `go`, `auto_run`, and ADC-specific I/O ports, using an instantiated ADC control sub-module parameterized by operational settings. Read/write operations are conditionally managed based on the conversion status to ensure data integrity and system responsiveness.
