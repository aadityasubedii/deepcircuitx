Module name: altera_up_video_scaler_multiply_width.
Module specification: The "altera_up_video_scaler_multiply_width" is a Verilog module designed to adjust the width of a video data stream. It deals primarily with complex frame scaling tasks by manipulating the throughput of pixel data streams. This module has several input ports: `clk` (the clock signal that synchronizes operations), `reset` (resets internal states and outputs), `stream_in_data` (carries the input pixel data), `stream_in_startofpacket` (indicates the start of a data packet), `stream_in_endofpacket` (indicates the end of a data packet), `stream_in_valid` (specifies that the incoming data is valid), and `stream_out_ready` (signals that the downstream component can accept data). The output ports include `stream_in_ready` (signals readiness to accept new input data), `stream_out_data` (outputs the processed pixel data), `stream_out_startofpacket` (marks the beginning of an output data packet), `stream_out_endofpacket` (marks the end of an output data packet), and `stream_out_valid` (indicates that the output data is valid). Internally, the module uses `data`, `startofpacket`, `endofpacket`, `valid`, and `enlarge_width_counter` to buffer incoming data, manage packet boundaries, validate data, and control the scaling process by counting cycles to determine the start and end boundaries of output packets. The code is structured into three main always blocks: one that handles output data processing and resets, another that processes input signals and buffers them internally, and a third that manages the width expansion counter according to input validity and readiness conditions. Each block is triggered on the rising edge of the `clk` signal, ensuring tight synchronization across the internal processes and external interfaces.
