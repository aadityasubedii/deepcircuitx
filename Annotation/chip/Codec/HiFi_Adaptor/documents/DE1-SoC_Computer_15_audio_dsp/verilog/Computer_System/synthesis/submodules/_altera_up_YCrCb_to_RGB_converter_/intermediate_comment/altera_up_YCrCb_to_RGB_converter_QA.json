It accepts input signals for Y, Cr, and Cb color components along with control signals indicating the validity and packet boundaries of the stream. These inputs are then processed through multiple stages including subtraction, multiplication (using predefined multipliers for color conversion coefficients), and addition to compute the RGB components. The conversion adheres to adjustments for standard video levels and implements clipping to ensure the outputs stay within the RGB color space. The module outputs the RGB color values and corresponding stream control signals, making it suitable for integration in video processing pipelines where color space conversion is required."
