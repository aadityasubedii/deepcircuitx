It supports configurations such as variable data width, FIFO depth, and optional features like packet handling, error tracking, channel differentiation, and threshold signalling for memory status (almost full, almost empty). Additionally, the FIFO manages read and write pointers, supports control via CSR (Control and Status Register), and can operate with either internal shift registers or block memory depending on specified parameters. This makes the module highly adaptable for various data buffering needs in digital systems."
