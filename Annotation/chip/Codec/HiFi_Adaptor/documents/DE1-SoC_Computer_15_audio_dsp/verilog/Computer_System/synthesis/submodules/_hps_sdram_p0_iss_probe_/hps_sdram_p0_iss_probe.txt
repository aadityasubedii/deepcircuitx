Module-level comment: The `hps_sdram_p0_iss_probe` module is used for monitoring internal SDRAM signals for debugging purposes, employing the `altsource_probe` component. It accepts a signal via `probe_input`, parameterized by `WIDTH`, to connect directly to this component, facilitating signal observation. Implementation involves configuration of key parameters like `probe_width` and control settings, with most optional ports left unconnected to simplify debugging operations.
