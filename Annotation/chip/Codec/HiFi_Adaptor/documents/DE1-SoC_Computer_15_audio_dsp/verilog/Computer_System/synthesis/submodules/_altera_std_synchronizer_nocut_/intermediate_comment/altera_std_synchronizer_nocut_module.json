    "module": "Module-level comment: The altera_std_synchronizer_nocut module synchronizes signals across different clock domains to mitigate metastability in FPGA designs. It features input ports for clock, reset, and data, with an output for the synchronized data. Internally, it utilizes a series of registers (din_s1, dreg) configured by the 'depth' parameter and special attributes to ensure synchronization integrity. Optional metastability simulation is supported through specific compile-time flags, enhancing testing capabilities."
