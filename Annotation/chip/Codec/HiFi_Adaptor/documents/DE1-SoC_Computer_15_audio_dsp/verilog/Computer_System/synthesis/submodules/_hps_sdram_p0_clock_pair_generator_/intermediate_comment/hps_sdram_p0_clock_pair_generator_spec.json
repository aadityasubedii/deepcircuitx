    "spec": "Module name: hps_sdram_p0_clock_pair_generator. Module specification: The \"hps_sdram_p0_clock_pair_generator\" is a Verilog module designed to generate two pseudo-differential output signals from a single input signal for SDRAM applications, enhancing signal integrity in high-speed transmission by utilizing differential signaling. The module has one input port, `datain`, which accepts a single-bit signal, likely a clock or control signal. It provides two output ports, `dataout` and `dataout_b`, which deliver the buffered differential outputs. Within the module, internal signals such as `wire_obuf_ba_o`, `wire_obuf_ba_oe`, `wire_obufa_o`, `wire_obufa_oe`, `wire_pseudo_diffa_o`, and others play critical roles; they connect and control the output buffers and the cyclonev_pseudo_diff_out block, facilitating the generation, buffering, and enablement control of the pseudo-differential signals. Specifically, the module utilizes the cyclonev_pseudo_diff_out block named `pseudo_diffa_0` to produce differential outputs (`wire_pseudo_diffa_o` and `wire_pseudo_diffa_obar`) from the input, which are then buffered by two cyclonev_io_obuf blocks (`obufa_0` and `obuf_ba_0`) to provide high drive strength for the outputs `dataout` and `dataout_b`. Additionally, the control of the outputs\u2019 enable lines is managed by simple logic inversion of other internal signals forming an integral part of module\u2019s continuous output readiness, as indicated by the constant high signal `oe_w`. This module thus encapsulates critical functionality for signal processing in memory modules, ensuring robust data handling and integrity.",

It utilizes a cyclonev_pseudo_diff_out block to create pseudo-differential outputs from the input signal.
