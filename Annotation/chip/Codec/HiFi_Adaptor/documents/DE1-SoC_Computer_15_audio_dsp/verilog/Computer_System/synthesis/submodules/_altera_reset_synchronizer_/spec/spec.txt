Module name: altera_reset_synchronizer. 

Module specification: The altera_reset_synchronizer is a Verilog module designed to synchronize reset signals with a system's clock domain, thereby mitigating metastability risks in digital circuits. It handles both asynchronous and synchronous reset signals based on the configuration set by the ASYNC_RESET parameter. The module inputs include 'reset_in', a reset signal that can be either asynchronous or synchronous, and 'clk', the clock signal that dictates the timing of the synchronization. The module outputs a single port, 'reset_out', which delivers the synchronized reset signal. Internally, the module utilizes a shift register array, 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain', which acts as a buffer to store and shift the reset state, and 'altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out', a single-bit register that outputs the final synchronized reset signal. The code includes two main blocks governed by the ASYNC_RESET parameter: one block handles the asynchronous reset logic by immediately setting the synchronization chain to a high state upon a reset signal, and another block handles the synchronous reset logic by sequentially shifting the reset state through the register chain on each clock edge. Both sections ensure that the output 'reset_out' accurately reflects the state at the last register of the internal chain, synchronized appropriately with the input clock signal.
