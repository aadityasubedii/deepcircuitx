    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_up_av_config_auto_init` module orchestrates the initialization of system settings from ROM. It utilizes clocked sequential logic to read and transfer ROM data, manage the ROM address, and signal initialization status. It incorporates error handling and progression control using internal signals such as `toggle_next_transfer`, adjusting operational parameters based on inputs like `reset` and `transfer_complete`. This modular design ensures synchronized, error-free configuration setup."
