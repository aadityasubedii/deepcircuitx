Module name: altera_up_irda_counters. 

Module specification: The "altera_up_irda_counters" is a Verilog module designed for baud rate generation and bit transmission control in an infrared data communication system. The module utilizes input signals 'clk' (the system clock), 'reset' (to initialize all signals and counters), and 'reset_counters' (exclusively for reinitializing counters) to manage timing and data transmission processes. It features output signals including 'baud_clock_rising_edge' and 'baud_clock_falling_edge' for indicating the precise timing of baud rate clock edges, 'capture_in_bit' for signaling the appropriate capture timing of an input bit, 'transmitting_bit' to show an ongoing bit transmission, and 'all_bits_transmitted' to indicate the completion of bit transmission. Internally, it employs 'baud_counter' to track clock cycles for baud timing, 'bit_counter' for keeping count of transmitted bits, and unused 'ns_counter' and 's_counter' potentially reserved for future expansions or debugging. The functional blocks within the code are responsible for managing these counters and output signals based on the clock and reset conditions, ensuring systematic timing and reliable transmission control in line with configured parameters like baud rates and transmission bit width.
