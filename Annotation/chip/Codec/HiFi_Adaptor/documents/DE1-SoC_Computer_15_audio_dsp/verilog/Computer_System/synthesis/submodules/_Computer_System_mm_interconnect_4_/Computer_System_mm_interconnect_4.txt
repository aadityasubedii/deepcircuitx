Module-level comment: The "Computer_System_mm_interconnect_4" module interfaces video DMA transactions, synchronizing data between DMA master and control slave through input/output management. It employs `altera_merlin_master_translator` and `altera_merlin_slave_translator` for signal translation, ensuring protocol compliance and efficient data flow within a video subsystem, managed by internal signal controls and system clock synchronization.
