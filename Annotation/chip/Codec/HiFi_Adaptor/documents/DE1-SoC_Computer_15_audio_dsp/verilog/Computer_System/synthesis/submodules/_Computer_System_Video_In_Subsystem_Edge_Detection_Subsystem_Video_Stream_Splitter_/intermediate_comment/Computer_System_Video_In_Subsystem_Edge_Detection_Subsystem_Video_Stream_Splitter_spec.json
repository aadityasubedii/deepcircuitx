    "spec": "Module name: Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Edge_Detection_Subsystem_Video_Stream_Splitter.\n\nModule specification: This module is designed to take a single video stream input and distribute it selectively to one of two output streams based on the `stream_select` control signal. The input ports include `clk` for clock synchronization, `reset` for initializing states, and `sync_ready` for synchronization control. The video stream is provided through ports such as `stream_in_data`, `stream_in_startofpacket`, `stream_in_endofpacket`, `stream_in_empty`, and `stream_in_valid`, with readiness signals from the output streams (`stream_out_ready_0` and `stream_out_ready_1`). The module has two sets of output ports corresponding to the two possible output video streams; each set provides data, validity, and packet boundary signals. The internal signals such as `enable_setting_stream_select`, `between_frames`, and `stream_select_reg` facilitate the safe switching of output streams between video packets and provide stability for ongoing transmissions. The primary code blocks manage synchronization signal updates, output data stream selections based on `stream_select_reg`, updates of internal states when `reset` is triggered, and assignments that determine when it is safe to update stream outputs and the `stream_select_reg`. This organization ensures that the video data is routed correctly and securely in a system that requires dynamic switching between different processing paths.",

It handles synchronization with external systems using a sync signal, and maintains the integrity of video packet data (start and end of packet markers, data validity, etc.). The stream selection can be dynamically changed, potentially between frames, but is locked during packet transmission to ensure data consistency. This selective streaming enables the use in subsystems like video processing where different processing paths might be required for different video data."

When it is high, it allows updating `sync_valid`.\n- stream_in_data carries the pixel data from the video stream to be processed or passed on.\n- stream_in_startofpacket marks the start of a video packet which helps in frame or packet boundary definition.\n- stream_in_endofpacket marks the end of a video packet facilitating the handling of video packet boundaries.\n- stream_in_empty communicates whether there are empty unused bits in the video stream data.\n- stream_in_valid shows if the data on the input stream can be trusted for further processing or routing.\n- stream_out_ready_0 and stream_out_ready_1 signals from downstream consumers of the outputs indicate if they can accept new data.\n- stream_select guides the distribution, directing the stream to one of the two output paths based on external requirements or conditions.\n\nOutput ports:\n- sync_data: Data output for synchronization (echoes `stream_select` under certain conditions).\n- sync_valid: Signals if the `sync_data` is valid and should be considered by external systems.\n- stream_in_ready: Indicates if the module is ready to receive more data from the input stream.\n- stream_out_data_0: Data output for the first stream output.\n- stream_out_startofpacket_0: Marks the start of a packet for the first output stream.\n- stream_out_endofpacket_0: Marks the end of a packet for the first output stream.\n- stream_out_empty_0: Indicates if there are empty data slots in the first output stream's data.\n- stream_out_valid_0: Indicates whether the data on the first output stream should be regarded as valid.\n- stream_out_data_1: Data output for the second stream output.\n- stream_out_startofpacket_1: Marks the beginning of a packet for the second output stream.\n- stream_out_endofpacket_1: Marks the end of a packet for the second output stream.\n- stream_out_empty_1: Indicates if there are empty data slots in the second output stream's data.\n- stream_out_valid_1: Indicates whether the data on the second output stream should be regarded as valid.\n\nExplanation:\n- sync_data and sync_valid handle synchronization data integrity and readiness feedback, crucial for coordinating with external systems or other subsystems.\n- stream_in_ready is critical for flow control, ensuring that the module does not receive more data than it can process.\n- Outputs ending with '0' or '1' correspond to the two selectable output video streams. Data outputs carry the video stream data, `startofpacket` and `endofpacket` signals demarcate packets' boundaries, `empty` indicates unused bits, and `valid` flags the reliability or acceptability of the data. They are crucial in maintaining the integrity and organizing the routing and processing of video streams to different parts of a system according to dynamic requirements."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals:\n- enable_setting_stream_select\n- between_frames\n- stream_select_reg\n\nExplanation:\n- **enable_setting_stream_select**: This signal is used to determine when it is safe to update the `stream_select_reg` register. It ensures that the stream selection can only be changed during the safe periods, specifically when a packet ends or in between frames when the input stream isn't starting a new packet. This helps prevent inconsistent data routing mid-packet and manages the transition between stream channels safely.\n\n- **between_frames**: This signal is a flag to indicate the state between video packets. It is set to high (1) when the input video stream is between packets (after an end of one packet and before the start of the next) or after a reset. It is used in conjunction with other conditions to manage the timing for updating the `stream_select_reg`.\n\n- **stream_select_reg**: A registered version of the input `stream_select`. This signal holds the selected output stream path which can be either stream 0 or stream 1. Once set, usually between video packets, this selection remains consistent during the transmission of a video packet, ensuring stable routing of data to the chosen output stream. This keeps data packets intact and prevents potential corruption caused by mid-packet routing changes."

The input ports include `clk` for clock synchronization, `reset` for initializing states, and `sync_ready` for synchronization control. The video stream is provided through ports such as `stream_in_data`, `stream_in_startofpacket`, `stream_in_endofpacket`, `stream_in_empty`, and `stream_in_valid`, with readiness signals from the output streams (`stream_out_ready_0` and `stream_out_ready_1`). The module has two sets of output ports corresponding to the two possible output video streams; each set provides data, validity, and packet boundary signals. The internal signals such as `enable_setting_stream_select`, `between_frames`, and `stream_select_reg` facilitate the safe switching of output streams between video packets and provide stability for ongoing transmissions. The primary code blocks manage synchronization signal updates, output data stream selections based on `stream_select_reg`, updates of internal states when `reset` is triggered, and assignments that determine when it is safe to update stream outputs and the `stream_select_reg`. This organization ensures that the video data is routed correctly and securely in a system that requires dynamic switching between different processing paths."
