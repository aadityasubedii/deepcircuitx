Module-level comment: The "altera_up_irda_counters" module manages timing for infrared data communication by generating baud rate clocks and controlling bit transmission. It uses input signals for clock and reset controls, and internal counters for timing events. Output signals indicate clock edges, bit capture, and transmission status, ensuring precise synchronization in data transfers.
