    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"Computer_System_VGA_Subsystem_VGA_Pixel_RGB_Resampler\" module resamples RGB pixel data for VGA display, expanding color components to 10 bits each. It handles incoming data parameters such as start, end, and validity of packets, aligning output readiness. Internally, it operates on edge-triggered clocks and utilizes conditional checks to reset or resample based on output readiness, employing bitwise operations to adjust the RGB values and integrate a constant alpha. The output is controlled through synchronized registers ensuring accurate streaming."
