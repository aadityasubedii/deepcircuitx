Module name: Computer_System_LEDs. 

Module specification: The Computer_System_LEDs module primarily functions as an interface for controlling a set of LEDs through a 10-bit output register called `data_out`. This module takes in 2-bit `address` and `chipselect` as part of its input ports along with a `clk` (clock), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `write_n` (active-low write enable), and `writedata` (32-bit write data). Its outputs are `out_port`, a 10-bit output reflecting the state of `data_out`, and `readdata`, which outputs the state of `data_out` zero-extended to 32 bits. 

Internally, `data_out` is a register that stores the state of the LEDs or digital outputs and `read_mux_out` is used to route `data_out` to `readdata` when addressed via the `address` signal. The `clk_en` signal, although constantly set to '1', suggests intent for potential clock gating features but remains unused in the logical operations.

Code blocks include a clocked always block that handles the reset functionality and write operations. If `reset_n` is de-asserted, `data_out` is reset to zero. If a write operation is commanded (indicated by an active `chipselect`, inactive `write_n`, and correct address), the lower 10 bits of `writedata` are stored in `data_out`. The module uses continuous assignments for `readdata`, which zero-extends `read_mux_out`, and `out_port`, directly linked to `data_out`, reflecting its value externally. This setup ensures synchronized, stable operations of reading and writing LED states or equivalent digital output controls based on the input commands and system clock.
