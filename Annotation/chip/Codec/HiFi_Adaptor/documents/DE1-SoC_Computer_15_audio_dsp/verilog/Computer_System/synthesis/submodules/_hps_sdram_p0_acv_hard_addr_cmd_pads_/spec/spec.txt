Module name: hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_addr_cmd_pads.

Module specification: The `hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_addr_cmd_pads` module is designed to interface FPGA logic with an SDRAM memory device, specifically handling the address and command signals for optimal performance. It converts internal FPGA clock and command/address signals to the proper physical signals required by the SDRAM using specialized DDR I/O techniques. Input ports include a variety of reset signals (`reset_n`, `reset_n_afi_clk`), clocks (`pll_afi_clk`, `pll_hr_clk`, `pll_avl_phy_clk`, `pll_mem_clk`, `pll_write_clk`), DDR I/O command/address signals (`phy_ddio_address`, `phy_ddio_bank`, etc.), and a DLL delay control input (`dll_delayctrl_in`). Its outputs are primarily the converted physical signals such as `phy_mem_address`, `phy_mem_bank`, `phy_mem_cs_n`, and others that interface directly with the SDRAM. Internally, the module uses `ac_clk` and `addr_cmd_clk` for generating synchronized address and command clock signals, amongst other details managed by the `hps_sdram_p0_acv_ldc` for various loop delays and signal adjustments, and the specialized DDR I/O banks like `hps_sdram_p0_generic_ddio` for handling data output operations. Various parameterization features allow the module to be adapted to different memory and FPGA specifications. The module is split into several blocks corresponding to handling different aspects such as address/command generation (`address_gen`), clock conditioning (`clock_gen`), and DDR output phase adjustments, ensuring robust design suitable for high-performance memory interfacing in FPGA designs.
