Module-level comment: The altera_up_edge_detection_hysteresis module detects edges in an 8-bit data stream, utilizing hysteresis for noise reduction. It operates on synchronized clock cycles, employing two shifting registers for data propagation. Internal logic evaluates data against set thresholds, updating outputs based on detected edges. This systematic process ensures stable edge detection under varying data conditions.
