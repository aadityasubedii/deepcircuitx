Module name: altera_up_avalon_adv_adc. Module specification: The `altera_up_avalon_adv_adc` module serves to interface FPGA with an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter), targeting specific FPGA boards like DE1-SoC and DE0-Nano-SoC. It orchestrates the conversion process through a state machine that manages states including initiation, waiting, transmitting, pausing, and completion of data conversion. Input ports include `go` (trigger for start of conversion), `dout` (serial data from ADC), `clock` (provides timing for operations), and `reset` (resets states and registers). Output ports encompass `done` (indicates end of conversion), `sclk` (serial clock to ADC), `din` (data to ADC), `cs_n` (chip select, active low), and `reading0` to `reading7` (stores digital outputs for each ADC channel). Internal signals such as `currState`, `nextState`, `dout_shift_reg`, `din_shift_reg`, and several counters (`counter`, `pause_counter`, `sclk_counter`) assist in synchronization and state transitions. The module is structured with conditions to handle different boards and revisions, itemized through Verilog conditional generate statements. Specific sections handle initialization, data transmission, pause handling in between states, error counting, and managing the transition through states based on the ADC and the host board specifications.
