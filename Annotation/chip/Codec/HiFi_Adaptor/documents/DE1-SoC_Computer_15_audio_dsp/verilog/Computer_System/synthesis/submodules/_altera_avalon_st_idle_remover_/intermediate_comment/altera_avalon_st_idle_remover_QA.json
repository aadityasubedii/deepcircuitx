It operates synchronously with a clock signal. The module takes serial data input along with control signals indicating data validity and outputs the cleansed data stream, marking data packets as valid unless they contain idle characters. Special handling is implemented for escape characters: when an escape character is detected, the following data byte is transformed by bitwise XOR with 0x20 before output, unless another escape character is detected first, which resets this behavior. The readiness of the module to accept new input or provide output depends directly on the readiness of the subsequent component in the data chain."

It directly controls the in_ready signal (output of this module) making sure the data flow is properly managed.\n\nOutput ports: in_ready, out_valid, out_data.\nExplanation:\n- in_ready: This output indicates whether the module is ready to accept new data. It reflects the out_ready state, ensuring the data transmission is coordinated with the ability of the next component in the line to receive data.\n- out_valid: This signal marks whether the output data (out_data) is valid and should be considered by the next component. It becomes valid only when the input data is valid, not an idle character, and appropriately handled escape sequences.\n- out_data: This is the output data (8-bit) which has been cleansed of idle characters and in which escape characters have triggered a transformation of the subsequent data byte.
