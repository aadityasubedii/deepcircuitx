    "module": "Module-level comment: The Computer_System_Onchip_SRAM module implements dual-port SRAM for read/write operations using an `altsyncram` component. It handles multi-port data transactions with byte-level granularity, clock gating, and write-enable logic controlled through input signals. Configured through parameters like memory depth and content, it ensures address stability and data integrity during operations."
