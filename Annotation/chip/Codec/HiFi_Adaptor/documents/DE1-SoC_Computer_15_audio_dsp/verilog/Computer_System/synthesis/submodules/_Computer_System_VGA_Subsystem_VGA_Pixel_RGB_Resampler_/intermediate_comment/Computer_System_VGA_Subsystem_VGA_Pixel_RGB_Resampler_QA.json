The input pixel data stream received (stream_in_data) undergoes transformation to expand each color component (Red, Green, Blue) from their smaller bit representations to a 10-bit representation per color component. Additionally, this module manages the streaming interface, ensuring packets are correctly initialized and terminated, and the output stream is managed based on readiness and validation signals. The ALPHA value is also set to a constant maximum in the output stream."
