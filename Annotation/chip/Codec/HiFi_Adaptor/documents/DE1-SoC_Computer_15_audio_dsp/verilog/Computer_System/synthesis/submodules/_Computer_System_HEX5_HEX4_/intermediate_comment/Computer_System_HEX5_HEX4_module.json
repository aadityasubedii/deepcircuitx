    "module": "Module-level comment: The Computer_System_HEX5_HEX4 module handles data operations by writing to and reading from a register based on selected inputs. It implements this via a synchronous always block reacting to the positive edge of the clock and the negative reset. Input conditions such as chip select, write enable, and an address check dictate the data write to a 16-bit 'data_out' register. Reading is conditioned by the address input, outputting a zero-extended 32-bit 'readdata' and a direct 'out_port'."
