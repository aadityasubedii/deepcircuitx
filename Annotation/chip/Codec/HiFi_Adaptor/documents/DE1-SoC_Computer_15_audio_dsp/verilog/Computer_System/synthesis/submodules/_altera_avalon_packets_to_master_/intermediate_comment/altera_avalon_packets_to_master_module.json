    "module": "Module-level comment: This module converts packet data to Avalon master transactions. It supports two modes: fast (using separate submodules for packet conversion and buffering) and standard (using a single module). The module processes input packets, handles read/write commands with incrementing/non-incrementing addresses, and generates appropriate Avalon master signals. It uses state machines to manage packet reception, command processing, data buffering, and transaction execution, ensuring efficient conversion between packet-based communication and Avalon master interface."
