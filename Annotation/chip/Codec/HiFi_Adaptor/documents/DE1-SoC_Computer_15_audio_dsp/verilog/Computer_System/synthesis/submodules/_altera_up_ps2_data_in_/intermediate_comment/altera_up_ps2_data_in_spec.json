    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_ps2_data_in.\nModule specification: The 'altera_up_ps2_data_in' module interfaces with a PS/2 device to receive serial data, handling it through a state machine with multiple states: idle, wait for data, data reception, parity handling, and stop bit confirmation. It synchronizes operations via the 'clk' input port and also supports manual resets through the 'reset' port. The module begins either waiting for incoming data ('wait_for_incoming_data') or immediately starts data reception ('start_receiving_data') based on control signals. The PS/2 clock's positive ('ps2_clk_posedge') and negative edges ('ps2_clk_negedge') help detect transitions, and 'ps2_data' reads in the actual data bits. The output is handled through an 8-bit 'received_data' register and an enabling signal 'received_data_en' that flags when the byte assembly is complete and valid. Internally, the module uses 'data_count' to track received bits, 'data_shift_reg' to assemble the data byte, 'ns_ps2_receiver' for determining the next state, and 's_ps2_receiver' indicating the current state. The Verilog code is structured into sections managing state transitions, bit counting, data shifting, and output flag control, ensuring operations adhere strictly to the PS/2 communication protocol and timing requirements. This design encapsulates effective PS/2 data handling with robust state machine architecture, facilitating reliable data reception in digital systems using PS/2 peripherals.",

The transitions between states are triggered by edge detections of the PS/2 clock.

It increments each time a bit is received on the positive edge of the PS/2 clock (ps2_clk_posedge) during the DATA_IN state and resets when not in the DATA_IN state or upon reset.\n- data_shift_reg: An 8-bit shift register that accumulates the bits of data received from the PS/2 data line (ps2_data). Bits are shifted in from the least significant end as new data bits are read on the rising edge of the PS/2 clock during the DATA_IN state. This register holds the forming data byte as bits are received serially.\n- ns_ps2_receiver: This register holds the next state of the PS/2 receiver's state machine. Combinational logic sets this register based on the current state (s_ps2_receiver), PS/2 clock edges, and data line status, determining the next state transition.\n- s_ps2_receiver: The current state register of the PS/2 receiver state machine.

It synchronizes operations via the 'clk' input port and also supports manual resets through the 'reset' port. The module begins either waiting for incoming data ('wait_for_incoming_data') or immediately starts data reception ('start_receiving_data') based on control signals. The PS/2 clock's positive ('ps2_clk_posedge') and negative edges ('ps2_clk_negedge') help detect transitions, and 'ps2_data' reads in the actual data bits. The output is handled through an 8-bit 'received_data' register and an enabling signal 'received_data_en' that flags when the byte assembly is complete and valid. Internally, the module uses 'data_count' to track received bits, 'data_shift_reg' to assemble the data byte, 'ns_ps2_receiver' for determining the next state, and 's_ps2_receiver' indicating the current state. The Verilog code is structured into sections managing state transitions, bit counting, data shifting, and output flag control, ensuring operations adhere strictly to the PS/2 communication protocol and timing requirements. This design encapsulates effective PS/2 data handling with robust state machine architecture, facilitating reliable data reception in digital systems using PS/2 peripherals."
