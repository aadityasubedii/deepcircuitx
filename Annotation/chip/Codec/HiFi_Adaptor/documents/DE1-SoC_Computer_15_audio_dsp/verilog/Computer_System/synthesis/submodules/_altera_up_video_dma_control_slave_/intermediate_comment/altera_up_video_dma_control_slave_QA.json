It supports basic functionalities such as reading and writing video buffer addresses, toggling buffer swaps, and enabling DMA operations. The module uses parameters like screen width, height, color bits, and addressing mode to handle video data effectively. Registers are used to store buffer addresses, control DMA enablement, and manage buffer swapping. DMA operations are tuned by adjusting addressing mode and video quality settings, facilitating data transfer directly between RAM and devices, bypassing CPU to speed up video rendering and manipulation tasks in hardware."

It directs data flow to appropriate internal operations.\n- byteenable: A 4-bit input signal that specifies which byte lanes of the 'writedata' should be considered during a write operation, allowing partial updates of data.\n- read: This signal indicates a read operation when active. It enables data from the module's internal registers to be output on 'readdata'.\n- write: This signal indicates a write operation when active. Data from 'writedata' is written to module\u2019s internal registers based on the 'address' and 'byteenable' inputs.\n- writedata: A 32-bit input port that contains the data to be written into the module's registers when a write operation is performed.\n- swap_addresses_enable: This input controls whether the addresses pointing to current and back video buffers can be swapped.\n\nOutput ports: readdata, current_start_address, dma_enabled.\nExplanation:\n- readdata: A 32-bit output that holds the data from the module's internal registers fetched during a read operation. This data corresponds to buffer addresses, video parameters, or module states based on the input 'address'.\n- current_start_address: This 32-bit output holds the address of the current start of the video buffer. It reflects the address from where DMA operations can begin reading or writing data.\n- dma_enabled: A single-bit output that indicates whether DMA operations are enabled or not, controlling the ability of the module to perform direct memory transfers independently of the CPU."

It can be updated via input commands and swapped with the buffer_start_address to manage double buffering, allowing one buffer to be displayed while the other is being written to.\n- buffer_swap: A single bit signal that controls the swapping between the current and back buffer addresses.
