It accepts pixel data and related control signals (line valid and frame valid), and outputs processed pixel data with corresponding control signals indicating the start and end of a packet, and the validity of the output data. The module operates on the rising edge of a clock signal and integrates reset functionality to set initial states. Additionally, it uses internal registers to manage the state and synchronization of the frame data, aligning output data based on the readiness and validity of the input data stream."
