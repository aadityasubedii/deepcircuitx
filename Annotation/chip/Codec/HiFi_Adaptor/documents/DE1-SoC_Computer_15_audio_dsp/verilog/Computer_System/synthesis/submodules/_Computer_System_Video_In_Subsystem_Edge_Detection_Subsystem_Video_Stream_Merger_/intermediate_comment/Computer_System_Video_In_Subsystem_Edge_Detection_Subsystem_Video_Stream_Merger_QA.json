It switches between two input video streams (stream_in_data_0 and stream_in_data_1), selecting one to pass through to the output (stream_out_data) depending on synchronization input (sync_data) and the internal state managed by the stream_select_reg register. The module manages start and end of packet flags to ensure smooth transitions between video frames and checks the availability of the incoming streams and readiness of the output stream to control the flow of data effectively. When reset, it initializes its output and internal states."
