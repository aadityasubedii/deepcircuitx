Module-level comment: The Computer_System_AV_Config module manages AV settings on a computer system via I2C communication. It handles read/write operations to configuration registers, manages state transitions, and supports auto-initialization from ROM data. The module includes various input and output ports for data handling and control signals, and employs internal registers and state machines to maintain operational states and manage data transfer processes, ensuring synchronization and error handling in I2C communications.
