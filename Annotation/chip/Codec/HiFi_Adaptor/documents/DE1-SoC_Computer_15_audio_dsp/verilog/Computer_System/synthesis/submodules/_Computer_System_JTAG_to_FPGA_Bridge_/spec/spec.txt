Module name: Computer_System_JTAG_to_FPGA_Bridge. Module specification: The Computer_System_JTAG_to_FPGA_Bridge module serves as a bridge interface between a JTAG interface and an FPGA component, facilitating transactions such as reading and writing to the FPGA master interface. It has input ports like `clk_clk` (the clock signal), `clk_reset_reset` (the system reset signal), `master_readdata` (data read from the master), `master_waitrequest` (indicates if the master can accept more data), and `master_readdatavalid` (validity of the data from the master). The output ports include `master_address` (target address for operations on the master), `master_read` and `master_write` (control signals for read and write operations), `master_writedata` (data to be written to the master), `master_byteenable` (indicates active bytes during a data write), and `master_reset_reset` (outputs a reset signal to the master). Internal signals like `jtag_phy_embedded_in_jtag_master_src_valid` and `jtag_phy_embedded_in_jtag_master_src_data` manage data receipt from the JTAG interface, while others like `fifo_out_valid`, `fifo_out_data`, and `fifo_out_ready` control data flow through FIFO buffers. The module encompasses several sub-modules such as `altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface` for interfacing with JTAG, `altera_avalon_sc_fifo` for FIFO handling, `altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets` and its counterpart for packet transition, and `altera_avalon_packets_to_master` for connecting to the FPGA master with transaction capabilities. Each sub-module corresponds to specific tasks like data buffering, packetization and transaction management, structured to maintain data integrity and synchronization throughout the operations within the module. Parameter checks in the generate block ensure correct instantiation by stopping the operation if incorrect parameters are used regarding PLI usage, port numbers, or FIFO depths.
