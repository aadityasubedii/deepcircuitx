Module name: altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface.
Module specification: The altera_avalon_st_jtag_interface module is designed to integrate JTAG communication capabilities with Altera's Avalon streaming architecture, providing key functionalities and debugging features for embedded systems. Among its input ports, this module includes JTAG signals like `jtag_tck`, `jtag_tms`, `jtag_tdi`, and the enable signal `jtag_ena`, among others specifying various JTAG states (`jtag_state_tlr`, `jtag_state_rti`, etc.) and control signals (`reset_n`, `clk` for synchronization, `source_ready`, and data flow control ports `sink_data`, `sink_valid`). Output ports include `jtag_tdo`, handling JTAG Test Data Output, `source_data`, `source_valid`, and `sink_ready` which manage data streams, and signals like `resetrequest`, `debug_reset`, and management signals (`mgmt_valid`, `mgmt_channel`, `mgmt_data`). Internal signals such as `tck`, `tdi`, `tdo`, and virtual state indicators (`virtual_state_cdr`, `virtual_state_sdr`, `virtual_state_udr`) manage the internal state and data processing based on JTAG operations. The code includes conditional generation blocks. If EXPORT_JTAG is enabled, JTAG-related signals are directly assigned. On the other hand, a PLI-based simulation unit, controlled by USE_PLI, is used for more sophisticated simulation interfacing operations, dictating how data is transmitted or received during simulations. This dual operation mode (normal and PLI simulation) allows flexibility in testing and debugging across different system configurations.
