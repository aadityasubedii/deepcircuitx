Module-level comment: The `Computer_System_Nios2_2nd_Core` module acts as an interfacing wrapper for a Nios II CPU core, managing signals for memory access, interrupts, and debugging. It connects input/output ports directly to an internal submodule `Computer_System_Nios2_2nd_Core_cpu`, which handles deeper computational tasks, effectively making this module a straightforward conduit for signal routing and simple interfacing without internal signal processing.
