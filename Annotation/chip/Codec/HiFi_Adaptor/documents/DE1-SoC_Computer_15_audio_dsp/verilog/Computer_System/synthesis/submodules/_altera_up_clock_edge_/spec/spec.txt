Module name: altera_up_clock_edge. 

Module specification: The "altera_up_clock_edge" module is adept at detecting rising and falling edges of a test clock signal (test_clk) relative to a primary clock signal (clk). Its functionality hinges on sampling the test clock's state at each rising edge of the primary clock and determining if there have been transitions since the last sample. The input ports include: 'clk', the primary clock input that drives the sampling mechanism; 'reset', an inactive input meant for resetting internal states; and 'test_clk', which is the clock signal being monitored for edge transitions. The output ports are 'rising_edge' and 'falling_edge', which signal detected rising and falling edges of 'test_clk', respectively. Internally, the module utilizes 'found_edge' to indicate any change in 'test_clk' state by using an XOR operation between 'cur_test_clk' (current state) and 'last_test_clk' (previous state). The 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk' registers store the current and previous states of 'test_clk' sampled at each positive edge of 'clk'. The core of the module consists of two always blocks which update 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk', and a set of assign statements that determine and output the edge detection signals based on the state changes captured by these registers. This module is essential in digital systems for triggering events precisely aligned with changes in clock signals, ensuring correct synchronous operations.
