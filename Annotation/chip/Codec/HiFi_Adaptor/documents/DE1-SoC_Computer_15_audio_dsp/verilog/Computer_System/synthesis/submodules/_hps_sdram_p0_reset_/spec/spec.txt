Module name: hps_sdram_p0_reset. Module specification: The `hps_sdram_p0_reset` module is designed for managing reset synchronization across various clock domains related to an SDRAM system on an FPGA, particularly within an HPS environment. The module inputs include a variety of clock signals such as `pll_afi_clk`, `pll_addr_cmd_clk`, `pll_dqs_ena_clk`, `seq_clk`, `scc_clk`, `pll_avl_clk`, and `read_capture_clk`, along with signals `seq_reset_mem_stable`, `pll_locked`, `global_reset_n`, and `soft_reset_n`. These inputs help indicate the memory system's stability, PLL lock status, and global or software-based resets. The outputs consist of synchronized reset signals like `reset_n_scc_clk`, `reset_n_avl_clk`, `ctl_reset_n`, `ctl_reset_export_n`, and reset signals for different clock domains (`reset_n_afi_clk`, `reset_n_addr_cmd_clk`, `reset_n_resync_clk`, `reset_n_seq_clk`, `reset_n_read_capture_clk`). Internally, the module uses signals `phy_reset_n` combining the PLL lock status with global and software resets, and `phy_reset_mem_stable_n` which further accounts for the memory's stability status. The design incorporates several instances of the submodule `hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync` to align the reset signals with their respective clock domains, parameterized to handle synchronization with different stages and reset outputs mapped to various clock triggers. The generate block specifically handles the dynamic creation of reset instances for each `read_capture_clk` array element, signifying meticulous reset management for read-capture operations in memory interfacing. This module ensures robust, synchronized reset operations across various functionality blocks within the SDRAM, aiding in stability and reliability of memory operations in multi-clock domain SDRAM systems.
