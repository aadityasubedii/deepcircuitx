Module name: altera_avalon_st_idle_remover. 

Module specification: The altera_avalon_st_idle_remover is a Verilog module designed to cleanse a data stream by removing certain idle characters and managing escape characters within a synchronous hardware interface. It operates on a clock signal (clk) and relies on an active-low reset signal (reset_n) to initialize its internal state. The module accepts an 8-bit serial input data (in_data) with a signal (in_valid) indicating the validity of the data. The output readiness of succeeding components is signaled by out_ready, which governs the moduleâ€™s readiness to accept new data via the output in_ready. The module outputs both out_data, representing the transformed or cleansed data, and out_valid, marking this data as valid. Internally, the module utilizes register received_esc and signals escape_char and idle_char to determine if the incoming data byte is a special character requiring particular handling. When the escape character (identified as 0x4D) is detected in input data, the state of received_esc is toggled; this state affects subsequent data transformation through bitwise XOR with 0x20, resetting upon validation of output data. Idle characters (defined as 0x4A) are ignored by setting output data invalid when detected. The module consists mainly of two always blocks; one manages the received_esc register's status based on input conditions, and the other handles the output validity and data transformation conditionally based on internal flags and inputs.
