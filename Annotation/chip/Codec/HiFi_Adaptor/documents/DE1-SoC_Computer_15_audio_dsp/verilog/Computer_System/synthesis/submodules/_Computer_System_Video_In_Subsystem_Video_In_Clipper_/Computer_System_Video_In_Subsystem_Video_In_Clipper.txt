Module-level comment: The Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Video_In_Clipper processes video streams by sequentially applying clipping operations through two stages. The initial stage (`altera_up_video_clipper_drop`) reduces frames by dropping specified pixels and lines, while the subsequent stage (`altera_up_video_clipper_add`) can add elements to frames configured by set parameters. This module manages data flow with internal signals ensuring correct processing and output timing synchronized by input clk and reset signals.
