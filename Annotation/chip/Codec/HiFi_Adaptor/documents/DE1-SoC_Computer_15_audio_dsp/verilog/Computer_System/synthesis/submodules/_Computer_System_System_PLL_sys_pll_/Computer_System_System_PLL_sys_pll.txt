Module-level comment: The 'Computer_System_System_PLL_sys_pll' module utilizes an 'altera_pll' to generate two 100 MHz clocks from a single reference input. It accepts a reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset signal (`rst`), outputting two synchronized clocks (`outclk_0`, `outclk_1`) and a lock status (`locked`). The PLL parameters are pre-configured for direct frequency synthesis without fractional operations, ensuring stable, synchronized outputs essential for reliable system performance.
