    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_video_scaler_shrink.\nModule specification: The 'altera_up_video_scaler_shrink' module serves to scale down a video stream by selectively dropping pixels and lines based on predefined masks. This module operates on a video input stream and produces a scaled-down video output stream while maintaining synchronization with frame boundaries. It uses a clock signal ('clk') for synchronization, an asynchronous reset signal ('reset') for initializing states, and handles video packet indications with 'stream_in_startofpacket' and 'stream_in_endofpacket'. Data validity is manipulated via 'stream_in_valid' and 'stream_out_valid'. The module ensures readiness for incoming data using 'stream_in_ready' and for outgoing data using 'stream_out_ready'. Internally, various counters and shift mechanisms like 'width_counter', 'height_counter', 'drop_pixel', and 'drop_line' manage the pixel and line scaling, implementing the scaling mechanism via dropped frames or lines based on 'WIDTH_DROP_MASK' and 'HEIGHT_DROP_MASK'. Crucial internal signals include 'drop', which dictates whether the current pixel or line is omitted; 'capture_inputs', which signals the capturing of inputs; and 'transfer_data', which indicates data transfer to output. The architecture exhibited also buffers important start-of-packet indicators using 'saved_startofpacket' to manage boundary conditions across dropped frames/lines. The module processes data sequentially in a streaming manner while ensuring that the video frame integrity is upheld through careful synchronization and state management across various stages of the code.\n",

This module operates on a video input stream and produces a scaled-down video output stream while maintaining synchronization with frame boundaries. It uses a clock signal ('clk') for synchronization, an asynchronous reset signal ('reset') for initializing states, and handles video packet indications with 'stream_in_startofpacket' and 'stream_in_endofpacket'. Data validity is manipulated via 'stream_in_valid' and 'stream_out_valid'. The module ensures readiness for incoming data using 'stream_in_ready' and for outgoing data using 'stream_out_ready'. Internally, various counters and shift mechanisms like 'width_counter', 'height_counter', 'drop_pixel', and 'drop_line' manage the pixel and line scaling, implementing the scaling mechanism via dropped frames or lines based on 'WIDTH_DROP_MASK' and 'HEIGHT_DROP_MASK'. Crucial internal signals include 'drop', which dictates whether the current pixel or line is omitted; 'capture_inputs', which signals the capturing of inputs; and 'transfer_data', which indicates data transfer to output. The architecture exhibited also buffers important start-of-packet indicators using 'saved_startofpacket' to manage boundary conditions across dropped frames/lines. The module processes data sequentially in a streaming manner while ensuring that the video frame integrity is upheld through careful synchronization and state management across various stages of the code.\n"
