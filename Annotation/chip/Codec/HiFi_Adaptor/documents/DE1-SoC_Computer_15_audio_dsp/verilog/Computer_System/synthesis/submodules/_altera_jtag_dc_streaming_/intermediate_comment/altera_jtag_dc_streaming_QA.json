It uses specialized submodules (`altera_std_synchronizer`, `altera_jtag_streaming`, and `altera_avalon_st_clock_crosser`) to ensure data integrity and timing correctness when transferring signals between the JTAG domain (related to tck - test clock) and a system clock domain, as well as managing various signals like reset, management commands, and data flow control. The module synchronizes input and output data streams and handles crossing clock domains, making it suitable for applications involving complex interactions between system and test clocks, particularly in testing and debugging scenarios involving hardware."
