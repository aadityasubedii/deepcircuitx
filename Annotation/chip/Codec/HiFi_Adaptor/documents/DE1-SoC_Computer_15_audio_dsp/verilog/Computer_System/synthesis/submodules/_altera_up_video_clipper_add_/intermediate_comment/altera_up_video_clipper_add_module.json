    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_up_video_clipper_add` module processes video data streams by selectively replacing data based on frame boundaries. It synchronizes to a clock and uses signals for internal control flow and decisions, interacting with a counter submodule for dynamic frame manipulation. This module integrates input readiness checks, data validation, and manipulates start/end of packet signals based on pre-configured offset parameters and defined boundaries, providing flexibility in video stream editing."
