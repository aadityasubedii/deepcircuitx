Module-level comment: The 'altera_up_edge_detection_sobel_operator' module performs edge detection via the Sobel operator on 9-bit pixel data, synchronized by a clock signal and an enable input. Using sequential processing inside two shift registers, the module caches adjacent pixel data for convolution calculations, determining horizontal and vertical gradients. Resultant edge strengths and directions are encoded in a 10-bit output. This implementation efficiently handles data flow for real-time edge detection applications in image processing.
