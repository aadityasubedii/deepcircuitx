    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_jtag_sld_node` module manages JTAG interface operations tailored for Altera devices, facilitating debugging and testing processes. It handles JTAG state transitions using input signals like `ir_out` and `tdo`, and outputs commands and state indications via `ir_in`, `tck`, `tdi`, and multiple `virtual_state` signals. Internally, the module toggles necessary states and performs bit-wise data handling, leveraging tasks and conditional compilation to adapt between simulation environments and actual hardware interfacing."
