Module-level comment: The Computer_System_Expansion_JP1 module interfaces external and internal system components, managing bi-directional data flow and interrupts. It utilizes input selection, data direction control, edge detection, and interrupt configuration, driven by clock and reset signals. Key operations occur within clock-driven blocks, handling data read/write, edge detection for interrupts, and bidirectional port configuration. This organization ensures precise data handling and timely interrupt management in real-time systems.
