Module name: altera_jtag_streaming.
Module specification: The "altera_jtag_streaming" module is specifically engineered for handling JTAG data streaming operations within FPGA systems, focusing on data, loopback, debug, management, and control functionalities. It leverages input ports such as `tck` (Test Clock), `tdi` (Test Data In), and `ir_in` (Instruction Register input) for operation specification, along with various status signals like `virtual_state_cdr`, `virtual_state_sdr`, and `virtual_state_udr` to manage states in the JTAG state machine. The module outputs data through ports including `tdo` (Test Data Out) and `source_data` which indicate the processed data stream and its validity. Internally, the module utilizes a range of signals such as `dr_data_in`, `dr_data_out`, and state management flags (`write_state`, `read_state`) to control the data reading and writing processes. Various counters like `bypass_bit_counter` and `write_data_bit_counter` are used to manage data alignment and transitions. Blocks within the code handle synchronization (e.g., `altera_std_synchronizer`), data stream manipulation (e.g., `altera_avalon_st_idle_remover` and `altera_avalon_st_idle_inserter`), and conditional operations based on the JTAG instruction type (`DATA`, `LOOPBACK`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `CONTROL`, `MGMT`) to configure or respond to different operational needs. This architecture provides robust control and diagnostics for embedded system debugging and data management in a JTAG environment.
