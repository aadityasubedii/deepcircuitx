    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_irda_in_deserializer. Module specification: The altera_up_irda_in_deserializer module is designed primarily for deserializing infrared communication data by managing serial data reception, storing it in a shift register, and transferring it to a FIFO buffer. The module has input ports namely 'clk' (clock input for synchronization), 'reset' (resets internal states and registers), 'serial_data_in' (receives serial data bits from the IR channel), and 'receive_data_en' (enables reading from the FIFO). The output ports include 'fifo_read_available' (an 8-bit indication of FIFO's status), 'received_data_valid' (indicates validity of the output data), and 'received_data' (carries the deserialized data, size parameterized by DW). Internal signals such as 'shift_data_reg_en' (enables data shift into the shift register), 'all_bits_received', 'fifo_is_empty', 'fifo_is_full', and 'fifo_used' provide status and control for data handling. The module includes capabilities handling timing parameters and data buffering by interfacing with 'altera_up_irda_counters' for managing counters and 'altera_up_sync_fifo' for FIFO operations. Overall, the module ensures effective data deserialization and reliable data availability for IR communication systems.",

The primary function includes managing the receipt of serial data bits, storing those bits in a shift register, and handling them through a FIFO (First-in, First-out) buffer. The deserializer module captures incoming data bits based on a specified baud rate and other timing parameters, checks for the completion of data reception, and manages data availability and validity flags.
