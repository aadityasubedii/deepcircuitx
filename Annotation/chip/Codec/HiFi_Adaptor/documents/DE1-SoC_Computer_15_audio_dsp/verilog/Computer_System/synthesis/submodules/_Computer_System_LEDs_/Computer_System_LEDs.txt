Module-level comment: The Computer_System_LEDs module interfaces for controlling LEDs using a 10-bit register (`data_out`). It handles write operations when addressed at 0, updating `data_out` from `writedata` and read operations output `data_out` zero-extended via `readdata`. Operation syncs to the system clock with support for an active-low reset. `out_port` directly mirrors `data_out`, providing real-time LED status.
