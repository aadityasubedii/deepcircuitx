The basic functionalities include checking each byte of incoming data and determining whether it's an idle or escape character. It handles conditions where special sequences need to be inserted or data needs to be modified before passing it to the output. This is managed based on the state of the input `in_valid`, the output `out_ready`, and the received escape flag `received_esc`. It also ensures that the output is ready only when the input conditions match set criteria, modifying the data accordingly and setting a flag whenever an escape or idle character is initially received, preventing immediate subsequent special actions on following characters unless conditions are reset."

This data is examined to determine if it includes special control characters.\n- `out_ready`: A control signal from the downstream component indicating that it is ready to accept data. This helps in managing flow control to prevent data loss.\n\nOutput ports: in_ready, out_valid, out_data. \nExplanation: \n- `in_ready`: A control signal that signifies to the upstream component that the module is ready to receive more data. Its value is determined by the current capability to receive and process additional data based on `out_ready` and conditions derived from `in_data`.\n- `out_valid`: Indicates whether the outgoing data `out_data` is valid and ready to be sent to the downstream component. This signal typically goes high when valid data is available for transmission.\n- `out_data`: The 8-bit output data that has been potentially modified by the module to include special characters or handle escape conditions from the input data `in_data`.
