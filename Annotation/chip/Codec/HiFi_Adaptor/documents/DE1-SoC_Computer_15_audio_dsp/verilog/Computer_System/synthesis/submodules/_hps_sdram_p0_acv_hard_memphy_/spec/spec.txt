Module name: hps_sdram_p0_acv_hard_memphy. Module specification: This module serves as a memory physical layer (PHY) interface for an SDRAM controller, specifically designed for use in a Hard Processor System (HPS). It handles low-level communication between the memory controller and SDRAM chips, managing clock synchronization, data transfer, and various memory-related operations. The module has numerous input and output ports, including reset signals, PLL-related inputs, AFI (AMBA Fabric Interface) signals, configuration parameters, and memory interface signals. Key internal signals include DDIO (Double Data Rate I/O) related signals for address, data, and control, as well as various clock and reset signals for different domains. The module is structured with several main components: a reset controller, a clock management block, a DDIO interface, and an I/O pad interface. It incorporates features
