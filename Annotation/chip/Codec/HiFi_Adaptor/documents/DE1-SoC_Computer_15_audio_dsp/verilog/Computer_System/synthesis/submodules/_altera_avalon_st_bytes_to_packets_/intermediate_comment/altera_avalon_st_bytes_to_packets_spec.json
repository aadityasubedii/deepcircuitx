    "spec": "Module name: altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets. Module specification: The altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets module is designed to transform an 8-bit incoming byte-stream data into packetized data which facilitates easier data handling and processing in systems that support packet-based communications. Key input ports include clk (clock input), reset_n (active-low reset), out_ready (indicates downstream readiness to accept data), in_valid (indicates the validity of input data), and in_data (8-bit input data stream). The output ports comprise out_valid (indicates the output data validity), out_data (8-bit packetized output data stream), out_channel (channel information derived from input data), out_startofpacket (flags the beginning of a packet), out_endofpacket (flags the end of a packet), and in_ready (indicates readiness to accept new input data). Internally, the module utilizes various flags such as received_esc (escape character received), received_channel, and received_varchannel (both related to channel character processing), alongside specific characters like escape, start of packet (sop), end of packet (eop), and channel characters identified by specific byte values for managing packet integrity and data segmentation. The main blocks of the Verilog code handle character escaping and channel data extraction, dynamically adapt based on the CHANNEL_WIDTH, incorporate flow control for synchronization between input and output, and generate conditions to set/reset internal flags and outputs. This entire process is managed under the synchronization of the input clock and cleanly reset during initialization or triggered resets, ensuring robust data communication that supports varying protocols and data widths.",

                    "text": "Module name: altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets. Module specification: The altera_avalon_st_bytes_to_packets module is designed to transform an 8-bit incoming byte-stream data into packetized data which facilitates easier data handling and processing in systems that support packet-based communications. Key input ports include clk (clock input), reset_n (active-low reset), out_ready (indicates downstream readiness to accept data), in_valid (indicates the validity of input data), and in_data (8-bit input data stream). The output ports comprise out_valid (indicates the output data validity), out_data (8-bit packetized output data stream), out_channel (channel information derived from input data), out_startofpacket (flags the beginning of a packet), out_endofpacket (flags the end of a packet), and in_ready (indicates readiness to accept new input data). Internally, the module utilizes various flags such as received_esc (escape character received), received_channel, and received_varchannel (both related to channel character processing), alongside specific characters like escape, start of packet (sop), end of packet (eop), and channel characters identified by specific byte values for managing packet integrity and data segmentation. The main blocks of the Verilog code handle character escaping and channel data extraction, dynamically adapt based on the CHANNEL_WIDTH, incorporate flow control for synchronization between input and output, and generate conditions to set/reset internal flags and outputs. This entire process is managed under the synchronization of the input clock and cleanly reset during initialization or triggered resets, ensuring robust data communication that supports varying protocols and data widths."
