    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_clock_edge. \n\nModule specification: The \"altera_up_clock_edge\" module is adept at detecting rising and falling edges of a test clock signal (test_clk) relative to a primary clock signal (clk). Its functionality hinges on sampling the test clock's state at each rising edge of the primary clock and determining if there have been transitions since the last sample. The input ports include: 'clk', the primary clock input that drives the sampling mechanism; 'reset', an inactive input meant for resetting internal states; and 'test_clk', which is the clock signal being monitored for edge transitions. The output ports are 'rising_edge' and 'falling_edge', which signal detected rising and falling edges of 'test_clk', respectively. Internally, the module utilizes 'found_edge' to indicate any change in 'test_clk' state by using an XOR operation between 'cur_test_clk' (current state) and 'last_test_clk' (previous state). The 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk' registers store the current and previous states of 'test_clk' sampled at each positive edge of 'clk'. The core of the module consists of two always blocks which update 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk', and a set of assign statements that determine and output the edge detection signals based on the state changes captured by these registers. This module is essential in digital systems for triggering events precisely aligned with changes in clock signals, ensuring correct synchronous operations.",

It employs sequential logic circuit (flip-flops) triggered by the primary clock (clk) to sample the test clock (test_clk) levels at different times, storing the current and the previous states of the test clock. It then determines rising and falling edges by comparing these consecutive states. The rising edge is flagged when there is a transition from low to high between past and current states, while the falling edge is flagged when the transition is from high to low. These edge detections are crucial in digital circuits for triggering specific actions aligned with clock changes, ensuring synchronous operation."

Specifically, it performs an XOR operation between `cur_test_clk` and `last_test_clk`, which will be high when there's a change, indicating an edge.\n- cur_test_clk: This register temporarily stores the current state of the test clock (`test_clk`) when the primary clock (`clk`) rises. It allows the state of `test_clk` to be used consistently during the evaluation of a single cycle and provides a reference point for edge detection with the previous value stored in `last_test_clk`.\n- last_test_clk: This register stores the state held in `cur_test_clk` at the last positive edge of the primary clock (`clk`). It's used to compare against `cur_test_clk` at the next clock cycle to identify any changes, indicating an edge. This historical comparison is essential for detecting transitions or edges in the test clock signal."
