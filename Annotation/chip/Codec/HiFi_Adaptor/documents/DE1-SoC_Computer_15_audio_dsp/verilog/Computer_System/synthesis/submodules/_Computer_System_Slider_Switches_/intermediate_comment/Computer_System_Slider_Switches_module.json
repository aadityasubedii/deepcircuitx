    "module": "Module-level comment: The Computer_System_Slider_Switches module interfaces with slider switches, selecting and outputting their states based on a 2-bit address. It outputs a 32-bit zero-extended value via readdata, updated every positive clk edge unless reset_n is low. Inside, it uses clk_en to enable clocking constantly, employs a multiplexer to filter data_in based on the address, and manages outputs through conditional logic in synchronization with the clock and reset signals."
