Module name: Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Edge_Detection_Subsystem_Video_Stream_Splitter.

Module specification: This module is designed to take a single video stream input and distribute it selectively to one of two output streams based on the `stream_select` control signal. The input ports include `clk` for clock synchronization, `reset` for initializing states, and `sync_ready` for synchronization control. The video stream is provided through ports such as `stream_in_data`, `stream_in_startofpacket`, `stream_in_endofpacket`, `stream_in_empty`, and `stream_in_valid`, with readiness signals from the output streams (`stream_out_ready_0` and `stream_out_ready_1`). The module has two sets of output ports corresponding to the two possible output video streams; each set provides data, validity, and packet boundary signals. The internal signals such as `enable_setting_stream_select`, `between_frames`, and `stream_select_reg` facilitate the safe switching of output streams between video packets and provide stability for ongoing transmissions. The primary code blocks manage synchronization signal updates, output data stream selections based on `stream_select_reg`, updates of internal states when `reset` is triggered, and assignments that determine when it is safe to update stream outputs and the `stream_select_reg`. This organization ensures that the video data is routed correctly and securely in a system that requires dynamic switching between different processing paths.
