The first stage, controlled by the `altera_up_video_clipper_drop` instance, drops specified numbers of pixels and lines from the beginning and end of the video frames. The second stage, controlled by the `altera_up_video_clipper_add` instance, potentially adds specified numbers of pixels and lines to the video frames. The module uses signals for data handling (including start of packet, end of packet, and validity checks) and is configurable through parameters to adjust width, height, and data specifics of the video frames processed."

After initial modifications by the `altera_up_video_clipper_drop` instance, this data gets further processed by the `altera_up_video_clipper_add` instance.\n- **internal_startofpacket:** Serves as an internal marker indicating the start of a video packet (or frame) after it has been initially processed by the first clipper stage. It is used to handle packet boundaries correctly in subsequent processing stages.\n- **internal_endofpacket:** Similar to internal_startofpacket, this signal marks the end of a video packet (or frame) after initial processing. It helps in maintaining the integrity of video packet boundaries through the processing chain.\n- **internal_empty:** Indicates if there are unused bits within the internal video data stream between the two clipping stages. This signal ensures that data width alignments are maintained correctly throughout the internal processing stages.\n- **internal_valid:** This signal confirms that the internal video stream data (and associated control signals like start and end of packet) are valid and ready for further processing by the second clip stage.\n- **internal_ready:** It shows the readiness of the second clip stage (add stage) to receive data from the first clip stage (drop stage). This signal is crucial for flow control between the two stages, ensuring that data is neither lost nor overflowed.\n  \nThese internal signals are pivotal for the data handling and control between the drop and add video clipping stages within the module, ensuring seamless and accurate video stream processing."
