    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_sync_fifo.\n\nModule specification: The 'altera_up_sync_fifo' is a Verilog module designed for FPGA implementations, specifically targeting the Cyclone II family via a parameterized instantiation of Altera's synchronous FIFO component, `scfifo`. The module serves as a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer, allowing data to be stored and retrieved in a sequential manner, with operations synchronized to an external clock input `clk`. The input ports include `clk` (clock signal), `reset` (resets FIFO content), `write_en` (enables data writing on rising edge of `clk`), `write_data` (data to be written to FIFO), and `read_en` (enables data to be read from FIFO on rising edge of `clk`). Output ports consist of `fifo_is_empty` (indicates FIFO is empty), `fifo_is_full` (indicates FIFO is full), `words_used` (shows number of words stored in the FIFO), and `read_data` (data output from FIFO). For internal operations, the module configures an internal `scfifo` instance with specific parameters to manage data handling, including setting FIFO depth, data width, and other operational settings. The code includes definitions of parameters like `DW` (data width), `DATA_DEPTH` (number of words in FIFO), and `AW` (address width), and sets various properties of the `Sync_FIFO` internal component to align with design requirements (e.g., output register usage, FIFO depth, and data width). These configurations ensure that the FIFO performs efficiently and accurately according to the specified parameters, making 'altera_up_sync_fifo' a reliable and customizable FIFO implementation for digital systems requiring sequential data storage and retrieval.",

It operates with clock signal `clk` and can be reset using `reset` input. Data can be written into the FIFO when `write_en` is triggered and read from the FIFO when `read_en` is activated. The module provides status outputs like `fifo_is_empty` and `fifo_is_full` to indicate if the FIFO is empty or full, respectively, and `words_used` to show the number of words currently stored in the FIFO. The FIFO has configurable depth and data width, set by parameters DATA_DEPTH and DW, and utilizes a sync FIFO component (`scfifo` from the Altera library) to manage the FIFO operations internally."

When activated, it clears all data in the FIFO, essentially reinitializing the FIFO's state.\n- **write_en**: This is the write enable input. When set to high (`1`), it allows data on the `write_data` input to be written into the FIFO at the next clock edge.\n- **write_data**: This data input carries the data to be written into the FIFO when `write_en` is active.

When set to high (`1`), it allows data to be read from the FIFO at the next clock edge.\n\nOutput ports: fifo_is_empty, fifo_is_full, words_used, read_data.\nExplanation:\n- **fifo_is_empty**: This output indicates whether the FIFO is empty.

It becomes high (`1`) when the FIFO has reached its capacity, and no further data can be written until some data is read out.\n- **words_used**: This output provides the current number of words stored in the FIFO. It helps in understanding how full the FIFO is at any given point in time.\n- **read_data**: This output carries the data read from the FIFO when `read_en` is activated.
