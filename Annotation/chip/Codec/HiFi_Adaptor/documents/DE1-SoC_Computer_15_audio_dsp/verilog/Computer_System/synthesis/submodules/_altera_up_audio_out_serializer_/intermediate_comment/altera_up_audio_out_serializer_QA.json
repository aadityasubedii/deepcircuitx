It includes functionality for clock management, data serialization, and FIFO (First-In-First-Out) handling for audio data buffering. Each audio channel has its own FIFO for buffering incoming data. The module also adjusts FIFO write space tracking based on FIFO status and performs shifting operations of audio data bits based on clock edges to serialize the audio output. This preparation is essential for handling audio data efficiently in digital audio systems."
