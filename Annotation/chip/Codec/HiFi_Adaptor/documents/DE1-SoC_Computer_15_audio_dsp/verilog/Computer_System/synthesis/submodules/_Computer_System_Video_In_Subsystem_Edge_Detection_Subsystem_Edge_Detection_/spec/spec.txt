Module name: Computer_System_Video_In_Subsystem_Edge_Detection_Subsystem_Edge_Detection.
Module specification: This module is purposed for edge detection within a video processing system, particularly handling the operations required to detect edges from incoming video pixel data using filter-based techniques. It processes incoming data through four distinct filters—Gaussian smoothing, Sobel operator, nonmaximum suppression, and hysteresis—to refine and highlight significant edges. The input ports include `clk` (clock signal), `reset` (reset signal), `in_data` (pixel data), `in_startofpacket` and `in_endofpacket` (packet boundary markers), `in_empty` (unused bits indicator), `in_valid` (data validity), and `out_ready` (readiness for output data). The outputs consist of `in_ready` (input ready signal), `out_data` (edge-detected data output), `out_startofpacket`, `out_endofpacket` (output packet boundaries), `out_empty` (indicator of unused output bits), and `out_valid` (output data validity). Key internal signals include `transfer_data` (enables data transfer between stages), `filter_1_data_out` through `filter_4_data_out` representing output from each filter stage, and `final_value` conveying processed data to the output. Additional internal registers like `data`, `startofpacket`, `endofpacket`, `empty`, and `valid` manage synchronization of inputs. Furthermore, submodules such as `altera_up_edge_detection_gaussian_smoothing_filter` and others perform dedicated filtering operations. The module efficiently ensures the sequential processing of image data for edge detection, synchronizes input data handling within internal pipelines, and supports proper data flow management to adjacent systems.
