Module name: Computer_System_Slider_Switches.
Module specification: The Computer_System_Slider_Switches module is designed to interface with, and interpret the states of physical slider switches within a computer system. It reads a ten-bit input (`in_port`) that represents the state of these switches and, based on a two-bit address (`address`), selectively outputs part of this input as a 32-bit value (`readdata`) after zero extension. The module operates on the positive edge of a clock input (`clk`) and clears its output when a reset (`reset_n`) signal is low. The input ports include `address`, which determines which portion of the input data is output; `clk`, the clock signal that dictates the timing of data sampling and output updates; `in_port`, which carries the 10-bit state of the slider switches; and `reset_n`, an active-low reset that clears the output when triggered. Internal signals such as `clk_en`, always set high, ensure the clock is always enabled; `data_in`, which directly carries the slider switch states; and `read_mux_out`, where multiplexed data based on the address is temporarily held before being output. The code contains a multiplexing block using a masking operation (`{10 {(address == 0)}} & data_in`) which selects data based on the address and an always block that handles the output logic contingent on the clock and reset signals, updating `readdata` accordingly. The integration of these blocks ensures that the output data reflects current slider switch settings each clock cycle, contingent upon the system not being in reset.
