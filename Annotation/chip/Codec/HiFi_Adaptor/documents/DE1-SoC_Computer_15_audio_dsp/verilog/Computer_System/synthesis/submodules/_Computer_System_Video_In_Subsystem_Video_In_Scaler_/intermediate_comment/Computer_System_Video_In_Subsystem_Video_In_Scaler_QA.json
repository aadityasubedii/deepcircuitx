It performs frame shrinking for video streams using the `altera_up_video_scaler_shrink` component. The module handles data streams that include starting and ending packet indicators, valid data flags, and readiness signals between the input and the output. Parameters like data width, empty width indication, maximum height width, and video dimensions are configurable. The scaler works by receiving video input signals, scaling them down according to specified dimensions and masks, and then sending out the processed video streams."
