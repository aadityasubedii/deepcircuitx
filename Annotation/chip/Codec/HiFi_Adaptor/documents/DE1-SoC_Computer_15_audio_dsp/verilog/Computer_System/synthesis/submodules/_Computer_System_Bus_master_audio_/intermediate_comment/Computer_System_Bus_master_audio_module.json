    "module": "Module-level comment: The Computer_System_Bus_master_audio module serves as a master interface for audio data transfers between module IOs and an Avalon bus. It features input ports for control and data which are directly mapped to corresponding outputs. The module generates an acknowledgment signal, combining bus availability and operation signals. This straightforward pass-through and logical assignment ensure efficient data synchronization and handling per Avalon specifications."
