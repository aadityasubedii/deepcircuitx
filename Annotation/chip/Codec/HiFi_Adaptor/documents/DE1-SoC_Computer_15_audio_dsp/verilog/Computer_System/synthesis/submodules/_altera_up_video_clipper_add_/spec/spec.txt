Module name: altera_up_video_clipper_add.
Module specification: The 'altera_up_video_clipper_add' module is designed to manipulate video data streams by either passing through the original input data or replacing certain segments with predefined data based on the calculated frame boundaries and conditions. It handles video stream inputs and outputs with synchronization to a clock input. Input ports include `clk` (clock signal), `reset` (resets internal states), `stream_in_data` (carries the pixel data), `stream_in_startofpacket`, `stream_in_endofpacket` (indicate the start and end of video packets), `stream_in_empty` (valid unused bits in the last word), `stream_in_valid` (validity of the input data), and `stream_out_ready` (readiness of downstream component to receive data). The output ports consist of `stream_in_ready` (module's readiness to receive more input data), `stream_out_data` (processed output data), `stream_out_startofpacket`, `stream_out_endofpacket` (start and end flags for output video packets), `stream_out_empty` (invalid bits in the last output word), and `stream_out_valid` (validity of the output data). Internally, the module uses signals such as `increment_counters` (trigger for internal counters), `new_startofpacket`, `new_endofpacket` (calculated boundary flags for the output stream), and `pass_inner_frame` (decides if the output should be original data or replaced data based on frame region definitions). The code includes a main process block that defines output data and packet boundary conditions based on the state of the `stream_out_ready` and the `pass_inner_frame` signal, linking to submodules (like `altera_up_video_clipper_counters`) that manage counter operations for frame boundary and validity considerations. The configuration parameters such as `IMAGE_WIDTH`, `IMAGE_HEIGHT`, and offsets are utilized within submodule parameter assignments to define the video processing characteristics.
