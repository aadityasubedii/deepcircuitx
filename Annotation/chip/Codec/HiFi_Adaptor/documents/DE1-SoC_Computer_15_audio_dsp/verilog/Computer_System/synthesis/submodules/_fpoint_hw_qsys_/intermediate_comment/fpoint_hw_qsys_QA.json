It takes two input operands (dataa and datab), a 2-bit operation selector (n), and control signals (clk, clk_en, reset, start). The module includes separate sub-modules for multiplication, addition/subtraction, and division. It uses a counter to control the operation timing and generates a 'done' signal when the operation is complete. The result of the selected operation is output as a 32-bit floating-point number."
