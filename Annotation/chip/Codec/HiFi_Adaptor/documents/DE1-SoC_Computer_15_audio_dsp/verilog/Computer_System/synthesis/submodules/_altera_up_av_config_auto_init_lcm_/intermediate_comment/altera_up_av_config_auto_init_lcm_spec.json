It maps a set of predefined configuration parameters to specific addresses for the LCD's ROM. When provided with an `rom_address`, the module outputs a corresponding 16-bit `rom_data` value, where the first 8 bits may include a parameter-specific command or identifier (with the upper 2 bits of these set to zero) and the lower 8 bits hold the configuration data (such as brightness level, contrast, etc.).
