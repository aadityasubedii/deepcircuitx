The primary function includes managing the receipt of serial data bits, storing those bits in a shift register, and handling them through a FIFO (First-in, First-out) buffer. The deserializer module captures incoming data bits based on a specified baud rate and other timing parameters, checks for the completion of data reception, and manages data availability and validity flags. Furthermore, it integrates with counters and FIFO components which aid in timing, data arrangement, and buffer management to ensure that received data can be processed effectively in a system."
