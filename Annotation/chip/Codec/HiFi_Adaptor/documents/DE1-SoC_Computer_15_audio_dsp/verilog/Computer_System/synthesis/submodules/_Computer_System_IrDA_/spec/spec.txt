Module name: Computer_System_IrDA. Module specification: The Computer_System_IrDA module manages infrared data communication through the IrDA interface by handling serialization and deserialization of data. It processes inputs such as clock (clk) to synchronize operations, reset to reset the module's state, address for targeted register access, chipselect for enabling the module, byteenable for specifying active byte lanes, read and write signals for data operations, writedata for actual data to write, and IRDA_RXD for incoming serialized data. Outputs include an interrupt request (irq) based on buffer conditions, readdata for outputting module status or buffer data, and IRDA_TXD for outgoing serialized data. Internally, the module uses signals like read_fifo_read_en and write_fifo_write_en to control data flow to and from FIFO buffers, read_available and write_space to monitor buffer capacity, read_data_valid and parity_error for data integrity, read_interrupt and write_interrupt triggered under specified conditions, and data_to_uart prepared for serialization. The code integrates blocks such as instantiations for data deserialization (IrDA_In_Deserializer) and serialization (IrDA_Out_Serializer) along with control logic for interrupts, read/write operations, and register management, ensuring robust handling of data transmission and reception via the IrDA protocol.
