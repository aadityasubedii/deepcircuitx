Module name: hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync. 

Module specification: The `hps_sdram_p0_reset_sync` module is designed to synchronize an asynchronous active-low reset signal (`reset_n`) to a specified clock domain governed by the input clock (`clk`). This synchronization is crucial to mitigate metastability issues when the reset signal crosses clock domains. The internal mechanics of the module involve a series of flip-flops defined by the parameter `RESET_SYNC_STAGES`, which dictates the number of stages used to stabilize the reset signal. The input ports include `reset_n` and `clk`, where `reset_n` is the asynchronous reset input and `clk` is the clock input to which the reset signal is being synchronized. The module outputs the synchronized reset signal through the output port `reset_n_sync`, which ensures the reset signal is glitch-free and stable for use in downstream logic. Internally, the module utilizes a register array, `reset_reg`, with each register in the array corresponding to a synchronization stage, capturing and passing the reset signal through each flip-flop stage upon the rising edge of the clock or the falling edge of the reset signal. The Verilog code employs a generate block to dynamically create the synchronization stages based on the `RESET_SYNC_STAGES` and `NUM_RESET_OUTPUT` parameters, using loop iterations for managing the reset conditions and assignments within each stage. This structured approach ensures that the output reset signal meets the timing and stability requirements of the synchronous logic it interacts with.
