    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a top-level computer system design, integrating an ARM A9 HPS, audio subsystem, AV configuration, bus master, and system PLL. It manages interconnections between components, handles clock/reset signals, and provides external interfaces for memory, audio, and various communication protocols. The module uses internal signals for component communication and implements reset controllers for system synchronization. It orchestrates data flow between the HPS, audio subsystem, and external interfaces through an interconnect structure."
