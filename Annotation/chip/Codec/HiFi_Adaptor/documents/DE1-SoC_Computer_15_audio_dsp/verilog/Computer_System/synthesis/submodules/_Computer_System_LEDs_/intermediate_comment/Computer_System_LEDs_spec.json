    "spec": "Module name: Computer_System_LEDs. \n\nModule specification: The Computer_System_LEDs module primarily functions as an interface for controlling a set of LEDs through a 10-bit output register called `data_out`. This module takes in 2-bit `address` and `chipselect` as part of its input ports along with a `clk` (clock), `reset_n` (active-low reset), `write_n` (active-low write enable), and `writedata` (32-bit write data). Its outputs are `out_port`, a 10-bit output reflecting the state of `data_out`, and `readdata`, which outputs the state of `data_out` zero-extended to 32 bits. \n\nInternally, `data_out` is a register that stores the state of the LEDs or digital outputs and `read_mux_out` is used to route `data_out` to `readdata` when addressed via the `address` signal. The `clk_en` signal, although constantly set to '1', suggests intent for potential clock gating features but remains unused in the logical operations.\n\nCode blocks include a clocked always block that handles the reset functionality and write operations. If `reset_n` is de-asserted, `data_out` is reset to zero. If a write operation is commanded (indicated by an active `chipselect`, inactive `write_n`, and correct address), the lower 10 bits of `writedata` are stored in `data_out`. The module uses continuous assignments for `readdata`, which zero-extends `read_mux_out`, and `out_port`, directly linked to `data_out`, reflecting its value externally. This setup ensures synchronized, stable operations of reading and writing LED states or equivalent digital output controls based on the input commands and system clock.",

The interface responds to read and write operations based on an address value and chip select signal. When the module receives a write operation at address 0 (with chip select active), it updates `data_out` with the least significant 10 bits of the incoming `writedata`. For reads, `data_out` is output as `readdata`, zero-extended to 32 bits. The module supports reset functionality which sets `data_out` to zero when the reset signal is active. This setup uses basic synchronization to the system clock for stable data operations. Additionally, `out_port` directly mirrors the value of `data_out`, essentially providing a real-time output of the current LED state or data stored in `data_out`."

In this module, specifically the address '0' is used to target `data_out`.\n- **chipselect**: This input enables the module when active (typically high). It must be asserted along with proper address and control signals to perform read or write operations.\n- **clk**: The clock input. Operations within this module, including data reading and writing, are synchronized to the rising edge of this clock signal.\n- **reset_n**: Active-low reset signal. When this signal is pulled low, it resets `data_out` to 0, effectively turning off all outputs.\n- **write_n**: Active-low write enable signal. A low value on this signal indicates that a write operation should occur, provided `chipselect` is also active and the address is correct.\n- **writedata**: This 32-bit input provides the data to be written to the module. Only the least significant 10 bits are used to set the `data_out` upon a valid write operation.\n\nOutput ports:\n- out_port\n- readdata\n\nExplanation:\n- **out_port**: A 10-bit output that mirrors the content of `data_out` directly. This port typically connects to external devices or displays, for instance, to LEDs which reflect the state described by `data_out`.\n- **readdata**: A 32-bit output that is used to read the state of `data_out`. It outputs the value of `data_out` zero-extended to 32 bits, which allows interfacing with systems expecting a 32-bit data width. This port provides a reading mechanism when addressed correctly."

Typically, such a signal might be used to enable clock gating or similar functions, but here it remains unused in terms of impact on other operations.\n- **data_out**: A 10-bit register that holds the current state of the output data, potentially representing the status of LEDs or similar digital outputs. This register is updated upon a write operation when the module is appropriately addressed and selected, and the write enable is active. Upon reset, `data_out` is cleared to zero.\n- **read_mux_out**: This wire carries the multiplexed output data which is specified by the `address` input. In the current configuration, it outputs `data_out` when `address` is zero, essentially routing the internal data stored in `data_out` to the `readdata` output.
