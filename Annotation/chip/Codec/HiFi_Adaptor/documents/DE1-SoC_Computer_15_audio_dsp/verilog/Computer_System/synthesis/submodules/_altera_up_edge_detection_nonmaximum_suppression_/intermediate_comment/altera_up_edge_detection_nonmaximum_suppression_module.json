    "module": "Module-level comment: The module 'altera_up_edge_detection_nonmaximum_suppression' performs non-maximum suppression on edge detection data, outputting thinner edges. It processes 10-bit pixel data, using shift registers to manage data flow across pixel rows. Internal registers store pixel values and suppressed levels for comparison, with logic blocks to evaluate and decide suppression based on neighborhood intensity. The module employs sequential comparisons and conditional logic within an always block, driven by clock and enable signals, to refine edge representation in images effectively."
