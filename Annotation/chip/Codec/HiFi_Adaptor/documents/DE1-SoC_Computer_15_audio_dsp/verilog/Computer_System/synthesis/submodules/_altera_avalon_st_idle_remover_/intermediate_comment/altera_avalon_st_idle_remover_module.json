    "module": "Module-level comment: The altera_avalon_st_idle_remover module processes an 8-bit serial data stream to exclude idle characters (0x4A) and manage escape sequences (0x4D). It uses a synchronizing clock and an active-low reset. The output is conditioned on input validity and downstream readiness, utilizing internal controls like received_esc for context-specific data transformations (XOR with 0x20). The module ensures proper data flow by managing readiness signals, ensuring seamless interfacing with subsequent components."
