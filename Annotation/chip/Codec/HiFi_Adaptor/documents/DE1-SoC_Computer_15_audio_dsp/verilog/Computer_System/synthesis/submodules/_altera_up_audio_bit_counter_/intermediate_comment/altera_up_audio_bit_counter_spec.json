    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_audio_bit_counter.\n\nModule specification:\nThe `altera_up_audio_bit_counter` module is designed for audio processing applications using Altera devices, specifically for managing a bit counter that tracks audio data transmission timings via bit clock edges. This module has several input ports: `clk` (system clock), `reset` (resets the module), `bit_clk_rising_edge` and `bit_clk_falling_edge` (indicate the bit clock's timing edges), and `left_right_clk_rising_edge` and `left_right_clk_falling_edge` (detect channel changes in audio streams, triggering the counter reset). The sole output port, `counting`, indicates whether the module is in the process of counting (active high).\n\nInternally, the module utilizes `reset_bit_counter`, a wire signal that is set when either `left_right_clk_rising_edge` or `left_right_clk_falling_edge` is detected, prompting a reset or initialization of the `bit_counter`. The `bit_counter` itself is a 5-bit register initialized to `BIT_COUNTER_INIT` and decremented on each falling edge of `bit_clk_falling_edge` unless it is zero. The module encompasses two primary always blocks: the first maintains and updates `bit_counter` based on reset conditions and bit clock edges, while the second controls the `counting` output based on the state of `reset`, `reset_bit_counter`, and the value of `bit_counter`. Finally, the reset condition for the bit counter is managed by an assignment to `reset_bit_counter` based on edge detection of left or right audio channel changes. This structured approach ensures precise and efficient management of bit counting essential for audio data processing in hardware applications.",
