It takes a color index as input and outputs corresponding 10-bit red, green, and blue color values based on predefined values stored in ROM. The module operates based on a clock input (`clk`) and a clock enable signal (`clk_en`). The actual color data is stored in a memory initialized from a file called \"altera_up_video_fb_color_rom.mif\", and it outputs the color values split across three outputs (red, green, blue) extracted from the 30-bit data fetched from the ROM mapping the input color index."

It is used to synchronize the operation of the memory (ROM) and the entire module.\n- clk_en: This is the clock enable signal. It is used to enable or disable the clock for power management or to control the operation timing within the module.\n- color_index: This is a 4-bit input representing the index in the color lookup table. Based on this index, specific color data is fetched from ROM.\n\nOutput ports: red, green, blue.\nExplanation:\n- red: This is a 10-bit output representing the red component of the color. It maps to bits 29 down to 20 of the color data fetched from the ROM.\n- green: This is a 10-bit output representing the green component of the color. It maps to bits 19 down to 10 of the color data fetched from the ROM.\n- blue: This is a 10-bit output representing the blue component of the color. It maps to bits 9 down to 0 of the color data fetched from the ROM. These outputs provide the RGB values of the color specified by the color index input."

The color data stored is divided into three parts, each corresponding to different color components: the most significant 10 bits for the red component, the middle 10 bits for the green component, and the least significant 10 bits for the blue component.
