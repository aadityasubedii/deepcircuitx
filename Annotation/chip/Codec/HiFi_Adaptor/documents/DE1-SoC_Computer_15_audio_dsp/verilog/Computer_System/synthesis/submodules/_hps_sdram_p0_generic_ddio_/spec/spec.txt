Module name: hps_sdram_p0_generic_ddio. 
Module specification: The hps_sdram_p0_generic_ddio is a Verilog module designed for double data rate (DDR) output on Altera's Cyclone V DDIO blocks, catering specifically to SDRAM interfaces. The module takes a `datain` input bus, of width determined by the `WIDTH` parameter multiplied by 4, and outputs `dataout` with a width equal to `WIDTH`. It features input signals `halfratebypass`, `clk_hr` (half-rate clock), and `clk_fr` (full-rate clock). The `halfratebypass` allows bypassing half-rate processing, while `clk_hr` and `clk_fr` manage the data timing during DDR operations. Inside, two internal signals, `fr_data_hi` and `fr_data_lo`, are crucial for holding high and low phase data outputs respectively, processed independently. The module utilizes three instantiation blocks per `WIDTH` channel: two `cyclonev_ddio_out` instances for processing data for high and low phases (`hr_to_fr_hi` and `hr_to_fr_lo`) at half-rate, and one `cyclonev_ddio_out` for combining these phases to output at full-rate (`ddio_out`). This arrangement ensures efficient and speedy DDR data transmission, suitable for high-performance memory interfaces.
