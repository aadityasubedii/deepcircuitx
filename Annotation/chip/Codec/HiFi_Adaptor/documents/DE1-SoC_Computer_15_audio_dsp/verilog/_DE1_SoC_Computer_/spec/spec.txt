Module name: DE1_SoC_Computer. Module specification: This module implements a top-level design for a DE1-SoC FPGA board, focusing on audio processing and generation. It interfaces with various external components including clocks, ADC, audio codec, DRAM, I2C, GPIO, 7-segment displays, keys, switches, video interfaces, and HPS (Hard Processor System) components. The module features numerous input and output ports for these interfaces, including clock inputs, audio I/O, memory interfaces, and various peripherals. Internally, it utilizes signals such as bus_addr, bus_read, bus_write, and state for managing data transfer and control flow. The module implements a state machine for audio data handling, a Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) system for sine wave generation, and interfaces with the HPS for extended functionality. It includes a lookup table for sine wave values and manages
