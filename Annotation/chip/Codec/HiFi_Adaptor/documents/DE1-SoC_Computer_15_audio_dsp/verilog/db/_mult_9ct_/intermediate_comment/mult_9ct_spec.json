    "spec": "Module name: mult_9ct. Module specification: The 'mult_9ct' module is designed for multiplying two 24-bit input numbers, specifically 'dataa' and 'datab', and outputs a 48-bit result. The module operates synchronously with a system clock and includes features for asynchronous reset (aclr) and clock enable (clken). Input ports include 'aclr' (asynchronous clear), 'clken' (clock enable signal), 'clock' (system clock), as well as the two 24-bit data inputs, 'dataa' and 'datab'. The sole output port is 'result', a 48-bit register holding the product of 'dataa' and 'datab'. Internal registers like 'dataa_input_reg' and 'datab_input_reg' stabilize the input values across clock cycles. Intermediate and final results of the multiplication undergo staging through several internal registers ('result_extra0_reg', 'result_extra1_reg', and 'result_extra2_reg') before being held in 'result_output_reg'. The multiplication is processed through wire connections 'dataa_wire' and 'datab_wire' which feed a multiplication operation, the outcome of which is placed in 'result_wire'. Various sections of the module handle initialization of registers, conditional updating based on 'aclr' and 'clken', and the final assignment of the computed product to the output. This modular structure ensures that the multiplication adheres to timing requirements and signal stability mandated by hardware specifications.",
