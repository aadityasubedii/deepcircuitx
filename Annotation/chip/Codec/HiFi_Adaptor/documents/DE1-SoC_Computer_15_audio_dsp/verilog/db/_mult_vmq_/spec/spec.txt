Module name: mult_vmq. Module specification: The `mult_vmq` module is a Verilog-based hardware design responsible for performing signed multiplication of two 18-bit input signals, `dataa` and `datab`, and producing a 36-bit output result. Both input ports, `dataa` and `datab`, are signed and handle either positive or negative values, impacting the signed multiplication result. The output port `result` presents the multiplication outcome and is 36 bits wide to accommodate the range of values resulting from the operation. Internally, the module utilizes three significant signals: `dataa_wire`, `datab_wire`, and `result_wire`, all declared as signed. `dataa_wire` and `datab_wire` are directly assigned from the input ports and act as transient staging points preserving the sign of the inputs. The `result_wire` captures the product of these two wires, maintaining the result's sign, and ultimately drives the output through a direct assignment. The module is structured fundamentally into four main blocks: port declarations, internal signal declarations, data assignments to internal wires, and the computation assignment translating the multiplication into the output value. This structure ensures clarity in operations, handling of data types, and flow throughout the module, leading to efficient and effective functionality.
