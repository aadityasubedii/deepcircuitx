    "spec": "Module name: mult_i5n. \nModule specification: The 'mult_i5n' module is designed to multiply two 9-bit input values, 'dataa' and 'datab', and produce an 18-bit output 'result'. The inputs, 'dataa' and 'datab', are received through input ports, each being 9-bit wide. These ports are connected to internal wires 'dataa_wire' and 'datab_wire', which serve to transfer the input values within the module securely, maintaining the integrity of original inputs. The primary computation is performed by multiplying 'dataa_wire' and 'datab_wire', and the multiplication result is stored in a separate 18-bit wire 'result_wire'. This result is then assigned to the output port 'result', which emits the final multiplication product. The code for the module includes blocks for port declarations and assignments. The port declarations define the interfaces for module communication, while the assignments in the code are used to connect inputs to internal signals and handle the computation and routing of the output. This clear separation of input handling, computation, and output delivery enhances the modularity and clarity of the design, facilitating easier future enhancements or modifications.",

It takes two inputs, `dataa` and `datab`, each consisting of 9 bits. The outputs of these inputs are assigned to internal wires `dataa_wire` and `datab_wire`, respectively. The core functionality involves multiplying these two wires and producing an 18-bit result (`result_wire`). This result is then directly forwarded to the module's output `result`.
