    "module": "Module-level comment: The `mult_vmq` module carries out signed multiplication of two 18-bit inputs, `dataa` and `datab`, generating a 36-bit signed output `result`. Internally, the module uses signed wires `dataa_wire` and `datab_wire` to transfer input values, and `result_wire` for storing the multiplication product, which is then passed to the output. This setup ensures accurate sign handling and result delivery through straightforward wiring and arithmetic operations."
