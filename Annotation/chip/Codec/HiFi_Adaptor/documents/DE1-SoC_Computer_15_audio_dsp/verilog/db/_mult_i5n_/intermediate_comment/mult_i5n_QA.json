It takes two inputs, `dataa` and `datab`, each consisting of 9 bits. The outputs of these inputs are assigned to internal wires `dataa_wire` and `datab_wire`, respectively. The core functionality involves multiplying these two wires and producing an 18-bit result (`result_wire`). This result is then directly forwarded to the module's output `result`. This module essentially behaves as a simple multiplier for two small-sized binary numbers."

'dataa' serves as one multiplicand while 'datab' serves as the other multiplicand in the multiplication operation.\n\nOutput ports: [result]. Explanation: The output port 'result' is an 18-bit wide signal. This port outputs the result of the multiplication of the two input values 'dataa' and 'datab'. The 'result' is the product of these two inputs and hence, holds a value which can be up to 18 bits wide to accommodate the largest possible product from multiplying two 9-bit numbers."
