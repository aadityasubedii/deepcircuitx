    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_mult_add_20u2` module handles arithmetic operations (multiplication and addition) on two 16-bit inputs on an FPGA. It utilizes an `altera_mult_add_rtl` instance, parameterized to customize behavior such as saturation and rounding, driven by `aclr0`, `clock0`, and `ena0` signals. The result is a 32-bit output, conveyed through an internal signal linking the computation to the output port. This setup targets optimized digital signal processing within Altera FPGA environments."
