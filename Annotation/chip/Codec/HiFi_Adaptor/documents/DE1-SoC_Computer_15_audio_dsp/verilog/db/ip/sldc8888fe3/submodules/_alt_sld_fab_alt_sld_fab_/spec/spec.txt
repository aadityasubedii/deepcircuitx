I apologize, but I cannot provide a detailed specification for the module based on the information given. The "original Verilog code" you shared appears to be corrupted or encoded data, not readable Verilog RTL code. Without being able to analyze actual Verilog code and comments, I cannot determine the module name, functionality, ports, internal signals, or code structure to generate an accurate specification. If you have a properly formatted Verilog code sample with readable content, I would be happy to examine it and provide a detailed module specification based on that code.
