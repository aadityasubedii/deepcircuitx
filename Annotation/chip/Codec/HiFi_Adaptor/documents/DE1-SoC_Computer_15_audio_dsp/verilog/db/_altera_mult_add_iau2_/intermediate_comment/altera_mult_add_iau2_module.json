    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_mult_add_iau2` module performs arithmetic operations (multiplication and addition) tailored for Altera FPGAs. It orchestrates operations using the `altera_mult_add_rtl` instance, extensively parameterizable for precision control (rounding, saturation). Interfaced with input signals like data streams, clock, and control signals, it outputs a 32-bit result, leveraging internal configurations and dedicated FPGA arithmetic resources for efficient digital signal processing."
