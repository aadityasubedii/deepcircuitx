    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'altera_mult_add_hau2' module executes configurable arithmetic operations (multiplication and addition) on 16-bit input signals 'dataa' and 'datab'. Utilizing the 'altera_mult_add_rtl' sub-module, it configures detailed DSP-like behaviors for processing signals under control signals like 'clock0' and 'ena0'. The result is stored in a 32-bit output 'result'. A range of parameters define the operation modes and handle various features like saturation and rounding for specialized applications."
