The SpaceWireCODECIP_Terasic_DE0 repository houses an extensive FPGA design tailored primarily for space communication applications, leveraging its complex integration of CPUs, memory modules, and peripheral interfaces with a focus on SpaceWire communication protocols. At its core, the repository features a DE0_PLL module generating synchronized clocks for various components using an `altpll` component. The central CPU system incorporates a slew of submodules dealing with data handling, system synchronization, and JTAG debugging aligned with specialized needs of SpaceWire interfaces. Submodules such as CPU_spw_data_i, CPU_spw_config, CPU_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk, and CPU_jtag_uart, among others, manage data input/output, system configurations, and debugging processes to maintain robust data integrity and fluid interfacing. Additionally, informative management solutions, such as CPU_mm_interconnect_0 and altera_reset_synchronizer, are implemented to address memory mapping and signal reset synchronizations, respectively. This repository successfully integrates a comprehensive, highly configurable system suited for specialized computational tasks and rigorous testing scenarios in space communication environments, characterized by high reliability and targeted data transactional operations across its CPU and peripheral configurations.
