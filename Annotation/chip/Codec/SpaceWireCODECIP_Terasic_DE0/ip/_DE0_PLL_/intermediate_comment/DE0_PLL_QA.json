This PLL setup is typically used for achieving precise clock timing adjustments necessary in FPGA designs for synchronization and performance optimization. The `altpll` component is configured with various parameters, such as frequency division, multiplication and intended device family specifications, to generate four output clocks (`c0`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`) which can be used throughout an FPGA system for different subsystems requiring varying clock speeds and characteristics."

It's often used where the precise timing is critical.\n- `c1`, `c2`, `c3`: Similarly, these outputs are adjusted and used in different sections of the entire system where varied clock properties are required.
