Module name: DE0_PLL. Module specification: The DE0_PLL module leverages the `altpll` component from Altera to generate multiple clock outputs with variable frequencies and phases from a singular input clock signal, `inclk0`. This module mainly serves in FPGA systems requiring precise clock adjustments for synchronization and performance optimization. It has one input port, `inclk0`, which is the primary clock input, and four output ports, `c0`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, each delivering a distinct clock signal with specific configurations related to frequency, phase, and duty cycle. Internally, the module uses several signals: `sub_wire0` to `sub_wire7`, with `sub_wire0` being a 5-bit bus handling distribution of the PLL's output to `c0`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and others aiding in configurations and operations like `sub_wire5` directly connected to `inclk0`. The `altpll_component` is instantiated with specific parameters such as frequency and phase settings for each output and detailed lock and reset behaviors. This component handles the intricate signal generation and synchronization tasks fundamental for configuring the outputs accurately as per the system's requirements.
