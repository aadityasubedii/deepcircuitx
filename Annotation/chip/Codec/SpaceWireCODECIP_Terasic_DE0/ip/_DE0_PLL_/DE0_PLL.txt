Module-level comment: The DE0_PLL module utilizes the `altpll` component to generate multiple synchronized clock outputs from a single input clock (`inclk0`). It features one input and four output ports (`c0`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`), each configured for specific frequency and phase characteristics using internal signals (`sub_wire0` to `sub_wire7`). The `altpll_component` configuration and instantiation govern the precise clock generation, catering to varying system needs for clock management in FPGA designs.
