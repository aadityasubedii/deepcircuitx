Module name: CPU. Module specification: The CPU module is a top-level design for a CPU system with various peripherals and interfaces. It implements a system-on-chip design, likely for specialized applications involving space communication. The module includes a CPU core, memory (SDRAM and on-chip), JTAG UART, and several SpaceWire (SPW) related interfaces. It has input ports for clock (clk_clk), reset (reset_reset_n), and various SpaceWire-related signals, while output ports control SDRAM operations, manage SpaceWire communication, and drive display and LED outputs. The module also features a bidirectional SDRAM data bus (sdram_dq). Internally, it uses numerous signals for data and instruction management, debugging, interrupt handling, and reset control. The design is organized into several sub-modules and components, including a CPU core, memory controllers, Sp
