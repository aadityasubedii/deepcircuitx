    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a CPU system with integrated peripherals and SpaceWire interfaces. It incorporates a CPU core, SDRAM and on-chip memory, JTAG UART, and various SpaceWire-related components. The module uses an interconnect fabric (mm_interconnect_0) to link these components, manages reset and interrupt signals, and provides interfaces for external memory, SpaceWire communication, and visual feedback through displays and LEDs. The design is optimized for specialized applications, particularly those involving space communication."
