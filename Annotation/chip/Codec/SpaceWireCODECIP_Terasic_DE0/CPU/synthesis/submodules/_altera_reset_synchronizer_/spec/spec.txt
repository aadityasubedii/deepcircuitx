Module name: altera_reset_synchronizer.
Module specification:
The altera_reset_synchronizer is a Verilog module designed to synchronize an asynchronous reset signal to a clock signal, primarily intended to eliminate metastability issues in digital circuits. It inputs an asynchronous reset signal (`reset_in`) and a clock signal (`clk`), and outputs a synchronized reset signal (`reset_out`). `reset_in` initiates the reset process and can operate synchronously or asynchronously depending on the parameter settings, while `clk` dictates the timing of the module's operations. The module employs two internal signals: `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain`, a shift register storing the reset states and facilitating the synchronization process, and `altera_reset_synchronizer_int_chain_out`, which captures the final synchronized reset output from the shift register to drive the `reset_out`. The Verilog code encompasses a `generate` block which differentiates behavior based on the `ASYNC_RESET` parameter. If `ASYNC_RESET` is set, any assertion of `reset_in` sets the entire register to a high state, reflecting an immediate assertion of the reset throughout the system. Conversely, if asynchronous reset is disabled, `reset_in` is fed into the most significant bit of the shift register and propagated downwards on each clock edge, eventually stabilizing at `reset_out`. This configuration ensures the module caters to varying needs for reset synchronization, effectively smoothing and stabilizing the reset signal through parametrizable depth control, described by the `DEPTH` parameter.
