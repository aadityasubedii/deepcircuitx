It features a parameterizable depth for the synchronization chain, which can be adjusted according to the specific requirements of the reset timing. The module uses a shift register mechanism where the reset signal is sampled and shifted each clock cycle. If synchronous reset is enabled (ASYNC_RESET=1), any assertion of the input `reset_in` immediately sets the entire register chain to high, propagating a reset through the system. If the asynchronous reset is not used, the input `reset_in` gets loaded in the most significant bit of the register each clock cycle and shifted down, smoothing the propagation through the reset chain. The final output `reset_out` is then taken from the last element of this shift register, ensuring a stable and synchronized reset output."
