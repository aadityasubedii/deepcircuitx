Module name: CPU_cpu_oci_test_bench. 
Module specification: The `CPU_cpu_oci_test_bench` is a Verilog module designed for testing certain functionalities related to a CPU or CPU component, primarily focusing on managing and monitoring testing activities. It consists of four input ports: `dct_buffer`, a 30-bit data buffer likely used for input data relevant to testing; `dct_count`, a 4-bit counter that could track events or steps during the test; `test_ending`, a signal indicating the nearing completion of the test phase; and `test_has_ended`, a signal that confirms the completion of the test. There are no output ports or explicitly defined internal signals in this module, suggesting its primary role is to use external signals to monitor or influence internal testing processes without manifesting any results externally. The module lacks defined blocks or sections for further internal operations, implying that the test procedures handled or monitored by this module involve only basic input handling and no intermediate processing or output generation.
