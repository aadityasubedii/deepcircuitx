    "module": "Module-level comment: The `CPU_cpu_oci_test_bench` module is utilized for monitoring CPU-related test procedures, with no outputs or internal computations. It inputs a 30-bit `dct_buffer` for data reception, a 4-bit `dct_count` to track test progress or events, and two boolean signals, `test_ending` and `test_has_ended`, to manage test phases. This module purely acts on external input signals for monitoring purposes, facilitating the tracking of test statuses without further data manipulation or output activities."
