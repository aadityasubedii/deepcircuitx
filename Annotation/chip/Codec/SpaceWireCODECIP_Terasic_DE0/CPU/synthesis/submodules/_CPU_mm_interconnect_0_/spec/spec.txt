Module name: CPU_mm_interconnect_0. Module specification: This module implements a complex memory-mapped interconnect system for a CPU, facilitating communication between multiple master and slave components. It handles data routing, address decoding, and arbitration for various system components. The module has numerous input and output ports for clock, reset, CPU data and instruction master interfaces, and connections to various peripherals like SDRAM, LEDs, displays, and SpaceWire interfaces. These ports manage data transfer, addressing, and control signals. Internally, the module uses a wide array of signals for handling universal master and slave interfaces, request-response channels, and data width adaptation. The module is composed of several sub-components including address routers, data width adapters, command and response crossbar switches, burst adapters, and various demultiplexers and multiplexers. These components work together to manage data flow, perform address translations, handle different bus wi
