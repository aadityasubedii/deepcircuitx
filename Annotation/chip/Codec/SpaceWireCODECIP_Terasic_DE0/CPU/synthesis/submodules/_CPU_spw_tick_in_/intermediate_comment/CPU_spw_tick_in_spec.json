    "spec": "Module name: CPU_spw_tick_in.  \nModule specification: The CPU_spw_tick_in module is designed for simple yet specific data control within a CPU or microcontroller system, supporting functionality to write data to an internal register and read it out based on select input signals. The module processes inputs such as a 2-bit `address` to select specific registers, a 1-bit `chipselect` for enabling module operation, a clock signal `clk` for synchronization, an active-low `reset_n` for initializing states, an active-low `write_n` as a write enable signal, and a 32-bit `writedata` for input data. The outputs consist of a 1-bit `out_port`, mirroring the state of the internal 1-bit register `data_out`, and a 32-bit `readdata` that outputs the state of `data_out` based on the input address via multiplexing logic. Internal signals include `clk_en` which is statically set high implying constant enablement, `data_out` that serves as the primary storage element updated under specific conditions (chip selected, write enabled, and correct address), and `read_mux_out` used to gate `data_out` based on address value through a simple multiplexer logic ensuring that data is appropriately routed. The code is structured into blocks handling reset conditions and data writing in a synchronous always block triggered by the clock or reset, alongside continuous assignments for output multiplexing and output state mirroring. The module encapsulates the logic necessary for managed data writing/reading within select addressed and controlled environments ideal for peripheral or special function register management in computational systems.",

At its core, it includes functionality to write data to an internal register (`data_out`) when certain conditions are met: the module is selected via `chipselect`, it's not in a write-protected state (`write_n` is low), and the targeted address is zero. The data written to `data_out` originates from the `writedata` input. The `readdata` and `out_port` outputs provide means to externally access the state of `data_out`, either directly through `out_port` or as part of the register map via `readdata` where the output is conditionally determined by the input `address`. The module also resets the internal register `data_out` when a negative reset signal is received, ensuring a known state upon initialization. The overall functionality suggests its use in a system where simple, controlled data interactions with specific peripheral or register addresses are necessary, potentially in a larger CPU or microcontroller system for handling special function registers or simple I/O operations."

It ensures the module acts only when it is specifically selected, preventing unintentional writes or reads.\n- `clk` (1-bit): The clock input, used to synchronize the operations of the module, specifically data writing in the synchronous logic block.\n- `reset_n` (1-bit): Active-low reset signal used to reset the module\u2019s internal states and outputs to known values, typically during startup or fault conditions.\n- `write_n` (1-bit): Active-low write enable signal, allowing data to be written to the module when low and the chip is selected with the correct address.\n- `writedata` (32-bit): Data input that will be written into the module's internal register or storage when the appropriate conditions (chip selected, write enabled, correct address) are met.\n\nOutput ports: out_port, readdata.\nExplanation: \n- `out_port` (1-bit): This is a direct output that mirrors the state of the internal `data_out` register.
