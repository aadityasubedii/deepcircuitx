    "module": "Module-level comment: The CPU_spw_tick_in module handles specific data interactions within a CPU system, leveraging input controls for targeted data writing and reading. It utilizes an internal register `data_out` for storing and outputting data, controlled by `chipselect`, `write_n`, and `address`. It resets `data_out` on `reset_n` and outputs data based on address inputs through a mux (multiplexer) logic. The module operates synchronously with `clk`, ensuring precise timing and operation sequence."
