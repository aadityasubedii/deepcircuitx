Module name: CPU_spw_tick_in.  
Module specification: The CPU_spw_tick_in module is designed for simple yet specific data control within a CPU or microcontroller system, supporting functionality to write data to an internal register and read it out based on select input signals. The module processes inputs such as a 2-bit `address` to select specific registers, a 1-bit `chipselect` for enabling module operation, a clock signal `clk` for synchronization, an active-low `reset_n` for initializing states, an active-low `write_n` as a write enable signal, and a 32-bit `writedata` for input data. The outputs consist of a 1-bit `out_port`, mirroring the state of the internal 1-bit register `data_out`, and a 32-bit `readdata` that outputs the state of `data_out` based on the input address via multiplexing logic. Internal signals include `clk_en` which is statically set high implying constant enablement, `data_out` that serves as the primary storage element updated under specific conditions (chip selected, write enabled, and correct address), and `read_mux_out` used to gate `data_out` based on address value through a simple multiplexer logic ensuring that data is appropriately routed. The code is structured into blocks handling reset conditions and data writing in a synchronous always block triggered by the clock or reset, alongside continuous assignments for output multiplexing and output state mirroring. The module encapsulates the logic necessary for managed data writing/reading within select addressed and controlled environments ideal for peripheral or special function register management in computational systems.
