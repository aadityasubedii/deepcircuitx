Module-level comment: The CPU_cpu_jtag_debug_module_tck is a JTAG interface for CPU debugging, managing data and control signal inputs and outputs for internal and external testing. It uses synchronous blocks for signal stability, shift operations dictated by JTAG commands for debugging data transfer, and parameterizable synchronization to align with the JTAG clock, ensuring effective CPU state manipulation and monitoring compliance with JTAG standards.
