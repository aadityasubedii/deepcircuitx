    "spec": "Module name: CPU_spw_tx_div. Module specification: The CPU_spw_tx_div module is designed to serve as a data register interface within a CPU environment, specifically focussing on data transmission. The module manages a 7-bit data value based on input signals including an address and control signals like chipselect, write enable, and reset. It features an array of input ports including a 2-bit address to select the internal operations, a chipselect signal to enable data transactions, a clock signal (`clk`) to time these operations, a negative-edge triggered reset (`reset_n`), an active-low write enable (`write_n`), and a 32-bit data bus (`writedata`). The outputs include a 7-bit `out_port` which mirrors the internal `data_out` register, and a 32-bit `readdata`, which provides a zero-extended output from the internal `data_out`. Internal signals such as `clk_en`, `data_out`, and `read_mux_out` are employed to control operational timings, hold the intermediate data, and manage data output based on the address input, respectively. In the Verilog implementation, the module initializes or updates `data_out` based upon the reset state or during write operations when the correct conditions are met, the `read_mux_out` is used for selectively masking the `data_out` based upon the `address`, and output assignments are made for `readdata` and `out_port`. This logical configuration ensures that the module operates correctly under specified conditions, handling data efficiently and synchronously in a digital system.",

It accommodates settings and retrieval of a 7-bit data value based on an input address and control signals. When the module is reset or during standard operation with proper chip selection and write enable conditions, it writes to a 7-bit output register from a 32-bit input data bus, masking the upper bits. It provides two outputs: the data out which is directly the content of the 7-bit register, and a read data output which maps the 7-bit data into a 32-bit output, filling the upper bits with zeroes. The module is triggered by a positive edge of a clock or a negative edge of a reset signal, ensuring synchronous operations."

Explanation: \n- address: This 2-bit input selects specific functionality or internal registers within the module depending on its value.\n- chipselect: This input signal, when active (high), enables the module to accept data on the writedata lines or to output data on the readdata lines.\n- clk: This clock input is the main clock signal used to time the operations within the module, working on its positive edge.\n- reset_n: This active-low reset signal initializes all the internal registers to their default state when pulled low.\n- write_n: This active-low write enable signal allows data on the writedata lines to be written into the module's internal registers when asserted.\n- writedata: This 32-bit input provides the data to be written into the module's internal register based on the state of other control signals.\n\nOutput ports: [out_port, readdata]. Explanation:\n- out_port: This 7-bit output presents the current data stored in the module's internal register. It's directly connected to the data_out register within the module.\n- readdata: This 32-bit output is used to read the value of the internal data register when addressed properly.

Explanation: \n- clk_en: This signal is used to enable or disable the clock functionality within the module. In the given code, `clk_en` is statically assigned a value of 1, which means it always enables subsequent operations regardless of external conditions. This implementation suggests that clock enable functionality might be considered for future use or modifications.\n- data_out: This 7-bit register holds the data that can be written to or read from depending on the module's control signals and operations. It gets updated on the positive edge of the clock when certain conditions are met, like reset not being asserted, chipselect being active, and write being enabled.\n- out_port: This is one of the output signals of the module which directly maps to `data_out`. It provides external access to the data held in the `data_out` register.\n- read_mux_out: This signal acts as an intermediary in generating the `readdata` output. It uses a multiplexing operation based on the `address` input to determine whether to output the `data_out` content. This is done by masking `data_out` with a condition of `address` being 0.\n- readdata: This 32-bit output signal is formed by zero-extending `read_mux_out` to 32 bits.
