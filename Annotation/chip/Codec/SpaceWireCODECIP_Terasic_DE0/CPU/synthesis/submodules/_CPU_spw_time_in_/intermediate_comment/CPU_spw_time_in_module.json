    "module": "Module-level comment: The CPU_spw_time_in module manages data input and output synchronized by a clock. It captures 8-bit data on address zero when chip select and write enable are active, storing this in `data_out`. Outputs include `out_port` directly from `data_out` and `readdata` as a zero-extended version of `data_out`. The module functions effectively under control signals ensuring precise data handling within digital systems."
