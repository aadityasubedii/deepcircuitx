Module name: CPU_display7seg. Module specification: The "CPU_display7seg" module serves as an interface between a CPU and a 7-segment display or similar output device, managing data output through synchronized operations. It consists of input ports such as a 2-bit 'address' which targets registers or operations, 'chipselect' which enables module operation when high, 'clk' as the clock signal for synchronization, 'reset_n' an active-low reset signal to initialize internal states, 'write_n' an active-low write enable signal, and a 32-bit 'writedata' bus carrying data from the CPU. Output ports include a 32-bit 'out_port' reflecting the current data stored for display, and 'readdata' which outputs the internal data when read. Internal signals 'clk_en', always enabled in this configuration, 'data_out' that stores data from 'writedata', and 'read_mux_out', a conditional signal output based on the address, are essential for operations. The code block controlled by 'clk' and 'reset_n' conditions captures data on write commands, and another set of assignments control output behavior and module response. This module encapsulates all necessary logic for reading from and writing to a display connected to a CPU, ensuring efficient data handling and integrity in output operations.
