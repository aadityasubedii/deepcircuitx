It features an 8-bit interface with the CPU, consisting of control signals for read and write operations, a clock signal, reset functionality, and a data bus. The module primarily captures data written from the CPU when a specific address and chip select conditions are met and outputs this data continuously to an external port (out_port). Upon reading from the CPU, the data currently stored in the module is provided. The module handles synchronization to the system clock and ensures data integrity during asynchronous reset conditions."

It is used to select specific functionalities like data transmission.\n- **chipselect**: This input signal enables the module when high, allowing it to interact with the CPU bus operations such as reading or writing.\n- **clk**: The clock signal input synchronizes the operations of the module with the rest of the system.\n- **reset_n**: This active-low reset signal initializes or resets the module's internal states and outputs when asserted.\n- **write_n**: This active-low write enable signal allows data on the 'writedata' bus to be written into the module when combined with the condition of chipselect and the correct address.\n- **writedata**: This 32-bit input bus carries data from the CPU to be written into the module. This data may represent anything depending on the system, such as control signals for a display.\n\nOutput ports: [out_port, readdata].\nExplanation:\n- **out_port**: This 32-bit output port presents the data currently stored within the module to external hardware such as a 7-segment display. It reflects the most recent valid write data fed into the module.\n- **readdata**: This 32-bit output bus provides the data currently stored and addressed within the module back to the CPU when read operations are performed. It effectively allows the CPU to verify write operations or retrieve stored data."

This data is held until it is overwritten or cleared upon reset. It serves as the main storage register that outputs data continuously to the `out_port` and conditions the data returned on the `readdata`.\n- **read_mux_out**: This wire signal is used to conditionally pass the contents of `data_out` to the `readdata` output based on the address being provided. It is implemented as a simple multiplexer that outputs `data_out` when the address is 0, otherwise, it outputs 0. This functionality is simplified due to the single condition (address == 0); as the design scales, more complex conditions could be used to derive this signal."
