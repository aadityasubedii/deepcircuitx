Module-level comment: The "CPU_display7seg" module interfaces a CPU to a display by handling data output operations synchronized to system clock. It uses input conditions from 'address', 'chipselect', and 'write_n' to control the capture of data, storing it in 'data_out'. Output is managed via 'out_port' and conditioned output to 'readdata' based on the address. This ensures continuous and accurate data delivery to an external display while enabling data verification from the CPU.
