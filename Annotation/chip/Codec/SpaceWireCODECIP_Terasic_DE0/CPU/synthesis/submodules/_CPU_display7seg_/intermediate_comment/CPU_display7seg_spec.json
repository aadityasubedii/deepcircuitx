    "spec": "Module name: CPU_display7seg. Module specification: The \"CPU_display7seg\" module serves as an interface between a CPU and a 7-segment display or similar output device, managing data output through synchronized operations. It consists of input ports such as a 2-bit 'address' which targets registers or operations, 'chipselect' which enables module operation when high, 'clk' as the clock signal for synchronization, 'reset_n' an active-low reset signal to initialize internal states, 'write_n' an active-low write enable signal, and a 32-bit 'writedata' bus carrying data from the CPU. Output ports include a 32-bit 'out_port' reflecting the current data stored for display, and 'readdata' which outputs the internal data when read. Internal signals 'clk_en', always enabled in this configuration, 'data_out' that stores data from 'writedata', and 'read_mux_out', a conditional signal output based on the address, are essential for operations. The code block controlled by 'clk' and 'reset_n' conditions captures data on write commands, and another set of assignments control output behavior and module response. This module encapsulates all necessary logic for reading from and writing to a display connected to a CPU, ensuring efficient data handling and integrity in output operations.",

It features an 8-bit interface with the CPU, consisting of control signals for read and write operations, a clock signal, reset functionality, and a data bus.

It is used to select specific functionalities like data transmission.\n- **chipselect**: This input signal enables the module when high, allowing it to interact with the CPU bus operations such as reading or writing.\n- **clk**: The clock signal input synchronizes the operations of the module with the rest of the system.\n- **reset_n**: This active-low reset signal initializes or resets the module's internal states and outputs when asserted.\n- **write_n**: This active-low write enable signal allows data on the 'writedata' bus to be written into the module when combined with the condition of chipselect and the correct address.\n- **writedata**: This 32-bit input bus carries data from the CPU to be written into the module. This data may represent anything depending on the system, such as control signals for a display.\n\nOutput ports: [out_port, readdata].\nExplanation:\n- **out_port**: This 32-bit output port presents the data currently stored within the module to external hardware such as a 7-segment display. It reflects the most recent valid write data fed into the module.\n- **readdata**: This 32-bit output bus provides the data currently stored and addressed within the module back to the CPU when read operations are performed.

This data is held until it is overwritten or cleared upon reset. It serves as the main storage register that outputs data continuously to the `out_port` and conditions the data returned on the `readdata`.\n- **read_mux_out**: This wire signal is used to conditionally pass the contents of `data_out` to the `readdata` output based on the address being provided. It is implemented as a simple multiplexer that outputs `data_out` when the address is 0, otherwise, it outputs 0. This functionality is simplified due to the single condition (address == 0); as the design scales, more complex conditions could be used to derive this signal."
