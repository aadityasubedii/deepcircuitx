The module's input ports include MonDReg and break_readreg for monitor and breakpoint control data respectively, clk as the primary clock signal, multiple dbrk_hitX_latch signals for identifying breakpoint hits, and additional signals like debugack, monitor_error, and tracemem_trcdata which support debugging operations. Outputs include jdo for debug output, jrst_n for debug reset, and various take_actionX and take_no_actionX signals that control and report actions taken on debug and memory events. The internal structure utilizes several wires prefixed with vji_ representing JTAG-specific connections like vji_tck for the test clock and vji_tdo for test data output, crucial for managing state and data flow in JTAG operations. The code comprises two main blocks: CPU_cpu_jtag_debug_module_tck and CPU_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk which handle synchronization with JTAG and system clock operations respectively, ensuring correct timing and execution of debug tasks. These features collectively enable rigorous and structured handling of CPU debugging scenarios, helping detect, interface, and handle various states and errors effectively.\n",

The module's input ports include MonDReg and break_readreg for monitor and breakpoint control data respectively, clk as the primary clock signal, multiple dbrk_hitX_latch signals for identifying breakpoint hits, and additional signals like debugack, monitor_error, and tracemem_trcdata which support debugging operations. Outputs include jdo for debug output, jrst_n for debug reset, and various take_actionX and take_no_actionX signals that control and report actions taken on debug and memory events. The internal structure utilizes several wires prefixed with vji_ representing JTAG-specific connections like vji_tck for the test clock and vji_tdo for test data output, crucial for managing state and data flow in JTAG operations. The code comprises two main blocks: CPU_cpu_jtag_debug_module_tck and CPU_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk which handle synchronization with JTAG and system clock operations respectively, ensuring correct timing and execution of debug tasks.
