Module-level comment: The "altera_reset_controller" module synchronizes multiple asynchronous reset inputs, producing a stable reset output and an acknowledged reset request output. It combines input reset signals, synchronizes them using configurable parameters for depth and timing, and manages output through conditional logic based on parameter settings. The module can handle up to 16 reset and reset request inputs, allowing for robust and adjustable reset behavior ideal for system stability in FPGA designs.
