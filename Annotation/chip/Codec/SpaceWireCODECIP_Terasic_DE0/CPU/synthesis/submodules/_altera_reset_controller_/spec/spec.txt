Module name: altera_reset_controller. 

Module specification: The "altera_reset_controller" module is designed to handle multiple asynchronous reset signals, standardizing them into a synchronized, stable reset output suitable for various digital circuits. It accommodates up to 16 reset inputs (`reset_in0` to `reset_in15`) and reset request inputs (`reset_req_in0` to `reset_req_in15`). The `clk` input port is the clock signal used for synchronizing the reset process. The output includes a `reset_out`, which is a synchronized and potentially delayed version of the input resets, and a `reset_req` which provides an acknowledged reset request output. Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `merged_reset`, which aggregates all reset inputs, and `merged_reset_req_in`, which combines all active reset request inputs. These signals are then synchronized through stages controlled by parameters like synchronization depth and specific timing needs, which are manipulated by `altera_reset_synchronizer` instances. The module's functionality can be tuned through parameters to adjust features like the number of input resets, output reset behavior, reset request handling, and internal timing details. The code employs `generate` blocks to conditionally compile code based on the need for the reset request functionality as well as handling the synchronization and deassertion stages dynamically based on configuration parameters. The synchronization includes multiple cases for enabling/disabling reset request signals and adjusting the stabilization period for the reset signal before it is driven to the output. This exhibition of responsiveness to configuration and conditional structuring allows for a customizable and robust reset controller ideal for use in FPGA designs or other synchronous digital systems where reset signal stability is essential.
