    "spec": "Module name: CPU_spw_time_o.  \nModule specification: The `CPU_spw_time_o` module primarily processes input data based on controls derived from a 2-bit address and a clock signal to selectively update a 32-bit output register, `readdata`. The input ports include a 2-bit `address` that determines data selection, a clock signal `clk` that synchronizes operations, an 8-bit `in_port` that provides the primary input data, and a `reset_n` signal that resets `readdata` to zero when active low. The sole output port, `readdata`, holds the result of the module's operations, updating on every positive clock edge when not reset. Internally, `clk_en` is a constant high (1) enabling signal for data updates, `data_in` routes the input data for processing, and `read_mux_out` carries the bits selected by `address` to `readdata`. The operation is managed through two blocks: the first uses combinational logic to define the actions while the module's main functionality, related to data processing and updating `readdata`, is governed by sequential logic in an `always` block. This block ensures that `readdata` is either reset or updated based on the `reset_n` state and clock events, where `readdata` receives zero-padding to accommodate the 32-bit requirement, and actively reflects the data chosen through a multiplexing governed by `address`.",

It supports clock-based read operations into an output register (`readdata`) which gets updated on every positive clock edge provided the reset is not active low. If reset is active-low, `readdata` is cleared (set to 0). The module selects 8 bits from `data_in`, based on the `address`, to feed into `readdata`.
