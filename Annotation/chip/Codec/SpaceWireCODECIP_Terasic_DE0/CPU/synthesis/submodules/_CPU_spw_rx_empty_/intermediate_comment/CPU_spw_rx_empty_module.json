    "module": "Module-level comment: The CPU_spw_rx_empty is a Verilog module designed for CPU data reception. It captures single-bit data from `in_port` to a 32-bit `readdata` output when `address` is 0, synchronized by `clk`. The module uses fixed clock enabling (`clk_en`), a mirrored input (`data_in`), and selective data transfer controlled by `address` (`read_mux_out`). Resets are handled on the negative edge of `reset_n`, ensuring `readdata` is timely updated or reset under set conditions."
