Module-level comment: The `CPU_spw_data_o` module is a data output controller for CPU systems, managing data transaction based on control signals. It supports read and write operations determined by signals `chipselect`, `write_n`, and `address`. On write, it stores the least significant 9 bits of `writedata` to `data_out` which is continuously presented on `out_port`. On read, `data_out` is masked and extended to 32 bits for `readdata`. Operations are synchronized to a clock `clk` and can be reset with `reset_n`.
