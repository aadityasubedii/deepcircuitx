Module name: CPU_spw_data_o. 
Module specification: The `CPU_spw_data_o` module functions primarily as a data output controller in a CPU system, managing both read and write operations to and from its internal registers based on input signals. It processes data via several input ports including: a 2-bit `address` port for register selection, a `chipselect` signal for enabling the module, a clock signal `clk` for synchronization, an active-low `reset_n` for initializations, an active-low `write_n` for operation mode toggling, and a 32-bit `writedata` for input data on write operations. The output ports consist of a 9-bit `out_port` that continuously outputs the stored `data_out` value, and a 32-bit `readdata` that presents the stored data, formatted for external interfacing based on the address input. Internally, `clk_en` is a constant-enabled signal potentially for future clock enabling modifications, `data_out` is a 9-bit register holding the output data updated on write conditions, and `read_mux_out` is an internal signal calculating conditional output data based on the address. The code consists of several blocks including assignment of constant values, conditional data update within a clock-driven block, and wire assignments for outputs reflecting read operations and constant data display. This structure ensures the module handles the data output management robustly with conditions like signal activation and specific addressing handled with clarity.
