Module name: CPU_spw_state.
Module specification: The "CPU_spw_state" module is designed to function as a data selector and register manager centered around a clock signal and a reset condition. This module takes inputs from a 2-bit address signal, a clock signal (clk), a 3-bit input port (in_port), and an active-low reset signal (reset_n). The principal output of the module is a 32-bit register (readdata), which is selectively updated based on the address input. The internal signals include `clk_en`, which is constantly enabled, `data_in`, which directly receives the 3-bit data from `in_port`, and `read_mux_out`, which handles bit selection or zeroing based on the address value. The core of the code features a combinational block assigning data and a sequential block controlling the register update operation. During each positive clock edge, if not in reset, the module updates 'readdata' based on conditions provided by `read_mux_out`. The module ensures that if `reset_n` is asserted, `readdata` is reset to zero to maintain data integrity.
