    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"CPU_spw_state\" module is a data selector and register manager that uses a clock and a reset signal. It selects and outputs a 32-bit value from a 3-bit input ('in_port') based on a 2-bit address and updates this value at each clock's positive edge unless reset. Internal logic includes a clock enable (always on), data input directly from 'in_port', and a multiplexer controlled by 'address' to handle data processing or zeroing before updating the output register 'readdata'."
