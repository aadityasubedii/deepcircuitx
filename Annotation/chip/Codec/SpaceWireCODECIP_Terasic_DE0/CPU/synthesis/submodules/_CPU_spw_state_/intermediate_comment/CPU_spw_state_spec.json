    "spec": "Module name: CPU_spw_state.\nModule specification: The \"CPU_spw_state\" module is designed to function as a data selector and register manager centered around a clock signal and a reset condition. This module takes inputs from a 2-bit address signal, a clock signal (clk), a 3-bit input port (in_port), and an active-low reset signal (reset_n). The principal output of the module is a 32-bit register (readdata), which is selectively updated based on the address input. The internal signals include `clk_en`, which is constantly enabled, `data_in`, which directly receives the 3-bit data from `in_port`, and `read_mux_out`, which handles bit selection or zeroing based on the address value. The core of the code features a combinational block assigning data and a sequential block controlling the register update operation. During each positive clock edge, if not in reset, the module updates 'readdata' based on conditions provided by `read_mux_out`. The module ensures that if `reset_n` is asserted, `readdata` is reset to zero to maintain data integrity.\n",

The module takes an input from a 3-bit port ('in_port'), an address, a clock signal ('clk'), and a reset signal ('reset_n'). Depending on the value of the 'address', it selectively outputs a 32-bit value through the 'readdata' port. If the reset is active (low), it resets 'readdata' to 0. If not in reset and the clock is enabled, it updates the 'readdata' to contain a value derived from 'in_port', which is determined by the address input.
