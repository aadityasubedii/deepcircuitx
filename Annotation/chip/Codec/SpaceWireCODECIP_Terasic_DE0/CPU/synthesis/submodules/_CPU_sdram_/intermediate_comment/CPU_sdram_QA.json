It interfaces with the CPU through address, data, and control signals and orchestrates the transformation of these signals into appropriate commands and timing sequences required by the SDRAM. It uses a FIFO buffer module (`CPU_sdram_input_efifo_module`) to handle data input and output operations efficiently. The module controls SDRAM operations such as read, write, refresh, and precharge, and ensures the synchronization of these operations with the CPU's needs through status signals like `za_valid` and `za_waitrequest`. Furthermore, the module manages initialization, address decoding, and command generation for accessing the SDRAM, making it essential for proper memory management in systems requiring high-speed data access."
