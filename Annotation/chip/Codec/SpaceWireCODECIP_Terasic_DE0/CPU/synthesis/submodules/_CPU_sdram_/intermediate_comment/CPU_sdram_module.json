    "module": "Module-level comment: // This CPU_sdram module interfaces between a CPU and SDRAM, managing data transfer and memory operations. It processes CPU commands, handles address translation, and generates appropriate SDRAM control signals. The module uses a FIFO buffer for data queueing, implements SDRAM initialization and refresh cycles, and employs state machines to coordinate read/write operations while ensuring proper timing and synchronization."
