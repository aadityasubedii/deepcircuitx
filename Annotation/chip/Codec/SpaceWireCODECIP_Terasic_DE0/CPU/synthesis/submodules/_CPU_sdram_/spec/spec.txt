Module name: CPU_sdram. Module specification: The CPU_sdram module serves as the interface between a CPU and SDRAM, managing communication and operations to ensure proper data transfer and memory management. It includes a variety of input ports such as `az_addr`, `az_be_n`, `az_cs`, `az_data`, `az_rd_n`, `az_wr_n`, `clk`, and `reset_n` that bring in address, data control, and timing signals from the CPU. The outputs, which include `za_data`, `za_valid`, `za_waitrequest`, `zs_addr`, `zs_ba`, `zs_cas_n`, `zs_cke`, `zs_cs_n`, `zs_dq`, `zs_dqm`, `zs_ras_n`, and `zs_we_n`, provide feedback and control to the CPU and SDRAM accordingly. Internally, the module uses signals like `active_addr`, `active_bank`, and `cmd_code` among others to manage data, address handling, and command execution statuses. The module encapsulates blocks for initializing SDRAM parameters, command processing, data buffering through the FIFO submodule (`CPU_sdram_input_efifo_module`), and interfacing with the SDRAM chips for operations such as read, write, and refresh. Each of these elements is crafted to synchronize the workflow from the CPU commands to the SDRAM with clock controls and state machines ensuring the module operates under correct conditions.
