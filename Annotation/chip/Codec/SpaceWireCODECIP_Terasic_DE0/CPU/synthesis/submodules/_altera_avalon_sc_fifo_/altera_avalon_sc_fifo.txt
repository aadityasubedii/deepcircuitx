Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable FIFO buffer for data streams, supporting various data types including packets. It uses parameterizable depth, width, and features like memory block usage and fill-level monitoring. The FIFO operates with standard read/write signals and additional controls for packet boundaries and error handling. Internally, it manages data storage using pointers and memory arrays, tracks fill levels, and generates control signals for flow management and error handling. The module supports different latency modes and can be configured for store-and-forward or cut-through operations.
