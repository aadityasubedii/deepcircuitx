Module name: altera_avalon_sc_fifo. Module specification: This module implements a configurable FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer for data streams in hardware systems. It supports various data types, including packets, with optional error handling and channel-based data processing. The FIFO's depth, data width, and features like memory block usage, packet processing, and fill-level monitoring are parameterizable. Key input ports include clk, reset, in_data, in_valid, and out_ready, while output ports include out_data, out_valid, and in_ready. Additional ports handle packet boundaries, error flags, and channel information. Internal signals such as wr_ptr, rd_ptr, mem, and fill_level manage data storage and FIFO status. The module is structured into sections for memory management, read/write operations, fill level tracking, and control signal generation. It incorporates
