    "module": "Module-level comment: The CPU_onchip_memory2 is a single-port, synchronous on-chip memory component utilizing Altera's altsyncram. It interprets input signals for selecting operations (read/write), managing byte-level data manipulation, and ensuring synchronized data integrity via clock and reset controls. Internal signals derive conditions for writing and clock enabling, while memory configurations like size and mode are parameterized, establishing a flexible yet specific memory handling suited for CPU architectures."
