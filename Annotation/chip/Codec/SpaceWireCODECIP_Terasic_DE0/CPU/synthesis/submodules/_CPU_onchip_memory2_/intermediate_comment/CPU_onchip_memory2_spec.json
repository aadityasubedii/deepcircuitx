    "spec": "Module name: CPU_onchip_memory2. Module specification: The CPU_onchip_memory2 is a single-port on-chip memory module designed for a CPU, leveraging Altera's `altsyncram` for memory management. This module supports single-port access, addressing control with signals such as `address` for specifying RAM locations and `byteenable` for byte-level manipulation during writes. The `chipselect` signal ensures the module's response only when active, `clk` is the main clock sync, `clken` for clock enable, `reset` for an asynchronous reset of the module, `reset_req` which flags specific memory subsystem reset, and `write` to dictate read or write operations. The `writedata` input takes in data for storage, while `readdata` outputs data fetched from memory. Internally, the `wren` signal, derived from `chipselect` and `write`, serves as a write enable, and `clocken0`, combining `clken` and `reset_req`, manages operational conditions for the memory. This module primarily includes a declaration of parameters for RAM configuration, port definitions, internal signal wiring, and an `altsyncram` instance characterized by the module\u2019s operational specifications. This setup encompasses initialized settings for RAM depth, width, byte size, operation mode, and data register configurations to align with the memory requirements of a CPU architecture.",
