Module name: CPU_onchip_memory2. Module specification: The CPU_onchip_memory2 is a single-port on-chip memory module designed for a CPU, leveraging Altera's `altsyncram` for memory management. This module supports single-port access, addressing control with signals such as `address` for specifying RAM locations and `byteenable` for byte-level manipulation during writes. The `chipselect` signal ensures the module's response only when active, `clk` is the main clock sync, `clken` for clock enable, `reset` for an asynchronous reset of the module, `reset_req` which flags specific memory subsystem reset, and `write` to dictate read or write operations. The `writedata` input takes in data for storage, while `readdata` outputs data fetched from memory. Internally, the `wren` signal, derived from `chipselect` and `write`, serves as a write enable, and `clocken0`, combining `clken` and `reset_req`, manages operational conditions for the memory. This module primarily includes a declaration of parameters for RAM configuration, port definitions, internal signal wiring, and an `altsyncram` instance characterized by the moduleâ€™s operational specifications. This setup encompasses initialized settings for RAM depth, width, byte size, operation mode, and data register configurations to align with the memory requirements of a CPU architecture.
