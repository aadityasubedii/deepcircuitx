Module-level comment: The `CPU_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk` module orchestrates JTAG debugging by controlling and updating CPU debug operations synchronized to a system clock. It inputs JTAG and instruction signals, processes them through synchronized registers, and uses internal logic to generate outputs that manage debug actions such as breaks and memory tracing. Key processing involves edge-detecting signal changes for state updates and action decisions based on instruction inputs, supported by local registers and synchronization blocks.
