    "spec": "Module name: CPU_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk.\nModule specification: The `CPU_cpu_jtag_debug_module_sysclk` module is designed primarily for JTAG debugging within a CPU, managing debugging actions triggered by instruction inputs and synchronized to a system clock. The module encompasses several input ports: `clk` (the primary clock signal), `ir_in` (instruction register input determining debugging operations), `sr` (shift register holding data for state updates), `vs_udr` and `vs_uir` (signals for updating data and instruction registers). Output ports include `jdo` (output state register), along with multiple control signals such as `take_action_break_[a,b,c]`, `take_no_action_break_[a,b,c]`, `take_action_ocimem_[a,b]`, `take_no_action_ocimem_a`, `take_action_tracectrl`, `take_action_tracemem_[a,b]`, and `take_no_action_tracemem_a`, which command various debugging actions and states. Internal signals like `enable_action_strobe`, `ir`, `jxuir`, `sync2_udr`, `sync2_uir`, `sync_udr`, and `sync_uir` facilitate synchronization, state updates, and enable the activation of output controls. The module's code is divided into blocks including signal synchronization using `altera_std_synchronizer` for `sync_udr` and `sync_uir`, edge detection for internal state updates, and conditions for emitting action or no-action control signals based on the instruction register and internal state. The code logic within always blocks updates the `ir` and `jdo` registers based on edge-triggered inputs and controls the output signals by evaluating these internal registers and incoming instruction signals. This structured approach ensures dynamic and conditioned responses during CPU debugging sessions, using JTAG interface mechanisms.",

The module encompasses several input ports: `clk` (the primary clock signal), `ir_in` (instruction register input determining debugging operations), `sr` (shift register holding data for state updates), `vs_udr` and `vs_uir` (signals for updating data and instruction registers). Output ports include `jdo` (output state register), along with multiple control signals such as `take_action_break_[a,b,c]`, `take_no_action_break_[a,b,c]`, `take_action_ocimem_[a,b]`, `take_no_action_ocimem_a`, `take_action_tracectrl`, `take_action_tracemem_[a,b]`, and `take_no_action_tracemem_a`, which command various debugging actions and states. Internal signals like `enable_action_strobe`, `ir`, `jxuir`, `sync2_udr`, `sync2_uir`, `sync_udr`, and `sync_uir` facilitate synchronization, state updates, and enable the activation of output controls. The module's code is divided into blocks including signal synchronization using `altera_std_synchronizer` for `sync_udr` and `sync_uir`, edge detection for internal state updates, and conditions for emitting action or no-action control signals based on the instruction register and internal state. The code logic within always blocks updates the `ir` and `jdo` registers based on edge-triggered inputs and controls the output signals by evaluating these internal registers and incoming instruction signals. This structured approach ensures dynamic and conditioned responses during CPU debugging sessions, using JTAG interface mechanisms."
