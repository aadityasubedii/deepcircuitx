Module name: CPU_led. 
Module specification: The CPU_led module is designed to interface with a CPU to manage write and read operations to a data register based on specific control signals. It utilizes input ports such as a 2-bit `address`, a 1-bit `chipselect`, a `clk` or clock signal, an active-low `reset_n`, an active-low `write_n`, and a 32-bit `writedata` bus. The module outputs through a 10-bit `out_port` reflecting the state of the internal data register, and a 32-bit `readdata` for reading operations, zero-extended from a 10-bit internal value. Internal signal `clk_en` is fixed high, playing no dynamic role in the code. The `data_out` signal is a 10-bit register updated on write operations when conditions - `chipselect` active, `write_n` low, and `address` is zero - are met, and reset to zero when `reset_n` is low. `read_mux_out` is used to selectively pass `data_out` based on the `address`, ensuring proper data sourcing to `readdata`. The code includes blocks for managing `data_out` on clock edges depending on reset conditions and write operations, and for assigning outputs based on internal states and conditions. The module encapsulates simple I/O functionalities conditioned on state and control parameters, effectively demonstrating basic interfacing capabilities with external systems or further internal components.
