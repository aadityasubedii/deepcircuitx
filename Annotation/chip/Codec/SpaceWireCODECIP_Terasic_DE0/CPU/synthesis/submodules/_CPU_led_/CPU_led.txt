Module-level comment: The CPU_led module interfaces with a CPU for handling data register write and read operations. It supports inputs like address, chipselect, and writedata, and outputs like out_port and readdata. Internally, it uses a data_out register controlled by clock events and reset conditions, updating based on selected address and control signals. Outputs are managed through assignments reflecting internal register states, facilitating simple data interaction and external interfacing operations.
