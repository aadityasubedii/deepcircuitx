    "spec": "Module name: CPU_led. \nModule specification: The CPU_led module is designed to interface with a CPU to manage write and read operations to a data register based on specific control signals. It utilizes input ports such as a 2-bit `address`, a 1-bit `chipselect`, a `clk` or clock signal, an active-low `reset_n`, an active-low `write_n`, and a 32-bit `writedata` bus. The module outputs through a 10-bit `out_port` reflecting the state of the internal data register, and a 32-bit `readdata` for reading operations, zero-extended from a 10-bit internal value. Internal signal `clk_en` is fixed high, playing no dynamic role in the code. The `data_out` signal is a 10-bit register updated on write operations when conditions - `chipselect` active, `write_n` low, and `address` is zero - are met, and reset to zero when `reset_n` is low. `read_mux_out` is used to selectively pass `data_out` based on the `address`, ensuring proper data sourcing to `readdata`. The code includes blocks for managing `data_out` on clock edges depending on reset conditions and write operations, and for assigning outputs based on internal states and conditions. The module encapsulates simple I/O functionalities conditioned on state and control parameters, effectively demonstrating basic interfacing capabilities with external systems or further internal components.",

The module has input signals including address, chipselect, clock (clk), active low reset (reset_n), active low write (write_n), and writedata. The outputs are out_port and readdata. The module primarily operates based on the clock signal and the reset condition. When reset is active low, the data_out register is cleared to zero. If the chipselect is active, write is requested (indicated by write_n being low), and the address is zero, the data_out register takes the lower 10 bits of the input writedata. For read operations, the readdata output provides a zero-extended version of data_out when address is zero. The out_port signal directly mirrors the data_out register, possibly for external interfacing.

In this context, it is used to determine the operation on `data_out`.\n- `chipselect` (1-bit): Enables the module when high, allowing it to respond to read or write commands.\n- `clk` (clock, 1-bit): Provides the timing signal for the module\u2019s operations, particularly for data registering on the rising edge.\n- `reset_n` (active low reset, 1-bit): Resets the module when low, specifically clearing the `data_out` register to zero.\n- `write_n` (active low write, 1-bit): When low, along with active chipselect, it initiates a write operation to the `data_out` register based on the address.\n- `writedata` (32-bit): Data bus input which provides the data to be written into `data_out` if write operation is commanded.\n\nOutput ports: out_port, readdata.\nExplanation:\n- `out_port` (10-bit): Mirrors the contents of the `data_out` register for external interfacing or monitoring, reflecting the current data held.\n- `readdata` (32-bit): Outputs data from the module.

It is written to during write operations when specific conditions are met (chipselect is active, write command is active, and the address is 0). It also sources the output to `out_port` and indirectly to `readdata` after conditioning.\n- `read_mux_out` (10-bit): Serves as an intermediate wire that presents the data from `data_out` during read operations based on the address condition. It uses logical AND with the condition {address == 0} to determine whether `data_out` should pass through to `readdata`. If the address is 0, `read_mux_out` will carry `data_out` contents; otherwise, it holds zero. This mechanism aids in zero extension for the `readdata` output."
