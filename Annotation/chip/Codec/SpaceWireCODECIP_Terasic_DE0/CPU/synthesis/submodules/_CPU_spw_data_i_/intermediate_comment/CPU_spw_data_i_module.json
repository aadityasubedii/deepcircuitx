    "module": "Module-level comment: The CPU_spw_data_i module manages data input for a CPU by reading from 'in_port' and outputs a 32-bit 'readdata' based on 'address'. It uses internal signals like 'clk_en' (always enabled) and 'data_in' (mirror of 'in_port') to handle data during each clock cycle, governed by the 'clk'. The module resets 'readdata' to zero on a low 'reset_n' and updates it conditionally based on address masking, ensuring synchronized data processing and output."
