Module name: CPU_spw_data_i. Module specification: The CPU_spw_data_i module is designed primarily for handling data input operations within a CPU, specifically regulating the data input through the 'in_port' and producing a 32-bit output 'readdata' based on the input 'address'. The module features four input ports: 'address', a 2-bit input determining the data masking; 'clk' (clock), which synchronizes data operations; 'in_port', a 9-bit input that represents data to be processed; and 'reset_n', an active-low reset signal that clears 'readdata' when low. The sole output port, 'readdata', presents the processed data synchronized by 'clk'. Internally, the module uses several signals: 'clk_en', which is perpetually enabled (set to 1), controlling whether the always block processes every clock cycle; 'data_in', a direct copy of 'in_port' used for intermediate handling; and 'read_mux_out', which applies a masking determined by 'address' to 'data_in' before passing to 'readdata'. The code has a combinational block assigning values to 'data_in' and 'read_mux_out', and a sequential always block triggered on the positive edge of 'clk' or negative edge of 'reset_n', responsible for setting 'readdata' to either zero upon reset or updating its value based on 'read_mux_out' respecting the clock enable condition.
