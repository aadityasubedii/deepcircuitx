    "spec": "Module name: CPU_spw_data_i. Module specification: The CPU_spw_data_i module is designed primarily for handling data input operations within a CPU, specifically regulating the data input through the 'in_port' and producing a 32-bit output 'readdata' based on the input 'address'. The module features four input ports: 'address', a 2-bit input determining the data masking; 'clk' (clock), which synchronizes data operations; 'in_port', a 9-bit input that represents data to be processed; and 'reset_n', an active-low reset signal that clears 'readdata' when low. The sole output port, 'readdata', presents the processed data synchronized by 'clk'. Internally, the module uses several signals: 'clk_en', which is perpetually enabled (set to 1), controlling whether the always block processes every clock cycle; 'data_in', a direct copy of 'in_port' used for intermediate handling; and 'read_mux_out', which applies a masking determined by 'address' to 'data_in' before passing to 'readdata'. The code has a combinational block assigning values to 'data_in' and 'read_mux_out', and a sequential always block triggered on the positive edge of 'clk' or negative edge of 'reset_n', responsible for setting 'readdata' to either zero upon reset or updating its value based on 'read_mux_out' respecting the clock enable condition.",

The operation involves checking if the 'reset_n' signal is low to reset 'readdata' to zero; otherwise, it transfers the input from 'in_port' to 'readdata', adjusted and masked based on the address value. It operates synchronously with a clock signal 'clk' and makes use of a clock enable signal, although it is set to always be enabled in this context."

This data will be processed and forwarded to 'readdata'.\n- 'reset_n' is a reset signal, active low, which is used to reset the module's output 'readdata' to zero when the signal is low.\n\nOutput ports: readdata.\nExplanation: \n- 'readdata' is a 31-bit output port that presents the processed form of the data input through 'in_port', controlled by the 'address' input and synchronized by the 'clk' signal.

In this specific module, it is hard-coded to always be 1 (enabled). This means that the processing within the 'always' block is enabled on every clock cycle, contingent upon the state of 'reset_n'.\n- 'data_in' is a wire that directly copies its value from the 'in_port' input signal. It is an intermediate signal used to facilitate the eventual data assignment to 'readdata' through another internal construct based on conditions set by 'address'.\n- 'read_mux_out' is a wire derived by a masking operation dependent on the 'address' input. The masking with `{9 {(address == 0)}}` serves to selectively pass the 'data_in' to the output 'readdata' based on the value of 'address'. This masked output is passed only when 'address' equals 0, facilitating conditional data propagation based on address input."
