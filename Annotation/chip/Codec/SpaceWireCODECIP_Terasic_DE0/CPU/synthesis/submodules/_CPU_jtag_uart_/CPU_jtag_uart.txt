Module-level comment: The CPU_jtag_uart module simulates UART communication via JTAG for testing purposes, handling data through FIFO buffers. It uses input signals like av_address and av_chipselect for operational control, and outputs like av_irq and av_readdata for status and data handling. Internally, it incorporates submodules for managing FIFO read and write operations, ensuring efficient data flow and interrupt management based on FIFO status signals like fifo_AE and fifo_AF. This structured approach allows detailed simulation and operational control in communications testing environments.
