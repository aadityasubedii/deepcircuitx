Module name: CPU_jtag_uart. Module specification: The CPU_jtag_uart module is designed for UART communication interfaced via a JTAG environment, primarily for testing and simulation purposes integrated in systems that rely on UART communications. This module facilitates bidirectional data transactions and buffer management using FIFO (First-In-First-Out) mechanisms. Input ports include av_address, av_chipselect, av_read_n, av_write_n, av_writedata, clk, and rst_n, which control address selection, module activation, read and write operations, synchronization, and reset operations respectively. The output ports are av_irq, av_readdata, av_waitrequest, dataavailable, and readyfordata, managing interrupt requests, reading of data, operation availability status, and data availability notifications. Internally, the module uses signals like fifo_AE, fifo_AF, fifo_wr among others to manage FIFO operations and state conditions affecting data readiness and interrupt handling. Its design features clusters such as CPU_jtag_uart_scfifo_w and CPU_jtag_uart_scfifo_r for managing dedicated write and read FIFO operations, with simulated sections to facilitate testing functionalities. Together, these elements contribute to a robust module that effectively simulates UART communication within a JTAG-configured system, assisting in the seamless management and operation of read-write tasks enhanced by detailed state and flow control mechanisms.
