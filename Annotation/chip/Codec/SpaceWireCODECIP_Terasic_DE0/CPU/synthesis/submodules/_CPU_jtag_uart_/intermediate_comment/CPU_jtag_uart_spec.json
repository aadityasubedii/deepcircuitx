    "spec": "Module name: CPU_jtag_uart. Module specification: The CPU_jtag_uart module is designed for UART communication interfaced via a JTAG environment, primarily for testing and simulation purposes integrated in systems that rely on UART communications. This module facilitates bidirectional data transactions and buffer management using FIFO (First-In-First-Out) mechanisms. Input ports include av_address, av_chipselect, av_read_n, av_write_n, av_writedata, clk, and rst_n, which control address selection, module activation, read and write operations, synchronization, and reset operations respectively. The output ports are av_irq, av_readdata, av_waitrequest, dataavailable, and readyfordata, managing interrupt requests, reading of data, operation availability status, and data availability notifications. Internally, the module uses signals like fifo_AE, fifo_AF, fifo_wr among others to manage FIFO operations and state conditions affecting data readiness and interrupt handling. Its design features clusters such as CPU_jtag_uart_scfifo_w and CPU_jtag_uart_scfifo_r for managing dedicated write and read FIFO operations, with simulated sections to facilitate testing functionalities. Together, these elements contribute to a robust module that effectively simulates UART communication within a JTAG-configured system, assisting in the seamless management and operation of read-write tasks enhanced by detailed state and flow control mechanisms.",

It interfaces with both write and read FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffers handling data transmission and reception. The module deals with various states such as wait requests, data availability, interrupts, and buffer overflows, among others. It manages activities based on clock and reset signals, and processes data based on whether the system is ready to send or receive data. This is likely used to simulate a UART interface in a hardware description language for testing or development purposes."

Module specification: The CPU_jtag_uart module is designed for UART communication interfaced via a JTAG environment, primarily for testing and simulation purposes integrated in systems that rely on UART communications. This module facilitates bidirectional data transactions and buffer management using FIFO (First-In-First-Out) mechanisms. Input ports include av_address, av_chipselect, av_read_n, av_write_n, av_writedata, clk, and rst_n, which control address selection, module activation, read and write operations, synchronization, and reset operations respectively. The output ports are av_irq, av_readdata, av_waitrequest, dataavailable, and readyfordata, managing interrupt requests, reading of data, operation availability status, and data availability notifications. Internally, the module uses signals like fifo_AE, fifo_AF, fifo_wr among others to manage FIFO operations and state conditions affecting data readiness and interrupt handling. Its design features clusters such as CPU_jtag_uart_scfifo_w and CPU_jtag_uart_scfifo_r for managing dedicated write and read FIFO operations, with simulated sections to facilitate testing functionalities. Together, these elements contribute to a robust module that effectively simulates UART communication within a JTAG-configured system, assisting in the seamless management and operation of read-write tasks enhanced by detailed state and flow control mechanisms."

It interfaces with both write and read FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffers handling data transmission and reception. The module deals with various states such as wait requests, data availability, interrupts, and buffer overflows, among others.

Module specification: The CPU_jtag_uart module is designed for UART communication interfaced via a JTAG environment, primarily for testing and simulation purposes integrated in systems that rely on UART communications. This module facilitates bidirectional data transactions and buffer management using FIFO (First-In-First-Out) mechanisms. Input ports include av_address, av_chipselect, av_read_n, av_write_n, av_writedata, clk, and rst_n, which control address selection, module activation, read and write operations, synchronization, and reset operations respectively. The output ports are av_irq, av_readdata, av_waitrequest, dataavailable, and readyfordata, managing interrupt requests, reading of data, operation availability status, and data availability notifications. Internally, the module uses signals like fifo_AE, fifo_AF, fifo_wr among others to manage FIFO operations and state conditions affecting data readiness and interrupt handling. Its design features clusters such as CPU_jtag_uart_scfifo_w and CPU_jtag_uart_scfifo_r for managing dedicated write and read FIFO operations, with simulated sections to facilitate testing functionalities. Together, these elements contribute to a robust module that effectively simulates UART communication within a JTAG-configured system, assisting in the seamless management and operation of read-write tasks enhanced by detailed state and flow control mechanisms."
