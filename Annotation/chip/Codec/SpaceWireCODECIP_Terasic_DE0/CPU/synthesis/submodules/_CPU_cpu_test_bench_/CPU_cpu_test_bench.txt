Module-level comment: 
// This module implements a CPU test bench for verifying CPU operations.
// It monitors various CPU signals, checks for undefined ('x') values,
// and filters load data for non-I/O operations. The module uses numerous
// input signals to track instruction execution, memory access, and register
// writes. It employs assertions and checks to detect errors during simulation,
// stopping execution when unexpected conditions occur. The test bench
// helps ensure correct CPU functionality by validating critical signals
// and operations throughout the CPU's pipeline stages.
