    "module": "Module-level comment: \n// This module implements a CPU test bench for verifying CPU operations.\n// It monitors various CPU signals, checks for undefined ('x') values,\n// and filters load data for non-I/O operations. The module uses numerous\n// input signals to track instruction execution, memory access, and register\n// writes. It employs assertions and checks to detect errors during simulation,\n// stopping execution when unexpected conditions occur. The test bench\n// helps ensure correct CPU functionality by validating critical signals\n// and operations throughout the CPU's pipeline stages."
