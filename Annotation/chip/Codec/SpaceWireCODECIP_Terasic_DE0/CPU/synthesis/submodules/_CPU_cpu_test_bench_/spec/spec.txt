Module name: CPU_cpu_test_bench. Module specification: This module serves as a test bench for a CPU design, monitoring and verifying various CPU operations. It takes numerous input signals including instruction word (D_iw), operation codes (D_iw_op, D_iw_opx), pipeline stage validity signals (D_valid, E_valid, F_valid, W_valid), program counter (F_pcb), control signals (R_ctrl_ld, R_ctrl_ld_non_io, R_wr_dst_reg), register numbers (R_dst_regnum), write data (W_wr_data), memory interfaces (d_address, d_byteenable, d_read, d_write, i_address, i_read, i_readdata), and system signals (clk, reset_n). It outputs filtered load data (av_l
