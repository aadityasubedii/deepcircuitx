    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'CPU_spw_config' module configures a CPU interface, acting only when selected by address, enabled by chip selection, and allowed by write operation. It includes inputs for address selection, control signals, and data, and outputs both direct and masked versions of the internal data register 'data_out'. Internally, it employs constant wire assignments and conditional registers updates within an always block synced to the clock and reset signals, ensuring determined and safe operations based on incoming control settings.\n"
