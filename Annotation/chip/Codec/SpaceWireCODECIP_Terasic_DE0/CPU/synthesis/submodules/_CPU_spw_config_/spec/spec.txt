Module name: CPU_spw_config. Module specification: The 'CPU_spw_config' module in Verilog is designed for managing configuration settings for a CPU interface, activating only when specific conditions are met, such as selected address, chip selection, and write operations. It features input ports like 'address' (2-bit for operation selection), 'chipselect' (enables the module), 'clk' (clock input for synchronization), 'reset_n' (active-low for resetting internal registers), 'write_n' (active-low enabling data write), and 'writedata' (32-bit data for writing). The output ports include 'out_port' (3-bit, mirrors an internal register ‘data_out’) and 'readdata' (32-bit, outputs masked data based on address). Internal signals encompass 'clk_en' (constantly enabled clock signal), 'data_out' (3-bit register storing the output value), and 'read_mux_out' (masks data based on the address to output through 'readdata'). The module operates primarily within 'always' and 'assign' blocks—'always' block handling data writing and reset conditions on the positive edge of the clock or negative edge of 'reset_n'; 'assign' blocks manage constant assignments and conditional signal manipulation for outputs. This structured setup ensures the module only acts under designated settings, enhancing system efficiency and control in CPU interfacing scenarios.
