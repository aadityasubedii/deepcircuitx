Module-level comment: This module implements the NIOS II CPU core, featuring a 5-stage pipeline (fetch, decode, execute, memory, writeback). It handles instruction fetch, decoding, arithmetic/logic operations, memory access, and result writeback. The module includes branch prediction, exception handling, and interfaces with memory and peripherals. It uses a combination of sequential and combinational logic to manage instruction flow, data processing, and control signal generation across pipeline stages.
