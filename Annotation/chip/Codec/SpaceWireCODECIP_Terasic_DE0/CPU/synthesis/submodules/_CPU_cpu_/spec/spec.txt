Module name: CPU_cpu. Module specification: This module implements the main CPU core for a NIOS II processor. It contains the key pipeline stages (fetch, decode, execute, memory, writeback) and associated control logic. The module handles instruction fetch, decoding, execution of arithmetic/logic operations, memory access, and writing results back to registers. It also includes logic for branch prediction, exception handling, and interfacing with other system components like memory and peripherals. Key input ports include clk (system clock), reset_n (active-low reset), d_irq (data memory interrupt request), and i_readdata (instruction read data). Output ports include d_address (data memory address), i_address (instruction memory address), and various control signals. Internal signals such as F_pc (fetch stage program counter), D_iw (decode stage instruction word), and E_alu_result (execute stage ALU result) are use
