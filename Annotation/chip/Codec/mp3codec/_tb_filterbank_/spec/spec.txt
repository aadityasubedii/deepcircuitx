Module name: tb_filterbank. Module specification: The "tb_filterbank" module serves as a testbench for simulating a filterbank system. It initializes and tests different conditions and scenarios that a filterbank might encounter. Key input ports include `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `rst` (reset signal for state initialization), `sample` (the data input for the filterbank), and `sample_valid` (a signal denoting the validity of the input data). The output ports are `subband_sample` (the decomposed output sample), `subband_sample_valid` (validity of the decomposed output), `wso` (windowed sample output, potentially representing a processed data form), and `wso_valid` (validity of the windowed sample output). Internal signals like `filter_coef` (array of filter coefficients), and `divider` (used for timing control), among others, facilitate internal operations and control flows. In this testbench, blocks such as `initial` and `always` are used for setting up simulation conditions, loading coefficients from "filter_coef.mem", and driving the clock signal for tests. The simulation sequences are staged within various initial blocks that either load data, set operational conditions, or terminate the simulation after a set number of cycles, ensuring thorough testing of the filterbank's functionality and response.
