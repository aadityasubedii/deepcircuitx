Module-level comment: The "tb_filterbank" module functions as a Verilog testbench for a filterbank system. It simulates diverse operational scenarios by sequentially loading filter coefficients, generating clock signals, and managing I/O signals. Input data is timed and validated using an internal divider, facilitating conditions for comprehensive testing. Output correctness is monitored through validity signals, ensuring the filterbank processes data accurately across multiple cycles.
