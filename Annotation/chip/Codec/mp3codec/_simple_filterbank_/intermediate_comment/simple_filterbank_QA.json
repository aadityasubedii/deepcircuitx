It stores the samples in an Elastic Buffer Register (EBR), applies a filtering process with predefined coefficients, and outputs the windowed samples. The module works synchronously with a clock signal (`clk`) and a reset signal (`rst`). The filtering involves multiplying the current sample by a filter coefficient, and this is done sequentially for blocks of samples. The filtered output (`windowed_sample_output`) becomes valid cyclically (`wso_valid`) once the module has completed filtering a block of samples based on buffer indices and control flags for filtering operations."
