Module-level comment: The `simple_filterbank` module processes a stream of 16-bit signed samples, applying a filter operation using predefined coefficients to generate windowed output samples. It handles inputs synchronously with a clock, storing samples in an Elastic Buffer Register, and using sequential indexing to manage sample filtering and output generation. Filtering is controlled through flags and indices, ensuring output validity is indicated alongside the windowed samples.
