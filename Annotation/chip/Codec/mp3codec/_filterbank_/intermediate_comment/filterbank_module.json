    "module": "Module-level comment: The `filterbank` module performs polyphase filter bank processing on input signal samples to extract frequency subbands, crucial for digital signal processing applications like audio coding. It handles inputs and outputs through a clock-driven synchronous design, utilizing internal memory for storing samples and coefficients, and sequential always blocks manage the complex tasks of signal windowing, sub-sampling, and matrix multiplication. This ensures efficient data flow and computation across multiple stages to output processed subband samples alongside validity flags and indices."
