    "spec": "Module name: filterbank. Module specification: The filterbank module in Verilog is designed for digital signal processing, specifically implementing a polyphase filter bank that processes single input signal samples to produce subband samples. The module utilizes a clock input (`clk`) for timing sync, a reset signal (`rst`) to initialize its internal state, a signed 16-bit `sample` signal for the input signal, and a `sample_valid` to know when a new sample is available. The outputs include a signed 32-bit `subband_sample` portraying the processed subband sample, `subband_sample_valid` to indicate the readiness of the output, a 5-bit `granule_idx` indicating the processing sequence, a signed 16-bit `windowed_sample_output` showing interim windowed samples, and `wso_valid` flagging the readiness of the windowed output. Internally, the module employs arrays for storing samples, filter coefficients, and matrix coefficients. Signals such as `sample_block_offset`, `sample_idx`, `read_sample_offset`, and various pipeline registers (`filtering_r1` to `filtering_r5`, etc.) control and hold data during processing stages. The code includes memory initialization for coefficients using specified functions and memory files, as well as detailed logic in sequenced always blocks that manage filtering states, indexing for memory reads/writes, and the process of multiplying and summing up the results. This sequence includes handling input samples, windowing them, employing polyphase matrix operations for filtering, and producing the subband samples\u2014all managed within synchronized stages marked by specific registers and flags indicating the status of various internal operations.",

                    "text": "Module name: filterbank. Module specification: The filterbank module in Verilog is designed for digital signal processing, specifically implementing a polyphase filter bank that processes single input signal samples to produce subband samples. The module utilizes a clock input (`clk`) for timing sync, a reset signal (`rst`) to initialize its internal state, a signed 16-bit `sample` signal for the input signal, and a `sample_valid` to know when a new sample is available. The outputs include a signed 32-bit `subband_sample` portraying the processed subband sample, `subband_sample_valid` to indicate the readiness of the output, a 5-bit `granule_idx` indicating the processing sequence, a signed 16-bit `windowed_sample_output` showing interim windowed samples, and `wso_valid` flagging the readiness of the windowed output. Internally, the module employs arrays for storing samples, filter coefficients, and matrix coefficients. Signals such as `sample_block_offset`, `sample_idx`, `read_sample_offset`, and various pipeline registers (`filtering_r1` to `filtering_r5`, etc.) control and hold data during processing stages. The code includes memory initialization for coefficients using specified functions and memory files, as well as detailed logic in sequenced always blocks that manage filtering states, indexing for memory reads/writes, and the process of multiplying and summing up the results. This sequence includes handling input samples, windowing them, employing polyphase matrix operations for filtering, and producing the subband samples\u2014all managed within synchronized stages marked by specific registers and flags indicating the status of various internal operations."
