Module-level comment: The `dct_t2` module performs Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) on four 16-bit input samples using fixed-point arithmetic for signal compression applications. It operates on a clock signal, sequentially processing each sample and employing functions like `dct_coef` for coefficient calculation and `RealToFixed` for real-to-fixed conversion, outputting the transformed samples after consecutive clock cycles. Internal multi-cycle MAC registers accumulate transformation results ensuring pipeline efficiency.
