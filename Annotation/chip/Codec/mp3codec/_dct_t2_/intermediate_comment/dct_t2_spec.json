    "spec": "Module name: dct_t2. Module specification: The `dct_t2` module is designed for performing a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) on four signed 16-bit input samples, namely `sample0`, `sample1`, `sample2`, and `sample3`, using the pipeline processing method driven by a clock signal (`clk`). The processed outputs are obtained as four signed 16-bit values `out_sample0`, `out_sample1`, `out_sample2`, `out_sample3`, representing the DCT transformed results. The module employs various internal signals such as a real constant `PI` for mathematical calculations, a `dct_coef` function to compute DCT coefficients, and registers like `mac_sample0`, `mac_sample1`, `mac_sample2`, and `mac_sample3` for storing intermediate Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) results during transformation. The `RealToFixed` function is used to convert calculated real-valued coefficients into fixed-point representation for hardware compatibility. The module\u2019s operation is sequenced by an index `idx_n` which guides the processing of samples in a sequential manner in response to clock cycles, ensuring that outputs are calculated once every four cycles. The code is clearly divided into sections including assignment of input samples to an array `sample_group`, initialization and iterative accumulation of MAC results to compute the final output samples based on the DCT coefficients, which are handled effectively within the clock-driven always block. This organization supports efficient synthesis and implementation in digital signal processing hardware targeted for applications such as data compression.",
