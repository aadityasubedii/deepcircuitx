It processes these samples in a pipelined fashion, computing the DCT coefficients using the cosine function and fixed point arithmetic. The transformed samples are then output sequentially. The DCT is used in various signal processing applications, typically for data compression. This implementation utilizes a real-to-fixed point conversion function and handles sample indices and computation stages through a sequential process driven by a clock signal (`clk`)."
