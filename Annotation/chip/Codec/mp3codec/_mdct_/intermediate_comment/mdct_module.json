    "module": "Module-level comment: The `mdct` module implements the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) for audio subband samples processing. It utilizes an input buffer `mdct_input_buffer` and a coefficient array `mdct_coef` initialized from external files. Samples are processed in a synchronized manner within a clock-driven loop, using indexing and MAC operations. Outputs are produced as 16-bit windowed sample data, flagged valid when transformation is complete, supporting audio data compression workflows."
