    "spec": "Module name: mdct. Module specification: The `mdct` module processes audio subband samples using the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) algorithm, crucial in audio compression techniques. The module operates on a 32-bit input `subband_sample` when the `subband_sample_valid` is high and uses the `subband_idx` to manage these samples into an input buffer. The audio samples undergo a transformation which results in 16-bit outputs through the `windowed_sample_output` port, flagged valid by `wso_valid` when data is ready for downstream processing. Internally, the module uses `granule_idx` to track the index of granules being processed, managing data arrangement within `mdct_input_buffer`. The array `mdct_coef` holds the transformation coefficients read initially from \"mdct_coef.mem\". Computational control is achieved through registers like `granule_work_idx`, `eighteen_counter`, `idx`, and `kdx`, orchestrating the sequential stepping through transformation processing. Memory buffers include the usage of `mdct_input_buffer` for incoming samples and `mdct_coef` for coefficients. The module initiates computations in a multiply-accumulate (MAC) style within a clock-controlled process block, ensuring synchronized transformations of sampled audio data into the frequency domain, necessary for subsequent audio data compression or processing.",

It receives a stream of subband samples (with identifiers), stores them in an input buffer, and then performs MDCT using predefined coefficients read from memory. The module operates synchronously with a clock signal and handles indices and counters to manage the flow of data through the transformation process. Granule indices are used to organize the data, and MDCT coefficients are applied in a multiply-accumulate fashion across the set of data samples to produce the transformed output. The result is provided as a windowed sample output when valid. This module is typically used in audio processing to convert data from the time domain to the frequency domain, which is a crucial step in many audio compression techniques."

Each sample is a 32-bit signed integer representing one piece of processed audio data.\n- `subband_sample_valid`: A boolean flag that indicates whether the subband sample data being fed into the module is valid and should be processed.\n- `subband_idx`: An index accompanying each subband sample that specifies the position or identifier of the sample within a larger set or sequence of subband data.\n\nOutput ports: windowed_sample_output, wso_valid.\nExplanation: \n- `windowed_sample_output`: This is the output data port where the result of the MDCT (Modified Discrete Cosine Transform) process is sent.
