Module name: mdct. Module specification: The `mdct` module processes audio subband samples using the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) algorithm, crucial in audio compression techniques. The module operates on a 32-bit input `subband_sample` when the `subband_sample_valid` is high and uses the `subband_idx` to manage these samples into an input buffer. The audio samples undergo a transformation which results in 16-bit outputs through the `windowed_sample_output` port, flagged valid by `wso_valid` when data is ready for downstream processing. Internally, the module uses `granule_idx` to track the index of granules being processed, managing data arrangement within `mdct_input_buffer`. The array `mdct_coef` holds the transformation coefficients read initially from "mdct_coef.mem". Computational control is achieved through registers like `granule_work_idx`, `eighteen_counter`, `idx`, and `kdx`, orchestrating the sequential stepping through transformation processing. Memory buffers include the usage of `mdct_input_buffer` for incoming samples and `mdct_coef` for coefficients. The module initiates computations in a multiply-accumulate (MAC) style within a clock-controlled process block, ensuring synchronized transformations of sampled audio data into the frequency domain, necessary for subsequent audio data compression or processing.
