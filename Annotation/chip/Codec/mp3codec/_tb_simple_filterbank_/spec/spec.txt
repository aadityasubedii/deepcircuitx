Module name: tb_simple_filterbank. 

Module specification: tb_simple_filterbank is a testbench designed for verifying the functionality of a 'simple_filterbank' system that processes digital signals. This module includes input ports such as `clk` (a clock signal to synchronize the entire testbench's operations), `rst` (a reset signal to initialize the system), `sample` (a digital sample signal input to be processed), and `sample_valid` (a signal indicating the validity of the input sample). The output ports are `wso` (the processed signal output from the filterbank) and `wso_valid` (indicating the validity of the filterbank's output). Internally, the module uses signals like `valid_coef` (modified filter coefficients for validation), `filter_coef` (array holding filtering coefficients read from `filter_coef.mem`), `divider` (a counter to manage the rate of generating `sample_valid` signals), and `idx` (an index used in loops for validation processes). The code has several blocks: initialization and setup of simulation, reading filter coefficients from memory, instantiation of the `simple_filterbank` under test (DUT), signal generation and control via `divider`, and validation logic where the output `wso` is compared with the expected `valid_coef` to confirm correct filtering behavior. This ensures that the simple_filterbank performs as expected when processing signal inputs according to specified parameters and conditions.
