Module-level comment: The tb_simple_filterbank is a testbench to verify the simple_filterbank system, simulating DSP operations on sample signals. It utilizes internal signals like valid_coef and a divider-driven sample_valid generation with the filter_coef array for output validation. Key components include the clock generation, loading filter coefficients, DUT instantiation, and output verification against expected results, ensuring the filterbank's accurate signal processing.
