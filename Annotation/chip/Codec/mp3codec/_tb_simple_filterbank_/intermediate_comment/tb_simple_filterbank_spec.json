    "spec": "Module name: tb_simple_filterbank. \n\nModule specification: tb_simple_filterbank is a testbench designed for verifying the functionality of a 'simple_filterbank' system that processes digital signals. This module includes input ports such as `clk` (a clock signal to synchronize the entire testbench's operations), `rst` (a reset signal to initialize the system), `sample` (a digital sample signal input to be processed), and `sample_valid` (a signal indicating the validity of the input sample). The output ports are `wso` (the processed signal output from the filterbank) and `wso_valid` (indicating the validity of the filterbank's output). Internally, the module uses signals like `valid_coef` (modified filter coefficients for validation), `filter_coef` (array holding filtering coefficients read from `filter_coef.mem`), `divider` (a counter to manage the rate of generating `sample_valid` signals), and `idx` (an index used in loops for validation processes). The code has several blocks: initialization and setup of simulation, reading filter coefficients from memory, instantiation of the `simple_filterbank` under test (DUT), signal generation and control via `divider`, and validation logic where the output `wso` is compared with the expected `valid_coef` to confirm correct filtering behavior. This ensures that the simple_filterbank performs as expected when processing signal inputs according to specified parameters and conditions.",

It simulates the digital signal processing where an input signal 'sample' is processed by the filterbank system. The testbench generates a clock signal and a reset, controls the input signal and its validity status, and checks the output from the filterbank against expected results loaded from a memory file `filter_coef.mem`. The main functionality includes driving the input signals (sample and sample_valid) based on a divider which controls the sampling rate, capturing and validating the output of the filterbank system (wso and wso_valid) against predefined filter coefficients, thus verifying the correct behavior of the simple_filterbank under test conditions defined in the testbench."
