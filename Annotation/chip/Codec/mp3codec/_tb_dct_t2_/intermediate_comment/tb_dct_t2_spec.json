Key internal signals in the testbench include `idx` used for looping indices during input initialization and simulation control. The testbench uses distinct code blocks\u2014initialization of tracing tools through `$dumpfile` and `$dumpvars`, instantiation of the `dct_t2` module with proper signal connections, input sample initialization in a loop, and a simulation clock cycle loop followed by a simulation termination.
