This testbench initializes and simulates input samples to `dct_t2` and captures the output results. It includes a clock signal that toggles every 20 time units to drive the timing of the operations. The input samples are systematically assigned values in a loop, and the system is simulated for several clock cycles before finishing the simulation. The testbench also uses `$dumpfile` and `$dumpvars` commands to enable waveforms tracing for debugging and visualization purposes."

The clock signal toggles every 20 units of time, driving the sequential logic within the module.\n- `reset`: This input is used to reset the state of the module `dct_t2` to a known state, although it's unused in the provided code and typically aids in initializing or restarting the module logic.\n- `samples[0:3]`: These are the input data samples provided to the module `dct_t2`. The testbench assigns a specific pattern of values to these samples, which are then processed by `dct_t2`.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `results[0:3]`: Array of output sample signals.\n\nExplanation:\n- `results[0:3]`: These are the output data samples that `dct_t2` generates after processing the input samples.
