Module-level comment: The `tb_dct_t2` is a testbench for verifying the `dct_t2` module which processes discrete cosine transforms. It sets up input samples, simulates clock cycles for operation synchronizing, and captures outputs. The test employs internal looping for initializing signals and toggling the clock, alongside an instantiation of `dct_t2` to connect and test its input/output signal processing. Outputs are verified against expected DCT outcomes using waveform dumps for debugging.
