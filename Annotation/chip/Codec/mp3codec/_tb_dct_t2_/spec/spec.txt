Module name: tb_dct_t2. 

Module specification: The `tb_dct_t2` is a testbench module designed to verify the functionality of a `dct_t2` module that processes discrete cosine transforms. This testbench initializes and simulates input samples to `dct_t2` and captures the output results through the interaction of internal signals and blocks. Input ports include: `clk`, the clock signal that toggles every 20 time units to synchronize operations; and `reset`, which, although included, is not utilized in the current test logic. There are also four input sample signals `samples[0:3]` and output sample signals `results[0:3]` that capture the transformed results from `dct_t2`. Key internal signals in the testbench include `idx` used for looping indices during input initialization and simulation control. The testbench uses distinct code blocksâ€”initialization of tracing tools through `$dumpfile` and `$dumpvars`, instantiation of the `dct_t2` module with proper signal connections, input sample initialization in a loop, and a simulation clock cycle loop followed by a simulation termination. This structured execution allows for rigorous testing and validation of the discrete cosine transform implementation in `dct_t2`, ensuring its correct operation and output.
