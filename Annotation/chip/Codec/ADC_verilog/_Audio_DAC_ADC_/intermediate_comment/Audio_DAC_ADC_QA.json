It specifically handles the generation of the bit clock (BCK), left-right clock (LRCK), and data signals required for audio data transmission. The module operates by generating a clock signal for synchronization (BCK), toggling between left and right audio channels using LRCK, and processing incoming ADC data based on these clock edges. Moreover, it supports output of audio data to a DAC. The control and operation of the module depend on an external 18.4 MHz clock and a reset signal."

It is used within the module to capture audio samples that can later be processed or routed.\n- iCLK_18_4: This is the input clock signal with a frequency of 18.4 MHz. It serves as the primary clock reference for timing the generation of bit clock (BCK) and left-right clock (LRCK) signals essential for synchronizing the DAC and ADC operations.\n- iRST_N: This input is the active-low reset signal. It initializes internal registers and counters to their default states, ensuring that the module starts operation in a known state upon reset.\n\nOutput ports: oAUD_BCK, oAUD_DATA, oAUD_LRCK.\nExplanation:\n- oAUD_BCK: Output bit clock signal used to drive the clocking requirements of the DAC and ADC. It is critical for defining the time slots in which audio data bits are valid and should be read or written.\n- oAUD_LRCK: Output left-right clock signal that toggles between low and high to indicate the current channel (left or right) being accessed or transmitted. This clock is essential for multiplexing the dual-channel audio streams in stereo audio systems.\n- oAUD_DATA: This output port carries the digital audio data to an external DAC. Depending on the state of oAUD_LRCK, this port will output audio data for either the left or right audio channel."

It determines when to toggle the BCK signal to synchronize with the data rate required by the DAC and ADC.\n- LRCK_1X_DIV, LRCK_2X_DIV, LRCK_4X_DIV: These dividers assist in generating the left-right clock (LRCK) at various multipliers of the base frequency needed for proper channel toggling and synchronization between left and right audio streams.\n- LRCK_1X, LRCK_2X, LRCK_4X: These are actual signals generated from the respective dividers to produce differing frequencies of LRCK, which toggle to indicate which audio channel (left or right) should be active.\n- SEL_Cont: This is a selection counter used in the data transmission logic to select and route individual bits of audio data to and from the ADC. It helps in reading the bit-wise audio data from the ADC and arranging it correctly for internal processing or output.\n- AUD_outL, AUD_outR: These registers hold the processed digital audio data for the left and right channels respectively which are to be sent out to the DAC.\n- AUD_inL, AUD_inR: These registers capture and store incoming audio data for the left and right channels respectively from the ADC.\n- bit_in: This wire is meant to capture and possibly manipulate bits of incoming audio data.
