    "spec": "Module name: AUDIO_DAC_ADC. \n\nModule specification: The AUDIO_DAC_ADC module interfaces with both a DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) and an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) to handle audio signals. The module generates necessary clock signals including the bit clock (BCK) and left-right clock (LRCK), and manages audio data signals for transmission. It inputs digital audio data via the iAUD_ADCDAT port and operates synchronized by an 18.4 MHz external clock signal from iCLK_18_4, with operations initiated or reset using the active-low iRST_N signal. The outputs include oAUD_BCK (bit clock), oAUD_LRCK (left-right clock), and oAUD_DATA (digital audio data) that drive the DAC and ADC according to the received audio data. Internally, the module uses registers like BCK_DIV, LRCK_1X_DIV, and LRCK_2X_DIV to manage and divide clock frequencies for proper synchronization and data handling. The module also includes additional logic for channel selection management using SEL_Cont and for switching output signals based on the LRCK status, which defines the active audio channel. The code broadly segments into initialization blocks handling reset conditions, clock division blocks for generating BCK and LRCK signals, and data routing blocks that specify how audio bits are processed and routed according to the synchronization clocks. Each section of the code contributes to handling specific tasks required for audio data conversion and transfer, ensuring synchronous operation across audio channels and between external ADC/DAC components with the FPGA.",

It specifically handles the generation of the bit clock (BCK), left-right clock (LRCK), and data signals required for audio data transmission. The module operates by generating a clock signal for synchronization (BCK), toggling between left and right audio channels using LRCK, and processing incoming ADC data based on these clock edges.

It is used within the module to capture audio samples that can later be processed or routed.\n- iCLK_18_4: This is the input clock signal with a frequency of 18.4 MHz. It serves as the primary clock reference for timing the generation of bit clock (BCK) and left-right clock (LRCK) signals essential for synchronizing the DAC and ADC operations.\n- iRST_N: This input is the active-low reset signal. It initializes internal registers and counters to their default states, ensuring that the module starts operation in a known state upon reset.\n\nOutput ports: oAUD_BCK, oAUD_DATA, oAUD_LRCK.\nExplanation:\n- oAUD_BCK: Output bit clock signal used to drive the clocking requirements of the DAC and ADC. It is critical for defining the time slots in which audio data bits are valid and should be read or written.\n- oAUD_LRCK: Output left-right clock signal that toggles between low and high to indicate the current channel (left or right) being accessed or transmitted. This clock is essential for multiplexing the dual-channel audio streams in stereo audio systems.\n- oAUD_DATA: This output port carries the digital audio data to an external DAC. Depending on the state of oAUD_LRCK, this port will output audio data for either the left or right audio channel."
