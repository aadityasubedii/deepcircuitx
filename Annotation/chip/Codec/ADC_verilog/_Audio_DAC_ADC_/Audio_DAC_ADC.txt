Module-level comment: The AUDIO_DAC_ADC module interfaces with external DAC and ADC for audio data handling. It generates synchronized bit (BCK) and left-right (LRCK) clocks using an 18.4 MHz input clock and manages audio data flows by toggling channels and processing data bit-wise. Resets initialize the system, while clock dividers and selectors help manage timing and data routing. Outputs are configured dynamically based on channel and clock states, ensuring proper synchronization for audio conversion and transmission.
