Module name: AUDIO_DAC_ADC. 

Module specification: The AUDIO_DAC_ADC module interfaces with both a DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) and an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) to handle audio signals. The module generates necessary clock signals including the bit clock (BCK) and left-right clock (LRCK), and manages audio data signals for transmission. It inputs digital audio data via the iAUD_ADCDAT port and operates synchronized by an 18.4 MHz external clock signal from iCLK_18_4, with operations initiated or reset using the active-low iRST_N signal. The outputs include oAUD_BCK (bit clock), oAUD_LRCK (left-right clock), and oAUD_DATA (digital audio data) that drive the DAC and ADC according to the received audio data. Internally, the module uses registers like BCK_DIV, LRCK_1X_DIV, and LRCK_2X_DIV to manage and divide clock frequencies for proper synchronization and data handling. The module also includes additional logic for channel selection management using SEL_Cont and for switching output signals based on the LRCK status, which defines the active audio channel. The code broadly segments into initialization blocks handling reset conditions, clock division blocks for generating BCK and LRCK signals, and data routing blocks that specify how audio bits are processed and routed according to the synchronization clocks. Each section of the code contributes to handling specific tasks required for audio data conversion and transfer, ensuring synchronous operation across audio channels and between external ADC/DAC components with the FPGA.
