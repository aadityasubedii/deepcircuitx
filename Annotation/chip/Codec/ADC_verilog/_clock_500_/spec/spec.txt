Module name: CLOCK_500. Module specification: The CLOCK_500 module is designed to generate frequency-divided clock signals, manage data fetched from a ROM, and provide operational status based on internal counters and ROM data. The module has three inputs: CLOCK, which is the main clock signal driving the counters and timing functions; END, which controls ROM data fetching and also affects the address pointer; and RESET, which reinitializes the internal counters and address register. The outputs include CLOCK_500 and CLOCK_2, which are frequency-divided clock signals derived from specific bits of the COUNTER_500 register; DATA, a 24-bit output combining a constant value with data fetched from ROM through DATA_A; and GO, signifying operational status based on ROM address comparisons and the END input. Internally, the module utilizes the COUNTER_500 register as a main counter for clock outputs, a ROM array storing data used for the DATA output, the DATA_A register holding ROM data, and an address counter pointing to the current ROM data position. The code blocks include initialization and reset sequences for addresses and counters, ROM data loading during a positive edge of the END signal, and updates to the COUNTER_500 register on the CLOCK signal’s positive edge or RESET’s negative edge. Through these blocks, the module effectively manages timing, data fetching, and operational signals based on the given inputs and internal conditions.
