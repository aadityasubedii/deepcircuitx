    "module": "Module-level comment: The CLOCK_500 module generates frequency-divided clock signals (CLOCK_500, CLOCK_2) and manages data output (DATA) based on ROM contents. Inputs include CLOCK, END, and RESET. It utilizes internal counters and a ROM for data storage, adjusting outputs in response to CLOCK and END signals, while RESET controls initialization and state. Outputs are derived from counters, current ROM data, and operational status logic, facilitating versatile timing and data management in digital systems."
