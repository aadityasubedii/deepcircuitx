The module uses input signals such as CLOCK, RESET, and END to control the generation of output signals including CLOCK_500, CLOCK_2, DATA, and GO. The outputs are driven by the COUNTER_500 register which is incremented on every positive edge of the CLOCK or reset when RESET is driven low. The CLOCK_500 and CLOCK_2 outputs are specific bits of COUNTER_500, which likely serve as divided down clock signals. The DATA output is formed by concatenating a constant value and DATA_A, where DATA_A is derived from a ROM lookup using an address incremented upon END. The GO signal logic includes a condition based on the current address and the END signal. This module seems to be engaged in timing and data management tasks using a combination of ROM-stored values and dynamically controlled counters."

It can also influence the starting process of certain ROM data operations.\n- **RESET**: This input is used to reset the internal counters and address pointers to their initial states, essentially reinitializing the module's operation.\n\nOutput ports: CLOCK_500, DATA, GO, CLOCK_2.\nExplanation:\n- **CLOCK_500**: An output clock signal which is derived from a specific bit (bit 9) of the internal counter COUNTER_500. It acts as a frequency-divided version of the primary CLOCK input.\n- **DATA**: A 24-bit output data signal comprising a fixed 8-bit prefix and a 16-bit value from an internal ROM addressed by the current address. This output can be used to transmit data based on ROM content.\n- **GO**: This output signal indicates an operational status based on the current address relative to the ROM size and the END signal status. It helps in controlling the flow of operations within or outside the module.\n- **CLOCK_2**: Another output clock signal generated from a different bit (bit 1) of the internal counter COUNTER_500, serving as another frequency-divided clock variant.

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: COUNTER_500, ROM, DATA_A, address.\n\nExplanation:\n- **COUNTER_500**: This is an 11-bit register used primarily as a counter for generating the CLOCK_500 and CLOCK_2 signals. On every positive edge of the main CLOCK or a negative edge of RESET, this counter increments or resets to zero respectively. Specific bits of this counter (bit 9 for CLOCK_500 and bit 1 for CLOCK_2) are used to produce output clock signals at different divisions of the main clock frequency.\n\n- **ROM**: This is an array (size of 9, from 0 to 8) of 16-bit registers defined using the parameter `rom_size`. It is used for storing predefined data, which is loaded into ROM on the positive edge of the END signal. This stored data can later be output on the DATA line based on the current ROM address pointed to by the 'address' register.\n\n- **DATA_A**: This is a 16-bit register used to temporarily hold data fetched from ROM. The data held in DATA_A is then combined with a constant (8'h34) to form the 24-bit DATA output that is sent out of the module.\n\n- **address**: This is a 6-bit counter used to point to current data positions within the ROM. The content of 'address' is incremented upon encountering the positive edge of the END signal if the address has not exceeded the defined ROM size. This address register is also reset to 0 upon a negative edge of RESET. The value in this register decides which content from the ROM is fetched into DATA_A. Additionally, it plays a part in determining the state of the GO output signal based on its comparison with `rom_size`."
