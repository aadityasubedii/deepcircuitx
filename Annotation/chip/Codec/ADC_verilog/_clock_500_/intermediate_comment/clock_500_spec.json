    "spec": "Module name: CLOCK_500. Module specification: The CLOCK_500 module is designed to generate frequency-divided clock signals, manage data fetched from a ROM, and provide operational status based on internal counters and ROM data. The module has three inputs: CLOCK, which is the main clock signal driving the counters and timing functions; END, which controls ROM data fetching and also affects the address pointer; and RESET, which reinitializes the internal counters and address register. The outputs include CLOCK_500 and CLOCK_2, which are frequency-divided clock signals derived from specific bits of the COUNTER_500 register; DATA, a 24-bit output combining a constant value with data fetched from ROM through DATA_A; and GO, signifying operational status based on ROM address comparisons and the END input. Internally, the module utilizes the COUNTER_500 register as a main counter for clock outputs, a ROM array storing data used for the DATA output, the DATA_A register holding ROM data, and an address counter pointing to the current ROM data position. The code blocks include initialization and reset sequences for addresses and counters, ROM data loading during a positive edge of the END signal, and updates to the COUNTER_500 register on the CLOCK signal\u2019s positive edge or RESET\u2019s negative edge. Through these blocks, the module effectively manages timing, data fetching, and operational signals based on the given inputs and internal conditions.",

The module uses input signals such as CLOCK, RESET, and END to control the generation of output signals including CLOCK_500, CLOCK_2, DATA, and GO. The outputs are driven by the COUNTER_500 register which is incremented on every positive edge of the CLOCK or reset when RESET is driven low. The CLOCK_500 and CLOCK_2 outputs are specific bits of COUNTER_500, which likely serve as divided down clock signals. The DATA output is formed by concatenating a constant value and DATA_A, where DATA_A is derived from a ROM lookup using an address incremented upon END. The GO signal logic includes a condition based on the current address and the END signal. This module seems to be engaged in timing and data management tasks using a combination of ROM-stored values and dynamically controlled counters."

It can also influence the starting process of certain ROM data operations.\n- **RESET**: This input is used to reset the internal counters and address pointers to their initial states, essentially reinitializing the module's operation.\n\nOutput ports: CLOCK_500, DATA, GO, CLOCK_2.\nExplanation:\n- **CLOCK_500**: An output clock signal which is derived from a specific bit (bit 9) of the internal counter COUNTER_500. It acts as a frequency-divided version of the primary CLOCK input.\n- **DATA**: A 24-bit output data signal comprising a fixed 8-bit prefix and a 16-bit value from an internal ROM addressed by the current address. This output can be used to transmit data based on ROM content.\n- **GO**: This output signal indicates an operational status based on the current address relative to the ROM size and the END signal status. It helps in controlling the flow of operations within or outside the module.\n- **CLOCK_2**: Another output clock signal generated from a different bit (bit 1) of the internal counter COUNTER_500, serving as another frequency-divided clock variant.

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: COUNTER_500, ROM, DATA_A, address.\n\nExplanation:\n- **COUNTER_500**: This is an 11-bit register used primarily as a counter for generating the CLOCK_500 and CLOCK_2 signals. On every positive edge of the main CLOCK or a negative edge of RESET, this counter increments or resets to zero respectively. Specific bits of this counter (bit 9 for CLOCK_500 and bit 1 for CLOCK_2) are used to produce output clock signals at different divisions of the main clock frequency.\n\n- **ROM**: This is an array (size of 9, from 0 to 8) of 16-bit registers defined using the parameter `rom_size`. It is used for storing predefined data, which is loaded into ROM on the positive edge of the END signal. This stored data can later be output on the DATA line based on the current ROM address pointed to by the 'address' register.\n\n- **DATA_A**: This is a 16-bit register used to temporarily hold data fetched from ROM. The data held in DATA_A is then combined with a constant (8'h34) to form the 24-bit DATA output that is sent out of the module.\n\n- **address**: This is a 6-bit counter used to point to current data positions within the ROM. The content of 'address' is incremented upon encountering the positive edge of the END signal if the address has not exceeded the defined ROM size. This address register is also reset to 0 upon a negative edge of RESET. The value in this register decides which content from the ROM is fetched into DATA_A. Additionally, it plays a part in determining the state of the GO output signal based on its comparison with `rom_size`."
