    "module": "Module-level comment: The i2c module serves as an I2C controller, handling data serialization and communication timing over the I2C protocol. It manipulates the I2C clock and data lines while managing transaction phases through a state machine and internal signals, including SDO and SD_COUNTER. The module orchestrates bit-wise transmission according to I2C standards, controls acknowledgments, and manages start and reset conditions efficiently."
