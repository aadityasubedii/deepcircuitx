Module name: i2c.
Module specification: The i2c module emulates the functionality of an I2C controller in a Verilog environment, specifically handling the serialization of data and control of communication timing over the I2C protocol. It takes in a primary CLOCK signal, a 24-bit input data (I2C_DATA) for transmission, a GO signal to initiate the transmission process, a RESET to restore initial states, and a W_R signal likely intended for direction control in a full implementation. The module outputs include the I2C serial clock (I2C_SCLK) and data line (I2C_SDAT), as well as signals indicating the end of transmission (END), acknowledgment (ACK), and the state machine count (SD_COUNTER). Internally, the module defines several registers such as SDO (Serial Data Out) that holds the data bits being transmitted, a counter SD_COUNTER that manages the sequence of operations, and SCLK which governs the I2C clock signal output. Additionally, acknowledgment signals (ACK1, ACK2, ACK3) are captured at various stages of the data transfer. Control flow is managed by a state machine in two always blocks, one for setting initial states on a reset or incrementing the SD_COUNTER based on the clock, and another for managing transitions across the various stages of transmitting bits and handling acknowledgments. This structured approach enables efficient data handling and synchronous operations conforming to I2C protocol specifics such as clock stretching and data acknowledgment. The configuration of state-specific tasks ensures seamless bit handling and output control throughout the data transmission cycle.
