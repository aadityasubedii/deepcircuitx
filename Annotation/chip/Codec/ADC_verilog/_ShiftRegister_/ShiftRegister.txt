Module-level comment: The ShiftRegister module shifts a 16-bit output ('data_out') left each clock cycle, inserting a bit from 'data_in' into the least significant bit. On reset (active low), 'data_out' is cleared to 0. This functionality is implemented within a single always block triggered by the positive edge of 'clock' or the negative edge of 'reset', ensuring compact and efficient operation.
