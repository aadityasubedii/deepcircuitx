    "spec": "Module name: ShiftRegister. Module specification: The ShiftRegister is a Verilog module designed to perform bit shifting operations controlled by a clock and a reset signal. It features three input ports: 'clock', which is the clock signal driving the shift timing of the module; 'reset', an active-low reset signal that clears the output 'data_out' to zero when asserted; and 'data_in', representing the incoming bit to be shifted into the data register. The module provides one output port, 'data_out', a 16-bit register that holds the shifted data, which is shifted left by one position at every positive edge of the clock, inserting 'data_in' into the least significant bit position. If 'reset' is activated, 'data_out' is reset to 0. Internally, the module does not define any additional signals but directly manipulates 'data_out' using an always block sensitive to the clock's positive edge and the reset's negative edge. The always block contains two operations: resetting 'data_out' to 0 on a negative edge of 'reset' and performing the shift operation on a positive edge of 'clock'. The efficient use of the given signals within the always block allows the module to operate with minimal signal overhead, focusing purely on its main functionality of data shifting and resetting.",
