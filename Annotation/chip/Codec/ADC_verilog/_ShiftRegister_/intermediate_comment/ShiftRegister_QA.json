It features an input 'data_in' and provides a shifted output 'data_out', where 'data_out' is shifted left every positive edge of the clock signal, inserting 'data_in' into the least significant bit. If the reset signal is active (low in this case), the output 'data_out' is reset to 0. The size of 'data_out' is controlled by the parameter 'data_size', which is set to 16 bits in this instance."

When it is active (low), it causes the output register ('data_out') to be reset to 0.\n- **data_in**: This is the data input signal. Its value is fed into the least significant bit of 'data_out' during each shift operation.\n\nOutput ports: data_out.  \nExplanation:  \n- **data_out**: This is the output port that holds the shifted data. It is a register of width 'data_size' (16 bits by default). With each positive clock edge, the contents of 'data_out' are shifted left by one bit position, with the most significant bit dropped and replaced by the incoming 'data_in' at the least significant bit position.

Explanation: In the provided ShiftRegister module, there are no explicitly defined internal signals such as internal wires or additional registers within the always block or elsewhere. The only signals used are the inputs (*clock*, *reset*, *data_in*) and the output (*data_out*). The shifting and resetting operations are handled directly using these signals. The `data_out` output is manipulated directly in response to `clock` and `reset` signals, which dictates its behavior as described. This minimalism in signal usage helps in keeping the module straightforward and focused strictly on its primary functionality of shifting and resetting data."
