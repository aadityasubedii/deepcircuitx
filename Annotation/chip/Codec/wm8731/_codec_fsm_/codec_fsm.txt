Module-level comment: The `codec_fsm` module is a finite state machine for encoding and decoding digital audio signals using DAC and ADC. It manages audio data based on an external clock and readies signals for external use. Internally, it uses registers for buffering audio, counters for clock management, and state controls via FSM logic to serialize/deserialize data efficiently. Outputs include processed audio, validity signals, and various synchronized clocks to facilitate interfacing with external audio components.
