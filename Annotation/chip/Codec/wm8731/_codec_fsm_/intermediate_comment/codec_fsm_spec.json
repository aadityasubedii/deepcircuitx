    "spec": "Module name: codec_fsm. \nModule specification: The `codec_fsm` module is a finite state machine designed to manage the encoding and decoding of digital audio signals. It functions with an input external clock (`xclk_i`) and processes right and left channel audio signals through Digital-to-Analog and Analog-to-Digital Converters (DAC and ADC). The module's main outputs are the processed audio signals `right_o` and `left_o`, a validity signal `ready_o`, and several clock outputs (`xck_o`, `bclk_o`, `daclrck_o`, `adclrck_o`) controlling the timing for audio data handling, along with a serial digital output `dacdat_o`. Internal signals include `FSM_STATE` to control the state machine, `dac_right` and `dac_left` for buffering audio signals for DAC, `adc_right` and `adc_left` for buffering incoming ADC data, various counters for bit and clock management (`bclk_counter`, `lrck_counter`, `bits_counter`), and control signals (`lrck`, `bclk`, `valid_out`, `done`) for managing state transitions and data validation. The Verilog implementation consists of a primary sequential block triggered on the rising edge of `xclk_i`, handling state transitions, data processing, and clock management, alongside a series of assignments for output port connections reflecting the instantaneous state of internal computations. This structure efficiently orchestrates the synchronization of digital audio signal processing and component interfacing, ensuring seamless operation in digital audio applications.",

It operates based on input clock signals (`xclk_i`) and handles both DAC (digital-to-analog converter) and ADC (analog-to-digital converter) functionalities for handling audio data.

                    "text": "Module name: codec_fsm. \nModule specification: The `codec_fsm` module is a finite state machine designed to manage the encoding and decoding of digital audio signals. It functions with an input external clock (`xclk_i`) and processes right and left channel audio signals through Digital-to-Analog and Analog-to-Digital Converters (DAC and ADC). The module's main outputs are the processed audio signals `right_o` and `left_o`, a validity signal `ready_o`, and several clock outputs (`xck_o`, `bclk_o`, `daclrck_o`, `adclrck_o`) controlling the timing for audio data handling, along with a serial digital output `dacdat_o`. Internal signals include `FSM_STATE` to control the state machine, `dac_right` and `dac_left` for buffering audio signals for DAC, `adc_right` and `adc_left` for buffering incoming ADC data, various counters for bit and clock management (`bclk_counter`, `lrck_counter`, `bits_counter`), and control signals (`lrck`, `bclk`, `valid_out`, `done`) for managing state transitions and data validation. The Verilog implementation consists of a primary sequential block triggered on the rising edge of `xclk_i`, handling state transitions, data processing, and clock management, alongside a series of assignments for output port connections reflecting the instantaneous state of internal computations. This structure efficiently orchestrates the synchronization of digital audio signal processing and component interfacing, ensuring seamless operation in digital audio applications."
