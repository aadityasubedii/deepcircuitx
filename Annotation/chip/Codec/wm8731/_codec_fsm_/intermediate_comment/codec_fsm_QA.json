It operates based on input clock signals (`xclk_i`) and handles both DAC (digital-to-analog converter) and ADC (analog-to-digital converter) functionalities for handling audio data. Parameters allow configuration for oversampling rate, data width, and number of channels. The module uses separate FSM states to manage the bit clock (`bclk`) and the left-right clock (`lrck`) for properly sequencing audio data through DAC and ADC operations. The module outputs the processed right and left audio signals (as `right_o` and `left_o`), a readiness signal (`ready_o`), and also generates the necessary clocks (`xck_o`, `bclk_o`, `daclrck_o`, `adclrck_o`) and DAC data output (`dacdat_o`) based on the audio processing."
