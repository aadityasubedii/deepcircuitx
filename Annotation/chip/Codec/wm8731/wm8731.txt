The wm8731 repository is designed to manage the processing of digital audio signals through a finite state machine approach, specifically handling both encoding and decoding functionalities. The key component, `codec_fsm`, is adept at maintaining audio data integrity based on an external clock while preparing and controlling the output for external utility. The module includes internal buffering systems using registers, clock management through counters, and a state control mechanism implemented via finite state machine logic. This setup ensures efficient serialization and deserialization of audio data, outputting processed audio, validity signals, and multiple synchronized clocks that are crucial for seamless interfacing with various external audio components.
