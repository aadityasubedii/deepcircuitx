Module name: hdb3_plug_b. 
Module specification: The 'hdb3_plug_b' module is designed to encode input data according to the High Density Bipolar 3 (HDB3) coding scheme, specifically managing the transformation of plug-V codes to plug-B codes, considering the parity conditions. It operates with three input ports: `i_rst_n`, the active-low reset signal that initializes internal states; `i_clk`, the clock signal for synchronizing operations; and `i_plug_v_code`, a 2-bit input representing different states of plug-V code which influences the output plug-B code generation. The module outputs through one port, `o_plug_b_code`, which is a 2-bit output delivering the computed plug-B code. Internally, the module utilizes several significant registers: `r_plug_b_code_h` and `r_plug_b_code_l`, both 5-bit registers storing higher and lower bits of the computed plug-B codes respectively; and `r_not_0_parity`, a parity indicator that affects code calculation based on the input plug-V code. The module comprises two primary always blocks: one handling the reset conditions and parity adjustments in response to the input plug-V code, and another managing the generation of plug-B code from plug-V code while updating the internal high and low bit registers (`r_plug_b_code_h`, `r_plug_b_code_l`) based on the parity state dictated by `r_not_0_parity`. This structured approach allows the 'hdb3_plug_b' module to effectively compute the necessary output codes synchronized with the given clock signal, ensuring functional and timing correctness in digital communication systems.
