Module-level comment: The 'hdb3_plug_b' module encodes input data using the HDB3 coding scheme, transforming plug-V codes into plug-B codes based on parity. It employs registers `r_plug_b_code_h` and `r_plug_b_code_l` for storing high and low B-code bits, respectively, and toggles `r_not_0_parity` for parity management. Actions are synchronized with the input clock and controlled by an active-low reset signal, ensuring correct timing and reset behavior.
