    "spec": "Module name: hdb3_plug_b. \nModule specification: The 'hdb3_plug_b' module is designed to encode input data according to the High Density Bipolar 3 (HDB3) coding scheme, specifically managing the transformation of plug-V codes to plug-B codes, considering the parity conditions. It operates with three input ports: `i_rst_n`, the active-low reset signal that initializes internal states; `i_clk`, the clock signal for synchronizing operations; and `i_plug_v_code`, a 2-bit input representing different states of plug-V code which influences the output plug-B code generation. The module outputs through one port, `o_plug_b_code`, which is a 2-bit output delivering the computed plug-B code. Internally, the module utilizes several significant registers: `r_plug_b_code_h` and `r_plug_b_code_l`, both 5-bit registers storing higher and lower bits of the computed plug-B codes respectively; and `r_not_0_parity`, a parity indicator that affects code calculation based on the input plug-V code. The module comprises two primary always blocks: one handling the reset conditions and parity adjustments in response to the input plug-V code, and another managing the generation of plug-B code from plug-V code while updating the internal high and low bit registers (`r_plug_b_code_h`, `r_plug_b_code_l`) based on the parity state dictated by `r_not_0_parity`. This structured approach allows the 'hdb3_plug_b' module to effectively compute the necessary output codes synchronized with the given clock signal, ensuring functional and timing correctness in digital communication systems.",

It takes in a reset signal (`i_rst_n`), a clock signal (`i_clk`), and a 2-bit input (`i_plug_v_code`) that represents different states of plug-V code. It outputs a 2-bit code (`o_plug_b_code`) representing the plug-B values. Internally, it maintains registers to keep track of plug-B higher (`r_plug_b_code_h`) and lower (`r_plug_b_code_l`) bits, manages a parity indication (`r_not_0_parity`) to reset or flip based on input condition, and shifts these values based on the input plug-V code and the parity state.

It is used to reset the internal state of the module to its initial condition when a reset condition is triggered (indicated by this input being low).\n- `i_clk`: This is the clock signal. It is used to synchronize the operations within the module, ensuring that internal state updates and outputs occur in lockstep with the overall timing of the digital system.\n- `i_plug_v_code`: This is a 2-bit input that represents different states of the plug-V code. The state of this code controls how the module computes the equivalent plug-B code output, depending on its value and the internal parity monitoring.\n\nOutput ports: `o_plug_b_code`.\nExplanation:\n- `o_plug_b_code`: This is a 2-bit output that provides the processed plug-B code, which results from interpreting the plug-V input code through specific encoding logic governed by this module.
