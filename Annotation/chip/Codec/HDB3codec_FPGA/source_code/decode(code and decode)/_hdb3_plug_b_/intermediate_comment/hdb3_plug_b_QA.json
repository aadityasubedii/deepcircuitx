It takes in a reset signal (`i_rst_n`), a clock signal (`i_clk`), and a 2-bit input (`i_plug_v_code`) that represents different states of plug-V code. It outputs a 2-bit code (`o_plug_b_code`) representing the plug-B values. Internally, it maintains registers to keep track of plug-B higher (`r_plug_b_code_h`) and lower (`r_plug_b_code_l`) bits, manages a parity indication (`r_not_0_parity`) to reset or flip based on input condition, and shifts these values based on the input plug-V code and the parity state. This module essentially translates provided V-codes into B-codes based on the parity and input codes."

It is used to reset the internal state of the module to its initial condition when a reset condition is triggered (indicated by this input being low).\n- `i_clk`: This is the clock signal. It is used to synchronize the operations within the module, ensuring that internal state updates and outputs occur in lockstep with the overall timing of the digital system.\n- `i_plug_v_code`: This is a 2-bit input that represents different states of the plug-V code. The state of this code controls how the module computes the equivalent plug-B code output, depending on its value and the internal parity monitoring.\n\nOutput ports: `o_plug_b_code`.\nExplanation:\n- `o_plug_b_code`: This is a 2-bit output that provides the processed plug-B code, which results from interpreting the plug-V input code through specific encoding logic governed by this module. This output is generated by selecting specific bits from internal registers that hold the history and manipulated values based on plug-V code and parity settings."

Its purpose is to store intermediate and final high bits of the plug-B code as they are computed based on the input V codes and parity checks.
