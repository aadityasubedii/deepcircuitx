Module name: hdb3_plug_v. Module specification: The hdb3_plug_v is a Verilog module designed to encode data using the High Density Bipolar 3 (HDB3) encoding scheme, primarily for processing a stream of binary data inputs. Its inputs consist of i_rst_n (an active low reset), i_clk (a clock signal), and i_data (binary data input), alongside a 2-bit vector output, o_plug_v_code. The output represents the HDB3-encoded data using two significant bits from internal registers storing high and low pulse codes. The internal signals include a redundant 2-bit register r_plug_v_code, as well as r_plug_v_code_h and r_plug_v_code_l, 4-bit registers which track high and low coding states respectively, and a 3-bit shift register, r_data_shift, which stores recent bits of input data to aid in pattern recognition necessary for HDB3 encoding. The module operates in two primary always blocks: The first handles reset conditions, initializing r_data_shift to an all-high state, while the second manages encoding logic, shifting data within both pulse code registers and modifying their states based on input data patterns, specifically identifying sequences requiring HDB3 rule adherence, like consecutive zeros. These sections ensure the logic is updated every positive clock edge or upon reset activation.
