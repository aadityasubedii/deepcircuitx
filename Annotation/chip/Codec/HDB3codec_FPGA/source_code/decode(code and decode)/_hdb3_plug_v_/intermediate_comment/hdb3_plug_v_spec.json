    "spec": "Module name: hdb3_plug_v. Module specification: The hdb3_plug_v is a Verilog module designed to encode data using the High Density Bipolar 3 (HDB3) encoding scheme, primarily for processing a stream of binary data inputs. Its inputs consist of i_rst_n (an active low reset), i_clk (a clock signal), and i_data (binary data input), alongside a 2-bit vector output, o_plug_v_code. The output represents the HDB3-encoded data using two significant bits from internal registers storing high and low pulse codes. The internal signals include a redundant 2-bit register r_plug_v_code, as well as r_plug_v_code_h and r_plug_v_code_l, 4-bit registers which track high and low coding states respectively, and a 3-bit shift register, r_data_shift, which stores recent bits of input data to aid in pattern recognition necessary for HDB3 encoding. The module operates in two primary always blocks: The first handles reset conditions, initializing r_data_shift to an all-high state, while the second manages encoding logic, shifting data within both pulse code registers and modifying their states based on input data patterns, specifically identifying sequences requiring HDB3 rule adherence, like consecutive zeros. These sections ensure the logic is updated every positive clock edge or upon reset activation.",

This module has inputs for reset (i_rst_n), clock (i_clk), and data (i_data), as well as a 2-bit vector output (o_plug_v_code). Internally, it uses several registers to track and shift the data, and to store intermediate coding states for high and low pulses of the HDB3 code. The output is formed by selecting specific bits from two of these registers. The logic processes data every rising edge of the clock or falling edge of the reset. When reset is active, it initializes shift registers and coding states. During normal operation, it checks conditions to decide how to encode a sequence of zeros based on previous data and states to adhere to HDB3 encoding rules."

It essentially performs the converse operation to r_plug_v_code_h, storing and shifting the low pulse information of the encoded data according to HDB3 encoding specifications.\n- r_data_shift: This 3-bit register is a shift register for the input data.
