Module-level comment: The hdb3_plug_v module encodes binary data using the HDB3 scheme. It utilizes two always blocks; the first initializes shift registers upon reset, while the second encodes the data based on current and historical input. High and low pulse states are managed in 4-bit registers, r_plug_v_code_h and r_plug_v_code_l, influenced by input data patterns, and the result is output through o_plug_v_code.
