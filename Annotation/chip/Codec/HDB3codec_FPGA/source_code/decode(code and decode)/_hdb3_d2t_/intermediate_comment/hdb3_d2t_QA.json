It respects the HDB3 encoding rule where the polarity of nonzero levels alternates, and the polarity inverses depending on the saving bit ('0' or '1'). Also, if the input reset signal (`i_rst_n`) is low, it resets the internal state, setting the parity to `0` and output code to `00`. The module effectively toggles the parity and outputs the appropriate HDB3 code based on current parity and input code conditions."
