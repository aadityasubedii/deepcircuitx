    "spec": "Module name: hdb3_d2t. Module specification: The `hdb3_d2t` module processes a two-bit bipolar signal digitzed for transmission to encode it into a High-Density Bipolar of order 3 (HDB3) code. This is crucial for scenarios where long strings of zeros may otherwise compromise a signal's integrity by providing no energy, thus no timing references. There are two input ports and one output port. The inputs include `i_rst_n`, an active-low reset signal that resets internal states and outputs when low, and `i_clk`, which is the clock signal driving the timing of the sequential logic. The other input, `i_plug_b_code`, is the two-bit bipolar code to be transformed into HDB3. The single output port, `o_hdb3_code`, emits a two-bit signal representing the HDB3-modified bipolar code. Internally, this module uses a register `r_not_0_parity` to keep track of the parity of non-zero symbols, ensuring that the polarity of non-zero levels alternates as per the HDB3 rules. The main logic block, triggered on the rising edge of `i_clk` or the falling edge of `i_rst_n`, first checks for a reset condition to clear outputs and reset the parity. In the absence of a reset, it processes the incoming `i_plug_b_code` to toggle the parity appropriately and set the `o_hdb3_code` based on the current and previous states of `i_plug_b_code` and `r_not_0_parity`, consequently adapting the output code as per the specified transformation rules.\n",
