Module-level comment: The `hdb3_d2t` module encodes a two-bit bipolar signal into HDB3 code, enhancing signal integrity for transmission by ensuring non-zero symbols alternate polarity. Inputs include a clock (`i_clk`), reset (`i_rst_n`), and bipolar code (`i_plug_b_code`). The output (`o_hdb3_code`) represents the HDB3-encoded signal. Internal logic updates on clock rising edges or reset falling edges, processing inputs and toggling the internal parity (`r_not_0_parity`) to generate the correct HDB3 polarity.
