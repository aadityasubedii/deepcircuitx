Module name: hdb3_code. Module specification: The 'hdb3_code' module is designed for telecommunications to perform HDB3 (High Density Bipolar 3 Zeros) coding by converting binary input data into an HDB3 encoded signal for synchronization purposes and to maintain a zero DC component. It comprises input ports: 'i_rst_n', a reset signal active low for resetting the module's state; 'i_clk', a clock signal for timing synchronization; and 'i_data', the binary data to be encoded. The module outputs through the 'o_hdb3_code' port, which emits a two-bit HDB3 encoded signal. Internally, the module uses two signals: 'w_plug_v' and 'w_plug_b'. 'w_plug_v' carries output from the 'hdb3_plug_v' submodule to 'hdb3_plug_b' and is involved in preliminary processing of input data violations or conditions, while 'w_plug_b', which receives input from 'hdb3_plug_b', further transforms this processed data before it reaches the final encoding stage in 'hdb3_d2t'. The module is structured into three sub-modules: 'hdb3_plug_v' which processes the initial binary input, 'hdb3_plug_b' which takes the intermediate 'w_plug_v' data for further modification, and 'hdb3_d2t' that finally outputs the HDB3 encoded signal through 'o_hdb3_code'. This configuration efficiently manages data transformation conforming to the HDB3 coding rules.
