    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'hdb3_code' module encodes binary data into HDB3 format ensuring synchronization and zero DC component in telecommunications systems. It features inputs for reset, clock, and data, and outputs a two-bit HDB3 signal. Internally, it utilizes 'hdb3_plug_v', 'hdb3_plug_b', and 'hdb3_d2t' submodules to sequentially process and transform the data, using intermediate signals 'w_plug_v' and 'w_plug_b' for staged data handling and encoding."
