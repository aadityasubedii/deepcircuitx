Module name: hdb3_decode_tb. Module specification: The hdb3_decode_tb module is a testbench designed for simulating and verifying the functionality of the hdb3_decode module, which decodes HDB3 (High Density Bipolar 3) encoded data. The module includes three input ports: r_rst_n (a reset input, active low, used for initializing the state of the hdb3_decode module), r_clk (a clock input that provides the timing signal for synchronized operations), and r_data (an input carrying the encoded HDB3 data for decoding). The sole output port, w_data, is used to output the decoded data from the hdb3_decode module. Internal signals such as r_rst_n, r_clk, and r_data are registers that respectively manage reset, clock, and data input functions within the testbench. w_data is a wire signal used to handle the decoded output. The code includes various initial blocks: one for resetting the module, one for toggling the clock signal, and another to provide a sequence of test data inputs to the hdb3_decode module, illustrating how the module responds to different data patterns under test conditions. This setup helps in adequately testing and verifying the decoding correctness of the connected hdb3_decode module.
