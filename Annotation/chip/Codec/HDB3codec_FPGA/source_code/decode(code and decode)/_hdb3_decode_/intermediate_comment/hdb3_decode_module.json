    "module": "Module-level comment: The `hdb3_decode` module decodes HDB3 encoded data by using internal state registers (`r_hdb3_plus` and `r_hdb3_minus`) and a subordinate `hdb3_code` module that classifies incoming data (`i_data`). It updates these registers based on the transitions and violations detected in `i_hdb3_code`, strategically driving the binary output (`o_data`) to reflect the original pre-encoded data. This process ensures correct reconstruction of data synchronized with input clock (`i_clk`) and reset (`i_rst_n`)."
