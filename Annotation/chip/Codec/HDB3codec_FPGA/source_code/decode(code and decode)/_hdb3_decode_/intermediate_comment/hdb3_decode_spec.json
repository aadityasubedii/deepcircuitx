    "spec": "Module name: hdb3_decode.\nModule specification: The `hdb3_decode` module is designed to decode a data stream that has been encoded using High Density Bipolar 3 (HDB3) coding. The module takes three input signals which include `i_rst_n`, an active low reset signal that initializes internal states, `i_clk`, a clock input for synchronization of operations, and `i_data`, the incoming HDB3 encoded data stream. The output of the module, `o_data`, gives binary results of the HDB3 decoding process which represents the original data stream before encoding. Internally, the module utilizes a 2-bit wire `i_hdb3_code` for identifying the type of incoming HDB3 encoded data which is processed by an instance of an `hdb3_code` module. It also employs two 5-bit registers, `r_hdb3_plus` and `r_hdb3_minus`, which track the history of positive and negative transitions or violations, used in the module's decision logic. The code features an always block that triggers on the rising edge of `i_clk` or the falling edge of `i_rst_n`, where it combines condition checks on the `i_hdb3_code` along with the states of `r_hdb3_plus` and `r_hdb3_minus` registers to decode the input accurately and update output `o_data`. This structured approach allows `hdb3_decode` to reliably turn HDB3 encoded signals back into their original binary form.",
