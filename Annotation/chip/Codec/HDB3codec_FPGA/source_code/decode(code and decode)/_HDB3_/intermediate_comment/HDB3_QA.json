It controls the timing of the module's operations, synchronizing processing tasks within the HDB3 encoding process.\n- `i_data`: This is the incoming data signal that is to be encoded using the HDB3 method. This data is the subject of the processing and encoding performed by the `hdb3_code` module.\n\nOutput ports: `o_data`.\nExplanation: \n- `o_data`: This is the output data port that would ideally carry the HDB3 encoded data.
