    "spec": "Module name: HDB3. Module specification: The `HDB3` module is designed for implementing the High Density Bipolar 3 (HDB3) encoding technique used in digital communications. It handles the encoding of incoming digital data to ensure proper transmission over communication channels. This module has three input ports: `i_rst_n`, which is the reset signal used to return the module to a known state when active low; `i_clk`, the clock signal that synchronizes the encoding operations; and `i_data` which is the raw data to be encoded. The module features one output port, `o_data`, which is intended to output the HDB3 encoded data, though its connection and usage are not defined within this specific code snippet. Internally, the module uses a signal named `i_hdb3_code`, a 2-bit wide signal, serving as an intermediate representation of the encoded data, which is output by the `hdb3_code` instance. This instance, labeled `I1_hdb3_code`, receives input signals directly from the module\u2019s input ports and processes them to produce the `i_hdb3_code`, effectively implementing a part of the HDB3 encoding logic within the module\u2019s framework. The overall module architecture, while compact, integrates internal processing with external data flow seamlessly, focusing on data encoding for communication systems.",
