Module-level comment: The `hdb3_d2t` module encodes a 2-bit bipolar code (`i_plug_b_code`) into a 2-bit HDB3 code (`o_hdb3_code`). It operates on a positive clock edge (`i_clk`) and supports asynchronous reset (`i_rst_n`). Internally, it uses a parity register (`r_not_0_parity`), which toggles based on output to ensure correct HDB3 format, avoiding more than three consecutive zeros. This encoding aids in maintaining synchronization and data integrity in communication systems.
