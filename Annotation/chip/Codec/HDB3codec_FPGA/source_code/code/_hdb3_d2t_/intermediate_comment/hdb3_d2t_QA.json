This conversion takes into account a parity tracking mechanism using a register `r_not_0_parity`. The module decides the output code by leveraging a sequence of conditional checks on the input code and toggles this parity bit accordingly to maintain correct HDB3 encoding. The module operates on the positive edge of an input clock `i_clk` and can be asynchronously reset through an active-low input `i_rst_n`. This reset clears the output code and parity control. This module essentially encodes an input bipolar code into an HDB3 signaling format, used to ensure no more than three consecutive zeros in a data stream, thus reducing the possibility of synchronization loss."

The value of this output is determined by evaluating `i_plug_b_code` and toggling the `r_not_0_parity` to ensure correct HDB3 encoding, managing the parity to prevent more than three consecutive zeros in the output."

This signal is toggled every time a non-zero output is generated and is critical in ensuring that the output HDB3 code adheres to the requirements, such as not having more than three consecutive zeros.
