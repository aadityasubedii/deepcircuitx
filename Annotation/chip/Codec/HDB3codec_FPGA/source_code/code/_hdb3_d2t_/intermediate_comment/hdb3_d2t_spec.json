    "spec": "Module name: hdb3_d2t. \nModule specification: The hdb3_d2t module is a Verilog RTL implementation for encoding a 2-bit bipolar code (`i_plug_b_code`) into a 2-bit High-Density Bipolar 3 Zeros (HDB3) code (`o_hdb3_code`). The module operates with the clock `i_clk`, handling data processing on the rising edge, and can be reset asynchronously using an active-low reset `i_rst_n`, which initializes the output HDB3 code and internal parity status. Internally, the module utilizes a register `r_not_0_parity` to track parity by toggling its state with each non-zero output generated to maintain the correct HDB3 encoding and preventing more than three consecutive zeros. The logic within the module is structured in a sequential block that responds to either the falling edge of `i_rst_n` to reset the states, or on the rising edge of `i_clk` to compute the output. The computation involves conditional checks against the input `i_plug_b_code` value, and toggling the `r_not_0_parity` where necessary, to generate the corresponding HDB3 code based on the current and past input conditions. This module is critical in telecommunications and data storage systems where it is essential to maintain data integrity and prevent synchronization loss.",

This conversion takes into account a parity tracking mechanism using a register `r_not_0_parity`. The module decides the output code by leveraging a sequence of conditional checks on the input code and toggles this parity bit accordingly to maintain correct HDB3 encoding. The module operates on the positive edge of an input clock `i_clk` and can be asynchronously reset through an active-low input `i_rst_n`. This reset clears the output code and parity control. This module essentially encodes an input bipolar code into an HDB3 signaling format, used to ensure no more than three consecutive zeros in a data stream, thus reducing the possibility of synchronization loss."

When active (low), it initializes the state of the module, resetting the output code `o_hdb3_code` and the parity register `r_not_0_parity`.\n- `i_clk` is the clock input. The module's logic, including data processing and outputs, is triggered on the rising edge of this clock.\n- `i_plug_b_code` is a 2-bit input that represents the bipolar code. The module processes this input to produce an equivalent HDB3 code based on the parity and the input pattern.\n\nOutput ports: o_hdb3_code.\nExplanation: \n- `o_hdb3_code` is a 2-bit output that presents the HDB3 encoded result based on the input bipolar code and current parity status. The value of this output is determined by evaluating `i_plug_b_code` and toggling the `r_not_0_parity` to ensure correct HDB3 encoding, managing the parity to prevent more than three consecutive zeros in the output."
