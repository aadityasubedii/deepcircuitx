Module name: hdb3_d2t. 
Module specification: The hdb3_d2t module is a Verilog RTL implementation for encoding a 2-bit bipolar code (`i_plug_b_code`) into a 2-bit High-Density Bipolar 3 Zeros (HDB3) code (`o_hdb3_code`). The module operates with the clock `i_clk`, handling data processing on the rising edge, and can be reset asynchronously using an active-low reset `i_rst_n`, which initializes the output HDB3 code and internal parity status. Internally, the module utilizes a register `r_not_0_parity` to track parity by toggling its state with each non-zero output generated to maintain the correct HDB3 encoding and preventing more than three consecutive zeros. The logic within the module is structured in a sequential block that responds to either the falling edge of `i_rst_n` to reset the states, or on the rising edge of `i_clk` to compute the output. The computation involves conditional checks against the input `i_plug_b_code` value, and toggling the `r_not_0_parity` where necessary, to generate the corresponding HDB3 code based on the current and past input conditions. This module is critical in telecommunications and data storage systems where it is essential to maintain data integrity and prevent synchronization loss.
