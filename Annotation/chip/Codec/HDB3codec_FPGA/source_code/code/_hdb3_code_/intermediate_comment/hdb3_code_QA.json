It integrates three sub-modules: `hdb3_plug_v`, `hdb3_plug_b`, and `hdb3_d2t`. The `hdb3_plug_v` sub-module processes the input data (`i_data`) and produces an intermediate signal (`w_plug_v`), which is then further processed by `hdb3_plug_b` to generate another intermediate signal (`w_plug_b`). This intermediate signal is finally converted into the HDB3 encoded output (`o_hdb3_code`) by `hdb3_d2t`. Each sub-module is connected in a sequence where the output of one serves as the input to the next, and all are synchronized by a clock (`i_clk`) and can be reset through a common reset signal (`i_rst_n`)."

It is used to reset all the internal states of the module and sub-modules to known states. This is necessary to ensure that the module starts functioning correctly from a clean state whenever required.\n- `i_clk`: This is the clock input. It provides timing for all synchronous processes within the module and its sub-modules. The clock ensures that data processing and transitions occur at predictable times, essential for maintaining data integrity and synchronization throughout the encoding process.\n- `i_data`: This is the binary data input which is aimed to be encoded into HDB3 format. It represents the raw data that will be processed by the module through its sub-stages to ultimately generate a corresponding HDB3 encoded output.\n\nOutput ports: `o_hdb3_code`.\nExplanation:\n- `o_hdb3_code`: This is the HDB3 encoded output, which is a 2-bit wide output. It provides the resulting signal after the input data has been processed through the sequence of internal sub-modules (`hdb3_plug_v`, `hdb3_plug_b`, `hdb3_d2t`). Each bit of the output can represent an encoded version of the input data, modified to fit the HDB3 encoding standards which are useful in telecommunications and data transmission applications to ensure signal integrity and error minimization."

It carries the partially processed data signal outputted by `hdb3_plug_v`, which has modified the original `i_data` according to the first step of the HDB3 encoding process.

It carries further processed data that has been transformed by `hdb3_plug_b`, building upon the changes made by `hdb3_plug_v` to align with the HDB3 encoding specifications.
