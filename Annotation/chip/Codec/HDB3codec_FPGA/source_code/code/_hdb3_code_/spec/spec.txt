Module name: hdb3_code. Module specification: The `hdb3_code` module is designed for encoding binary data into High Density Bipolar 3 zeros (HDB3) format, commonly used in telecommunication systems to maintain signal integrity and reduce error rates. It accepts three input ports: `i_rst_n`, an active low reset for initializing internal states; `i_clk`, the clock signal that governs the timing of all synchronous operations; and `i_data`, the binary input data intended for HDB3 encoding. The output is delivered through `o_hdb3_code`, a 2-bit wide signal representing the HDB3 encoded data. Internally, the module incorporates three submodules connected sequentially. The `hdb3_plug_v` submodule processes the `i_data` producing an intermediate 2-bit signal `w_plug_v`. This is passed to `hdb3_plug_b`, which further modifies the signal, outputting another 2-bit intermediate, `w_plug_b`. Finally, `hdb3_d2t` converts `w_plug_b` to the final output `o_hdb3_code`. This architectural arrangement ensures a stepwise transformation of the input data to its encoded form, synchronized by shared clock and reset signals.
