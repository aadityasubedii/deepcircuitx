Module name: hdb3_plug_b.  
Module specification: The hdb3_plug_b module is designed to generate plug B code from the plug V code as part of the High-Density Bipolar 3 (HDB3) encoding scheme used in telecommunication systems. It accepts a 2-bit input `i_plug_v_code` that represents the plug V code, along with a clock signal `i_clk` and an active-low reset signal `i_rst_n`. The module outputs a 2-bit signal `o_plug_b_code`, which represents the plug B code. Internally, the module uses `r_plug_b_code_h` and `r_plug_b_code_l` shift registers for storing and manipulating the high and low bits of the plug B code, respectively. It also utilizes a parity bit `r_not_0_parity` to handle specific encoding rules based on the plug V code input. The control flow includes resetting the internal registers on the reset signal and updating the output through conditional logic based on the current state of input and parity. The module features two main always blocks: one that manages the parity bit updates and another that controls the content of the high and low shift registers dependent on the V code input and current parity state.
