Module-level comment: The hdb3_plug_b module transforms HDB3-encoded plug V code into plug B code for telecommunication data transmission. It uses two primary logic blocks synchronized by `i_clk` and reset by `i_rst_n`: one updates a parity bit (`r_not_0_parity`), and the other shifts bit values in two 5-bit registers (`r_plug_b_code_h` and `r_plug_b_code_l`) based on the input V code and parity state, producing the output `o_plug_b_code`.
