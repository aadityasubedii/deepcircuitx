    "spec": "Module name: hdb3_plug_b.  \nModule specification: The hdb3_plug_b module is designed to generate plug B code from the plug V code as part of the High-Density Bipolar 3 (HDB3) encoding scheme used in telecommunication systems. It accepts a 2-bit input `i_plug_v_code` that represents the plug V code, along with a clock signal `i_clk` and an active-low reset signal `i_rst_n`. The module outputs a 2-bit signal `o_plug_b_code`, which represents the plug B code. Internally, the module uses `r_plug_b_code_h` and `r_plug_b_code_l` shift registers for storing and manipulating the high and low bits of the plug B code, respectively. It also utilizes a parity bit `r_not_0_parity` to handle specific encoding rules based on the plug V code input. The control flow includes resetting the internal registers on the reset signal and updating the output through conditional logic based on the current state of input and parity. The module features two main always blocks: one that manages the parity bit updates and another that controls the content of the high and low shift registers dependent on the V code input and current parity state.",

It takes a reset signal (i_rst_n), a clock signal (i_clk), and a 2-bit input signal (i_plug_v_code) representing the plug V code. The module outputs a 2-bit signal (o_plug_b_code) which is the resulting plug B code. It includes logic to handle parity using a parity bit indicator (r_not_0_parity). The functionality includes resetting internal registers on reset signal and updating the output code based on the plug V code and current parity state. The transformation from V code to B code involves specific handling of the internal shift registers (r_plug_b_code_h and r_plug_b_code_l) depending on the V code input and the parity logic, ensuring transmission rules are adhered to for high-density bipolar coding."

This output is crucial as it ensures the correct transmission code is available following HDB3 encoding rules."
