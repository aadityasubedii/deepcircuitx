Module-level comment: The 'hdb3_code_tb' is a testbench for the 'hdb3_code' module, simulating necessary inputs (clock, reset, data) to validate HDB3 encoding. It initializes and toggles reset and clock, cycles data through various patterns, and checks output via an instantiated 'hdb3_code' module, ensuring all encoding scenarios are tested.
