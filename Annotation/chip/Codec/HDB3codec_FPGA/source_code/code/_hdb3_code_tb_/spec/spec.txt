Module name: hdb3_code_tb. Module specification: The 'hdb3_code_tb' is a testbench module designed to verify the functionality of the 'hdb3_code' module, which encodes input data using the HDB3 coding scheme. The module simulates input signals including a clock (r_clk), a reset signal (r_rst_n), and data signal (r_data), and monitors the encoded output (w_hdb3_code) to ensure proper functionality under varying conditions. Input ports include: 'r_rst_n', an active-low reset signal to initialize the module; 'r_clk', a clock signal critical for timing internal operations; and 'r_data', representing the data to be encoded. The output port 'w_hdb3_code' is a 2-bit wire reflecting the encoded data. Internally, these signals are utilized as follows: 'r_rst_n' resets the state of the 'hdb3_code' module, 'r_clk' provides necessary clock pulses, 'r_data' tests the encoding process with different data patterns, and 'w_hdb3_code' outputs the results of this encoding. The code includes several initial blocks: one sets and later releases the reset signal, another continuously toggles the clock signal, and a third block drives the data signal through multiple test patterns to thoroughly evaluate the 'hdb3_code' encoder's response. The instantiated 'hdb3_code' module links these internal signals to its respective inputs and output, forming a crucial part of the testbench functionality.
