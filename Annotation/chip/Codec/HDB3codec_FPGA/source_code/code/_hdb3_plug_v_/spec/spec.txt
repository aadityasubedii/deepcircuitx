Module name: hdb3_plug_v.

Module specification: The `hdb3_plug_v` is a Verilog module designed for encoding digital data using the High Density Bipolar 3 (HDB3) technique. This module caters to the requirement of maintaining zero DC bias and synchronization in data transmission systems. It processes an input signal (`i_data`) synchronized by a clock (`i_clk`) and outputs a 2-bit HDB3 encoded data (`o_plug_v_code`). The module operates effectively under the control of an active-low reset signal (`i_rst_n`). Internally, it utilizes a 3-bit shift register (`r_data_shift`) to monitor and process incoming data sequences, alongside two 4-bit registers (`r_plug_v_code_h` and `r_plug_v_code_l`) that facilitate the encoding based on the zero conditions detected and the continuity of zeros in the input data. The encoding logic is implemented in two primary blocks of sequential logic inside the module. The first block manages the shift register under clock and reset conditions, ensuring data is appropriately shifted for pattern recognition. The second block evaluates incoming bits and previously shifted data to modify the values in the `r_plug_v_code_h` and `r_plug_v_code_l` registers, dynamically updating the output based on the HDB3 encoding rules, particularly handling the scenarios of zero sequences and transitioning data values.
