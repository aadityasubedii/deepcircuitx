Module-level comment: The `hdb3_plug_v` module encodes input digital data (`i_data`) using the HDB3 technique, producing a 2-bit encoded output (`o_plug_v_code`). It uses a 3-bit shift register (`r_data_shift`) and two 4-bit registers (`r_plug_v_code_h`, `r_plug_v_code_l`) to detect zero sequences and encode data based on HDB3 rules. The module operates based on clock (`i_clk`) and reset (`i_rst_n`) signals, managing data integrity and encoding through sequential logic that updates internal registers to ensure compliance with HDB3 encoding standards.
