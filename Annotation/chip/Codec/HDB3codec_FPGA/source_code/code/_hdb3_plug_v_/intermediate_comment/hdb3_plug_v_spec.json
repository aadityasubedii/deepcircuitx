    "spec": "Module name: hdb3_plug_v.\n\nModule specification: The `hdb3_plug_v` is a Verilog module designed for encoding digital data using the High Density Bipolar 3 (HDB3) technique. This module caters to the requirement of maintaining zero DC bias and synchronization in data transmission systems. It processes an input signal (`i_data`) synchronized by a clock (`i_clk`) and outputs a 2-bit HDB3 encoded data (`o_plug_v_code`). The module operates effectively under the control of an active-low reset signal (`i_rst_n`). Internally, it utilizes a 3-bit shift register (`r_data_shift`) to monitor and process incoming data sequences, alongside two 4-bit registers (`r_plug_v_code_h` and `r_plug_v_code_l`) that facilitate the encoding based on the zero conditions detected and the continuity of zeros in the input data. The encoding logic is implemented in two primary blocks of sequential logic inside the module. The first block manages the shift register under clock and reset conditions, ensuring data is appropriately shifted for pattern recognition. The second block evaluates incoming bits and previously shifted data to modify the values in the `r_plug_v_code_h` and `r_plug_v_code_l` registers, dynamically updating the output based on the HDB3 encoding rules, particularly handling the scenarios of zero sequences and transitioning data values.",

It works on a clock signal (`i_clk`) and has a reset signal (`i_rst_n`). The input data is sampled and shifted using a 3-bit shift register (`r_data_shift`). Based on conditions set in the logic, the module modifies the values of two 4-bit registers (`r_plug_v_code_h` and `r_plug_v_code_l`), which are then used to determine the output signal `o_plug_v_code`. The output is driven by the highest bits of these two registers. This module ensures that there are no more than three consecutive zeros in the output signal, replacing sequences of four zeros with different patterns of ones and zeros to maintain zero DC bias and synchronization in the data transmission, which are critical aspects of the HDB3 encoding technique."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports: `i_rst_n`, `i_clk`, `i_data`.\nExplanation:\n- `i_rst_n`: This is the active low reset signal for the module. When this signal is low (`0`), it initializes the internal registers and shift register state. A necessary input to establish the start of regular operations and handle any requirement to reset the state due to errors or reinitializations.\n- `i_clk`: The clock input that synchronizes the operations within the module. All state changes occur on the rising edge of this clock signal (or on the falling edge of `i_rst_n`), ensuring consistent timing and operation pacing.\n- `i_data`: This is the digital input data signal that the module encodes using the HDB3 technique. The data is sampled every clock cycle and shifted into an internal shift register for encoding based on defined conditions.\n\nOutput ports: `o_plug_v_code`.\nExplanation:\n- `o_plug_v_code`: This is a 2-bit output signal that represents the HDB3 encoded data derived from the input data (`i_data`). The output is constructed using the highest bits of two internal 4-bit registers (`r_plug_v_code_h` and `r_plug_v_code_l`). This output provides the HDB3 encoded version of the input data which features modifications to the original data stream aimed at maintaining zero DC bias and synchronization capabilities."

In the encoding process, transitions from input zero conditions and continuity of zeros influence the manipulations within this register. It helps in formulating the higher bit of the HDB3 encoded output where sequences of zeros may be modified for zero DC bias maintenance.\n\n- `r_plug_v_code_l`: Similar to `r_plug_v_code_h`, this 4-bit register assists in encoding the lower part of the output code (`o_plug_v_code`). It works in tandem with `r_plug_v_code_h` to form the complete 2-bit output by providing the least significant bit of each HDB3 code combination depending on the input data and preceding bit sequence.\n\n- `r_data_shift`: This 3-bit shift register is critical for monitoring the input data sequence (`i_data`). It sequentially captures the data bits on each clock cycle and shifts them, allowing the logic to detect patterns like consecutive zeros, which are crucial for deciding when to inject different patterns in the output stream to comply with HDB3 encoding rules. This shift register is essential for maintaining synchronization and reducing error rates due to unrecognized bit sequences in longer stretches of zeros."
