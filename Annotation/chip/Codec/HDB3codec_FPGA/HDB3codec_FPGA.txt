The HDB3codec_FPGA repository is dedicated to the implementation of the High Density Bipolar 3 (HDB3) encoding and decoding techniques, primarily used in digital telecommunication systems to facilitate data integrity and synchronization. The repository includes various Verilog modules designed to encode binary data into the HDB3 format and decode it back to binary form. Encoding involves multiple submodules—'hdb3_plug_v,' 'hdb3_plug_b,' and 'hdb3_d2t'—that sequentially process the data transforming it through different stages, ensuring zero DC components and synchronization. The 'hdb3_code' module acts as the central unit that integrates these submodules for final encoding output. For decoding, the 'hdb3_decode' module, along with state management registers, meticulously reverts the HDB3 encoded data to its original binary format by analyzing transitions and violations. Testbenches like 'hdb3_code_tb' and 'hdb3_decode_tb' provide simulation environments to validate the functionality of encoding and decoding modules, respectively, simulating various input scenarios and monitoring the outputs. Consequently, the repository encapsulates a comprehensive suite of modules to support both encoding and decoding processes, complete with testing frameworks for verification of functional correctness under different conditions.
