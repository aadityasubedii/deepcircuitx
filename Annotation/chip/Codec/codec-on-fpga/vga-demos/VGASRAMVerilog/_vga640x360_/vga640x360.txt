Module-level comment: The vga640x360 module generates VGA signals for a 640x360 display, handling synchronization, blanking, and pixel location. Utilizes input signals i_clk, i_pix_stb, i_rst to manage timing; outputs include o_hs, o_vs, o_blanking, and others. Implements internal counters, h_count and v_count, to track position, and conditions within always blocks manage counter resets and increments based on clock and pixel strobes, aligning outputs with VGA standards.
