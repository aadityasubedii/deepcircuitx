Module name: vga640x360. Module specification: The vga640x360 module is designed to generate the necessary timing and control signals for a VGA display with a resolution of 640x360 pixels. It manages the synchronization processes for horizontal and vertical scanning, handles blanking intervals, defines active video periods, and tracks the end of each frame. The module uses various input signals which are `i_clk` for clock synchronization, `i_pix_stb` to initiate pixel processing at each clock cycle, and `i_rst` to reset all counters when needed. The output ports include `o_hs` for horizontal sync, `o_vs` for vertical sync, `o_blanking` for denoting the blanking period, `o_active` indicating active display time, `o_screenend` signaling the end of a screen frame, `o_animate` indicating the last line for animation, and `o_x`, `o_y` representing the current pixel coordinates. Internally, the module employs `h_count` and `v_count` as horizontal and vertical position counters; these play crucial roles in generating output signals and managing display timings. The Verilog code is structured around several key blocks: parameter definitions for defining boundaries and thresholds for sync and active video phases, signal assignments for output ports based on the current counter values, and always blocks that control the increment and reset logic of internal counters based on the input signals, ensuring that the VGA signaling adheres to specified timings.
