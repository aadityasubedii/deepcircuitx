Module name: top. 

Module specification: The "top" module is designed primarily to drive a VGA display by processing the clock (CLK) and reset button (RST_BTN) inputs to generate graphical output signals. These include horizontal and vertical sync signals (VGA_HS_O, VGA_VS_O) and RGB color outputs (VGA_R, VGA_G, VGA_B), crucial for syncing and displaying content on a VGA monitor. The central mechanism is managed by incrementing a pixel counter (`cnt`) on every rising edge of CLK which then controls a VGA signal generator (`display`) to create the pixel coordinates (x,y) and active signal. These signals drive the VGA sync outputs directly and are used to read graphical data from SRAM (via `vram`) based on the memory's address (`address`). A palette (`palette`) then converts this data into appropriate RGB values (`colour`) which are reflected in the color outputs during the active video phase. Internally, the module uses several key signals and blocks: `rst` aligns with RST_BTN simplifying reset operations, `pix_stb` generated from `cnt` regulates the VGA signal pacing, `address` computes memory location for pixel-specific data fetch, and `dataout` is fetched from SRAM serving as a bridge between video memory and the VGA output through the color mapping in `palette`. The module is also segmented distinctively into the VGA signal generation (handled by `vga640x360` instance), memory management for graphical data (handled by `sram` instance `vram`), palette initialization and color translation processes where graphical data from SRAM is translated to actual color data, which finally feeds into VGA color port assignments based on active video conditions. This structured approach enables the module to efficiently manage and display graphics on a VGA interface while responding dynamically to reset controls.
