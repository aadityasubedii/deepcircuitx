Module-level comment: The 'sram' module simulates a synchronous RAM with configurable address and data widths, utilizing a clock (`i_clk`) to coordinate read and write operations. It features input ports for address (`i_addr`), write control (`i_write`), and data (`i_data`). It outputs read data (`o_data`). Internally, a memory array stores the data. Operations are handled via an `always` block triggered on clock edges, supporting conditional write or read based on `i_write`. Optionally, it can preload data from a hex file at initialization.
