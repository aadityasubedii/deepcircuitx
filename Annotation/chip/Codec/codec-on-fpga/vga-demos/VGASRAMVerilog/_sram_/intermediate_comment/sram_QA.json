It utilizes a clock signal (`i_clk`) to read from and write to memory. The memory contents can be initialized from a specified hex file if provided. The memory operations are performed based on the input signal `i_write`: when high, the data (`i_data`) is written to the memory at the specified address (`i_addr`); when low, the data from the specified address is placed on the output (`o_data`). This module offers basic functionality of an SRAM in a digital system, including optional memory initialization from a file and synchronized read/write operations."
