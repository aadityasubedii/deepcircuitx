Module name: sram.

Module specification: The 'sram' module is designed to simulate a simple synchronous RAM with customizable address and data widths, using Verilog. The functionality centers on storing and retrieving data based on external inputs. Input ports include: `i_clk`, the clock signal that synchronizes memory operations; `i_addr`, which specifies the memory address for data transactions; `i_write`, a control signal where a high value triggers data writing and low indicates reading; `i_data`, the data to be written to memory during write operations. The single output port, `o_data`, outputs data read from the specified memory address during read cycles. Internally, the module uses a memory array (`memory_array`) constructed of registers that act as the storage cells. This array is dimensioned by the `DEPTH` and each registerâ€™s width by `DATA_WIDTH`. The Verilog code is segmented into an initialization block that potentially loads data from a hex file (`MEMFILE`) into the memory array at startup, and a sequential logic block within an `always` statement, activated on the positive edge of `i_clk`. This block handles writing data to or reading data from the memory array based on the state of `i_write`.
