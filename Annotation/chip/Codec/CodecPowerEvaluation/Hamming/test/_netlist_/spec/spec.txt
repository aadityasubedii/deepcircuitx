Module name: Codec. Module specification: The Codec module is designed for coding and decoding data in digital communication systems. It consists of two main sub-modules: Coder and Decoder. The module takes a 16-bit input data (data_in), a 21-bit bit_flip vector for simulating transmission errors, and a clock signal (clk) as inputs. It outputs a 16-bit decoded data (data_out). Internally, it uses two 21-bit signals: data_coded (output from the Coder) and data_augmented (data_coded XORed with bit_flip). The Coder sub-module encodes the input data into a 21-bit format, potentially adding error correction bits. The encoded data is then subjected to simulated transmission errors using the bit_flip vector. The resulting data_augmented is passed to the Decoder sub-module, which attempts to
