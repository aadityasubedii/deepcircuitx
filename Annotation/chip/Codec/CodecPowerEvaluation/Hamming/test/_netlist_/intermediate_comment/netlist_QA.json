It includes two main sub-modules named \"Coder\" and \"Decoder\". The 'Coder' sub-module takes a 16-bit input data, processes it through logic elements like DFF (Data Flip Flop) and various logical gates (XOR, XNOR, etc.), and outputs a 21-bit coded data. This coded data is then subject to potential bit flips defined by the 'bit_flip' input vector, using XOR gates to simulate errors or alterations in a communication environment. The resulting 'data_augmented' is then passed into the 'Decoder' sub-module. The 'Decoder' operates with the possibly altered data to reconstruct, or attempt to reconstruct, the original 16-bit data, using a series of XOR and XNOR operations, reflecting a typical error-correction or data recovery mechanism in digital communication systems. The final output is a 16-bit 'data_out' which represents the decoded version of the input considering any modifications introduced by the 'bit_flip' vector.\n"

Each bit in this vector can flip a corresponding bit in the encoded data to simulate noise or errors that might occur during data transmission.\n- `clk`: The clock input is crucial for timing the operations of data latches (DFFs) inside the Codec module, ensuring synchronous data processing in encoding and decoding operations. \n\nOutput ports: `data_out`. \nExplanation: \n- `data_out` (16-bit): This is the final output of the Codec module.
