    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/*\nThis Codec module implements data encoding and decoding for error-resilient communication.\nIt consists of a Coder and Decoder sub-module. The Coder encodes 16-bit input data into \n21-bit format. The encoded data is then XORed with a bit_flip vector to simulate transmission \nerrors. The Decoder attempts to reconstruct the original 16-bit data from the potentially \ncorrupted 21-bit input, employing error correction techniques.\n*/"
