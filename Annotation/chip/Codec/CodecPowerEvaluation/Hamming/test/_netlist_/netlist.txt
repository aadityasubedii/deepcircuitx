Module-level comment: 
/*
This Codec module implements data encoding and decoding for error-resilient communication.
It consists of a Coder and Decoder sub-module. The Coder encodes 16-bit input data into 
21-bit format. The encoded data is then XORed with a bit_flip vector to simulate transmission 
errors. The Decoder attempts to reconstruct the original 16-bit data from the potentially 
corrupted 21-bit input, employing error correction techniques.
