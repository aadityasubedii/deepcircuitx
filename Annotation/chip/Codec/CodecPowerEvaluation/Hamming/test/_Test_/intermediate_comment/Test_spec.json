    "spec": "Module name: Test. \nModule specification: The 'Test' module is designed to serve as a testbench for the 'Codec' module, specifically to verify how it reacts to varying data inputs and bit flips under a toggling clock environment. It utilizes input ports: `data_in`, a 16-bit register that provides test data to the 'Codec'; `bit_flip`, a 21-bit register for simulating bit errors; and `clk`, a register serving as the clock signal. The module outputs through the `data_out` port, a 16-bit wire that reflects the 'Codec' processed data, essential for functional verification. Internally, `data_in`, `bit_flip`, and `clk` are driven by procedural blocks: `data_in` and `bit_flip` are dynamically altered every 10 ns to simulate different test scenarios, while `clk` is toggled every 10 ns to maintain clock integrity. The main procedural blocks include an initialization segment setting initial zero values, and two always blocks controlling the random generation of `data_in` and `bit_flip` values and the toggling of `clk`, respectively. This structured approach provides a dynamic and controlled testing environment to comprehensively evaluate the 'Codec' module's response under simulated operational conditions.",
