It mainly tests how the 'Codec' reacts to different data inputs and bit flips under a toggling clock. 'data_in' and 'bit_flip' are randomly varied, and 'clk' is toggled every 10 nanoseconds to emulate a clock signal in this test environment. This setup helps in verifying the functionality of the 'Codec' module under various conditions."

It is used to test how the 'Codec' module processes varying data inputs.\n- `bit_flip`: This is a 21-bit input register used to input a bit flip mask to the 'Codec' module. It allows simulation of bit error introduction in the data path, testing the 'Codec' module\u2019s resilience or response to bit errors.\n- `clk`: This is an input register acting as the clock signal for the module. The clock is essential for triggering sequential operations within the 'Codec' module, aligning with typical digital circuit behavior.\n\nOutput ports: `data_out`.  \nExplanation:  \n- `data_out`: This 16-bit wire is the output from the 'Codec' module. It represents the processed data after it has been subjected to the operations within the 'Codec', based on 'data_in' and 'bit_flip' under the clock pulses.

It represents the primary data input which the 'Codec' processes.\n- `bit_flip`: A 21-bit internal register designed to introduce controlled bit errors (flip specific bits) in the data input as part of testing the error handling or resilience of the 'Codec' module.\n- `clk`: An internal register that serves as a clock signal in the test bench.
