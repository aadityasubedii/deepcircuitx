    "spec": "Module name: Codec\n\nModule specification: The Codec module is designed to simulate encoding and decoding functionality within digital communication systems using Verilog. It accepts three input ports including a 16-bit `data_in` which represents the data to be encoded, a 21-bit `bit_flip` used for simulating noise or errors by flipping bits of the encoded data, and a clock signal `clk` essential for synchronizing operations within the module. The sole output port is `data_out`, a 16-bit signal that ideally represents the decoded version of the original input data post error correction. The module leverages two internal signals; `data_coded`, a 21-bit signal representing the encoded version of `data_in` produced by the Coder submodule, and `data_augmented`, which holds the result of the exclusive OR operation between `data_coded` and `bit_flip` used for simulating transmission errors. This augmented data is then fed into the Decoder submodule for error correction, ultimately outputting the reconstructed data through `data_out`. The process flow involves the Coder submodule that encodes the input data, a bitwise XOR operation to introduce simulated errors, and the Decoder submodule that strives to correct these errors and reconstruct the original data, thereby demonstrating a simple encoder-decoder system functionality.",
