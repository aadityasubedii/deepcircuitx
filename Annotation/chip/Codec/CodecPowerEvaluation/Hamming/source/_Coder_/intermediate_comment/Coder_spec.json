    "spec": "Module name: Coder. Module specification: The 'Coder' module is designed to receive a 16-bit input vector 'data_in' and produce a 21-bit output vector 'data_out' primarily utilizing bitwise operations such as XOR. It harnesses two input ports: 'data_in' which supplies the module with the data for processing and 'clk', a clock signal used for data synchronization. The single output port, 'data_out', generates the result from logical operations performed on the synchronized data. Internally, 'data_in' is latched into a 16-bit register 'data_in_reg' at every positive clock edge, ensuring stability and consistency in data handling during computations. The module is structured into two main always blocks: one for synchronizing the input data to 'data_in_reg' and the other for computing each bit of 'data_out'. The computation logic mixes simple bitwise copying and more complex XOR operations. Specific bits of 'data_out' are direct mappings of 'data_in_reg', while others are derived from XORing various combinations of bits in 'data_in_reg', tailored to implement functionalities like error checking or encoding data in communication or storage systems. This makes the module essential for systems where encoded output and data integrity checks are critical.",
