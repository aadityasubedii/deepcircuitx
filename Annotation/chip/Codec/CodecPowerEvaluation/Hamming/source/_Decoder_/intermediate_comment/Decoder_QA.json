The module operates on the rising edge of a clock signal (`clk`). Initially, the input data is copied into a register (`data_in_reg`). The computed parities evaluate specific bits of this data to detect and locate errors using exclusive OR operations. If errors are detected, a 22-bit mask is used to correct the erroneous bit by XOR operation. Finally, 16 bits are selected from the potentially corrected data to form the output, with specified bits chosen from the `tmp` register, which contains the error-corrected data."

It ensures that a consistent data snapshot is used throughout the parity calculation and error correction cycles within the current clock cycle.\n- `tmp`: This register holds a copy of `data_in_reg` and is used to apply the error correction. The detected error position is corrected by XOR-ing `tmp` with a mask that has a bit set at the error position.\n- `parity`: This is a 5-bit register used for storing the results of parity calculations. Each bit of this register is computed based on a selective XOR operation across specific bits of `data_in_reg`. These parity bits are used to determine if there is an error and to locate it.\n- `mask`: A 22-bit signal computed by shifting a bit based on the value in `parity`. This mask generates a bit pattern used to correct the erroneous bit in `tmp` via an XOR operation, targeting only the bit (if any) where an error is detected based on the parity results."
