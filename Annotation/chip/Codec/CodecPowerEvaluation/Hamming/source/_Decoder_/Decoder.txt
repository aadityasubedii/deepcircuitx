Module-level comment: The Decoder module performs error detection and correction on a 21-bit input (`data_in`), utilizing Hamming code to output a corrected 16-bit data (`data_out`). Functionality is achieved via registers (`data_in_reg`, `tmp`) and parity calculations (`parity`), with error correction using an XOR operation with a dynamically generated `mask`. Activated by the positive edge of `clk`, the module ensures reliable, synchronized processing and output formation based on selective bit corrections.
