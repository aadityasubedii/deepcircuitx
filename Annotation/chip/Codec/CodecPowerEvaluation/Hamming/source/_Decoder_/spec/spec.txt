Module name: Decoder. 

Module specification: The Decoder module is responsible for error detection and correction in a 21-bit input data (`data_in`) using Hamming code parity calculations, outputting a corrected 16-bit data (`data_out`). The module activates on the rising edge of a clock (`clk`) to ensure synchronization. Input ports include `data_in`, a 21-bit signal that carries the data for decoding, and `clk`, the clock signal that triggers operations within each clock cycle. The output port, `data_out`, delivers the corrected 16-bit data, constructed after error checking and correction processes. 

Internally, `data_in_reg` holds a stable copy of the input data synchronized to the clock's positive edge, which is utilized for consistency during processing. The `tmp` register mirrors `data_in_reg` and is utilized for applying corrections based on computed error positions. The `parity` register, comprising 5 bits, stores the results from parity calculations essential for error detection and position identification. The `mask` signal, a 22-bit vector, generated based on the parity calculations, aids in correcting the identified erroneous bit via an XOR operation with `tmp`.

The code divides into several blocks for distinct functions: clock-edge triggered data registration, continuous error checking, error position correction, and data output formation. Specifically, the error detection block computes parity bits through XOR operations across specific `data_in_reg` bits; the error correction block forms a mask based on these parities to isolate and fix errors in `tmp`; and finally, selected bits from `tmp` are outputted after potential correction through channeling and manipulation in the output assignment block. This structured design allows the Decoder to efficiently correct any single-bit errors in the input data leveraging the Hamming code methodology.
