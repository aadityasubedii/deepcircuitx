Module name: Codec. Module specification: The Codec module is designed for simulating a digital communication system where data is encoded, corrupted, and decoded to test error correction capabilities. It first takes a 16-bit `data_in`, encodes it to 48 bits using the Coder submodule, simulates transmission errors by XOR-ing the encoded output with a 48-bit `bit_flip` signal, and finally decodes it back to a 16-bit `data_out` using the Decoder submodule. The input ports include `data_in`, `bit_flip`, and `clk`, where `data_in` is the original data to be encoded, `bit_flip` specifies errors introduced during transmission, and `clk` is the clock signal for synchronization. The output port `data_out` gives the decoded data approximating the original input data. The module uses two primary internal signals: `data_coded` for holding the encoded data and `data_augmented` for the modified encoded data after simulating bit flips. The Coder submodule handles the encoding, and the Decoder applies a voting mechanism to decode, helping identify and correct errors. The XOR operations between `data_coded` and `bit_flip` simulate the corruption in data transmission by toggling specific bits. This module effectively demonstrates error handling through encoding and decoding processes in communication systems.
