Module name: Test. Module specification: The `Test` module is designed to simulate the functionality of a Codec device. It utilizes input ports including a 16-bit `data_in` register for primary data input, a 48-bit `bit_flip` register to introduce errors by flipping bits, and a `clk` signal for synchronization. The output through the 16-bit `data_out` wire represents the Codec's processed result. Internally, these signals are connected to a `Codec` instance (uut) which processes based on the `data_in` and `bit_flip` under control of `clk`. The Verilog code defines an initial block setting `data_in`, `bit_flip`, and `clk` to zero at simulation start. Two always blocks manage dynamic operations: one toggling the `clk` every 10 ns, and another generating random values for `data_in` and setting a random bit in `bit_flip` every 5 ns. This setup effectively tests the Codec's response to varied input conditions and error scenarios in a controlled simulation environment.
