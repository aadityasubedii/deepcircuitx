Module-level comment: The `Test` module simulates a Codec device, feeding it with dynamic, random `data_in` and inducing errors via `bit_flip`. It operates on a toggling `clk` signal. Comprising initial conditions and always blocks for data generation and clock control, it tests Codec's behavior under varied scenarios, effectively verifying its functionality in a controlled environment.
