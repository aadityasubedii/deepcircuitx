It outputs a signal where each bit of the output is set to 1 if at least two corresponding bits of the input signals are 1. This is achieved through the logic operation `(a&b) | (b&c) | (a&c)`, providing a mechanism for fault tolerance or error correction by relying on the majority decision of multiple inputs."

Explanation: The input ports 'a', 'b', and 'c' are data signals that each are data_len bits wide. These ports represent the three input vectors over which the majority vote decision will be taken. Each bit in these vectors participates in a majority logic evaluation, where at least two of the three corresponding bits among 'a', 'b', and 'c' need to be high (1) for the resultant output bit to be high.\n\nOutput ports: out. Explanation: The output port 'out' is a data signal that is also data_len bits wide. This port provides the result of the majority voting logic performed on the input ports. Each bit of 'out' is determined by applying the majority logic `(a&b) | (b&c) | (a&c)` to the corresponding bits of inputs 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The result is a fault-tolerant or error-corrected version of the inputs, based on a majority rule."

The logic computation `(a&b) | (b&c) | (a&c)` is applied directly in the output assignment to establish the majority vote across the input signals, hence no intermediate storage or additional internal signals are required."
