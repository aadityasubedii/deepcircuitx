Module-level comment: The Voter module conducts a majority voting system for three data_len-bit-wide inputs (a, b, c), outputting a result where each bit is high if at least two corresponding bits of the inputs are high. It implements the logic `(a&b) | (b&c) | (a&c)` directly on the output wire 'out', efficiently providing fault tolerance through majority decision without internal buffering or additional logic blocks.
