Module name: Voter. Module specification: The Voter module is designed to implement a majority voting system for three input signals named 'a', 'b', and 'c', each being an array of `data_len` bits. The module utilizes a simple combinatorial logic to determine the output 'out', where each bit of 'out' is set to 1 if at least two corresponding bits from any of the three inputs are 1. This logic helps in fault tolerance or error correction by adhering to the majority decision rule across multiple inputs. The inputs 'a', 'b', and 'c' are data_len-bit-wide signals that serve as the vectors for the majority vote computation. The output 'out' is also a data_len-bit-wide signal, which is the result of applying the `(a&b) | (b&c) | (a&c)` logic to each corresponding bit of the input signals. There are no internal signals explicitly defined in the module; the aforementioned majority logic is applied directly in the output assignment expression which simplifies the design by avoiding intermediate stages or storage. The module is structured concisely without different blocks or sections, focusing solely on the implementation of the majority voting logic directly in the port assignment.
