Module-level comment: The Decoder module reads a 48-bit input (data_in), captures it on a rising clock edge (clk) into a register (data_in_reg), and divides it into three 16-bit sections. These sections are processed by a Voter module, which outputs a 16-bit value (data_out) based on a majority decision among the segments. This ensures synchronized and reliable output generation.
