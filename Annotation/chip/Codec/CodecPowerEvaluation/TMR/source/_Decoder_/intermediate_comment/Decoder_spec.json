    "spec": "Module name: Decoder. Module specification: The Decoder module is designed to process a 48-bit input data stream and generate a 16-bit output based on a consensus algorithm. It takes two input ports: 'data_in', a 48-bit vector that provides the data to be decoded and processed, and 'clk', a clock signal that triggers operations at its rising edge, particularly capturing the 'data_in' into a temporary register. The output port 'data_out' is a 16-bit vector that holds the result from an internal processing module called Voter, which utilizes a voting mechanism on three 16-bit segments of the input data. The internal signal 'data_in_reg', a 48-bit register, plays a crucial role in stabilizing the input data by capturing it on the clock's rising edge, ensuring consistent data supply to the Voter module. In the Verilog code, there is an 'always' block that captures 'data_in' into 'data_in_reg' at each positive edge of 'clk'. The Voter module, instantiated with a generic parameter indicating segment length, further processes the divided segments from 'data_in_reg', each covering 16 bits, and produces the module\u2019s output in 'data_out' based on presumably a majority decision among the segments.",
