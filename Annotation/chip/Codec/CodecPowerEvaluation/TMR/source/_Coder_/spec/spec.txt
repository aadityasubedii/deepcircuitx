Module name: Coder. Module specification: The "Coder" module is a digital circuit designed in Verilog for processing a 16-bit input signal `data_in` into a 48-bit output signal `data_out`. The functionality primarily involves capturing the 16-bit input signal on the rising edge of a clock signal `clk`, storing it in an internal 16-bit register named `data_in_reg`, and then tripling this registered data to produce a 48-bit output. The input ports include `data_in`, a 16-bit signal carrying the data to be processed, and `clk`, a clock signal that synchronizes data capturing. The single output port, `data_out`, outputs a 48-bit signal formed by concatenating the content of `data_in_reg` three times. Internally, the module contains the `data_in_reg` register, which temporarily holds the input data ensuring stability and synchronicity of the output data with the clock cycles. The code is structured into two primary blocks: an always block responsible for registering the input data at each positive clock edge, and an assign statement which manages the concatenation of the registered data to form the output. This setup provides a clear separation of sequential and combinational logic within the module.
