Module-level comment: The "Coder" module captures a 16-bit input data on the rising edge of a clock and triples it to produce a 48-bit output. It uses a 16-bit register `data_in_reg` for latching the input and an assign statement for concatenating the register's content three times to form `data_out`, ensuring synchronous operation with the clock.
