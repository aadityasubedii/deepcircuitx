The module first encodes the input data using the `Coder` sub-module, then applies a bit-wise XOR operation with the bit_flip signal to simulate data corruption or encoding modifications, and finally decodes this altered data with the `Decoder` sub-module to produce a 16-bit output data signal. This process might typically be used for error detection and correction in digital communication or data storage systems."

This data represents the core information being processed by the Codec module.\n- `bit_flip` is a 48-bit signal used to simulate data corruption or encoding changes via a bit-wise XOR operation after the data is encoded. This input is essential for testing the system's resilience or integrity under data alterations.\n- `clk` is the clock signal that synchronizes the operations of the encoding and decoding processes within the Codec module. This input ensures that all data processing is timed correctly relative to the system clock.\n\nOutput ports: [data_out].\nExplanation: \n- `data_out` is a 16-bit output signal that represents the decoded information, which should ideally match the original input data (`data_in`) if there is perfect error correction or if the `bit_flip` does not induce unrecoverable errors. It's the final output after the processes of encoding, possible corruption, and decoding.

This signal is crucial as it represents the encoded form of the data that will be subject to simulated modifications like a bit flip.\n- `data_augmented` is a 48-bit signal resulting from the XOR operation between `data_coded` and `bit_flip`. This operation represents the simulation of data corruption or intentional encoding variations. `data_augmented` serves as the input to the `Decoder` sub-module, which attempts to decode it back into a form comparable to the original `data_in`, effectively synthesizing the process of error correction or data recovery in practical scenarios."
