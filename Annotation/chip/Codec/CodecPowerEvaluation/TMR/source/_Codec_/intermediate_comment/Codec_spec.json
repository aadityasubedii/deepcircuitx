    "spec": "Module name: Codec. \nModule specification: The Codec module is tasked with encoding, modifying, and then decoding a 16-bit data signal, primarily for applications in error detection and correction in digital communications or data storage systems. It operates with three input ports: `data_in`, a 16-bit signal representing the original data; `bit_flip`, a 48-bit signal used to simulate data corruption or encoding changes; and `clk`, the clock signal ensuring synchronous operation. The single output port, `data_out`, carries the 16-bit decoded data, which should correspond to the original input data under perfect error correction conditions. Internally, the module utilizes two signals: `data_coded`, which is the 48-bit result of the encoding process handled by the `Coder` sub-module, and `data_augmented`, which is formed by a bit-wise XOR operation between `data_coded` and `bit_flip`, simulating data alteration. The `Decoder` sub-module then processes `data_augmented` to attempt recovery of the original input data. The module effectively integrates encoding and decoding processes, interleaved with a controllable corruption step, making it vital for testing and validating communication and storage system robustness under error-prone conditions.",
