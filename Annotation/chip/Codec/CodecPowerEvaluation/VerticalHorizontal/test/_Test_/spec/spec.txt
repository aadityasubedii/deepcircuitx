Module name: Test. 
Module specification: The Test module is designed to simulate the behavioral aspects of a codec system through integration with a submodule named Codec. Within the module, the following internal signals are utilized as inputs: a 16-bit register `data_in` which is dynamically assigned random 16-bit values used to feed varying data into the Codec; a 24-bit register `bit_flip` which sets a random single bit high to potentially simulate bit flipping in error handling scenarios; and a clock signal `clk` that toggles every 10ns to provide necessary synchronicity for updating the inputs. The output from the Codec submodule is held in the `data_out` wire, a 16-bit output reflecting the Codecâ€™s processing results. The Test module initiates by setting `data_in`, `bit_flip`, and `clk` to their default states. It includes a timing block to update `data_in` and `bit_flip` at different intervals, and another that manages the clock signal. This module primarily supports the testing and verifying of the Codec module's response to dynamic input conditions and timing sequences, thereby facilitating comprehensive functionality assessments through stimulated scenarios.
