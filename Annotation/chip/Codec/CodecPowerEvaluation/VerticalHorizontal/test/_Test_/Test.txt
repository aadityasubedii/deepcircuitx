Module-level comment: The Test module serves to simulate and verify a codec system by dynamically testing input scenarios through a Codec submodule. It initializes `data_in`, `bit_flip`, and `clk`, feeding them to Codec. Random 16-bit data and targeted single-bit flips are timed with a toggling clock to test Codec's response under varied and synchronized conditions, assessing its output via `data_out`.
