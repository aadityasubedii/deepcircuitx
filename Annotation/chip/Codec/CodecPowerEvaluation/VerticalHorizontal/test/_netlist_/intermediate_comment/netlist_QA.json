It takes a 16-bit input (`data_in`), encodes it into a 24-bit format using the `Coder` sub-module, then allows for artificial bit flipping (`bit_flip`) for simulation of transmission errors or other processes. The 24-bit result is then decoded back into a 16-bit output (`data_out`) using the `Decoder` sub-module. This module effectively demonstrates a digital communication system's typical error handling by encoding and decoding data, including intentional error introduction through bit flipping."

It represents the transformation of the 16-bit `data_in` into a more robust 24-bit format that can include redundancy for error checking or correction purposes in a communication system.\n- `data_augmented`: This is another 24-bit internal signal used to represent the intermediate state after the encoded data (`data_coded`) has undergone the simulated bit flipping defined by the `bit_flip` input. This signal feeds into the `Decoder` sub-module, where it is processed to retrieve a version of the original input data (`data_in`), potentially with errors introduced by the bit flips, mimicking a real-world data transmission scenario where data might get corrupted."
