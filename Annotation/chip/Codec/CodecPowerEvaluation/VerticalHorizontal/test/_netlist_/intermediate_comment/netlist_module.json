    "module": "Module-level comment: The Codec module simulates error handling in digital communications by encoding, error-inducing, and decoding data. It encodes a 16-bit input (`data_in`) into a 24-bit format using the `Coder` sub-module. Simulated errors are introduced via bitwise XOR between the `data_coded` and a `bit_flip` signal, forming `data_augmented`. Finally, the `Decoder` sub-module attempts to decode this augmented signal back to the original 16-bit `data_out`. Operations are synchronized with a clock input (`clk`), showcasing typical error correction flows in digital transmission systems."
