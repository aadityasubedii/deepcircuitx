Module name: Codec. Module specification: The Codec module is designed for simulating a digital communication system that handles errors through encoding and decoding processes. It processes a 16-bit input digital signal (`data_in`), which is encoded by the `Coder` sub-module into a 24-bit format represented as `data_coded`. This encoded signal can be artificially altered through bit flipping specified by a 24-bit `bit_flip` input to simulate transmission errors, producing the `data_augmented` signal. The `Decoder` sub-module then attempts to decode this potentially corrupted data back into the original 16-bit format, output as `data_out`. For internal signals, `data_coded` holds the 24-bit encoded data and `data_augmented` signifies the encoded data after simulated error introduction. The overall operation is synchronized with a clock signal (`clk`). This module encapsulates segments for encoding (handled by `Coder`), error introduction (via XOR operations between `data_coded` and `bit_flip`), and decoding (handled by `Decoder`), effectively demonstrating a simple error-corrective communication model.
