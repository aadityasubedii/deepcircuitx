    "spec": "Module name: Decoder. \nModule specification: The Decoder is a digital logic module designed in Verilog that processes a 24-bit encoded input (`data_in`) to detect and correct errors using parity calculations, synchronized by a clock signal (`clk`). It outputs a 16-bit corrected data (`data_out`). The module employs several internal signals including `data_in_reg` for storing input data on the clock's positive edge, `horizontal` and `vertical` for storing computed horizontal and vertical parities across 4x4-bit segments of `data_in_reg`, and `horizontal_missmatch` and `vertical_missmatch` for recording mismatches between the computed and provided parities. The key code sections include a clock-triggered block that captures input data into `data_in_reg`, and a combinational logic block that computes parities, checks for mismatches, and corrects the output. The calculation of horizontal and vertical parities and the detection of mismatches ensure that errors in the input data are accurately identified and corrected, thereby providing stable and reliable output.",

This ensures that the entire module processes a stable, unchanging input during its operation cycle.\n- `horizontal` is a 4-bit register where each bit represents the parity (even or odd) computed horizontally across four 4-bit segments of `data_in_reg`. It is mainly used to check if there is any mismatch between the computed horizontal parities and the horizontal parities provided in `data_in`.\n- `vertical` is another 4-bit register serving a similar purpose as `horizontal`, but it computes the parity vertically down the columns of the 4x4-bit matrix formed by segments of `data_in_reg`.\n- `horizontal_missmatch` is a 4-bit value that stores the result of the exclusive OR (XOR) operation between the `horizontal` parity and the respective 4 bits (bits[19:16]) extracted from `data_in_reg`. It indicates mismatches in horizontal parity.\n- `vertical_missmatch` is a 4-bit value comparable to `horizontal_missmatch` but it checks mismatches in vertical parity using XOR between the `vertical` parity and the respective bits (bits[23:20]) extracted from `data_in_reg`. This helps in identifying and locating parity errors along the vertical axis."
