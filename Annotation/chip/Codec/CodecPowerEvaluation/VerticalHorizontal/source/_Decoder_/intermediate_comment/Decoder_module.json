    "module": "Module-level comment: The Decoder module corrects encoding errors in a 24-bit input `data_in` using parity checks and outputs a corrected 16-bit `data_out`. It computes and compares horizontal and vertical parities of 4x4-bit segments of the stored input on the clock's positive edge, detects mismatches, and adjusts the output accordingly. Synchronization and error correction are managed via multiple internal registers and logic blocks triggered by a clock signal."
