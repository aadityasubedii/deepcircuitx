It operates on the edge of a clock signal 'clk'. Specifically, this module computes horizontal and vertical parity of 4x4-bit segments of `data_in`, compares these with provided parities, identifies mismatches, and corrects the output based on the mismatch information."

This ensures that the entire module processes a stable, unchanging input during its operation cycle.\n- `horizontal` is a 4-bit register where each bit represents the parity (even or odd) computed horizontally across four 4-bit segments of `data_in_reg`. It is mainly used to check if there is any mismatch between the computed horizontal parities and the horizontal parities provided in `data_in`.\n- `vertical` is another 4-bit register serving a similar purpose as `horizontal`, but it computes the parity vertically down the columns of the 4x4-bit matrix formed by segments of `data_in_reg`.\n- `horizontal_missmatch` is a 4-bit value that stores the result of the exclusive OR (XOR) operation between the `horizontal` parity and the respective 4 bits (bits[19:16]) extracted from `data_in_reg`. It indicates mismatches in horizontal parity.\n- `vertical_missmatch` is a 4-bit value comparable to `horizontal_missmatch` but it checks mismatches in vertical parity using XOR between the `vertical` parity and the respective bits (bits[23:20]) extracted from `data_in_reg`. This helps in identifying and locating parity errors along the vertical axis."
