Module name: Decoder. 
Module specification: The Decoder is a digital logic module designed in Verilog that processes a 24-bit encoded input (`data_in`) to detect and correct errors using parity calculations, synchronized by a clock signal (`clk`). It outputs a 16-bit corrected data (`data_out`). The module employs several internal signals including `data_in_reg` for storing input data on the clock's positive edge, `horizontal` and `vertical` for storing computed horizontal and vertical parities across 4x4-bit segments of `data_in_reg`, and `horizontal_missmatch` and `vertical_missmatch` for recording mismatches between the computed and provided parities. The key code sections include a clock-triggered block that captures input data into `data_in_reg`, and a combinational logic block that computes parities, checks for mismatches, and corrects the output. The calculation of horizontal and vertical parities and the detection of mismatches ensure that errors in the input data are accurately identified and corrected, thereby providing stable and reliable output.
