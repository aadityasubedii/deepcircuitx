    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'Coder' module processes a 16-bit input (`data_in`) synchronized by a clock (`clk`) to produce a 24-bit output (`data_out`). The lower 16 bits of `data_out` directly mirror `data_in`, while the upper 8 bits are generated through XOR operations on groups and columns of `data_in_reg` bits. These operations enhance data integrity for subsequent use. The processing involves a sequential block for data registration and a combinational logic block for data manipulation."
