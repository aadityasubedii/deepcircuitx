Module name: Codec. Module specification: The "Codec" module is designed for encoding and decoding operations tailored to maintain data integrity, especially during simulated error conditions in communication systems. It functions by taking a 16-bit input error-free data, "data_in," and encoding it via the "Coder" submodule into a 24-bit encoded output, "data_coded." This encoded data is subsequently augmented through a bitwise XOR operation with a 24-bit "bit_flip" input signal, generating the "data_augmented" signal that simulates noise or error conditions. The augmented data is then decoded by the "Decoder" submodule to produce a 16-bit output, "data_out," which ideally matches the original input if error correction is successful. Input ports include "data_in," a primary data input, "bit_flip," used for error simulation, and "clk," the clock signal that orchestrates the synchronous operation of the codec process. The output port "data_out" delivers the recovered data. Internal signals such as "data_coded" and "data_augmented" facilitate the intermediate steps of encoding and simulating transmission errors respectively. The main blocks of the Verilog code correspond to the Coder and Decoder submodule instances, and an XOR operation highlighting the module's essential encoding, error introduction, and decoding sequences.
