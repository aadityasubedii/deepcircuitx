    "module": "Module-level comment: The Codec module encodes, modifies, and decodes 16-bit input data to ensure integrity. It involves encoding through 'Coder', XOR operation with 'bit_flip' to simulate errors, and decoding via 'Decoder', synched by 'clk'. Designed to test error-handling in communication systems."
