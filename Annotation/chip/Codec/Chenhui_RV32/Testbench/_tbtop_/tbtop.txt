Module-level comment: The `tbtop` module serves as a testbench for simulating a RISC-V processor system, focusing on the IRAM. It generates system clock and reset signals using registers `d_sys_clk` and `d_sys_rst_n`, loads instructions from a hex file into memory `imem`, and interfaces with the `CHIP_TOP` module to test processor operations. The testbench monitors and verifies memory content and system behavior during simulation, helping validate processor initialization and execution sequences.
