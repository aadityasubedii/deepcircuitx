Module name: tbtop. Module specification: The `tbtop` module functions as a top-level testbench for simulating a RISC-V processor system within a `CHIP_TOP` hardware setup, primarily focusing on the Instruction RAM (IRAM) interaction and verification. The module lacks external input and output ports, emphasizing its role in internal simulation rather than interfacing with externals. Key internal signals include `d_sys_clk` for generating a 50 MHz system clock, `d_sys_rst_n` for controlling the system reset operations, `sys_clk` and `sys_rst_n` that interface the generated clock and reset signals to the CHIP_TOP module, an index register `i`, and an 8-bit wide memory array `imem` that preload instruction data. The major code blocks in the module include initialization sequences for resetting and clock generation, preloading and verifying memory content of IRAM using a hex file, and test termination with debug messages after a specific simulation period. This setup ensures comprehensive testing of the processorâ€™s initialization and operation relative to memory configurations and data handling.
