    "spec": "Module name: mux2. Module specification: The 'mux2' module is a Verilog module designed to function as a 2-to-1 multiplexer. It prioritizes selections between two 32-bit input signals based on a single-bit selection signal. The module interprets the input `sel`, which decides which input data (`data0_in` or `data1_in`) is forwarded to the output `data_out`. Specifically, if `sel` is high (`1`), `data1_in` is selected, and if `sel` is low (`0`), `data0_in` is selected. Regarding ports, the module includes three input ports (`sel`, `data0_in`, and `data1_in`) where `sel` determines the selection of data and `data0_in` and `data1_in` are the data options. There is one output port, `data_out`, which outputs the selected data. There are no internal signals as the module employs a simple conditional operation embedded within an `assign` statement to achieve its functionality. The logic is kept concise and efficient without additional internal complexities, facilitating straightforward synthesis and implementation in digital circuits. The entire operation is encapsulated neatly within the module without additional subsections, ensuring simple integration and maintenance.",

If `sel` is high (1), `data1_in` is passed to the output `data_out`; if `sel` is low (0), `data0_in` is passed to the output.

When `sel` is high (`1`), `data1_in` is selected; when low (`0`), `data0_in` is selected.\n- `data0_in` is a 32-bit input signal representing the first data option for the multiplexer.\n- `data1_in` is also a 32-bit input signal representing the second data option for the multiplexer.

It mirrors `data0_in` if `sel` is `0`, and `data1_in` if `sel` is `1`. This is the result of the multiplexing operation performed by the module."
