    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mux2' module is a 2-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog, selecting between two 32-bit inputs (`data0_in`, `data1_in`) based on a 1-bit selector (`sel`). It outputs the selected data through `data_out`. Selection is achieved using a simple conditional expression in an `assign` statement, directly routing the chosen input to the output without internal signal processing, ensuring efficiency and clarity in functionality."
