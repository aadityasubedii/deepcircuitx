    "module": "Module-level comment: The `forward_unit` module manages data hazards in pipeline architectures by selectively forwarding data from EX/MEM and MEM/WB stages to the execution stage. It uses control logic-driven always blocks to compare register addresses and control signals, setting outputs `forwardA`, `forwardB`, `forwardC`, and `forwardD`. These outputs decide the data forwarding paths to resolve RAW hazards and ensure correct data flow across pipeline stages, enhancing execution reliability and data coherence."
