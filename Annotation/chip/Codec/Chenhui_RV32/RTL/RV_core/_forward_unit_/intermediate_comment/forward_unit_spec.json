    "spec": "Module name: forward_unit. Module specification: The `forward_unit` module in Verilog is designed to handle data hazards in pipeline architectures by controlling the source of operand data for execution stages, thereby resolving potential read-after-write (RAW) hazards. It has various input ports including `rs_reg1_addr`, `rs_reg2_addr` for source operand addresses; `id_ex_rs_reg1_addr`, `id_ex_rs_reg2_addr` for operand addresses used during the execute stage; `ex_mem_wb_addr`, `mem_wb_addr` for register write-back addresses in their respective stages; `ex_mem_alu_result`, `mem_wb_alu_result` for ALU results from those stages; and control signals `ex_mem_reg_wr`, `mem_wb_reg_wr`, and `ex_mem_mem_wr` that indicate whether write-backs or memory writes occur in stages EX/MEM and MEM/WB. The outputs include `forwardA`, `forwardB`, which determine the source of operand data for the ID/EX stage's operands, and `forwardC`, `forwardD` that handle specialized forwarding including potential matching conditions. Internally, the module processes these inputs using logical checks to set the forwarding paths, ensuring that data hazards are avoided by selecting the correct data source, whether it is immediate data or data from a forwarding path. The control logic in the module comprises several always blocks: one for determining the value of `forwardA` based on write-back conditions and address matchings; another for `forwardB` handling similar logic for second operand address; a block for `forwardC` checking memory write matches; and a block for `forwardD` setting control paths for forwarding based on raw register addresses. This structured approach ensures the module effectively manages data dependencies across different pipeline stages, maintaining data integrity and execution correctness.",
