It decides whether to forward data from the EX/MEM or MEM/WB stages to the input of the execution stage to resolve read-after-write (RAW) hazards. This is critical for maintaining correct data flow and operation sequencing in pipeline architectures. The control signals `forwardA`, `forwardB`, `forwardC`, and `forwardD` are set based on specific conditions comparing register addresses and control signals to manage these forwarding decisions efficiently."

It is used in forwarding logic for possible memory-to-memory forwarding or preventing data corruption due to write operations.\n- `ex_mem_wb_addr`: This is the address of the register that will be written to during the write-back phase of the EX/MEM stage. It's crucial for determining which data to forward to upcoming instructions to resolve RAW hazards.\n- `mem_wb_addr`: Similar to `ex_mem_wb_addr`, this is the target write-back register address for the MEM/WB stage. It is essential for forwarding decisions involving later stages of instruction execution.\n- `ex_mem_alu_result`: This holds the ALU computation result from the EX/MEM stage. This value can be forwarded to subsequent instructions if needed to resolve data dependencies or hazards.\n- `mem_wb_alu_result`: This is the ALU result from the MEM/WB stage and may be forwarded similarly to handle dependencies and ensure data integrity across stages."
