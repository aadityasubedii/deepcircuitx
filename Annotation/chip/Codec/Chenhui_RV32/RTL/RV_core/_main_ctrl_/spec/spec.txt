Module name: main_ctrl. 
Module specification: The `main_ctrl` module functions as a core control unit within a processor, responsible for setting various control signals based on the incoming instruction type. It operates based on inputs `instruct_op`, a 7-bit opcode that identifies the nature of the operation (Load, Store, Arithmetic, etc.), and `instruct_func3`, a 3-bit function code adding specifics primarily for memory operations. The output ports include various control signals like `imm_add_data0_sel`, `rd_data_sel`, and `exAlu_op` that manage operand selections, register data selection, memory operations, and the execution unitâ€™s operations. Internally, the module utilizes defined signals such as `R_OP`, `LD_OP`, and `I_OP` for decoding the opcode to set appropriate flags and outputs. The internal logic is divided into two primary blocks: one (`always @(instruct_op)`) handles most operations and signal settings based on the opcode in a combinational manner; the other block (`always @(*)`) specifically sets `mem_op` based on the instruction type being Load or Store, using `instruct_func3` to further specify the memory operation type. This controlled assignment ensures accurate operations handling across different functional requirements of a processor's control unit.
