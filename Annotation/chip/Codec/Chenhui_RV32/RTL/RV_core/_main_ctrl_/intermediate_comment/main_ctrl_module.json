    "module": "Module-level comment: The `main_ctrl` module serves as the control unit in a processor, setting control signals based on instruction types identified by the 7-bit opcode (`instruct_op`) and 3-bit function code (`instruct_func3`). It outputs various control flags for ALU operations, memory access, and register manipulation. Logic is implemented using two primary combinational blocks, one for setting most control signals based on opcode, and another for defining memory operations using function codes specifically for Load and Store instructions."
