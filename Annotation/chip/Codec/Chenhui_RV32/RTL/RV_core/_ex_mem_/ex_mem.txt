Module-level comment: The 'ex_mem' module serves as a pipeline register in a pipelined processor, transferring execution stage results and control signals to the memory stage. It updates outputs upon the rising clock edge or resets outputs on the falling edge of the active-low reset signal. This module ensures stable data transfer between stages using registers for each input, organized in multiple always blocks, each handling specific signals for streamlined design and functionality.
