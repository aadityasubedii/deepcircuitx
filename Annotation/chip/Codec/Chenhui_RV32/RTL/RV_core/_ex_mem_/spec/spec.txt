Module name: ex_mem. 
Module specification: The 'ex_mem' module is designed for a pipelined processor to interface between the execution and memory stages, functioning primarily as a pipeline register. It handles the transfer of various execution results and control signals, ensuring a seamless data flow through the processor stages upon each clock cycle or system reset. The module has several input ports: 'clk' (clock signal), 'rstn' (active-low reset), 'reg_wr_line_in', 'mem2reg_sel_line_in', 'mem_wr_line_in', 'mem_rd_line_in' (control signals for write, memory select, and read operations respectively), 'mem_op_line_in' (type of memory operation), 'alu_ex_result_line_in' (result from the ALU), 'reg2_data_line_in' (register data destined for memory), and 'reg_wb_addr_line_in' (write-back address). The outputs correspond directly to these inputs and are hold registers for ensuring values are passed correctly to the next stage. There are no internal signals within this module; all functionality is directly associated with passing inputs to outputs based on clock and reset conditions. The code is organized into separate always blocks, each triggered by the clock's rising edge or the reset's falling edge, to update or reset output registers depending on the reset state. These blocks handle groups of signals or individual signals, maintaining clarity and modularity in the design, which simplifies verifying and modifying the pipeline's behavior.
