It monitors the incoming instruction type and decides whether execution should continue normally or if it should be altered to handle potential conflicts between instructions due to data dependencies. The module outputs signals to control whether to select alternative control paths, flush instructions, select the next program counter source, and stop program counter updates based on the current instruction and the comparison of two register values. This helps in maintaining correct program execution order and data integrity in pipelined processors."

These are used to compare register values to determine the outcome of branch conditions within the module.\n- instruct_data_in is a 32-bit input representing the current instruction being executed. The module uses specific bits from this input to decode the type of the instruction and the specific operation, which are crucial in determining the control flow within the processor.\n\nOutput ports: ctrl_mux_sel, if_flush, pc_mux_sel, pc_stop.\nExplanation: \n- ctrl_mux_sel is an output signal that controls multiplexer selection for the next instruction or data path, based on detection of hazards.\n- if_flush is an output signal that, when activated, clears the instruction fetch stage of the pipeline to prevent incorrect executions, typically used in case of taken branches or mispredictions.\n- pc_mux_sel is an output signal that selects between different sources for the program counter, affecting where the processor fetches the next instruction from.\n- pc_stop is an output signal that when asserted, stops updating the program counter to halt fetching new instructions, useful in scenarios where current execution paths need to be evaluated or altered due to branch outcomes."

It is used to decide if the specific instruction branching logic should be applied.\n- B_TYPE is a local parameter used to identify the opcode of branch instructions. It helps in decoding if the current instruction is a conditional branch, which requires special hazard handling.\n- BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU are all local parameters defining specific branch conditions.
