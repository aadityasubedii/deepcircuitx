    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'hazard_detec' module identifies and manages execution hazards in pipelined processors, mainly for branch and jump instructions in RISC-V architecture. It inputs instruction and register data, evaluates branch conditions using internal parameters for different jump and branch types, and outputs control signals to adjust the instruction flow \u2014 such as multiplexer control, pipeline flushing, and program counter management \u2014 ensuring correct execution sequencing and data integrity."
