    "spec": "Module name: hazard_detec. Module specification: The 'hazard_detec' module is engineered for detecting and addressing hazards in pipelined processors, notably within the RISC-V architecture which involves branch and jump instructions. The module has four 32-bit input ports; 'rs_reg1_rdata' and 'rs_reg2_rdata' to fetch data from source registers, and 'instruct_data_in' to access the current instruction data. The output consists of four signals: 'ctrl_mux_sel', 'if_flush', 'pc_mux_sel', and 'pc_stop', driving the selection logic for multiplexers, instruction flushing, program counter source selection, and program counter updates respectively. Internally, the module employs parameters like J_TYPE and B_TYPE to identify jump and branch instructions, and others such as BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU to determine specific branch conditions based on register comparisons. The control flow is determined by a combinational logic block structured around an 'always' block responding to changes in 'instruct_data_in'. This block decodes the instruction type and branch conditions to set the outputs appropriately, managing alternate execution paths, flushing the pipeline, and halting the program counter as necessary for correct instruction execution and data integrity in the pipeline.",

It monitors the incoming instruction type and decides whether execution should continue normally or if it should be altered to handle potential conflicts between instructions due to data dependencies. The module outputs signals to control whether to select alternative control paths, flush instructions, select the next program counter source, and stop program counter updates based on the current instruction and the comparison of two register values.

These are used to compare register values to determine the outcome of branch conditions within the module.\n- instruct_data_in is a 32-bit input representing the current instruction being executed. The module uses specific bits from this input to decode the type of the instruction and the specific operation, which are crucial in determining the control flow within the processor.\n\nOutput ports: ctrl_mux_sel, if_flush, pc_mux_sel, pc_stop.\nExplanation: \n- ctrl_mux_sel is an output signal that controls multiplexer selection for the next instruction or data path, based on detection of hazards.\n- if_flush is an output signal that, when activated, clears the instruction fetch stage of the pipeline to prevent incorrect executions, typically used in case of taken branches or mispredictions.\n- pc_mux_sel is an output signal that selects between different sources for the program counter, affecting where the processor fetches the next instruction from.\n- pc_stop is an output signal that when asserted, stops updating the program counter to halt fetching new instructions, useful in scenarios where current execution paths need to be evaluated or altered due to branch outcomes."

It is used to decide if the specific instruction branching logic should be applied.\n- B_TYPE is a local parameter used to identify the opcode of branch instructions. It helps in decoding if the current instruction is a conditional branch, which requires special hazard handling.\n- BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU are all local parameters defining specific branch conditions. Each corresponds to a different type of branch instruction:\n  - BEQ (Branch if Equal): Checks if two register values are equal.\n  - BNE (Branch if Not Equal): Checks if two register values are not equal.\n  - BLT (Branch if Less Than): Compares two register values to determine if the first is less than the second.\n  - BGE (Branch if Greater or Equal): Compares two register values to determine if the first is greater than or equal to the second.\n  - BLTU (Branch if Less Than Unsigned): Compares two register values as unsigned numbers to check if the first is less than the second.\n  - BGEU (Branch if Greater or Equal Unsigned): Compares two register values as unsigned numbers to determine if the first is greater than or equal to the second.\nThese parameters are crucial in the control logic to manage instruction flow based on comparison outcomes, thereby maintaining the integrity and correctness of program execution in pipelined processors."

Module specification: The 'hazard_detec' module is engineered for detecting and addressing hazards in pipelined processors, notably within the RISC-V architecture which involves branch and jump instructions. The module has four 32-bit input ports; 'rs_reg1_rdata' and 'rs_reg2_rdata' to fetch data from source registers, and 'instruct_data_in' to access the current instruction data. The output consists of four signals: 'ctrl_mux_sel', 'if_flush', 'pc_mux_sel', and 'pc_stop', driving the selection logic for multiplexers, instruction flushing, program counter source selection, and program counter updates respectively. Internally, the module employs parameters like J_TYPE and B_TYPE to identify jump and branch instructions, and others such as BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU to determine specific branch conditions based on register comparisons. The control flow is determined by a combinational logic block structured around an 'always' block responding to changes in 'instruct_data_in'. This block decodes the instruction type and branch conditions to set the outputs appropriately, managing alternate execution paths, flushing the pipeline, and halting the program counter as necessary for correct instruction execution and data integrity in the pipeline."
