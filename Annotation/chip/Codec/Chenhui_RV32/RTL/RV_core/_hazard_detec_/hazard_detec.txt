Module-level comment: The 'hazard_detec' module identifies and manages execution hazards in pipelined processors, mainly for branch and jump instructions in RISC-V architecture. It inputs instruction and register data, evaluates branch conditions using internal parameters for different jump and branch types, and outputs control signals to adjust the instruction flow — such as multiplexer control, pipeline flushing, and program counter management — ensuring correct execution sequencing and data integrity.
