Module name: hazard_detec. Module specification: The 'hazard_detec' module is engineered for detecting and addressing hazards in pipelined processors, notably within the RISC-V architecture which involves branch and jump instructions. The module has four 32-bit input ports; 'rs_reg1_rdata' and 'rs_reg2_rdata' to fetch data from source registers, and 'instruct_data_in' to access the current instruction data. The output consists of four signals: 'ctrl_mux_sel', 'if_flush', 'pc_mux_sel', and 'pc_stop', driving the selection logic for multiplexers, instruction flushing, program counter source selection, and program counter updates respectively. Internally, the module employs parameters like J_TYPE and B_TYPE to identify jump and branch instructions, and others such as BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU to determine specific branch conditions based on register comparisons. The control flow is determined by a combinational logic block structured around an 'always' block responding to changes in 'instruct_data_in'. This block decodes the instruction type and branch conditions to set the outputs appropriately, managing alternate execution paths, flushing the pipeline, and halting the program counter as necessary for correct instruction execution and data integrity in the pipeline.
