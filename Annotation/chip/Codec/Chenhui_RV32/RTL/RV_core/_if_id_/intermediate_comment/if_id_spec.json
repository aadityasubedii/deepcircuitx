It effectively handles the program counter (PC) and instruction data synchronization with the system clock and reset conditions. This module features several input and output ports: `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `rstn` (active-low reset which clears the PC), `if_flush` (flush signal to reset the PC during certain conditions like branch mispredictions), `PC_line_in` (incoming PC value from the fetch stage), and `instruct_data_line_in` (instruction data from the fetch stage). The output ports include `PC_line_out` (PC value going to the decode stage, controlled based on reset and flush conditions) and `instruct_data_line_out` (instruction data sent to the decode stage, directly mapped from input). No internal signals are employed in this module, emphasizing a direct and efficient data handling strategy. The code structure comprises two main blocks: an always block sensitive to the positive edge of `clk` and the negative edge of `rstn` for configuring the `PC_line_out` based on reset and flush conditions, and a continuous assignment statement for directly mapping the `instruct_data_line_in` to `instruct_data_line_out`, ensuring a consistent flow of instruction data to the decode stage without alteration.",

The module handles crucial conditions such as reset and flush signals. On reset (active low), or when the flush signal is high, the module resets the PC output (`PC_line_out`) to zero. Otherwise, the PC line is passed through unchanged from the input (`PC_line_in`).

It ensures that all operations within the `if_id` module occur in sync with the system clock.\n- `rstn`: The active-low reset signal. When this signal is de-asserted (low), it triggers a reset in the module, causing the program counter output to be set to zero.\n- `if_flush`: A control signal that, when set high, causes the module to flush the current program counter value by setting it to zero. This is typically used in branch prediction errors and similar scenarios.\n- `PC_line_in`: The input signal carrying the program counter value from the fetch stage. This value is either passed through or reset based on the `if_flush` and `rstn` signals.\n- `instruct_data_line_in`: The input signal carrying the instruction data. This data is transferred directly from the fetch to the decode stage without alteration.\n\nOutput ports: `PC_line_out`, `instruct_data_line_out`.\nExplanation:\n- `PC_line_out`: The output signal representing the program counter value sent to the decode stage. This value is controlled based on reset and flush conditions.\n- `instruct_data_line_out`: The output signal that directly passes the instruction data received from `instruct_data_line_in`. This maintains a continuous flow of instruction data to the decode stage, independent of reset or flush conditions."
