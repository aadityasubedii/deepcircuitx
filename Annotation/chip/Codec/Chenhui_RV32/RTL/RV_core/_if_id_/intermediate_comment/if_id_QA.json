The module handles crucial conditions such as reset and flush signals. On reset (active low), or when the flush signal is high, the module resets the PC output (`PC_line_out`) to zero. Otherwise, the PC line is passed through unchanged from the input (`PC_line_in`). The instruction data is directly passed from the input (`instruct_data_line_in`) to the output (`instruct_data_line_out`) without any alteration, maintaining the data flow integrity between the pipeline stages."

It ensures that all operations within the `if_id` module occur in sync with the system clock.\n- `rstn`: The active-low reset signal. When this signal is de-asserted (low), it triggers a reset in the module, causing the program counter output to be set to zero.\n- `if_flush`: A control signal that, when set high, causes the module to flush the current program counter value by setting it to zero. This is typically used in branch prediction errors and similar scenarios.\n- `PC_line_in`: The input signal carrying the program counter value from the fetch stage. This value is either passed through or reset based on the `if_flush` and `rstn` signals.\n- `instruct_data_line_in`: The input signal carrying the instruction data. This data is transferred directly from the fetch to the decode stage without alteration.\n\nOutput ports: `PC_line_out`, `instruct_data_line_out`.\nExplanation:\n- `PC_line_out`: The output signal representing the program counter value sent to the decode stage. This value is controlled based on reset and flush conditions.\n- `instruct_data_line_out`: The output signal that directly passes the instruction data received from `instruct_data_line_in`. This maintains a continuous flow of instruction data to the decode stage, independent of reset or flush conditions."

The operation depends solely on transferring and conditionally controlling the `PC_line_out` based on the inputs `PC_line_in`, `clk`, `rstn`, and `if_flush`. The module directly assigns the value from `instruct_data_line_in` to `instruct_data_line_out`, also without utilizing any internal buffering or additional signals. This results in a straightforward implementation focusing primarily on passing and controlling data based on external signals mandated by the clock, reset, and flush conditions."
