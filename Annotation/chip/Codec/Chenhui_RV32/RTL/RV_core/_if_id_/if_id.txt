Module-level comment: The `if_id` module transfers instruction data and PC between pipeline stages, ensuring synchronization with the clock and handling reset and flush conditions. It uses an always block for conditional PC handling based on `clk`, `rstn`, and `if_flush`, and a direct assignment for uninterrupted instruction data flow from `instruct_data_line_in` to `out`.
