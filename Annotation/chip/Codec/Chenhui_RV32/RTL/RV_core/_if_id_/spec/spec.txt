Module name: if_id. 
Module specification: The `if_id` module is designed to facilitate data transfer between the fetch and decode stages of a pipeline architecture in processor design. It effectively handles the program counter (PC) and instruction data synchronization with the system clock and reset conditions. This module features several input and output ports: `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `rstn` (active-low reset which clears the PC), `if_flush` (flush signal to reset the PC during certain conditions like branch mispredictions), `PC_line_in` (incoming PC value from the fetch stage), and `instruct_data_line_in` (instruction data from the fetch stage). The output ports include `PC_line_out` (PC value going to the decode stage, controlled based on reset and flush conditions) and `instruct_data_line_out` (instruction data sent to the decode stage, directly mapped from input). No internal signals are employed in this module, emphasizing a direct and efficient data handling strategy. The code structure comprises two main blocks: an always block sensitive to the positive edge of `clk` and the negative edge of `rstn` for configuring the `PC_line_out` based on reset and flush conditions, and a continuous assignment statement for directly mapping the `instruct_data_line_in` to `instruct_data_line_out`, ensuring a consistent flow of instruction data to the decode stage without alteration.
