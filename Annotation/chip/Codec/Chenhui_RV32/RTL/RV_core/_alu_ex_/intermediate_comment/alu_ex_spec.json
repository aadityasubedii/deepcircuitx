    "spec": "Module name: alu_ex. \nModule specification: The 'alu_ex' module is a versatile Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) implemented in Verilog, designed to perform a variety of arithmetic and logical operations based on control inputs. It accepts two 32-bit data inputs `data0` and `data1`, a 5-bit control signal `alu_ctl` which dictates the operation to be performed, and a 5-bit shift amount `shamt` used for shift operations. The output of the ALU is a 32-bit value `ALU_result` that stores the computed result, and a 1-bit signal `Zero` that indicates whether the result is zero. Internally, the module uses a signal `con_flag` that facilitates the correct handling of signed comparisons by checking if the most significant bits of `data0` and `data1` are equal.\nThe code structure includes definitions of parameterized constants for easy reconfiguration of operation codes, a combinational logic block using a `case` statement to execute the operation corresponding to the `alu_ctl` value, and the calculation of the `Zero` flag. Operations supported include addition, subtraction, logical shifts (left and right), arithmetic shifts, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and set less than operations for both unsigned and signed comparisons.

Each specific value corresponds to a different arithmetic or logical function.\n- `data0`: This is a 32-bit input that acts as the first operand in operations performed by the ALU.\n- `data1`: This is a 32-bit input that serves as the second operand in many of the ALU operations. For shift operations, only the lowest 5 bits are used.\n- `shamt`: This is a 5-bit input used as the shift amount in shift operations.\n\n**Output ports**: `ALU_result`, `Zero`.\n**Explanation**:\n- `ALU_result`: This is a 32-bit output where the result of the computation performed by the ALU is stored. Depending on the operation, this could be the result of arithmetic calculations or logical operations.\n- `Zero`: This output is a single bit that indicates whether the result stored in `ALU_result` is zero. If `ALU_result` equals zero, the `Zero` signal is set high (1); otherwise, it is set low (0).

It is determined by checking if the most significant bits (the sign bits) of `data0` and `data1` are equal. If they are equal, `con_flag` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. This helps handle the signed comparison properly by determining the workflow in signed conditions, especially when differentiating between signed values that might appear to be larger or smaller simply due to their sign. This signal is crucial for correctly setting the `ALU_result` during signed comparison operations like SLT where the comparison logic can depend on whether the numbers being compared have the same sign or not."
