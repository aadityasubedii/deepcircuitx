Module-level comment: The 'alu_ex' Verilog module is an Arithmetic Logic Unit designed to perform various arithmetic and logical operations. It takes two 32-bit inputs, a shift value, and a control signal to determine the operation to execute. The output is the operation result and a zero flag indicating if the result is zero. Internally, it uses combinational logic with a `case` statement for operation selection, supporting addition, subtraction, shifts, and bitwise operations guided by predefined operation codes.
