Module-level comment: The imm_gen module decodes the immediate values from a 32-bit instruction based on the opcode (lower 7 bits of `data_in`). Utilizing an always block with a case statement, it sign-extends and adjusts the values catering to different instruction types like I, S, U, B, and J. Outputs the processed 32-bit `data_out` for further use in processor operations.
