It uses different types of immediate data extraction and sign extension based on the opcode. This is typically used for instruction decoding in processors, where the immediate value is extracted from an instruction opcode and used in subsequent operations. The module supports multiple operation types such as I-type, S-type, U-type, B-type, J-type, etc., each handling the extraction differently to match the instruction set architecture specifications."
