Module name: imm_gen. Module specification: The imm_gen module is designed for decoding immediate values from a 32-bit instruction input based on its opcode, which is employed frequently in processor instruction sets. The module has a single 32-bit input port, `data_in`, which receives the entire instruction containing both the immediate value and the opcode. The lower 7 bits of `data_in` represent the opcode that dictates the extraction and sign-extension mechanism of the immediate value. The output of the module, `data_out`, is a 32-bit port that delivers the decoded immediate value ready for further processing in the CPU's operations. Internally, the module utilizes a wire named `opcode`, which isolates the 7-bit opcode from `data_in` for use in conditional logic. The Verilog code features an always block that employs a multiplexed case statement. Depending on the identified opcode, this block executes different bit slicing and concatenation operations defined for various instruction types like I-type, S-type, U-type, B-type, and J-type, sign-extending and adjusting the immediate value accordingly. The immediate values are processed as per the specification for each instruction set architecture delineated by opcodes, handling different decoding schemes to maintain the accuracy and efficiency prerequisite in instruction set decoding operations.
