    "spec": "Module name: regfile.\nModule specification: The 'regfile' module simulates a register file, crucial in processors for temporary data storage during computations. It is synchronized by a clock signal 'clk' and features an active-low reset 'rst_n'. The module supports data writing to registers controlled by a write enable signal 'wr_reg_en', and a 5-bit write address 'wr_reg_addr' using 32-bit input data 'wr_wdata'. Additionally, it handles data forwarding with a 2-bit input 'forwardD' to resolve read-after-write hazards. Reading from the register is done via two 5-bit inputs 'rs_reg1_addr' and 'rs_reg2_addr', the outputs of which are 32-bit values 'rs_reg1_rdata' and 'rs_reg2_rdata', respectively. The internal 32x32-bit 'reg_bank' array stores the register values. The module has three main blocks: the reset and write block, which sets registers to zero on reset or updates them on write-enable; and two separate blocks for managing output data to 'rs_reg1_rdata' and 'rs_reg2_rdata' based on forwarding conditions or direct register access, thus ensuring data integrity and timely availability post any writes.",

The module provides functionality for writing data to a specific register and reading data from one or two specified registers based on addresses provided. It handles synchronous reset and data writing based on the clock signal, 'clk'. Writes to the register are controlled by the 'wr_reg_en' signal and the address to write at 'wr_reg_addr'. The module also handles data forwarding to bypass potential read-after-write hazards where recent write data is forwarded to the read outputs as specified by the 'forwardD' signal. On reset (active low on 'rst_n'), all registers are cleared to 0. During normal operation, writes occur conditionally based on 'wr_reg_en', and reads are either direct from the register bank or forwarded through 'wr_wdata' depending on the 'forwardD' control."

All state changes within the module occur on the rising edge of this clock.\n- rst_n: Active-low reset input used to initialize all registers and outputs of the module to a default state (in this case, zero).\n- wr_reg_en: Write enable signal that allows data to be written into the register file.

It is synchronized by a clock signal 'clk' and features an active-low reset 'rst_n'. The module supports data writing to registers controlled by a write enable signal 'wr_reg_en', and a 5-bit write address 'wr_reg_addr' using 32-bit input data 'wr_wdata'. Additionally, it handles data forwarding with a 2-bit input 'forwardD' to resolve read-after-write hazards. Reading from the register is done via two 5-bit inputs 'rs_reg1_addr' and 'rs_reg2_addr', the outputs of which are 32-bit values 'rs_reg1_rdata' and 'rs_reg2_rdata', respectively. The internal 32x32-bit 'reg_bank' array stores the register values. The module has three main blocks: the reset and write block, which sets registers to zero on reset or updates them on write-enable; and two separate blocks for managing output data to 'rs_reg1_rdata' and 'rs_reg2_rdata' based on forwarding conditions or direct register access, thus ensuring data integrity and timely availability post any writes."
