The module provides functionality for writing data to a specific register and reading data from one or two specified registers based on addresses provided. It handles synchronous reset and data writing based on the clock signal, 'clk'. Writes to the register are controlled by the 'wr_reg_en' signal and the address to write at 'wr_reg_addr'. The module also handles data forwarding to bypass potential read-after-write hazards where recent write data is forwarded to the read outputs as specified by the 'forwardD' signal. On reset (active low on 'rst_n'), all registers are cleared to 0. During normal operation, writes occur conditionally based on 'wr_reg_en', and reads are either direct from the register bank or forwarded through 'wr_wdata' depending on the 'forwardD' control."

All state changes within the module occur on the rising edge of this clock.\n- rst_n: Active-low reset input used to initialize all registers and outputs of the module to a default state (in this case, zero).\n- wr_reg_en: Write enable signal that allows data to be written into the register file.

It determines if the written data should be forwarded directly to the output.\n- rs_reg1_addr: 5-bit input specifying the address of the register from which the first read data ('rs_reg1_rdata') should be fetched.\n- rs_reg2_addr: 5-bit input specifying the address of the register from which the second read data ('rs_reg2_rdata') should be fetched.\n\nOutput ports: rs_reg1_rdata, rs_reg2_rdata.\nExplanation:\n- rs_reg1_rdata: 32-bit output which holds the data read from the register file at the address specified by 'rs_reg1_addr'. The output can be the direct data from the register or data forwarded from 'wr_wdata' depending on the 'forwardD' control signal.\n- rs_reg2_rdata: 32-bit output which holds the data read from the register file at the address specified by 'rs_reg2_addr'.
