Module-level comment: The 'regfile' module simulates a processor's register file, handling data storage, retrieval, and forwarding through a 32x32-bit memory array. It operates on a clock signal with an active-low reset. The module writes data based on a write-enable signal and a specified address, and reads from one or two registers, forwarding new data when necessary to address read-after-write hazards. It primarily consists of sequential logic analyzing clock and reset conditions for updating or resetting internal storage and output data registers.
