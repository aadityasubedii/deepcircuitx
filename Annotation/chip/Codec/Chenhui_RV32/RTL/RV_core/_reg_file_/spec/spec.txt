Module name: regfile.
Module specification: The 'regfile' module simulates a register file, crucial in processors for temporary data storage during computations. It is synchronized by a clock signal 'clk' and features an active-low reset 'rst_n'. The module supports data writing to registers controlled by a write enable signal 'wr_reg_en', and a 5-bit write address 'wr_reg_addr' using 32-bit input data 'wr_wdata'. Additionally, it handles data forwarding with a 2-bit input 'forwardD' to resolve read-after-write hazards. Reading from the register is done via two 5-bit inputs 'rs_reg1_addr' and 'rs_reg2_addr', the outputs of which are 32-bit values 'rs_reg1_rdata' and 'rs_reg2_rdata', respectively. The internal 32x32-bit 'reg_bank' array stores the register values. The module has three main blocks: the reset and write block, which sets registers to zero on reset or updates them on write-enable; and two separate blocks for managing output data to 'rs_reg1_rdata' and 'rs_reg2_rdata' based on forwarding conditions or direct register access, thus ensuring data integrity and timely availability post any writes.
