Module name: wrap_iram. Module specification: The 'wrap_iram' module serves as an interface wrapper for a RAM block model named 'ram_bfm', facilitating controlled read and write operations to the RAM based on external control signals. The module is synchronized with a system clock 'sclk' and interfaces with five primary input signals: 'sclk' for synchronization, 'mem_wr' enabling write operations, 'mem_rd' enabling read operations, 'addr' providing a 32-bit address, and 'wdata' containing 32-bit write data. The sole output 'rdata' is a 32-bit bus carrying data read from RAM. Internally, the module employs several signals: 'ram_cs' activates the RAM for reading or writing, 'ram_we', though set to an inactive state ('4'b0000'), would usually specify byte enables for partial writes, and 'ram_addr' translates the 32-bit external address to a 12-bit internal RAM address. The module's core is structured around an instantiation of 'ram_bfm', a behavioral RAM model configured here for a 32-bit data width and an address space supporting 8192 locations. This submodule takes its clock from 'sclk' and is gated by 'ram_cs' and controlled by an inactive 'ram_we' and internally downscaled 'ram_addr'. Data to be written is statically set to '32'd0', enabling focus on the read functionality in this implementation. This specification encapsulates the design and function of 'wrap_iram', providing a clear view of its operation within the system it is intended for.
