Module-level comment: The 'wrap_iram' module acts as an interface wrapper for a RAM block, enabling read and write operations synchronized with a system clock ('sclk'). It processes inputs for memory operations (`mem_wr`, `mem_rd`), address (`addr`), and data (`wdata`), and outputs the data read from RAM (`rdata`). Internally, it uses signals like 'ram_cs' for RAM activation and 'ram_addr' for addressing, interfacing with a RAM behavioral model ('ram_bfm') configured for 32-bit wide, 8192-depth memory.
