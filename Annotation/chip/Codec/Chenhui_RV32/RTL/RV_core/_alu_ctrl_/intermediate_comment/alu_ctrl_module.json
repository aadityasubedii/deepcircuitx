    "module": "Module-level comment: The `alu_ctrl` module determines the ALU control signals based on inputs `data_in` and `ALUOp`. It employs a case statement to select between no-operation, direct, R-type, or I-type operations, mapping operation codes from `data_in` to the output `ALU_ctl` using predefined parameters. This setup ensures accurate control for the ALU to execute various arithmetic and logical operations."
