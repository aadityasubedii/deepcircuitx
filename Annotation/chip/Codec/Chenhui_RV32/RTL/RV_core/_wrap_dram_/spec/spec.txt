Module name: wrap_dram. Module specification: The 'wrap_dram' module serves as an interface or wrapper for DRAM-based memory, handling various memory operations including byte, half-word, and word reads and writes. This module operates with inputs such as `sclk` (system clock), `rstn` (active-low reset), `mem_wr` (write enable), `mem_rd` (read enable), `mem_op` (operation type), `addr` (memory address), and `wdata` (write data); and outputs `rdata` (read data). Key internal signals include `ram_cs` (RAM chip select), `ram_we` (write enable per byte), `ram_addr` (modified address for RAM), and `ram_wdata` (data being written to RAM), all crucial for interfacing and managing the DRAM operations. The module is divided into sections handling write logic, read logic, operation and address registration, and interfacing with an instantiated block RAM module (`ram_bfm`). The write logic section adapts write commands based on operation type to appropriately mask data bits. The read logic part implements sign or zero extensions based on the operation to fetch the correct portion of data. The block RAM module instantiation ties the internal logic and signals to a physical RAM model, ensuring correct data reads and writes as per operation commands.
