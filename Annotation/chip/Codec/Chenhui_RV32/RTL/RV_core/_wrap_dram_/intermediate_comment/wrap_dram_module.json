    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'wrap_dram' module interfaces with DRAM, handling memory operations like byte, half-word, and word reads and writes. It uses control signals for operations (`mem_wr`, `mem_rd`, `mem_op`), addresses (`addr`), and data (`wdata`, `rdata`). Internally, it employs logic for write mask generation and data alignment, and interfaces with a block RAM ('ram_bfm') for actual data storage and retrieval operations, handling different types of memory access specified by `mem_op`."
