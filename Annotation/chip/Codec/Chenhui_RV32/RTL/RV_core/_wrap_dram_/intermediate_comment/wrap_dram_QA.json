It handles read and write operations from a memory, by computing addresses and controlling data flow based on the operation type specified. The module accepts commands for different byte-aligned read and write operations (such as byte, half-word, or word size) and handles the sign extension or zero extension of read data depending on the operation. The internal memory behavior is managed by the instantiated `ram_bfm` block RAM module."

When asserted, it indicates that a write operation should be performed.\n- `mem_rd`: Memory read enable signal. When asserted, it indicates that a read operation should be performed.\n- `mem_op`: 3-bit operation code indicating the type of memory operation (byte, half-word, word, etc.).\n- `addr`: 32-bit address input that specifies the memory address for the read or write operation.\n- `wdata`: 32-bit data input used for write operations, specifies the data to be written to memory.\n\nOutput ports: `rdata`.\nExplanation: \n- `rdata`: 32-bit data output used for read operations, contains the data retrieved from the specified memory address.
