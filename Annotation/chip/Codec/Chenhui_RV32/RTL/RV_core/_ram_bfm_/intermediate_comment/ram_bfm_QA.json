It is parameterized to handle varying data widths, depths, and addressing schemes. The module functionalities include reading and selectively writing data based on the input control signals. If the chip select (`cs`) and write enable (`we`) signals are activated, the data (`wdata`) is written to the memory array at the specified address (`addr`). Conversely, if the chip select is active but write enable is inactive, it reads the data from the memory array at the given address and outputs it through `rdata`. The memory is organized such that each location can be individually accessed and modified, allowing flexibility in data handling."
