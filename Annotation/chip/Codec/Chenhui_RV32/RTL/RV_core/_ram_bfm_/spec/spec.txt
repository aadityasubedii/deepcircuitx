Module name: ram_bfm. Module specification: The `ram_bfm` module emulates the behavior of a parameterized RAM with configurations for varying data widths, depths, and addressing schemes. It includes input ports such as `clk` (clock signal that synchronizes the operations), `cs` (chip select that enables memory operations), `we` (write enable controlling writing to specific data segments), `addr` (memory location address), and `wdata` (data to be written). The sole output port, `rdata`, outputs the data fetched from the specified memory location during read operations. Internally, the module uses a `mem_array`, a register array representing the RAM's storage, which stores and retrieves data based on the provided `addr`. The code is divided into several sections: initialization of the `mem_array` with block RAM attributes, an always block that handles data reading when the clock edge occurs and conditions are met, and a generate block creating multiple always blocks to handle data-writing based on the write enable condition for each segment. This structured design ensures flexibility and precise control in memory operations aligned with the inputs.
