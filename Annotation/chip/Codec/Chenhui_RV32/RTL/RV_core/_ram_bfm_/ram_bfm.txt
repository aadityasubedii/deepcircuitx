Module-level comment: The `ram_bfm` module simulates a parameterized RAM, capable of read and write operations based on input signals. It utilizes a clock signal `clk` for synchronization, `cs` for enabling operations, `we` for selective writing, and `addr` and `wdata` for specifying memory locations and data. An internal memory array `mem_array` stores data, with conditional read operations on clock edges and segmented writes managed through generated blocks for precise data handling.
