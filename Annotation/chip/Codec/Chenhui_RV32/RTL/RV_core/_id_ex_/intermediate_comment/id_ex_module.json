    "module": "Module-level comment: The `id_ex` module acts as a pipeline register between ID and EX stages in a processor, transferring control and data signals synchronized with the clock. It maintains signal integrity across clock cycles by registering inputs like control flags and operation types, and directly passing data signals. No internal signals are used; organization is achieved through always blocks for control signals and assign statements for data, ensuring correct data flow and timing."
