    "spec": "Module name: id_ex\nModule specification: The `id_ex` module serves as a pipeline register in a processor, which operates between the instruction decode (ID) and execution (EX) stages. Its primary function is to transfer various control signals and data (such as immediate values and ALU control signals) from the ID stage to the EX stage in synchronization with the clock signal. The module takes multiple input signals such as `reg_wr_line_in`, `mem2reg_sel_line_in`, amongst others, which control operations like write enable and memory operations, and (`reg1_data_line_in`, `reg2_data_line_in`, `imm_gen_data_line_in`) which are the data inputs. There are equally named output ports, where output control signals are registered outputs, essentially preserving the value over clock cycles, and data lines are direct assignments. There are no internal signals used in this module as it relies primarily on passing through and registering incoming signals based on the clock (`clk`) and reset (`rstn`) conditions. The Verilog code includes specific always blocks aimed at registering input controls and data signals onto output ports upon the positive edge of the clock or when not in reset. This design ensures that data consistency and control signal flow are aligned with the pipelined operation of the processor, maintaining the integrity and timing of operations across stages.",

Its primary function is to transfer various control signals and data (such as immediate values and ALU control signals) from the ID stage to the EX stage in synchronization with the clock signal. The module takes multiple input signals such as `reg_wr_line_in`, `mem2reg_sel_line_in`, amongst others, which control operations like write enable and memory operations, and (`reg1_data_line_in`, `reg2_data_line_in`, `imm_gen_data_line_in`) which are the data inputs. There are equally named output ports, where output control signals are registered outputs, essentially preserving the value over clock cycles, and data lines are direct assignments. There are no internal signals used in this module as it relies primarily on passing through and registering incoming signals based on the clock (`clk`) and reset (`rstn`) conditions. The Verilog code includes specific always blocks aimed at registering input controls and data signals onto output ports upon the positive edge of the clock or when not in reset. This design ensures that data consistency and control signal flow are aligned with the pipelined operation of the processor, maintaining the integrity and timing of operations across stages."
