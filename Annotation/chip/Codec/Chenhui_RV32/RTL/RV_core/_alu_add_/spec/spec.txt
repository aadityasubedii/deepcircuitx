Module name: alu_add. Module specification: The 'alu_add' module is designed to perform basic arithmetic addition of two 32-bit input values, outputting their sum as a 32-bit result. It operates with two input ports, 'data0' and 'data1', which are each 32-bit signals representing the operands to be added. The output port, 'ALU_result', also a 32-bit signal, holds the resulting sum of the addition operation. The module has a straightforward structure with no internal signals or complex functionality, focusing solely on the addition operation. The core of the module's Verilog code is an assignment statement that directly computes the sum of 'data0' and 'data1' and assigns this to 'ALU_result'. This simple and efficient implementation makes the module ideal for integration into larger arithmetic or processing units where basic addition is required.
