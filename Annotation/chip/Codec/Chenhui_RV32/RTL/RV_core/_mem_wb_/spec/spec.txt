Module name: mem_wb. Module specification: The `mem_wb` module operates in a pipelined processor architecture, specifically managing the transition of data between the memory and write-back stages. It is synchronized with a clock (`clk`) and uses a negative-edge triggered reset (`rstn`) to ensure that outputs are correctly initialized under power on or error conditions. The input ports include `clk`, `rstn`, `reg_wr_line_in`, `mem2reg_sel_line_in`, `ram_data_out_line_in`, `alu_ex_result_line_in`, and `reg_wb_addr_line_in`. These handle synchronization, reset, control signals to indicate register writing and source selection for data (ALU or RAM), actual data from the RAM, ALU operation results, and the destination register address, respectively. Corresponding output ports — `reg_wr_line_out`, `mem2reg_sel_line_out`, `ram_data_out_line_out`, `alu_ex_result_line_out`, and `reg_wb_addr_line_out` — pass these values downstream after latching them, based on the clock and reset states. There are no internal signals utilized in this module, reflecting its direct role in data and control signal forwarding without further processing. The code is organized into multiple always blocks that handle different signal latching: one block for latching control signals on positive clock or negative reset, another block that constantly assigns the RAM data output (combining logic due to its independence from clock and reset for direct pass-through), and separate blocks for latching ALU results and register write addresses on clock edges or reset. This design ensures clear, phase-aligned handover of crucial data and control signals for subsequent stages in the pipeline, crucial for maintaining coherent and stable processor operation.
