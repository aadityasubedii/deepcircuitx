    "module": "Module-level comment: The `mem_wb` module serves in a pipelined processor to transfer data from the memory to the write-back stage. It operates on a clock (`clk`) and negative-edge reset (`rstn`). Inputs include control signals and data from memory and ALU, which are latched to outputs under clock or reset control, supporting synchronized, stable data flow into the next pipeline stage without internal processing."
