It handles the transfer of data between the memory stage and the write-back stage of the pipeline. Specifically, this module latches the results and control signals from the memory stage and passes them to the write-back stage. It operates on the rising edge of a clock signal (`clk`) and the negative edge of a reset signal (`rstn`). The module reads inputs like control signals (`reg_wr_line_in`, `mem2reg_sel_line_in`), data from RAM (`ram_data_out_line_in`), ALU result (`alu_ex_result_line_in`), and a register write address (`reg_wb_addr_line_in`). It outputs the latched values which include control signals for write-back operation, data to potentially be written back into registers, the ALU result, and the register write address, ensuring stability and readiness for the next write-back operation in the pipeline cycle. This module safeguards against erratic outputs under reset conditions by setting default states."
