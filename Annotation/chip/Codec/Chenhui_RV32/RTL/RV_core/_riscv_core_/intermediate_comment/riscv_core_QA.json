It handles the core functionalities such as instruction fetching, decoding, executing, and memory interactions. This module is responsible for executing programs by fetching instructions from memory, decoding them based on RISC-V ISA (Instruction Set Architecture), executing arithmetic or logical operations via an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), and interfacing with data memory. The module processes instructions in a pipelined manner, comprising stages like instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back to improve throughput and performance. It also has a mechanism to handle data hazards and control hazards to maintain correct execution order and data coherence. Additionally, the module controls a test LED, which toggles its state based on specific instruction addresses, committing changes to the processor state based on the clock (`sys_clk`) and reset (`sys_rst_n`) signals."

Being active low means that the processor will reset when the signal is at a logical zero.\n\nOutput ports: \n- `led_test`: Test LED output.\n\nExplanation:\n- `led_test`: This output signal drives an LED for testing or indicative purposes. The state of this LED toggles when the program counter (PC) reaches a specific address (e.g., `0x1000`), providing a simple visual indication of the processor's operation at that instruction address. This can be useful for debugging or demonstrating the processor's functionality."
