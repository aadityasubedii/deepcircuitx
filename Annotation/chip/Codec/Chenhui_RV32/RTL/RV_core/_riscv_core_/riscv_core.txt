Module-level comment: The riscv_core module is a Verilog model of a RISC-V processor core that handles the core processor operations organized in a pipelined architecture. It processes operations synchronized by the `sys_clk` and initialized by `sys_rst_n`. The design utilizes stages for fetching (`wrap_iram`), decoding (`u_if_id`), executing (`alu_ex`), memory operations (`wrap_dram`), and write-back (`mem_wb`) with signal-based control for forwarding and hazard detection to maintain data flow and integrity through various pipeline stages.
