Module name: riscv_core. Module specification: The riscv_core module is a Verilog implementation of a RISC-V processor's core, managing the critical functions of instruction fetching, decoding, execution, and memory interactions in a pipelined approach. Inputs include `sys_clk` for the system clock that synchronizes the operations in the pipeline and `sys_rst_n`, a reset signal that initializes the processor when active low. The lone output, `led_test`, serves as a test LED that toggles state at specific instruction address `0x1000`. Internally, a variety of signals route data and control across components, such as `PC` for tracking the address of the current instruction, and `alu_add4_data` for the output of the ALU when incrementing the PC. The design integrates multiple blocks reflecting stages of the pipeline: fetching (`wrap_iram`), decoding (`u_if_id`), executing (`alu_ex`), and memory operations (`wrap_dram`), followed by write-back (`mem_wb`). Each block supports the processor's execution flow, interfacing through meticulously managed control and data flow paths, including forwarding and hazard detection (`u_forward_unit`, `hazard_detec`) to ensure data integrity and correct operational sequencing across the pipeline.
