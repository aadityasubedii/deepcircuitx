Module-level comment: The 'mux3' module is a 3-way multiplexer implemented in Verilog. It selects one of three 32-bit inputs based on a 2-bit selector ('sel'). 'data_out' outputs 'data0_in' for 'sel' = 2'b00, 'data1_in' for 'sel' = 2'b01, and 'data2_in' for 'sel' = 2'b10. If 'sel' is not valid, 'data_out' is set to zero. Selection logic is managed within a combinational always block using a case statement.
