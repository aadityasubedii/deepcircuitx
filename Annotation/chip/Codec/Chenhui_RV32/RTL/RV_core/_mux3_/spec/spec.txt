Module name: mux3. 
Module Specification: The 'mux3' module is a 3-way multiplexer designed in Verilog. It operates by selecting one of three 32-bit input signals ('data0_in', 'data1_in', 'data2_in') based on a 2-bit selector input ('sel'). The selection process determines the output on the 32-bit 'data_out'. Specifically, 'sel' = 2'b00 selects 'data0_in', 'sel' = 2'b01 selects 'data1_in', and 'sel' = 2'b10 selects 'data2_in'. If 'sel' does not match any of these values, 'data_out' defaults to zero. The module essentially consists of one primary combinational block realized through an 'always' block, which implements a case statement to handle the selection and default operations. There are no internal signals used in this module; all operations are handled directly via the input and output ports, making the internal logic straightforward and efficient for synthesis. This module effectively showcases a basic multiplexing mechanism, commonly used in digital systems for routing signals based on selector input.
