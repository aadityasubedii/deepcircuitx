The Chenhui_RV32 repository is dedicated to the implementation of a RISC-V processor designed with a focus on a modular and pipelined architecture, encapsulating various stages and elements of processor operations in Verilog. The repository is organized into multiple sub-modules like the main control, ALU operations, multiplexers, and pipeline registers among others that collaboratively ensure the seamless operation and simulation of a RISC-V processor. Each module, ranging from memory interfaces (`wrap_iram`, `wrap_dram`) to various core components of pipelined processor stages (`if_id`, `id_ex`, `ex_mem`, `mem_wb`), and additional utility components such as an arithmetic logic unit with various capabilities (`alu_ex`, `alu_add`), control units (`main_ctrl`, `alu_ctrl`), hazard detection (`hazard_detec`) and data forwarding (`forward_unit`), is finely designed to support specific functionality with an emphasis on synchronization, data integrity, and operational efficiency. The testbench (`tbtop`) provided in the repository simulates the entire processor system, validating the integration and functionality of the pipelined RISC-V core under different scenarios. Through detailed simulation and testing modules (`glbl`), this repository encapsulates a comprehensive environment for the development, testing, and optimization of a RISC-V processor targeted for FPGA implementations, highlighting complex interactions of pipeline stages, memory management, and control signal generation to enable accurate and efficient processor emulation.
