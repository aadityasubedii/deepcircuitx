    "spec": "Module name: glbl. \nModule specification: The \"glbl\" module is a global settings and configuration block primarily used in FPGA designs to manage and synchronize system-wide settings such as global reset, 3-state control, and program reconfiguration. This module does not have any input ports, emphasizing its function that relies on internally managed states and parameters. It features several output ports including GSR (Global Set/Reset), GTS (Global 3-state), PRLD (Program Reload), and a series of JTAG-related signals (JTAG_TDO_GLBL, JTAG_TCK_GLBL, JTAG_TDI_GLBL, JTAG_TMS_GLBL, JTAG_TRST_GLBL), each catering to specific aspects of FPGA operation like reset synchronization, tri-state control across the FPGA, runtime reconfiguration, and standardized JTAG protocol functionalities for debugging and programming. Internally, the module uses specific registers like GSR_int, GTS_int, and PRLD_int to control the corresponding output signals through initial code blocks that set these registers. Additionally, there are JTAG operational signals and user-definable TDO outputs initially set to high impedance, waiting for specific operational triggers. In essence, the \"glbl\" module is critical for setting a foundational operational environment that ensures synchronized control and configuration across various sections of an FPGA system. Notably, the code is organized into blocks defining parameters, wire and reg declarations, output signal assignments, and initial blocks that dictate the timing and initial conditions for the significant control signals like GSR, GTS, and PRLD.",
