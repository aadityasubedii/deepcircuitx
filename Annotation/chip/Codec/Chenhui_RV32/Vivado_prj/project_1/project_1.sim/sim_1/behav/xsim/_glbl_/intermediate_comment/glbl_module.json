    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"glbl\" module orchestrates global settings for FPGA operations, managing synchronization of resets, tri-state controls, and reconfiguration procedures via internally set register values and signal assignments. Core functionalities are implemented through initial timing blocks for setups and signal strength assignments, alongside JTAG interfacing capabilities for extensive testing and configuration, ensuring universal control across FPGA circuits without external inputs."
