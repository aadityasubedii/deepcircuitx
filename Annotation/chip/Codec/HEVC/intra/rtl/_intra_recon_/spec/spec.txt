Module name: intra_recon.

Module specification: The `intra_recon` module performs intra prediction reconstruction for a block of image data in video processing. It operates on input signals like the predicted pixel values `predSamples`, alternative prediction data `predSamples_inter`, residuals `residuals`, and uses optional reconstruction data `r_reconSamples` based on control signals derived from `opt_recon`. The module processes these inputs using a `clk` (clock signal), `arst_n` (asynchronous reset), and `rst_n` (synchronous reset), configuring the process according to a transformation unit size `tuSize` and the general-purpose bit depth `gp_bitDepth`. The output is a reconstructed sample `reconSamples`, a regrouped version of computed pixel values.

Internal signals such as `temp_pred`, `pred`, `resi`, `result`, and `recon` facilitate the computation by temporarily storing intermediate values. For instance, `pred` retains the fetched `predSamples`, while `result` contains intermediate pixel value calculations after adding `resi` (residual values). The `en_recon` and `opt_a` signals derived from `opt_recon` dictate the use of alternate data paths and reconstruction sources, while `bdepth_8_10` adapts the bit processing depth based on `gp_bitDepth`.

The module logic is compartmentalized into sections by a generate block using `genvar i,j` to process multiple pixel data simultaneously for efficiency. Each block selects appropriate predicted samples, determines reconstruction paths, computes the resultant pixel values, and selects the final output pixels either by computed results or optional fetched data based on `en_recon`. The module cleverly utilizes signal manipulation, conditional operations, and bit slicing to achieve accurate and effective image sample reconstruction suited for further stages in an image processing pipeline.
