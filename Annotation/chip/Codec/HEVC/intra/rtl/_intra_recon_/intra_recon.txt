Module-level comment: The 'intra_recon' module processes image data for video by reconstructing pixel values from predicted samples, alternate predictions, and residuals based on control settings from 'opt_recon'. It leverages multiple internal registers and conditional logic within a generate block for parallel pixel processing, adapting to different bit depths, and selectively uses alternate reconstruction sources, outputting the reconstructed image block ready for further processing.
