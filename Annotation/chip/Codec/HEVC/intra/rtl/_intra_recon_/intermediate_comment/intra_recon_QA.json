It takes inputs such as predicted samples (`predSamples`), residuals (`residuals`), and a transformation unit size (`tuSize`) to compute the reconstructed samples of an image block. It allows for different reconstruction options controlled by `opt_recon`. Reconstruction entails adjusting prediction data by adding residuals and optionally using alternate prediction data from `predSamples_inter` based on the mode specified. The result can either be a direct calculation of the adjusted prediction or fetched from another input `r_reconSamples` if enabled by a control signal (`en_recon`). The final output, `reconSamples`, is a regrouped version of the individual pixel reconstructions, suitable for further processing or analysis in the image processing pipeline. The module handles bit-depth adjustments in calculations to accommodate different pixel depth requirements."
