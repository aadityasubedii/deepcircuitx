    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"intra_SRAMCtrl\" module manages read and write operations for multiple SRAM blocks using dual clock inputs. It controls 8 main SRAM sub-blocks and an additional smaller SRAM (SRAM_TL), handling separate read/write address and data paths. Utilizes parameterized memory block instantiations with handling for global read disable signals and dynamic address and data scaling for robust memory management across diverse system configurations. Internal registers and arrays support localized data and address control."
