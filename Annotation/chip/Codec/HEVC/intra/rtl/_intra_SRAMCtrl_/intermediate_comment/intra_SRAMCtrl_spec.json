    "spec": "Module name: intra_SRAMCtrl. \nModule specification: The \"intra_SRAMCtrl\" module is engineered to control reading and writing operations for several SRAM blocks with distinct clock inputs for read (rclk) and write (wclk) operations. It interfaces 8 sub-memories and another smaller SRAM (SRAM_TL), each with individual addressing and control signals. Input ports include read and write clocks (rclk, wclk), addresses for main and smaller SRAMs (rAdr, rAdr_TL, wAdr, wAdr_TL), data to be written (wData, wData_TL), read and write enable signals (rE_n, wE_n), and a global read disable (bStop_r). Output data after reading operations appears on rData for main blocks and rData_TL for the smaller SRAM. The internal signals encompass sram_w and sram_r arrays for buffering write data and gathering read data respectively, address registers r_Adr and w_Adr for each SRAM block, and modified read enables rE_n_ that integrate the global disable logic. The module comprises a generate loop that instantiates 8 sub-memory blocks utilizing a parameterized memory model \u201cstdcore_2prf\u201d, configuring each with individual addressing, data, and control paths enhanced by the parameterized bit and address widths for flexible memory management. Additionally, a separate stdcore_2prf instantiation manages the extra smaller SRAM (SRAM_TL). This hierarchical and parameterized approach allows efficient scaling and precise memory control tailored to diverse system requirements, optimizing memory access and throughput in high-performance applications.",

It manages SRAM data for 8 sub-memories, each with individual addressing and data paths. It takes into account a special control signal (bStop_r) for read enable that can globally disable all read operations. The module also handles additional smaller SRAM (SRAM_TL) with different bit depth and memory depth parameters. The input and output data widths are expanded using parameter calculations based on given bit depths and address widths, ensuring flexible scaling of the memory architecture as per the provided configurations. This SRAM controller serves as an interface between the memory components and other system parts, optimizing memory access timing and control."
