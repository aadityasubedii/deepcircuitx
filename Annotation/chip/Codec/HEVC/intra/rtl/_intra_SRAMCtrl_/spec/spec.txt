Module name: intra_SRAMCtrl. 
Module specification: The "intra_SRAMCtrl" module is engineered to control reading and writing operations for several SRAM blocks with distinct clock inputs for read (rclk) and write (wclk) operations. It interfaces 8 sub-memories and another smaller SRAM (SRAM_TL), each with individual addressing and control signals. Input ports include read and write clocks (rclk, wclk), addresses for main and smaller SRAMs (rAdr, rAdr_TL, wAdr, wAdr_TL), data to be written (wData, wData_TL), read and write enable signals (rE_n, wE_n), and a global read disable (bStop_r). Output data after reading operations appears on rData for main blocks and rData_TL for the smaller SRAM. The internal signals encompass sram_w and sram_r arrays for buffering write data and gathering read data respectively, address registers r_Adr and w_Adr for each SRAM block, and modified read enables rE_n_ that integrate the global disable logic. The module comprises a generate loop that instantiates 8 sub-memory blocks utilizing a parameterized memory model “stdcore_2prf”, configuring each with individual addressing, data, and control paths enhanced by the parameterized bit and address widths for flexible memory management. Additionally, a separate stdcore_2prf instantiation manages the extra smaller SRAM (SRAM_TL). This hierarchical and parameterized approach allows efficient scaling and precise memory control tailored to diverse system requirements, optimizing memory access and throughput in high-performance applications.
