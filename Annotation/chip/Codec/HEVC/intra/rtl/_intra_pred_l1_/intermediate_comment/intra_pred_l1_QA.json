It is parameterized with various bit depth and reference size settings, and it supports configurable precision for computation through its parameters. The module inputs include a clock signal, asynchronous and synchronous reset signals, a stop signal, and various data related to reference frames and motion vectors. The outputs are prediction results computed based on the input reference data and quasi-motion vectors. The module uses a combination of data manipulation and generate blocks to process and generate prediction values for different plans, based on weighted reference data and given positional modifications (X, Y coordinates). This kind of module is typically used in video codecs like H.264/AVC or HEVC for processing intra prediction directions and constructing predicted blocks."
