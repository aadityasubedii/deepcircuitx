Module-level comment: The intra_pred_l1 module facilitates intraframe prediction for video compression by manipulating reference frame data. It uses inputs like clock signals, resets, motion vectors, and positional coordinates to produce multiple prediction outcomes. Internally, the module employs generate and always blocks to manage data arrays and compute weighted predictions and directional adjustments based on dynamically configured weights and movement indices. This structured manipulation aids in efficient prediction across variable image blocks.
