Module name: intra_pred_l1. 
Module specification: The intra_pred_l1 module is designed for intraframe prediction in video compression, utilizing previously encoded frame data to predict new frame data. It is parameterized to handle various bit depth and reference size configurations. The module accepts several inputs: a clock signal (`clk`), asynchronous (`arst_n`) and synchronous (`rst_n`) resets, a stop signal (`bStop`), weights (`weight`), main reference register (`mainRefReg`), movement vector (`move`), positional coordinates (`X`, `Y`), and pixel values at specific image locations (`top_right_pixel`, `bottom_left_pixel`). The outputs include prediction results (`r_r0, r_r1`) and complex prediction schemes (`r_plan_0, r_plan_1, r_plan_2, r_plan_3`). Internal signals such as reference matrix (`refm`), movement indices (`mov`), weight factors (`w`), provisional pixel values (`r0, r1`), directional predictions (`r0_, r1_`), and intermediate prediction results (`plan_0, plan_1, plan_2, plan_3`) are utilized to compute the outputs. The Verilog code features generate blocks structured to handle extraction and mapping of reference data, weight application, and calculation of prediction results at varying precision, organized into a series of always and generate blocks dedicated to configuring the movement, weight, and prediction data for pixel prediction.
