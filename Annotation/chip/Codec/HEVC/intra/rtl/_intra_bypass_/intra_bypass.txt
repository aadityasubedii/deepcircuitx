Module-level comment: This module performs intra prediction bypass operations for video coding. It processes input signals related to coding unit sizes, positions, and borders to generate bypass samples for luma and chroma components. The module stores and selects reference samples from neighboring blocks, handles special cases for different partition sizes and positions, and generates bypass samples for various prediction modes. It uses multiple always blocks and generate statements to manage sample storage, reference selection, and bypass sample generation for different block sizes and configurations.
