Module name: intra_bypass. Module specification: The intra_bypass module is part of an intra prediction system for video coding, specifically handling bypass operations. It processes various input signals related to coding unit (CU) and transform unit (TU) sizes, positions, and borders to generate bypass samples for different prediction modes and sizes, handling both luma and chroma components. The module has numerous input ports, including clock and reset signals, control flags, size and position parameters, border information, and various flags related to the intra prediction process. Output ports provide bypass samples for different prediction modes and components, positions of bypass samples, and bottom and right samples. Internal signals include position indicators, flags, storage for reconstructed and reference samples, and various control signals. The module is structured with several always blocks and generate statements, handling different aspects of the bypass process such as sample storage, reference sample selection, and bypass sample generation for various block sizes and positions. It includes
