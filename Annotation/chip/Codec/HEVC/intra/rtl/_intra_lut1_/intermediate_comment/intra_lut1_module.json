    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'intra_lut1' module functions as a lookup table that generates a 12-bit output 'move' based on 5-bit angle 'ang' and 3-bit position 'yPos' inputs. The module concatenates 'ang' and 'yPos' into an 8-bit value utilized in a case statement within an `always` block to assign predefined bit patterns to 'move'. No internal signals are used, and all operations directly map input combinations to output configurations, optimized for controlling movement or positioning systems based on angular and positional inputs."
