Module name: intra_stopCtrl

Module specification: The intra_stopCtrl module is designed to control stop conditions within a hardware processing context, possibly in data streaming or iterative operations such as video or signal processing. It handles input ports such as clk (clock signal), rst_n and arst_n (synchronous and asynchronous resets), cabad_intra_val and resi_val (indicating availability of intra prediction data and residual data), isLastCycInTb (flag for last cycle in transmission block), cIdx (processing path or condition index), and isLast32In64_inter (flag for last 32 cycles in a set of 64 during inter processing). Outputs include various stop conditions (bStop, bStopz, bStop0 to bStop3, and variants bStop_z to bStop_3) and cabad_intra_rdy (indicates readiness to process intra prediction data). Internal signals, such as bSleep and different ladderStop and awkCnt registers, manage sleep conditions and various stop signals across cycles. The Verilog code structure contains combinational logic blocks for immediate stop conditions and sequential process blocks for handling resets, and operating state updates related to sleep, stopping, acknowledgment counting, and data processing readiness. Each section efficiently serves to coordinate and manage complex control flows necessary for maintaining synchronization and timely data processing within the system.
