Module-level comment: The intra_stopCtrl module manages data processing stop conditions in hardware contexts like video processing. It evaluates conditions from inputs such as data availability and processing cycle flags to output various stopping states. Internally, the module uses registers and combinational logic to handle stop condition signals, sleep mode activation, and cycle counts, ensuring synchronized data flow and control throughout the operation, influenced largely by system clock and reset conditions.
