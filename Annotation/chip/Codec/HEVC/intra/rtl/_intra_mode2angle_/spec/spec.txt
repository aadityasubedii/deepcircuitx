Module name: intra_mode2angle.
Module specification: The intra_mode2angle module converts a 6-bit input 'mode' into a corresponding signed 7-bit output 'angle', based on whether the mode indicates a default (DC), horizontal, or vertical orientation. The 'mode' input pin determines the category and specific orientation while the 'angle' output pin provides the calculated angle. Internal signals include 'angleIdx' which is a signed 5-bit register helping to calculate the index depending on whether the mode is vertical or horizontal. 'modeDC', 'modeHor', and 'modeVer' are wire signals that distinguish between default, horizontal, and vertical modes respectively. The module utilizes a primary combinational block that interprets the mode to compute 'angleIdx'. This value then maps through a case statement to determine the output 'angle'. The logic ensures that based on the mode, appropriate angle values are assigned, with consideration for positive or negative values indicating directionality.
