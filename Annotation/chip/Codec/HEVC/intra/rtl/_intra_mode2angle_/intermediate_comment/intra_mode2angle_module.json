    "module": "Module-level comment: The intra_mode2angle module maps a 6-bit mode input to a signed 7-bit angle output, identifying orientation as default (DC), horizontal, or vertical. It uses internal logic to calculate an index (angleIdx), differentiating modes with wire signals (modeDC, modeHor, modeVer), and translates the index to the angle via a selective case statement, efficiently outputting respective angles for different orientations."
