The `mode` input identifies the type of mode, with specific ranges indicating whether the mode is default, horizontal, or vertical. According to these categories, an index (`angleIdx`) is calculated, which is then used to determine the `angle` output from predefined angle values, effectively mapping mode values to angle values with potential inversions for certain ranges, signifying different directional orientations."

This value designates modes that could either be default (DC), horizontal, or vertical. Different ranges of the mode value will trigger different mappings to angles as defined by the module\u2019s logic.\n\nOutput ports: angle.\nExplanation: The `angle` output is a signed 7-bit value that represents the resultant angle derived from the input mode. Depending on the mode's value (interpreted as DC, horizontal, or vertical), `angle` gets assigned specific angle values that are either positive or negative, designating the orientation direction based on predefined angle definitions within the module's internal logic."

It appears to be a legacy or an initially intended signal, intended for a signed 4-bit intermediate representation but not utilized in the logic provided.\n- `angleIdx`: This register is a signed 5-bit value which is calculated based on whether the mode is vertical or horizontal. It shifts the provided mode value into a range around zero, used directly to fetch corresponding angle values from the case statement logic.\n- `modeDC`: A wire signal that is true (1) when the mode is recognized as a Default (DC) which is the case when mode is less than 2. It helps in determining the special case where casi no angle transformation is needed.\n- `modeHor`: This wire signal is true when the mode indicates a horizontal orientation but is not a default mode. It is derived when the mode value is between 2 and 17. This signal forms part of the decision structure for defining `angleIdx`.\n- `modeVer`: This wire signal indicates a vertical mode which is neither default nor horizontal. It is activated when the mode is equal to or above 18. This is also utilized in the angle index calculation.\n- `signAng`: Although declared, it is an unused wire signal in the provided code, potentially intended for determining the sign of the angle or an auxiliary control flag, not applied in the existing logic implementation.\n\nThese signals collectively contribute to deriving the proper angle output from the input mode through specified logical conditions and mappings in the module."
