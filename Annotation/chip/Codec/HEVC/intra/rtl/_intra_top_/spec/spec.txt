Module name: intra_top. Module specification: The intra_top module is the top-level module for intra prediction in a video codec, likely for HEVC/H.265. It integrates various sub-modules to perform intra prediction, including reference sample generation, prediction mode selection, sample reconstruction, and memory management. The module handles different prediction modes, block sizes, and chroma/luma processing through multiple pipeline stages. Key input ports include clk, rst_n, mode, pic dimensions, CTU coordinates, and various prediction parameters. Output ports provide reconstructed samples and ready signals for different processing stages. Internal signals manage pipeline stages, coordinate data flow, and store intermediate results. The module is structured into several main blocks: input transformation, FSM control, reference sample generation, prediction calculation, reconstruction, and memory interface. It implements a complex pipeline with multiple stages (lz_, l0_, l_, l1_, l2_, l
