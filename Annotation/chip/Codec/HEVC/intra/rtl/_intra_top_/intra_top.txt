Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements intra prediction for HEVC/H.265 video coding. It processes
input prediction parameters through multiple pipeline stages to generate reconstructed
samples. The module integrates sub-modules for reference sample generation, prediction
mode selection, and sample reconstruction. It handles various prediction modes, block
sizes, and chroma/luma components using a complex pipeline architecture with memory
interfaces for efficient data management and processing.
