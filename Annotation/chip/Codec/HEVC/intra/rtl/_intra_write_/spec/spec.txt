Module name: intra_write. 

Module specification: The 'intra_write' module is designed for managing conditional SRAM data writes, primarily used in video processing applications like intra prediction in video codecs. The module inputs include clock signals (`clk`, `rst_n`, `arst_n`), data control flags (`bStop`, `bStop_pre`), transformation unit data (`reconSamples`, `xTb`, `yTb`, `X`, `Y`, `tuSize`, etc.), and configuration flags (`verFlag`, `horFlag`, `isLastCycInTb`, etc.), which are essential in calculating addresses and control the flow of data and writes. Outputs consist of the data and address for SRAM (`w_data`, `w_data_TL`, `w_addr`, `w_addr_TL`), control flags (`wE_n`, `bDelayWrite`) for enabling or delaying writes based on internal conditions. Internal signals like `reg_TL_adr`, `reg_TL_adr_cr`, handling top-left addresses, `xTbPlusXmin1` for transform block calculations, and several others for address and data manipulations are pivotal for efficient computations. The module is extensively partitioned into initial setup and calculation blocks, data generation and transition handling block (`generate`), and synchronous blocks for managing state transitions at clock edges. Notably, dynamic addressing and data path selection ensure tailored operations for different scenarios such as processing chroma components differently based on input flags and internal state conditions. This module is adept at handling multi-dimensional data transforming and storing operations efficiently by managing complex conditions and registers state, which are essential for high-efficiency video processing tasks.
