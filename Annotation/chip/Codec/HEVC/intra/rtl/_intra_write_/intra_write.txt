Module-level comment: The 'intra_write' module is crafted for conditional SRAM data write operations tailored for video processing, specifically intended for situations like intra prediction. It handles complex input data correlating to pixel data to compute SRAM addresses and manage memory writes. Operating on synchronization and condition signals, module internals utilize registers and data arrays for efficient data manipulation and conditional memory address generation. With clearly partitioned blocks for initial setup, dynamic address computations, and data handling, the module ensures adaptable, efficient operations across different processing scenarios.
