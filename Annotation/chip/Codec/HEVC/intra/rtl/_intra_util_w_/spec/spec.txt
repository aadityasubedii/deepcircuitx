Module name: intra_util_w.  
Module specification: The 'intra_util_w' module is designed for use in video or image compression systems, particularly focusing on intra prediction utility calculations that optimize image data processing dimensions. It handles both clock and asynchronous reset signals (`clk`, `rst_n`, `arst_n`) to maintain synchronization and reliable state initialization. It processes boundary and coordinate signals (`xTb`, `yTb`, `l_xTb`, `l_yTb`) alongside transformation unit size (`tuSize`) and partition index (`partIdx`) to compute optimal width and relative positional adjustments for compression units (`opt_w_tl_`, `opt_w_`, `w_TL_rela_`). Internal signals like `xTbPlusXmin1` and `yTbPlusXmin1` compute adjusted coordinates, while `x_4inMaxCb` and `y_4inMaxCb` help interpret those in the context of maximum coding block norms. Control flags (`verFlag`, `horFlag`) direct the flow within conditions assessing boundary overlaps. The code contains multiple procedural blocks: initial reset conditions management, transformative position and dimension calculations, and dynamic decision-making loops (`always` blocks) determining the widths based on conditions such as the proximity to block boundaries and prediction stages (`isCalStage`). Lastly, a `generate` block iteratively assigns algorithmic results to arrayed outputs, tailoring processing outputs to specific intra prediction scenarios.
