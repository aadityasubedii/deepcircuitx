Module-level comment: The `intra_util_w` module optimizes width calculations for intra prediction in video compression systems. It integrates input signals for reset, synchronization, boundary coordinates, and prediction conditions to manage width calculations and adjustments via procedural blocks. Internal signals are utilized for coordinate adjustments and boundary checks, while iterative generate blocks dynamically apply conditions to optimize width based on partition and transformation unit sizes. This module is essential for adaptive, efficient video data processing and compression.
