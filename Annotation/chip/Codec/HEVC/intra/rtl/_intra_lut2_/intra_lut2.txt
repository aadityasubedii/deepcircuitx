Module-level comment: The intra_lut2 module generates specific weight outputs by utilizing a lookup table mechanism, driven by input signals `ang` (5-bit angle) and `yPos` (3-bit position). The core functionality is implemented using a combinational logic block governed by a `casez` statement within an always block, which selectively assigns values to the 20-bit `weight` output reflecting the combination of inputs. This modular approach ensures dynamic output configuration based on received inputs, catering widely to scenarios needing precise control over output variations tied to multiple signal criteria.
