Module name: intra_lut2. Module specification: The intra_lut2 module is engineered to implement a lookup table functionality that outputs specific weight values based on the combinations of input angle (`ang`) and position (`yPos`). The inputs include `ang`, a 5-bit signal specifying the angle, and `yPos`, a 3-bit signal denoting positional information. The output is a 20-bit signal named `weight`, which is composed of bit slices assigned values through a combinational logic using a `casez` statement based on the `ang` and `yPos` inputs. Internally, the `weight` output is stored temporarily in a 20-bit wide register driven by the logic in the always block which evaluates the inputs and assigns the corresponding values through a sequence of case statements. The logic within the always block is crucial for updating the `weight` output whenever there is a change in the inputs. This module typically finds applications in systems where outputs need to be dynamically selected based on multiple criteria represented through input signals.
