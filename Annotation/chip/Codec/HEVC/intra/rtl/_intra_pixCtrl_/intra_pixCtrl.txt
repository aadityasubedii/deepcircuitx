Module-level comment: This module performs intra-pixel control operations for image/video processing. It processes pixel data based on various parameters (bit depth, transformation size, mode) using multiple filtering techniques (bilinear, 121 FIR). The module implements complex pixel manipulations, including directional and bilinear filtering, DC component calculations, and dynamic reference pixel selection. It handles different processing stages and tuning unit sizes, outputting modified pixel data and DC information for further processing in video coding applications.
