    "module": "Module-level comment: This intra_read module generates addresses and manages flags for intra prediction in video coding. It calculates read addresses for multiple SRAMs based on input parameters like block position, size, and coding unit info. The module handles address offsets, horizontal/vertical flags, and special cases for different block sizes and positions. It uses combinatorial logic for address calculation and sequential logic for flag management, supporting both luma and chroma components while considering border conditions."
