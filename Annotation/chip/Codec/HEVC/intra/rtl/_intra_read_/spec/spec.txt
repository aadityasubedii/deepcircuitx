Module name: intra_read. Module specification: The intra_read module is designed for address generation and flag management in an intra prediction system for video coding. It processes input parameters such as block position, size, and coding unit information to generate read addresses for multiple SRAMs, manage horizontal and vertical flags, and handle special cases for different block sizes and positions. The module has inputs including clock (clk), reset signals (arst_n, rst_n), control signals (bStop, bStop_), block coordinates (xTb, yTb), transform unit size (tuSize), and various flags. Outputs include read addresses (r_addr, r_addr_TL), read enable signals (rE_n), horizontal and vertical flags and levels (horFlag, verFlag, verLevel_o, horLevel_o), and modified address information (o_modiPsAdr, o_modiPos
