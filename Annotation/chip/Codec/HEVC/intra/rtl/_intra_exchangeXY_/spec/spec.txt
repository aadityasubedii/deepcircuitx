Module name: intra_exchangeXY. 
Module specification: The `intra_exchangeXY` module is designed to conditionally exchange the values between two 3-bit inputs, `i_X` and `i_Y`, based on the Boolean conditions provided by `modeHor` and `isInter`. The `modeHor` input signals a request to swap the input values if `isInter` is false. The module has five inputs. `modeHor` is a Boolean input that triggers the conditional swap, `isInter` is a Boolean that when true, disables the swap regardless of `modeHor`. The inputs `i_X` and `i_Y` are 3-bit values representing coordinates or data to be swapped based on the conditions. The outputs, `o_X` and `o_Y`, also 3-bit each, either pass the input values directly or swap them depending on the mode conditions. Internally, `o_X` and `o_Y` are defined as register types to retain and output data within procedural blocks. The logic is encapsulated in a combinational `always` block which checks the conditions and assigns the output values accordingly. This block executes continuously any time there is a change in its sensitivity list inputs (`modeHor`, `isInter`, `i_X`, and `i_Y`), making it efficient for reacting to input changes and processing the conditional data swapping.
