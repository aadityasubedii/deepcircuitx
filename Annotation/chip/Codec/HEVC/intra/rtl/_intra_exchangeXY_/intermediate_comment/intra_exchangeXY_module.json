    "module": "Module-level comment: The `intra_exchangeXY` module conditionally swaps the 3-bit inputs `i_X` and `i_Y` based on the Boolean inputs `modeHor` and `isInter`. If `modeHor` is true and `isInter` is false, it swaps the inputs; otherwise, it passes them unchanged to outputs `o_X` and `o_Y`. This functionality is implemented in a combinational always block, ensuring immediate response to input changes."
