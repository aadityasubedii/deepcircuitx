The `modeHor` input signals a request to swap the input values if `isInter` is false.

Internally, `o_X` and `o_Y` are defined as register types to retain and output data within procedural blocks. The logic is encapsulated in a combinational `always` block which checks the conditions and assigns the output values accordingly.

If `modeHor` is true and `isInter` is false, it swaps the values such that `o_X` receives the value of `i_Y` and `o_Y` receives the value of `i_X`.
