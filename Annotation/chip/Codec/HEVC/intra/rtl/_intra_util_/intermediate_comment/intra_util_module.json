    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'intra_util' module assists in utility functions vital for intra-prediction in video codecs, handling reference data processing and output generation based on mode, TU size, and pixel coordinates. It operates through the use of conditional logic for mapping indices, controlling filter operations, and configuring reconstruction options, tailored according to the signals from various inputs. Internal computations ensure optimal data indexing and state management, aiding effective video processing."
