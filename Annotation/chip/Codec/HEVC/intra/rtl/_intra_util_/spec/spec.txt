Module name: intra_util.

Module specification: The 'intra_util' module is designed to handle utility functions for intra-prediction in video processing, particularly in codec environments. It manages a variety of tasks, including the calculation of mapped indices, the control of filtering operations, and the determination of reconstruction options based on a range of parameters such as mode, Transform Unit (TU) size, pixel coordinates, and processing stages. The module has several input ports: clk (clock signal), rst_n (active-low asynchronous reset), arst_n (active-low synchronous reset), bStop and bStop1 (control flags), mode and tuSize (configuration settings), X and Y (pixel coordinates), preStage (current processing stage), ref_pos and ref_flag (reference positional data and flags), ramIdxMapping (RAM index mappings), isInter (inter/intra mode flag), and modeHor (horizontal mode flag). The outputs include options (encapsulating configuration flags and settings), idx_mapped_ (transformed RAM indices), opt_recon (reconstruction option results), and unFil_opt_ (control flags for unfiltered operations). Internally, the module defines signals like noFilter1-4 to manage filtering decisions, pos and pos_plus1/minus1 for processing neighboring pixels, midLtRt_opt for middle/left/right options, and maxIdx to calculate maximum indices. The module also includes procedural blocks that handle buffer and filter conditions, update operational states based on the current configuration, and generate indices for memory addressing. These functionalities are crucial for optimizing video encoding or decoding performance under various conditions.
