    "spec": "Module name: intra_pIdx. Module specification: The 'intra_pIdx' module is designed to determine a two-bit positional index 'pIdx' based on input coordinates xTb (x-coordinate) and yTb (y-coordinate) within a transform block, considering the size of the transform unit 'tuSize'. Input ports include 'xTb' and 'yTb', both 13-bit integers representing coordinates, and 'tuSize', a 3-bit integer symbolizing transform unit size expressed as a power of 2. The output port 'pIdx' is a 2-bit index that categorizes the position relative to the transform size, which varies if the unit is processing chroma or luma data. Internal computations use wires 'y' and 'x', computed as the right-shifted 'yTb' and 'xTb' values modulo 2, efficiently capturing the quadrant in the transform block. The module primarily consists of assign statements: one calculating 'y' and 'x', and another determining 'pIdx' based on whether the transform is for a chroma component of size 5 (setting 'pIdx' to 0) or a general case where 'pIdx' is derived from concatenated values of 'y' and 'x'. This organization aids in intra-prediction tasks for image and video processing by mapping high-resolution coordinates into a smaller, more manageable index.",

The calculation uses bit shifts and modulo operations to generate the 'pIdx', considering whether the transform is chromatic or luma based on the parameter 'isChroma'. If it's a chroma component (isChroma=true) and the transform unit size equals 5, 'pIdx' is set to 0.
