Module-level comment: This module performs reference sample substitution for intra prediction in video encoding. It processes 8 banks of 4 samples each in parallel, handling various block sizes and prediction modes. The module selects appropriate reference samples based on input flags, block positions, and special conditions. It applies substitution logic for unavailable samples, border cases, and specific prediction modes. The module uses multiple internal registers and combinational logic to determine the final substituted samples, which are then output for further use in the intra prediction process.
