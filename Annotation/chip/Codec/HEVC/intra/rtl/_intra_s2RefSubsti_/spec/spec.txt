Module name: intra_s2RefSubsti. Module specification: This module performs reference sample substitution for intra prediction in video encoding. It processes 8 banks of 4 samples each in parallel, handling various block sizes and prediction modes. The module takes inputs such as pseuAdr (addressing information), isAbove/isLeft/isTopLeft (neighboring sample availability flags), tuSize (transform unit size), data (input samples), and various position and mode parameters. It outputs sub_data (substituted reference samples), sub_tl (substituted top-left sample), and substi_Opt (substitution options). Internal signals include srambank (input sample storage), sub_srambank (substituted sample storage), and various registers for processing and control. The module is divided into several sections: input processing, reference sample selection, substitution logic for different cases (e.g., unavailable samples, special modes), an
