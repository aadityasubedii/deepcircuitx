Module name: intrac_top. 
Module specification: The 'intrac_top' module serves as the top-level integration in a video processing application, specifically catering to intra prediction in video codecs. It interfaces with the submodule 'intra_top', coordinating inputs related to video frame dimensions and intra prediction system specifics. The primary inputs include the clock signal (`clk`), reset signals (`arst_n`, `rst_n`), operational mode (`mode`), picture dimensions (`pic_width_in_luma_samples`, `pic_height_in_luma_samples`), CTU and TB positioning (`first_ctu_in_slice_x`, `first_ctu_in_slice_y`, `first_ctu_in_tile_x`, `first_ctu_in_tile_y`, `last_ctu_in_tile_x`, `last_ctu_in_tile_y`, `xCtb`, `yCtb`, `xTb_rela`, `yTb_rela`), residuals and prediction modes (`residuals`, `predSamples_inter`, `intra_cuPredMode`, `isPcm`). Output signals include readies for residuals and CABAC intra entropy coding (`resi_rdy`, `cabad_intra_rdy`), and the output reconstructed samples (`r_reconSamples`). Internal operations are primarily managed in the 'intra_top' submodule where most processing logic resides, as the top module passes signals directly to this submodule without internal state management or signal alteration, essentially acting as a structural framework connecting the external interfaces. The `intrac_top` module integrates various components related to picture processing, coordination of prediction units, and interfacing with the intra-prediction subsystem, organizing the flow between input specifications and the predictive computational logic carried out in the subordinate module `intra_top`.
