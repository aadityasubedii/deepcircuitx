    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'intrac_top' module acts as a top-level orchestrator for intra prediction in video codecs, primarily interfacing and routing signals between inputs and the 'intra_top' submodule. It manages synchronization via clock and reset signals, oversees video frame parameters, and handles intra prediction specifics, delegating detailed processing tasks to 'intra_top'. This structural approach simplifies external interactions and focuses on transmission efficiency without internal logic elaboration."
