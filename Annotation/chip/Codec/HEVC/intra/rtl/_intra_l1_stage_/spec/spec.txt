Module name: intra_l1_stage. Module specification: The intra_l1_stage module is a Verilog component designed for processing intra prediction operations for a video or image processing application, integral to encoding and decoding tasks at a level-1 (L1) stage. The module supports numerous input ports such as `clk` (clock signal), `rst_n` (synchronous reset), `arst_n` (asynchronous reset), along with configuration and control flags such as `bStop_1_1`, `bStop_2`, `l1_mode`, `l1_tuSize`, among others, which manage module timings and operational settings. Additionally, it accepts image data inputs including `sub_data` (subpixel data) and `sub_top_left_pixel` (top-left values of subpixels). The output ports deliver processed pixel data and prediction results like `l1_sub_top_left_pixel_P`, `l1_mainRefReg`, and planes `r_plan_0` to `r_plan_3`, facilitating further stages of image processing or compression. The module harnesses an internal signal `sub_data_P` serving as an intermediary carrier of processed subpixel data between its significant internal components: `intra_s3RefSubsti`, which substitutes reference subpixels; `intra_pixCtrl`, which controls pixel operations and adjusts according to the module's configuration; and `intra_pred_l1`, responsible for predictive modeling and compression-related transformations. This structured architecture enables comprehensive handling and transformation of image data, supporting enhanced predictive encoding or decoding performance in video processing systems.
