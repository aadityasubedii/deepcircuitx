Module-level comment: The `intra_l1_stage` module performs intra prediction for video/image processing at an L1 stage, crucial for encoding/decoding tasks. It handles input parameters and image data, processes them through sub-modules `intra_s3RefSubsti` for reference pixel substitution, `intra_pixCtrl` for pixel management based on configurations, and `intra_pred_l1` for predictive modeling. Outputs include processed pixel data and predictive results, facilitating further compression or processing stages.
