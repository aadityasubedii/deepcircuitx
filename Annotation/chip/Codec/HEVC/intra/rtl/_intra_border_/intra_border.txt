Module-level comment: The 'intra_border' module determines boundary conditions for Coding Tree Units (CTUs) in video coding, evaluating their position relative to picture edges and subdivision borders (tiles/slices). Utilizing input coordinates, picture dimensions, and block sizes, it computes flags indicating boundary adjacency and offsets for edge handling. This is achieved via dynamic calculations within an always block, leveraging bitwise operations and condition checks to set appropriate flags and values for encoding optimization.
