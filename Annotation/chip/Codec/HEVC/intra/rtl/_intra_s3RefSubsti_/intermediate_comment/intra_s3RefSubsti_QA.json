It takes inputs such as different pixel data samples, substitution options, and decides whether to substitute top-level pixels. Depending on the situation, it can choose from direct bypass data, specific substitution patterns, or current pixel values. The module processes 8 sets of pixel data, and for each set, depending on defined rules, it selects new pixel values. The output is the substituted pixel data and potentially a substituted top-level pixel. This appears tailored for image or video processing where pixel manipulation based on conditions is required."

These options dictate the substitution behavior per pixel group.\n- `is_topl_sub`: A Boolean signal derived from `substi_Opt` to decide whether the top-level pixel (`data_tl`) is to be substituted.\n- `channel_Cr`: Also derived from `substi_Opt`, this Boolean flag indicates if the chroma bypass data (`byPa_P_DR_1_cr`) should be used, affecting decision-making in pixel substitution.\n- `r_b`, `r_rt`: These wires extract boundary-related pixel values from `btRtSamples` and can be used for substitution in specific scenarios as defined by the substitution options.\n\nThese internal signals are crucial for manipulating and substituting pixel data conditionally, enabling flexible processing tailored to varying requirements, particularly in image or video processing applications."
