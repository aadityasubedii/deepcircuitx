Module name: intra_s3RefSubsti.
Module specification: The 'intra_s3RefSubsti' module is designed for selective pixel data substitution in image or video processing applications. It takes multiple inputs, including pixel data (`data`), top-level pixel data (`data_tl`), direct bypass data options (`byPa_P_DR_1` and `byPa_P_DR_1_cr`), boundary-related pixels (`btRtSamples`), and substitution options (`substi_Opt`). It outputs substituted pixel data (`sub_data`) and potentially a substituted top-level pixel (`sub_tl`), based on conditions specified through substitution options. Internally, the module utilizes various registers and arrays such as `srambank` for temporary pixel data storage, `pixel` and `sub_pixel` for original and substituted pixel values, and control flags (`is_topl_sub`, `channel_Cr`) extracted from `substi_Opt`. The bulk of the pixel manipulation is done in a generate block where individual pixels are substituted based on the options specified by `opt[i]`, with different substitution scenarios handled through a case statement. Other parts of the module handle top-level pixel substitution and setup of default or bypass pixel data based on chroma flags. This module allows for complex conditional pixel data processing, making it suitable for scenarios where different substitution patterns or direct bypassing of pixel data is necessary.
