Module-level comment: The 'intra_s3RefSubsti' module processes and substitutes pixel data for image/video applications. It utilizes inputs like pixel arrays and substitution options, handling data through internal registers (`srambank`, `pixel`, `sub_pixel`) and decision logic within a generate block and case statement for conditional substitutions based on the substitution options. Output includes substituted pixel arrays and a top-level pixel, ensuring dynamic data manipulation tailored to specific conditions and requirements.
