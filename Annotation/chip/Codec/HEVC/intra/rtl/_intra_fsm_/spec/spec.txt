Module name: intra_fsm. 

Module specification: The intra_fsm module is a finite state machine designed to handle transformations or operations for image or video processing, typically managing transformation units (TUs) based on various input parameters. It utilizes the inputs: `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `arst_n` (asynchronous reset), `rst_n` (synchronous reset), `tuSize` (transformation unit size), `mode` (operation mode), `bStop` (control signal to halt operations), and `isInter` (indicator for inter-prediction usage). The outputs include `cIdx` (chroma index), `X` and `Y` (positional parameters), `preStage` (preliminary stage indicator), and `order` (sequencing output). Inside, the module uses internal signals such as `r_cIdx` (holds intermediate chroma index values), `currentState` (current state of FSM), and `nextState` (next state the FSM will transition to). The code is sectioned primarily into blocks handling the clock-driven state transitions and output determination based on `currentState` and `tuSize`. This involves switching through numerous states, each associated with specific operations enacted through conditional checks and state changes which guide the FSM execution flow, contributing to the versatile image and video transformations based on the given parameters.
