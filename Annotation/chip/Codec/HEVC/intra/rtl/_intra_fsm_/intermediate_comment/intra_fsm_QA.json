It handles different transformation sizes and conditions by transitioning through various states, each associated with specific operations and output values (`X`, `Y`, `preStage`, `order`). It processes these based on the incoming signals and transitions between states upon every clock cycle, determined by the input conditions. This module is typically used in image or video processing where transformation units (TUs) parameters are manipulated. The FSM uses a combination of synchronous and asynchronous resets to control its state transitions, managing state sequences to modify or readjust the behavior or output depending on the transformation size (`tuSize`), macroblock mode (`mode`), and other conditions such as chroma format and inter-prediction (`isChroma` and `isInter`)."
