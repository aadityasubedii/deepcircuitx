Module-level comment: The intra_fsm module is a finite state machine handling image/video transformation operations based on inputs like transformation size (tuSize), mode, and inter-prediction (isInter). It manages states through synchronous and asynchronous resets, processing outputs such as chroma indices and coordinates (X, Y) aligned with the current state and tuSize. Adjustments are triggered on clock edges, reflecting conditional progression through numerous preset states to achieve desired transformations.
