Module-level comment: The `intra_inputTrafo` module performs coordinate and size transformations for transformation units in video encoding. It calculates absolute coordinates and adjusted sizes for the TUs based on the CTB's coordinates and the initial TU size, with special handling for chroma components. Inputs include CTB coordinates `(xCtb, yCtb)`, relative TU positions `(xTb_rela, yTb_rela)`, and TU size `i_tuSize`. Outputs are adjusted TU coordinates `(xTb, yTb)` and size `tuSize`. The processing leverages shifts and conditional logic, considering chroma adjustments when applicable.
