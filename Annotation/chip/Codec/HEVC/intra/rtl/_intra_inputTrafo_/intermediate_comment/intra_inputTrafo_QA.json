It computes the absolute coordinates `(xTb, yTb)` and the TU size `tuSize` based on the coding tree block (CTB) coordinates `(xCtb, yCtb)`, relative coordinates within the CTB `(xTb_rela, yTb_rela)`, and the input transformation unit size `i_tuSize`. If the encoding is for chroma components (`isChroma=1`), additional adjustments are made based on the transformation unit size to handle different chroma formats properly. The operations involve shifts and conditional logic to handle size adjustments and alignment specific to luma and chroma components."
