    "spec": "Module name: intra_inputTrafo. \n\nModule specification: The `intra_inputTrafo` module in Verilog is designed for handling coordinate and size transformations pertinent to a video encoding context, specifically intended for transformation units (TU) based on their positioning within a coding tree block (CTB) and consideration of the component type. It processes input signals `xCtb`, `yCtb`, `xTb_rela`, and `yTb_rela`, which denote the absolute coordinates of the CTB and the relative coordinates of the TU within that CTB, respectively. The size of the TU at the input is represented by `i_tuSize`. The output signals include `xTb` and `yTb`, which are the adjusted absolute coordinates of the TU after potential chroma-specific adjustments, and `tuSize`, which is the final computed size of the TU potentially adjusted for chroma components. Internally, the module uses `xTb_` and `yTb_` as wire signals to initially compute the intermediary absolute coordinates by combining the base CTB coordinates with the TU's relative positions, scaled by appropriate factors. The final output coordinates `xTb` and `yTb` are adjusted based on whether the operation concerns chroma components (`isChroma`), with specific additional conditions based on the TU size (`i_tuSize`). The most pivotal parts of the code involve conditional assignments to determine the final `tuSize` based on chroma encoding needs and calculating the adjusted `xTb` and `yTb` coordinates for chroma components under different conditions. The module effectively enables precise positioning and sizing of TUs relative to CTBs, accounting for variations in encoding requirements for chroma components.",
