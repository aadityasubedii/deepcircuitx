    "spec": "Module name: intra_angleToang. \nModule specification: The intra_angleToang module is designed to convert a signed 7-bit input `angle` into an unsigned 5-bit output `ang` by mapping specific input angles to distinct digital codes. This mapping is based on predefined angular thresholds, useful in digital systems requiring discrete angle measures. The input port `angle` accepts signed values, representing varying degrees of angular displacement, while the output port `ang` delivers coded numerical representations of these angles. An internal register `ang` holds and propagates the output values, which are determined within an always block using a case statement. Each case correlates specific input angles to unique outputs, with a default output of `17` for any angle value not explicitly mapped in the cases. This setup facilitates the encoding of angular data for further digital processing, making the module particularly suited for applications involving angular measurement or positioning.",

It maps distinct input angle values to corresponding output codes, which appear to relate to angles. The input ranges from negative to positive values, each mapping to a specific output. Any angle not specifically mapped defaults to an output of `17`.
