It maps distinct input angle values to corresponding output codes, which appear to relate to angles. The input ranges from negative to positive values, each mapping to a specific output. Any angle not specifically mapped defaults to an output of `17`. This functionality is commonly used in angle-based applications where discrete angle measures are converted into digital representation."

In the context of this module, it accepts discrete angular values that are mapped to specific digital output codes. The negative values indicate angles shifted in one direction, while positive values indicate angles shifted in the opposite direction.\n\nOutput ports: `ang`. Explanation: The output `ang` is an unsigned 5-bit value which represents a coded version of the input angle. Each distinct angle input (from the `angle` port) is converted into a specific coded number through a case-based mapping. This output can be used in digital systems where angle measures need to be encoded."
