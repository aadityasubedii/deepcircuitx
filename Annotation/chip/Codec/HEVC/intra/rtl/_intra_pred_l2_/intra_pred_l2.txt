Module-level comment: The 'intra_pred_l2' module performs intra-frame prediction for video/image processing, generating prediction samples based on variable inputs like mode and transformation unit size. It utilizes internal registers and arrays for data manipulation, processing through conditional logic and arithmetic operations, handling differential prediction modes, and applying filters as configured. The design incorporates conditional generation and iterative assignments to accommodate varying prediction algorithms and optimization options, formulating an efficient predictive mechanism essential in codec operations.
