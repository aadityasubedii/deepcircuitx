Module name: intra_pred_l2.

Module specification: The 'intra_pred_l2' module is designed for generating prediction samples for intra-frame prediction in video or image processing applications. It facilitates sophisticated algorithms based on the input modes to calculate pixel values within a transformation unit. The inputs to this module include synchronization signals (`clk`, `arst_n`, `rst_n`), control signals (`bStop`, `mode`, `isPredFilter`), video parameters (`tuSize`, `X`, `Y`, `gp_bitDepth`, `top_left_pixel`), references (`mainRefReg`, `DC_xxxx_data`, `r_plan_0` to `r_plan_3`, `r_r0`, `r_r1`), and computational parameters (`weight`, `unFil_opt`, `preStage`). The single output `predSamples` holds the computed prediction samples for the block.

Internally, this module uses arrays (`refm`, `predPixel`, `plan_0` to `plan_3`) and variables (`DC_xxxxx`, `DC_unShift`, `DC_unShift_temp`, `dev`, `shift`, `unFilDC`, `unFilDC_5`, `unFilDC_432`, `ang_0`, `ang_1`, `dc1_9bit`, `dc2_8bit`, `dc3_8bit`) to store interim data and computed results based on input configurations and detailed prediction logic. Numerous intermediate computations and conditions affect the prediction output, such as dealing with filtered and unfiltered modes, computing weighted sums, and adjusting based on pre-computed plans.

The module is structured into different generative blocks where predictive and computational methodologies are applied. These include registering reference data, extracting and computing weights, and applying transformation units. Specifically, the module handles reference manipulation, weighting calculations, applying prediction algorithms based on operational mode and configurations (like bit depth and transformation unit size), and generating final prediction samples based on intra-prediction blocking or tiling schemes for image/video processing tasks. Overall, the 'intra_pred_l2' module integrates complex control paths and diverse computational formulas to efficiently generate high-quality prediction results, making it a crucial component in processing pipelines for high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) or similar standards.
