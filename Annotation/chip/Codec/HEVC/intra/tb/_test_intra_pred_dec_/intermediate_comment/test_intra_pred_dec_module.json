    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test_intra_pred_dec' module simulates intra-prediction decoding in video decoding systems, focusing on both luma and chroma components per HEVC standards. It processes inputs through simulation of prediction units, managing data flow via input and output ports for timing signals, resets, and data read from files. Internally, it uses control signals and blocks to implement HEVC-specific test scenarios, ensuring the correct operation of intra-prediction with various configurations and bit depths."
