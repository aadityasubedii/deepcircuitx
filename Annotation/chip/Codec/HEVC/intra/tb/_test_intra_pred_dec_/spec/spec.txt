Module name: test_intra_pred_dec.

Module specification: The 'test_intra_pred_dec' module tests the intra-prediction decoding mechanism for a video decoder, specifically designed for handling both luma and chroma components in accordance with video standards like HEVC/H.265. It primarily operates based on input and outputs including a clock signal (`clk`), asynchronous (`arst_n`) and synchronous reset (`rst_n`) inputs facilitating the signal synchronization and module initialization. The output ports comprise readiness signals for residuals (`ri_res_rdy`) and predictions (`ri_pred_rdy`), along with the actual reconstructed intra-prediction samples (`ir_recon`). Internal signals such as `ri_res`, `ri_res_val`, `ri_pred`, and `ri_pred_val` manage the residual and prediction data buffering and validation. Coordinates (`xCtb`, `yCtb`), sizes (`tuSize`), and modes (`cuPredMode`, `lumaMode`, `chromaMode`) help in controlling processing per Coding Tree and Transform Units. The module is structured into several initial and always blocks handling data loading from files, validation, simulation of intra-prediction processing, and interaction with a submodule (`intra_top`). These blocks manage data reading, filing operations, and conditional tests to check for data integrity and synchronization, allowing comprehensive testing and validation against expected outcomes. The processing logic embedded within handles complex scenarios of typical intra-prediction paths such as bit-depth considerations and component-specific processing.
