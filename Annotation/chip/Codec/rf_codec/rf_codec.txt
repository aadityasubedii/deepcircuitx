The rf_codec repository houses a comprehensive suite of RF signal encoding and decoding modules tailored for digital communication systems, especially in RFID technology. On the decoding end, it includes specialized modules like 'miller_decoder', 'manch_decoder', 'fmiller_decoder', and a central 'rf_decoder' that collectively handle Manchester, Miller, and FM0 encoded signals using a doubled-frequency clock for accurate synchronization and error detection. Each decoder processes incoming encoded data (`din`), extracts information, and flags errors, managing output impedances for various bus compliance. On the encoding side, 'rf_encoder' together with its sub-modules 'fmiller_encoder', 'manchester_encoder', and 'miller_encoder' performs Miller, Manchester, and FM0 encoding on digital input signals. These encoders leverage a high-speed clock (`clk2x`) to ensure timing accuracy and output management, enabling or disabling outputs based on control inputs to maintain signal integrity across communication channels. This structured approach in both encoding and decoding facilitates reliable data handling, suitable for advanced communication environments where precise data transmission and reception are critical.
