    "spec": "Module name: miller_decoder.\n\nModule specification: The 'miller_decoder' is a digital logic module designed to decode Miller-encoded data. It utilizes a double-frequency clock input (`clk2x`) to sample incoming data (`din`) and uses internal logic to detect synchronization and decode the data based on detected patterns. The module outputs the decoded data on `dout` and indicates any decoding errors or synchronization issues via the `error` signal. Both `dout` and `error` are conditional on the `enable` input, which controls the output state allowing for high-impedance outputs when disabled for bus-sharing configurations. Internally, the module uses a 4-bit shift register (`fifo`) to store the latest bits of the input data, using this historical data to assess synchronization and decoding correctness. The synchronization flag (`syn_flg`) determines the behavior of a derived clock (`clk1x`), which toggles based on successful synchronization. The `dout_buf` buffer holds the intermediate decoded data before being output. The module comprises three main always blocks: one that manages the `fifo` shift register and the `syn_flg` setting, another that controls the `clk1x` based on `syn_flg`, and a third that drives the `dout_buf` with decoded data based on positive edges of `clk1x`. The entire operation ensures coherent processing of encoded input sequences into usable digital data, controlled and synchronized accurately by internal logic mechanisms.",

This module processes incoming digital signals (din) synchronized to a double-frequency clock (clk2x). It uses a shift register (fifo) to detect patterns and set a synchronization flag (syn_flg). When certain patterns are detected in the input, it toggles or sets the clk1x based on the state of syn_flg. The decoded data output (dout) and an error signal are generated based on clk1x-driven logic, indicating whether the incoming data is properly synchronized and decoded. The outputs (dout and error) are conditioned to be high-impedance when not enabled, allowing for potential bus-sharing configurations in larger digital systems."

It primarily manages the synchronization and the updating of the FIFO as well as toggling of the clk1x based on synchronization flags.\n- din: This is the data input port, carrying the encoded Miller sequence which needs to be decoded. It is read into a FIFO shift register for pattern detection and decoding.\n- enable: This input port enables the output of the module. When not enabled ('enable' is low), the dout and error outputs will be set to high-impedance ('bz), allowing other devices to use the bus without conflict.\n\nOutput ports: dout, error.\nExplanation:\n- dout: This is the decoded output data of the module generated after processing the din input considering patterns via clk1x-driven logic. It presents decoded bits synchronized to the clk1x.\n- error: This is an output that indicates decoding errors or synchronization problems. If the module is enabled and synchronization fails (indicated by 'syn_flg'), this output will be asserted high, suggesting a problem with the input encoding or sequence."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: fifo, syn_flg, dout_buf, clk1x.\nExplanation:\n- fifo: This is a 4-bit shift register used to store the most recent bits of the incoming data (din). It shifts data upon each positive edge of clk2x, allowing the module to examine patterns within the most recent four bits of input data. This shift register is crucial for pattern detection needed for synchronization and decoding.\n- syn_flg: A boolean flag used to indicate synchronization status. It is set or cleared based on certain detected patterns in the fifo shift register. When the correct pattern (indicative of synchronization in Miller encoding, like '10') is detected, syn_flg is set; otherwise, it may be cleared based on other patterns ('1111' or '0000'). This flag controls whether clk1x is toggled or held at zero.\n- dout_buf: A temporary buffer for the decoded output data. This register holds the output data bit which is driven by the logic evaluated at the positive edge of clk1x, based on the fifo contents. The final dout signal output to external circuits is sourced from this buffer, conditional on the enable signal.\n- clk1x: A derived clock signal that is controlled based on the syn_flg. It is toggled (invert its state) when synchronization is established (syn_flg is high); otherwise, it is held at zero. The positive edge of clk1x triggers the logic that evaluates the fifo to generate the output data in dout_buf. This clock essentially gates the decoding logic, enabling updates to the output only when synchronization is assured."
