    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'miller_decoder' module decodes Miller-encoded data using a double-frequency clock (`clk2x`). It employs a 4-bit shift register (`fifo`) to examine input data patterns, synchronizing via a dynamic clock (`clk1x`) controlled by a synchronization flag (`syn_flg`). Output `dout` and error indication `error` are driven by this synchronized logic, gated by an `enable` input which also manages output impedance for bus compatibility."
