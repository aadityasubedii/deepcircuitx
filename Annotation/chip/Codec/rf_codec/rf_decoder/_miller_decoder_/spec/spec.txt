Module name: miller_decoder.

Module specification: The 'miller_decoder' is a digital logic module designed to decode Miller-encoded data. It utilizes a double-frequency clock input (`clk2x`) to sample incoming data (`din`) and uses internal logic to detect synchronization and decode the data based on detected patterns. The module outputs the decoded data on `dout` and indicates any decoding errors or synchronization issues via the `error` signal. Both `dout` and `error` are conditional on the `enable` input, which controls the output state allowing for high-impedance outputs when disabled for bus-sharing configurations. Internally, the module uses a 4-bit shift register (`fifo`) to store the latest bits of the input data, using this historical data to assess synchronization and decoding correctness. The synchronization flag (`syn_flg`) determines the behavior of a derived clock (`clk1x`), which toggles based on successful synchronization. The `dout_buf` buffer holds the intermediate decoded data before being output. The module comprises three main always blocks: one that manages the `fifo` shift register and the `syn_flg` setting, another that controls the `clk1x` based on `syn_flg`, and a third that drives the `dout_buf` with decoded data based on positive edges of `clk1x`. The entire operation ensures coherent processing of encoded input sequences into usable digital data, controlled and synchronized accurately by internal logic mechanisms.
