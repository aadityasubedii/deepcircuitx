Module name: manch_decoder. Module specification: The manch_decoder is a digital logic module designed to decode Manchester encoded signals, which combines clock and data information. It operates with an input clock signal `clk2x` that is twice the frequency of the data rate for sampling the incoming Manchester encoded data input `din`. The `enable` signal activates the decoding process, and the module outputs the decoded data on `dout` and any potential decoding errors on `error`. Internally, the module utilizes a 4-bit shift register `fifo` to sample incoming data bits, a synchronization flag `syn_flg` indicating valid Manchester transitions, `error_buf` to buffer error conditions, `dout_buf` to buffer the decoded data, and `clk1x` deriving from `clk2x` to handle mid-bit transitions. The code includes two primary always blocks: the first triggered at the positive edge of `clk2x` managing the shift register updates, synchronization flag, and the generated clock `clk1x`; the second triggered at the positive edge of `clk1x`, which decodes the data, manages error conditions, and updates the output buffers based on the sampled data bits. Output signals `error` and `dout` are assigned to either the buffer values or high impedance states depending on the `enable` signal status, ensuring proper module output control.
