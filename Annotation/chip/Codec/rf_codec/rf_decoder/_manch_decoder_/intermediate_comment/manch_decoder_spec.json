    "spec": "Module name: manch_decoder. Module specification: The manch_decoder is a digital logic module designed to decode Manchester encoded signals, which combines clock and data information. It operates with an input clock signal `clk2x` that is twice the frequency of the data rate for sampling the incoming Manchester encoded data input `din`. The `enable` signal activates the decoding process, and the module outputs the decoded data on `dout` and any potential decoding errors on `error`. Internally, the module utilizes a 4-bit shift register `fifo` to sample incoming data bits, a synchronization flag `syn_flg` indicating valid Manchester transitions, `error_buf` to buffer error conditions, `dout_buf` to buffer the decoded data, and `clk1x` deriving from `clk2x` to handle mid-bit transitions. The code includes two primary always blocks: the first triggered at the positive edge of `clk2x` managing the shift register updates, synchronization flag, and the generated clock `clk1x`; the second triggered at the positive edge of `clk1x`, which decodes the data, manages error conditions, and updates the output buffers based on the sampled data bits. Output signals `error` and `dout` are assigned to either the buffer values or high impedance states depending on the `enable` signal status, ensuring proper module output control.",

Manchester encoding involves combining clock and data information into a single self-synchronizing data stream. In this module, input signals include a clock signal `clk2x` (twice the frequency of the data rate), data input `din`, and a control signal `enable`. The outputs are `dout` for the decoded data and `error` to indicate any decoding errors.\n\nThe module uses a shift register `fifo` to sample the incoming data. It detects valid Manchester encoded transitions to maintain synchronization (`syn_flg`) and to generate a half-rate clock (`clk1x`) from the incoming double rate clock. Based on the phase-corrected mid-bit transitions detected (`clk1x`), the module then determines the data bit value. Detected errors during these operations set the `error` output high when the module is enabled. When not enabled, both `dout` and `error` outputs are set to high impedance ('bz). The design aims to ensure reliable data retrieval from Manchester encoded inputs, handling synchronization, data extraction, and error checking within a digital system.\n"

It is used for sampling the incoming data and for generating the mid-bit transition clock, `clk1x`.\n- `din`: This is the Manchester encoded data input. This signal carries both the data and the clock information, which the module needs to decode to retrieve the original data.\n- `enable`: A control signal that, when high, enables the module to output the decoded data (`dout`) and any errors (`error`). When low, the outputs are put into a high impedance state.\n\n**Output Ports:**\n- `dout`\n- `error`\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `dout`: This is the output data port where the decoded data bits are presented. It reflects the original data bits that were encoded using Manchester encoding in the input `din`.\n- `error`: This output flag indicates if there has been an error in decoding.
