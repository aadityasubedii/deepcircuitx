Module name: fmiller_decoder. 
Module specification: The "fmiller_decoder" module is designed to decode data, likely based on FM0 or Miller encoding schemes, which are commonly used in RFID systems. It works by sampling incoming data signals using a generated internal slower clock (clk1x) derived from a faster clock (clk2x). The input ports include: 'clk2x', a fast clock input used to generate 'clk1x' by toggling its state on each rising edge; 'din', the input data signal sampled to control output logic based on the state of 'din' and 'clk1x'; and 'enable', a control signal that dictates whether the output 'dout' is driven by the internal buffer or set to high impedance. The output port 'dout', carries the decoded output, which is driven by the internal output buffer gated by the value of 'dout_buf' when 'enable' is high, otherwise it outputs high impedance ('bz). Internal signals include: 'fifo', an unused potential storage element; 'flg', a flag determining output buffer state based on 'din' and 'clk1x'; 'dout_buf', an output buffer updated on the rising edge of 'clk1x'; and 'clk1x', a slower internal clock. Functionally, 'fmiller_decoder' includes several code blocks: a clock division mechanism, a decoding logic that sets or resets 'flg' based on the triggering conditions, an output buffer control adjusted by 'clk1x', and the conditional output driving based on the 'enable' signal. The module initializes both 'flg' and 'clk1x' to zero to ensure defined states at startup.
