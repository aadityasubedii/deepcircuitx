    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"fmiller_decoder\" decodes data signals using a derived clock (clk1x) from a faster input clock (clk2x). It leverages dual-edge logic to control an output buffer (dout_buf) based on the input data (din) and internal flag (flg) states. The output (dout) is conditionally driven based on the 'enable' signal, changing between active and high impedance states. This module operates efficiently in RFID systems for reliable data decoding."
