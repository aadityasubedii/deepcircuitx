Module-level comment: The `rf_decoder` module decodes RF signals encoded in Manchester, Miller, and FM0 formats. It accepts a high-frequency clock (`clk2x`) and encoded data (`din`), directly interfacing with three sub-modules (`manch_decoder`, `miller_decoder`, `fmiller_decoder`) that handle respective decoding schemes. Each decoder is consistently enabled, delivering output data and error detection signals, with `fmiller_error` unconnected.
