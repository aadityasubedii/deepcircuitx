Each decoder takes a doubled clock frequency `clk2x` and a data input `din`, outputs decoded data, and, where applicable, error signals to indicate any decoding issues. The decoded outputs and error signals are routed to respective outputs of the `rf_decoder` module. The module ensures versatile decoding capabilities within a single integrated module for varied RF signal encoding types."

It synchronizes the data processing in each sub-decoder of the module.\n- `din`: This stands for \"data in\". It is the encoded input data stream to be decoded by the module's sub-decoders.\n\nOutput ports: manch_out, manch_error, miller_out, miller_error, fmiller_out, fmiller_error.\nExplanation:\n- `manch_out`: Output from the Manchester decoder sub-module, representing the decoded data stream of Manchester encoding.\n- `manch_error`: Output error signal from the Manchester decoder. It indicates if there were any errors during the decoding process of Manchester encoded data.\n- `miller_out`: Output from the Miller decoder sub-module, providing the decoded data of Miller encoding.\n- `miller_error`: Output error signal from the Miller decoder. It reveals any decoding errors encountered with Miller encoded data.\n- `fmiller_out`: Output from the FM0 decoder sub-module, indicating the decoded data of FM0 encoding.\n- `fmiller_error`: FM0 decoder does not have an explicit error output connected in the module, although the instantiation template implies an availability of error handling; if this is needed, the connection needs addressing in the design."

Therefore, no additional internal signals are used or required for data transfer or intermediate processing within the defined scope of the provided code.\n\nExplanation:\n- Since the `rf_decoder` module primarily acts as a wrapper for the sub-modules, it directly wires input signals (`clk2x`, `din`) and output signals (`manch_out`, `manch_error`, `miller_out`, `miller_error`, `fmiller_out`, `fmiller_error`) to/from these sub-modules. This setup avoids the need for additional internal signals within the `rf_decoder` itself.\n- Without explicit internal signaling or storage elements such as registers, buffers, or buses declared in the code, it can be concluded that the module's implementation is designed for straightforward signal routing and delegation to sub-modules without further internal processing."
