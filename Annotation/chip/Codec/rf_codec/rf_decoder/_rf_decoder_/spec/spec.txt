Module name: rf_decoder. Module specification: The `rf_decoder` is a versatile Verilog module designed to decode RF signals encoded using Manchester, Miller, and FM0 encoding schemes. It features three main input ports: `clk2x`, a clock input that operates at twice the frequency of the data rate for synchronization of data processing; `din`, an encoded data input stream; and an `enable` signal, set high for continuous operation. It outputs six signals: `manch_out` and `manch_error` for the Manchester decoded data and error detection; `miller_out` and `miller_error` for the Miller decoded data and error detection; and `fmiller_out` (FM0 decoded data), with the `fmiller_error` not explicitly connected in this implementation. Internally, the module lacks additional signals as it serves primarily as a seamless integrator routing inputs directly to the respective decoder sub-modules (`manch_decoder`, `miller_decoder`, `fmiller_decoder`) and their outputs back to the module's own outputs. Each decoder sub-module is directly wired to the inputs and outputs, with `enable` set to 1 (true) to signify active decoding, facilitating direct, efficient signal processing with no intermediate buffering or processing stages, thereby simplifying the moduleâ€™s architecture and ensuring low-latency operation.
