Module-level comment: The `fmiller_encoder` module performs Manchester encoding on input data (`din`) with enhanced output control via a double-rate clock (`clk2x`). It uses internal logic to toggle a counter (`count`) based on negated encoded signal (`b`) during the `clk2x`'s negative edge. The final output (`dout`) is gated by `count` and `clk2x`, and can be disabled, setting it to high impedance (`'bz`) when not enabled. This setup ensures reliable and synchronized encoded outputs for advanced digital communication systems.
