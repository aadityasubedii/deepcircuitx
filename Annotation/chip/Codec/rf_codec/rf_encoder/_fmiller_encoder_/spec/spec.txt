Module name: fmiller_encoder. 
Module specification: The `fmiller_encoder` is a Verilog module designed to encode digital signals using the Manchester encoding scheme, enhanced with a toggling mechanism based on a double-rate clock for precise output control. The module has four input ports: `rst_n`, an active low reset that initializes module states; `clk2x`, a double-rate clock that synchronizes internal logic operations; `din`, the binary data input for encoding; and `enable`, which controls whether the output is active or in a high impedance state ('bz). The singular output port, `dout`, delivers the final encoded and processed signal. Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `a` for the direct Manchester encoded output, `b` as the logical negation of `a` to facilitate edge-triggered toggling, and `count` a binary register that toggles its state based on `b` during the negative edge of `clk2x`. The manchester_encoder submodule takes inputs and generates the `a` signal. The `count` is utilized in conjunction with `clk2x` to conditionally gate the final output through `dout`, dependent on the enabling signal. Together, these components and their interactions within the fmiller_encoder module ensure precise timing and output control suitable for complex digital systems requiring reliable encoded signal transmission.
