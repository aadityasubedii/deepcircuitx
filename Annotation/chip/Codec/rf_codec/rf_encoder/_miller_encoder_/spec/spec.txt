Module name: miller_encoder. Module specification: The `miller_encoder` module is dedicated to applying Miller encoding to a digital input signal (`din`) for data communication, aimed at eliminating long sequences of zeros by altering the signal depending on the previous bit and timing. The input ports include `rst_n`, an active-low reset signal that clears internal states; `clk2x`, a double-frequency clock signal guiding the encoding timing; `din`, the digital data to be encoded; and `enable`, a signal controlling the output states (active or high-impedance). The outputs are `dout`, the Miller encoded data, and `ready`, signaling the readiness for new data. Internally, the module utilizes `odevity`, a toggle flag for managing bit processing phases; `ready_buf`, a buffer indicating processing completion; `out_buf`, which temporarily holds the encoded data before output; and `last_din`, which captures the last processed input bit to influence ensuing output based on encoding rules. In operation, the module primarily functions within an always block triggered by `clk2x`, where it first checks for reset conditions, followed by encoding logic that toggles `odevity` to handle the current bit and setup for the next. Based on the `enable` signal, the final output may either reflect the processed data or remain in a high-impedance state, controlled via conditional assignments outside the always block. Additionally, initial conditions set some signal defaults at startup.
