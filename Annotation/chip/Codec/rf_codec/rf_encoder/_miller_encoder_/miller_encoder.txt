Module-level comment: The `miller_encoder` module implements Miller encoding to prevent long zero sequences in digital communication. It utilizes an always block triggered by a double-frequency clock (`clk2x`), handling input (`din`) based on previous bit history (`last_din`) and maintains encoding state (`out_buf`, `ready_buf`) toggled via `odevity`. Outputs (`dout`, `ready`) are controlled by `enable`, providing active signals or high-impedance states.
