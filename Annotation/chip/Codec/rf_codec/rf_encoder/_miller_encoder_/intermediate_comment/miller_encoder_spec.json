    "spec": "Module name: miller_encoder. Module specification: The `miller_encoder` module is dedicated to applying Miller encoding to a digital input signal (`din`) for data communication, aimed at eliminating long sequences of zeros by altering the signal depending on the previous bit and timing. The input ports include `rst_n`, an active-low reset signal that clears internal states; `clk2x`, a double-frequency clock signal guiding the encoding timing; `din`, the digital data to be encoded; and `enable`, a signal controlling the output states (active or high-impedance). The outputs are `dout`, the Miller encoded data, and `ready`, signaling the readiness for new data. Internally, the module utilizes `odevity`, a toggle flag for managing bit processing phases; `ready_buf`, a buffer indicating processing completion; `out_buf`, which temporarily holds the encoded data before output; and `last_din`, which captures the last processed input bit to influence ensuing output based on encoding rules. In operation, the module primarily functions within an always block triggered by `clk2x`, where it first checks for reset conditions, followed by encoding logic that toggles `odevity` to handle the current bit and setup for the next. Based on the `enable` signal, the final output may either reflect the processed data or remain in a high-impedance state, controlled via conditional assignments outside the always block. Additionally, initial conditions set some signal defaults at startup.",

It takes a digital input signal (`din`) and encodes it based on the timing (`clk2x`, a clock signal at twice the frequency of the data rate) and the value of the last input bit (`last_din`). The primary aim is to prevent long runs of zeros in the output, which helps in maintaining synchronization in communication systems. The module utilizes `enable` to control the output; when `enable` is high, the processed output (`dout`) and the status of readiness (`ready`) are provided. If `enable` is low, these outputs are in high-impedance state (`'bz`). The `rst_n` signal is used for asynchronously resetting the internal state of the module. The internal logic toggles the output on certain conditions to ensure Miller encoding is achieved, and it tracks readiness and last data input states for proper encoding on the next clock cycle."

This clock is used to drive the encoding process, determining when the module evaluates and potentially changes its outputs.\n- `din`: This is the digital input signal that is to be encoded using Miller encoding scheme. Changes in this signal's value guide how the output is generated.\n- `enable`: This controls whether the output `dout` and `ready` should be active or in a high-impedance state.
