Module specification: The 'rf_encoder' module is instrumental for encoding a digital input signal 'din' into three distinct encodings: Manchester, Miller, and FM0 (Frequency Modulated Miller), utilizing a doubled frequency clock 'clk2x' and an active-low reset 'rst_n'. It also includes an 'enable' signal to control the encoding operation. The outputs 'manch_out', 'miller_out', and 'fmiller_out' correspond to the Manchester, Miller, and FM0 encoding outputs respectively. Internally, there are no explicit signals used; the module acts essentially as an aggregation point for the three encoders; Manchester, Miller, and FM0. Each encoder submodule receives the same set of inputs and generates an encoded output. The 'manchester_encoder', 'miller_encoder', and 'fmiller_encoder' sections within the code highlight this structured approach to generating varied encoded outputs essential for RF communication applications, ensuring versatile encoder functionality conducive for differing signal processing scenarios.",

It processes this input based on the 'clk2x' (a clock signal presumably at twice the frequency of a base clock) and 'rst_n' (an active low reset signal).
