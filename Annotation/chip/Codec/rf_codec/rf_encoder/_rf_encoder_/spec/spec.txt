Module name: rf_encoder. Module specification: The 'rf_encoder' module is instrumental for encoding a digital input signal 'din' into three distinct encodings: Manchester, Miller, and FM0 (Frequency Modulated Miller), utilizing a doubled frequency clock 'clk2x' and an active-low reset 'rst_n'. It also includes an 'enable' signal to control the encoding operation. The outputs 'manch_out', 'miller_out', and 'fmiller_out' correspond to the Manchester, Miller, and FM0 encoding outputs respectively. Internally, there are no explicit signals used; the module acts essentially as an aggregation point for the three encoders; Manchester, Miller, and FM0. Each encoder submodule receives the same set of inputs and generates an encoded output. The 'manchester_encoder', 'miller_encoder', and 'fmiller_encoder' sections within the code highlight this structured approach to generating varied encoded outputs essential for RF communication applications, ensuring versatile encoder functionality conducive for differing signal processing scenarios.
