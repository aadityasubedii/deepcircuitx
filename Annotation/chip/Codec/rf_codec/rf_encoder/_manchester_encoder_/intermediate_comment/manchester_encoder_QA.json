It operates with a double speed clock 'clk2x' to generate the encoding. The Manchester encoding involves setting 'dout' to the value of 'din' or its inverse depending on the internal state. The state alternates with each positive clock edge of 'clk2x'. Additionally, the output 'dout' can be tri-stated when 'enable' is low, allowing the output to be disconnected. This behavior is essentially for use cases where multiple drivers may be connected to a single line, providing a mechanism for avoiding conflicts."

When this signal is low, it initializes the internal state of the module, setting both the 'odevity' flag (which controls the encoding behavior on alternate clock edges) and the 'out_buf' (output buffer) to 0.\n- clk2x: This is the double speed clock input. It controls the timing of the encoding process, allowing the module to react and update its state with every positive edge of this faster-than-data clock.\n- din: This is the digital input data which needs to be Manchester encoded. Depending on the internal state toggled by 'clk2x', 'din' or its inverse will be driven to 'dout'.\n- enable: This is a control signal for the output driver. When enabled (high), the output 'dout' is active and follows the state of 'out_buf'. When disabled (low), 'dout' is in a high-impedance state, effectively disconnecting it from possible external circuitry (useful in multi-driven bus configurations).\n\nOutput ports: dout.\nExplanation:\n- dout: This is the output port where the Manchester encoded signal based on the input 'din' is available. Its state depends both on the incoming data and the frequency-controlled toggle behavior regulated by 'clk2x' and 'odevity'. It can also be tri-stated based on the 'enable' signal allowing for safer shared-bus operations."

Its role is to alternate the Manchester encoding process such that on one clock edge 'din' is output directly and on the next, its inverse is output. It switches between 0 and 1 on every positive edge of the clock 'clk2x'.\n- out_buf: This register holds the intermediate values of the output before being assigned to the actual output 'dout'.
