    "spec": "Module name: manchester_encoder. Module specification: The manchester_encoder is designed to perform Manchester encoding on the input digital signal 'din' using a double-speed clock 'clk2x'. The module has four input ports: 'rst_n' (active-low reset), 'clk2x' (double-speed clock), 'din' (input digital signal to be encoded), and 'enable' (control signal for output driver). The output port 'dout' delivers the Manchester encoded signal, which can be tri-stated if 'enable' is low, disconnecting it safely from external circuits. Internally, the module utilizes two signals: 'odevity', a binary flag that toggles on each positive clock edge to alternate the encoding method, and 'out_buf', a buffer holding intermediate output values before they are assigned to 'dout'. The Verilog code includes an always block triggered on the positive edge of 'clk2x', handling the reset functionality, toggling of 'odevity', and updating 'out_buf' based on the state of 'odevity'. The logic for updating 'out_buf' is such that it either passes 'din' directly or its inverse, depending on 'odevity'. An assign statement manages the condition of 'dout' based on the 'enable' signal, allowing for tri-state output management. This setup ensures the module effectively encodes the incoming digital signal into a Manchester encoded form while facilitating essential control over its output behavior.\n",

It operates with a double speed clock 'clk2x' to generate the encoding. The Manchester encoding involves setting 'dout' to the value of 'din' or its inverse depending on the internal state. The state alternates with each positive clock edge of 'clk2x'. Additionally, the output 'dout' can be tri-stated when 'enable' is low, allowing the output to be disconnected. This behavior is essentially for use cases where multiple drivers may be connected to a single line, providing a mechanism for avoiding conflicts."

When this signal is low, it initializes the internal state of the module, setting both the 'odevity' flag (which controls the encoding behavior on alternate clock edges) and the 'out_buf' (output buffer) to 0.\n- clk2x: This is the double speed clock input. It controls the timing of the encoding process, allowing the module to react and update its state with every positive edge of this faster-than-data clock.\n- din: This is the digital input data which needs to be Manchester encoded. Depending on the internal state toggled by 'clk2x', 'din' or its inverse will be driven to 'dout'.\n- enable: This is a control signal for the output driver. When enabled (high), the output 'dout' is active and follows the state of 'out_buf'. When disabled (low), 'dout' is in a high-impedance state, effectively disconnecting it from possible external circuitry (useful in multi-driven bus configurations).\n\nOutput ports: dout.\nExplanation:\n- dout: This is the output port where the Manchester encoded signal based on the input 'din' is available. Its state depends both on the incoming data and the frequency-controlled toggle behavior regulated by 'clk2x' and 'odevity'.
