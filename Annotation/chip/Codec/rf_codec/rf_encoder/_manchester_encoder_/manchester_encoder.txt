Module-level comment: The manchester_encoder module encodes a digital signal 'din' with Manchester encoding using a double-speed clock 'clk2x'. It features an always block for state toggling and output buffering based on clock edges, with an output 'dout' that can be tri-stated controlled by 'enable'. This structure ensures correct timing and flexible output management for encoded signals.
