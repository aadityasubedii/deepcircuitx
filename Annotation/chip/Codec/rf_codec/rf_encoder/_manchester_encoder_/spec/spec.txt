Module name: manchester_encoder. Module specification: The manchester_encoder is designed to perform Manchester encoding on the input digital signal 'din' using a double-speed clock 'clk2x'. The module has four input ports: 'rst_n' (active-low reset), 'clk2x' (double-speed clock), 'din' (input digital signal to be encoded), and 'enable' (control signal for output driver). The output port 'dout' delivers the Manchester encoded signal, which can be tri-stated if 'enable' is low, disconnecting it safely from external circuits. Internally, the module utilizes two signals: 'odevity', a binary flag that toggles on each positive clock edge to alternate the encoding method, and 'out_buf', a buffer holding intermediate output values before they are assigned to 'dout'. The Verilog code includes an always block triggered on the positive edge of 'clk2x', handling the reset functionality, toggling of 'odevity', and updating 'out_buf' based on the state of 'odevity'. The logic for updating 'out_buf' is such that it either passes 'din' directly or its inverse, depending on 'odevity'. An assign statement manages the condition of 'dout' based on the 'enable' signal, allowing for tri-state output management. This setup ensures the module effectively encodes the incoming digital signal into a Manchester encoded form while facilitating essential control over its output behavior.
