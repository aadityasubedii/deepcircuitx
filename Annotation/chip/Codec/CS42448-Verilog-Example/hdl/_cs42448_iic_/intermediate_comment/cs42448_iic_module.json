    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements an I2C controller for the CS42448 audio codec, managing initialization and I/O operations. It uses parameterized state machines to handle I2C communication, startup sequences, and timing generation. The module supports flexible system clock and I2C bus speeds, and provides configurable DAC/ADC settings. It manages I2C transactions, including start/stop conditions, data transfer, and acknowledgment, while also handling codec reset and master clock readiness."
