It manages multiple data channels for both input and output audio signals. The module uses I2C for configuration settings, synchronous serial interfaces for audio data, and includes initialization and clock management functionality. It controls the audio codec's reset behavior, and ensures proper synchronization of audio clocks for robust audio streaming."
