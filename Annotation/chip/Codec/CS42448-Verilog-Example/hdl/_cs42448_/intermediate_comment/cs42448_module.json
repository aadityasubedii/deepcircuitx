    "module": "Module-level comment: The cs42448 module interfaces with the CS42448 audio codec to facilitate both DAC and ADC operations for audio signals. It uses inputs like system clock and reset, along with serial audio inputs and controls audio output channels, I2C configuration, and clock management. Internally, digital audio handling flows through dac and adc sub-modules, while an iic sub-module manages codec configuration via I2C, ensuring synchronized, robust audio processing."
