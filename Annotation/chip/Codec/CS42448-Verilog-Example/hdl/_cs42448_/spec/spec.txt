Module name: cs42448. Module specification: The cs42448 module is designed to interface with the CS42448 audio codec, handling both analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) conversion processes for audio signals. The module operates with the following input ports: `sys_clk`, which serves as the main timing reference; `sys_nrst`, a system-wide reset; and `CS42xx8_ADC_SDIN0`, `CS42xx8_ADC_SDIN1`, `CS42xx8_ADC_SDIN2`, which are serial digital audio input channels receiving digital audio data for the ADC. The output ports include `CS42xx8_DAC_SDOUT0` to `CS42xx8_DAC_SDOUT3` for serial digital audio output from the DAC; `CS42xx8_DAC_SCLK` and `CS42xx8_DAC_LRCK` for DAC serial and left-right clocks, respectively; the same variants `CS42xx8_ADC_SCLK` and `CS42xx8_ADC_LRCK` for the ADC; `CS42xx8_MCLK` as the master clock; `CS42xx8_nRST` for audio codec reset; and `CS42xx8_SCL` and `CS42xx8_SDA` for I2C configuration communication. Internally, the module uses signals such as `forward_w`, a set of wires that temporarily hold digital audio data, `init_done`, a status wire for initialization completion, and `cs_mclk_rdy`, signaling the readiness of the master clock. The module is divided into several functional blocks: `cs42448_dac` for handling DAC-related operations, `cs42448_adc` for ADC processes, and `cs42448_iic` for managing I2C communication with the codec, facilitating configuration and control. Each block is tightly integrated to ensure robust data handling and synchronization across various audio data processing tasks.
