    "module": "Module-level comment: The `cs42448_adc` module interfaces with an ADC to convert serial data from three channels to parallel 16-bit outputs using a system clock. It manages initialization, clock generation, and data conversion through startup delays, divider counters, and internal state registers. Serial and left-right clocks are conditionally generated post-initialization for synchronized data transfer. The code efficiently handles state resets, clock toggles and data sampling controlled by sequential logic."
