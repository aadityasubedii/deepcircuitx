The module receives digital serial data from ADC channels and converts them into parallel 16-bit data outputs. It operates based on the system clock (`sys_clk`) and a reset signal (`sys_nrst`). The module checks for an initialization completion signal (`init_done`) and uses a startup delay process to ensure that the conversion can start only after certain conditions are met. The serial clock (`ADC_SCLK`) and left-right clock (`ADC_LRCK`) are generated internally, conditioned by the ADC being ready (`all_ready`). Data from three ADC input channels (`ADC_SDIN_CH0`, `ADC_SDIN_CH1`, `ADC_SDIN_CH2`) is sampled and organized into left and right channel outputs for multiple (three) sets, efficiently managing the timing and sampling phases to ensure correct data representation."
