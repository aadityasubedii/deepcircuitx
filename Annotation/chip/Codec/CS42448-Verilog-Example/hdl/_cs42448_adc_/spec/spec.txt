Module name: cs42448_adc. 
Module specification: The `cs42448_adc` module interfaces with an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) to manage data conversion processes. It receives digital serial data from three separate ADC channels (ADC_SDIN_CH0, ADC_SDIN_CH1, ADC_SDIN_CH2), converting these into parallel 16-bit data outputs for each of the three channel pairs (adc_dout_l0/r0, adc_dout_l1/r1, adc_dout_l2/r2). The module operates with a system clock (`sys_clk`) and reset signal (`sys_nrst`) and starts its operations once an external initialization completion signal (`init_done`) is detected. It generates internal serial (`ADC_SCLK`) and left-right (`ADC_LRCK`) clocks synchronized to the module's readiness, signaled by internal flags (`all_ready`, `all_ready2`). Internal counters and registers such as `adc_divider`, `startup_delay`, and `shift_bit` manage timing, sequential logic, and serial-to-parallel data conversion. Specifically, `adc_divider` controls the bit shifting for data serialization; `startup_delay` and `startup_delay2` impose initial operational delays; `shift_bit` determines the bit placement in output registers during data conversion. The sequence of operations includes system initialization, clock management, data sampling in rising and falling edges of the system clock, and data synchronization with external ADC operations, mapping systematic processes in distinct sections of the code for modular and sequential operations.
