    "module": "Module-level comment: The cs42448_dac module interfaces with a CS42448 DAC to manage digital-to-analog conversion for eight audio channels. It uses input audio signals and a system clock to generate synchronized serial data outputs and clock signals. Internal counters and state registers (dac_divider, startup_delay) ensure stable operation following initialization, governed by flags (all_ready). Outputs are managed by serializing input data and aligning it with generated clocks (sclk_r, lrck_r) ensuring proper DAC timing and data format."
