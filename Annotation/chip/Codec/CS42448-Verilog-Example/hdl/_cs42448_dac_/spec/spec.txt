Module name: cs42448_dac. Module specification: The cs42448_dac module is designed for interfacing with a CS42448 Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC), handling digital audio transmission for eight channels (four stereo pairs). The module accepts a system clock (sys_clk) and a system reset (sys_nrst) which are fundamental for timing and initialization, along with initialization status input (init_done) and 16-bit digital audio inputs for each channel (dac_din_l0 to dac_din_r3). The outputs consist of serial digital audio data streams for each channel (DAC_SDOUT_CH0 to DAC_SDOUT_CH3) and two clock signals, DAC Serial Clock (DAC_SCLK) and DAC Left-Right Clock (DAC_LRCK), which handle the timing of serial data transmission. Internally, the module uses various signals such as dac_divider for clock division, lrck_r, sclk_r for generating output clocks, and sdin_r0 to sdin_r3 for buffering serial data outputs. Startup synchronization is handled using startup_delay and startup_delay2, which ensure the system is stable before operations begin, managed by all_ready and all_ready2 flags. The code is structured into several always blocks that handle the initialization and reset conditions, clock and data signal generation, synchronization of buffer registers, and assignments of internal operations to output ports. This design efficiently packages digital audio signal processing for a multispectral DAC operation in various audio applications.
