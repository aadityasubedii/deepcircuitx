    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'top' module orchestrates the management of clock and audio signals for a CS42448 codec system. It inputs system clock and reset, processing these through a PLL (sys_pll) to generate a global clock (glb_clk) which drives the audio codec module (cs42448_u0). Audio inputs and outputs are effectively synchronized and managed, supporting both ADC and DAC operations along with I\u00b2C communications."
