Module name: top. Module specification: The `top` module serves as the central integration framework for managing clock and audio signal processes in systems utilizing the CS42448 audio codec. It accepts three inputs: `sys_clk`, which is the system's primary clock source; `sys_nrst`, an active-low system reset; and `CS42xx8_ADC_SDIN0`, which is the digital audio input for the ADC. The outputs of the module are `CS42xx8_DAC_SDOUT0`, `CS42xx8_DAC_SCLK`, `CS42xx8_DAC_LRCK` for DAC's digital output and synchronization, `CS42xx8_ADC_SCLK` and `CS42xx8_ADC_LRCK` for ADC's clock synchronization, `CS42xx8_MCLK` as the codec’s master clock, and I²C communication signals `CS42xx8_SCL` (clock), `CS42xx8_SDA` (data), and `CS42xx8_nRST` as the codec's external reset. An internal signal, `glb_clk`, generated by a `sys_pll` phase-locked loop, serves as the global clock that drives the `cs42448_u0` codec module, ensuring synchronized operation in audio processing. The code is organized into two main blocks: the `sys_pll` instantiation responsible for generating the `glb_clk` based on the system clock, and the `cs42448_u0` instantiation which manages all functionalities related to audio processing and codec control. This structural configuration facilitates effective digital audio processing in systems that incorporate audio codec functionalities.
