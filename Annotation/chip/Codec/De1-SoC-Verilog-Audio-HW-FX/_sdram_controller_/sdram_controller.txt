Module-level comment: The `sdram_controller` module interfaces with SDRAM, managing read and write operations using a state machine. It operates on signals like `wr_addr`, `wr_data`, and `rd_addr` for addressing, along with data transfer controls. Key outputs include `rd_data` and operational status signals. Internally, it uses registers like `haddr_r` and `wr_data_r` for address and data buffering respectively, alongside state-specific signals to manage timing and data integrity. The process is driven through defined states, from initialization to dynamic handling of read/write commands, ensuring compliant SDRAM communication.
