It handles reading and writing operations by managing the states and control signals required to communicate with the SDRAM. This involves generating appropriate command sequences for initialization, refresh, and active read/write operations based on the SDRAM's protocol. The controller accepts input commands for read and write, processes these commands according to SDRAM timing requirements, and outputs data and control signals accordingly. It manages address translations and state transitions to ensure data integrity and timing compliance with the SDRAM specifications."
