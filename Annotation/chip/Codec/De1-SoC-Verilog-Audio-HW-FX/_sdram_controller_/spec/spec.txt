Module name: sdram_controller. 
Module specification: The "sdram_controller" module is designed to interface with Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (SDRAM), managing basic operations such as reading and writing data. The controller uses a wide variety of input ports like `wr_addr` (write address), `wr_data` (write data), `wr_enable` (write enable signal), `rd_addr` (read address), `rd_enable` (read enable signal), `rst_n` (active low reset signal), and `clk` (clock signal). The output ports include `rd_data` (read data), `rd_ready` (read ready signal), `busy` (busy signal), and several SDRAM-specific signals such as `addr`, `bank_addr`, and control signals (`cs_n`, `ras_n`, `cas_n`, `we_n`). Internal signals like `haddr_r` (holds the current address for read/write), `wr_data_r`, `rd_data_r`, `busy`, `data_mask_low_r`, `data_mask_high_r`, `addr_r`, `bank_addr_r`, `rd_ready_r`, and others, play crucial roles in data handling and state management. The code meticulously initializes and maintains state machine controls through states like `INIT_NOP1`, `INIT_PRE1`, ..., and `READ_READ`. These states manage everything from power-on initialization sequences to the specifics of each read and write operation, including handling multiple cycles within states to respect timing constraints set out by SDRAM specifications. The code structure provides robust control over SDRAM operations while ensuring data integrity and proper system synchronization.
