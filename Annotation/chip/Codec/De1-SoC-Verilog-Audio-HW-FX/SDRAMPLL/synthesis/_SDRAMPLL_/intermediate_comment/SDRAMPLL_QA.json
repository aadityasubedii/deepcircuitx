It takes a reference clock and a reset signal as inputs and outputs a system clock, an SDRAM clock, and a reset signal. This setup is primarily used for managing clock signals and reset conditions required for operating SDRAM with a consistent timing reference by translating the input reference clock into appropriate clock outputs for the system and SDRAM, managed by an internal PLL instantiation `sys_sdram_pll_0`."
