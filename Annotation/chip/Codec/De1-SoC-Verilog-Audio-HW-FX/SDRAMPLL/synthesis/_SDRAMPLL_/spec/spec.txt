Module name: SDRAMPLL. Module specification: The "SDRAMPLL" module interfaces with an internal PLL specifically designed for generating SDRAM and system clocks based on a reference clock input. The functionality of this module includes taking a reference clock, `ref_clk_clk`, and a reset signal, `ref_reset_reset`, and outputting a reset signal `reset_source_reset`, an SDRAM clock `sdram_clk_clk`, and a system clock `sys_clk_clk`. The `ref_clk_clk` is the timing base for the PLL to generate necessary clocks, while `ref_reset_reset` provides a reset mechanism to ensure the PLL starts in a known state. The output reset signal `reset_source_reset` can be used to reset external systems, ensuring synchronous operation post-reset. The `sdram_clk_clk` and `sys_clk_clk` are generated by the PLL to meet timing requirements for SDRAM and system operations, respectively. Internally, this module directly instantiates a sub-module `SDRAMPLL_sys_sdram_pll_0` connecting inputs to outputs without additional signal manipulation or processing within the module, indicating a straightforward interface role for this PLL setup in larger systems.
