Module name: SDRAMPLL_sys_sdram_pll_0_sys_pll.

Module specification: The SDRAMPLL_sys_sdram_pll_0_sys_pll module in Verilog is designed to generate specialized clock outputs for SDRAM applications using an internal PLL configuration. It utilizes the `altera_pll` block, a configurable PLL module, to derive two clock outputs from a single reference clock (`refclk`). The module takes two inputs: `refclk`, a reference clock that drives the PLL's frequency and phase configurations, and `rst`, a reset signal for initializing the PLL state. The outputs generated include `outclk_0`, which is a direct frequency match to the reference clock with no phase shift, and `outclk_1`, which also matches the frequency of `refclk` but incorporates a -3000 ps phase shift. Additionally, a `locked` signal is provided to indicate the lock status of the PLL, asserting high when the PLL output is stable and synchronized with `refclk`. Internally, the module primarily interacts with the `altera_pll` instantiation directly connected to its inputs and outputs, with no explicitly declared internal signals outside this instantiation. The `altera_pll` component governs the core PLL functionalities based on predefined settings such as frequency, phase shift, and duty cycle for each output channel, helping achieve the desired clock characteristics for SDRAM timing synchronization.
