Module-level comment: The SDRAMPLL_sys_sdram_pll_0_sys_pll is a PLL module for SDRAM applications, generating two specific clock outputs from a reference clock using an `altera_pll` block. It accepts a reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset (`rst`), producing clocks `outclk_0` with no phase shift and `outclk_1` with a -3000 ps phase shift, along with a `locked` status signal, indicating PLL stability and synchronization.
