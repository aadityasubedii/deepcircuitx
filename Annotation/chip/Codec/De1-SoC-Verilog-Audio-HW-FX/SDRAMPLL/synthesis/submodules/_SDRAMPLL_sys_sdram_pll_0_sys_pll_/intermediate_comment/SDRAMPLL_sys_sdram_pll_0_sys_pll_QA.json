It takes a reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset signal (`rst`) as inputs, and outputs two clocks (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`) along with a locked signal. The PLL is configured through parameters such as frequency, phase shift, and duty cycle for its output clocks. It's designed to generate clocks that are essential for synchronizing the timing of SDRAM operations, with one clock output having no phase shift and the other having a negative phase shift. The `locked` output indicates whether the PLL has successfully synchronized to the input reference clock."

When asserted, it initializes the PLL state, providing a known starting point for its operations.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `locked`.\nExplanation:\n- `outclk_0`: This is one of the output clocks from the PLL. It is configured to be equal to the reference clock frequency (50 MHz) with no phase shift. This clock is typically used in systems requiring a synchronized clock signal aligned with the reference clock.\n- `outclk_1`: This is another output clock from the PLL. It matches the reference clock frequency but has a negative phase shift (-3000 ps). This output can be used where a specific phase-shifted clock is required.\n- `locked`: This output signal indicates whether the PLL has achieved and is maintaining lock with the reference clock. If the PLL is locked, this signal will be high (true), signifying that the PLL's output is stable and usable."
