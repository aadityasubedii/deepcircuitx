Specifically, the reset output is the logical NOT of the locked signal, meaning if `locked` is high (1), `reset` will be low (0), and if `locked` is low (0), `reset` will be high (1). This is typically used in digital circuits where a locked signal indicates a stable system condition, and the reset is activated when the system is not stable."

Explanation: The 'locked' input is a signal that typically indicates whether a specific part of a digital circuit (like a PLL) has achieved a stable condition. A high (1) on this port implies the system is stable, while a low (0) indicates instability.\n\nOutput ports: [reset]. Explanation: The 'reset' output is used to generate a system reset signal. It is logically inverted from the 'locked' signal, meaning it will be high (1) when 'locked' is low (0), which triggers a reset in unstable system conditions, and low (0) when 'locked' is high (1), reflecting a stable state with no need for a reset. This ensures that the system only resets during periods of instability."
