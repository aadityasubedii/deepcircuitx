    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal` module generates a reset signal inversely based on the `locked` input, indicating system stability. It directly assigns the negated `locked` signal to the `reset` output, ensuring a reset is triggered when the system is unstable. No intermediate signals are used, simplifying the implementation."
