Module specification: The `altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal` module is designed to generate a reset signal based on an input signal named `locked`. This module features a single input port, `locked`, which indicates the stability of the system\u2014with a high level meaning stable and a low level meaning unstable. The sole output port, `reset`, inversely reflects the `locked` signal so that a reset occurs during system instability. There are no internal signals used in this module, as the output is directly derived through a logical NOT operation performed on the `locked` input. The essential operation within the module is the assignment operation where `reset` is assigned the negation of `locked`. This concise design efficiently handles the generation of a system reset signal in response to changes in system stability.",

Specifically, the reset output is the logical NOT of the locked signal, meaning if `locked` is high (1), `reset` will be low (0), and if `locked` is low (0), `reset` will be high (1). This is typically used in digital circuits where a locked signal indicates a stable system condition, and the reset is activated when the system is not stable."

Explanation: The 'locked' input is a signal that typically indicates whether a specific part of a digital circuit (like a PLL) has achieved a stable condition. A high (1) on this port implies the system is stable, while a low (0) indicates instability.\n\nOutput ports: [reset]. Explanation: The 'reset' output is used to generate a system reset signal. It is logically inverted from the 'locked' signal, meaning it will be high (1) when 'locked' is low (0), which triggers a reset in unstable system conditions, and low (0) when 'locked' is high (1), reflecting a stable state with no need for a reset. This ensures that the system only resets during periods of instability."
