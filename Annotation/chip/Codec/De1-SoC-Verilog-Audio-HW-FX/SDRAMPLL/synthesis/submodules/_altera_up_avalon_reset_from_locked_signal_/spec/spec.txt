Module name: altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal. Module specification: The `altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal` module is designed to generate a reset signal based on an input signal named `locked`. This module features a single input port, `locked`, which indicates the stability of the systemâ€”with a high level meaning stable and a low level meaning unstable. The sole output port, `reset`, inversely reflects the `locked` signal so that a reset occurs during system instability. There are no internal signals used in this module, as the output is directly derived through a logical NOT operation performed on the `locked` input. The essential operation within the module is the assignment operation where `reset` is assigned the negation of `locked`. This concise design efficiently handles the generation of a system reset signal in response to changes in system stability.
