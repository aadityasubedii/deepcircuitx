Module name: SDRAMPLL_sys_sdram_pll_0. Module specification: The SDRAMPLL_sys_sdram_pll_0 is a Verilog module that generates appropriate clock signals for systems utilizing SDRAM. It takes a reference clock signal (`ref_clk_clk`) and a reset signal (`ref_reset_reset`) as inputs to ensure that the phase-locked loop (PLL) starts in a known state, critical during power-ups or similar reset conditions. The module outputs include `sys_clk_clk` and `sdram_clk_clk`, which are the system and SDRAM-specific clock signals respectively, and a managed reset signal `reset_source_reset` that ensures the system operates only under stable clock conditions. Internally, the module uses the `sys_pll_locked_export` signal to monitor the lock status of the PLL, ensuring the generated clocks are stable and synchronized with the input reference clock. This signal is used to control the `reset_source_reset` output through the `altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal` block, which manages the reset state based on the PLL's lock status. Overall, the SDRAMPLL_sys_sdram_pll_0 module ensures reliable clock generation and reset control for systems using SDRAM, incorporating a PLL and reset management in its functional architecture.
