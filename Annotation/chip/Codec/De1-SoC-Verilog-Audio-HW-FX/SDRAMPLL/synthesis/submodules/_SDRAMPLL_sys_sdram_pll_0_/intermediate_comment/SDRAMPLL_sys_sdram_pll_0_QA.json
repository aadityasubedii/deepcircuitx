It takes a reference clock signal and a reset signal as inputs. The module contains a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) component named 'sys_pll' which generates two output clocks: `sys_clk_clk` for the system and `sdram_clk_clk` specifically for the SDRAM. It also monitors the lock status of the PLL through 'sys_pll_locked_export'. An additional component, `altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal`, uses this lock status to manage the reset signal `reset_source_reset`, ensuring stable operation post-PLL lock. Thus, the module facilitates reliable clock generation and reset control for systems utilizing SDRAM."

It ensures the SDRAM operates at the correct frequency.\n- `reset_source_reset`: This output is a managed reset signal derived from the lock status of the PLL.
