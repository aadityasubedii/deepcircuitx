    "spec": "Module name: SDRAMPLL. Module specification: The SDRAMPLL is a specialized Verilog module designed primarily for managing and generating synchronized clock signals required for SDRAM and system operations. It leverages a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to derive these clock signals from a reference clock provided at the input port `ref_clk_clk`. This reference clock serves as the primary timing reference. The module also accepts a reset signal through the `ref_reset_reset` input port, used to reset the module's internal state to ensure reliable initialization and operation. The output ports include `sys_clk_clk` for the system clock, `sdram_clk_clk` for the SDRAM clock, and `reset_source_reset` for outputting a reset signal possibly used for other subsystems. Internally, although not visible in the instantiation snippet, the module is expected to contain mechanisms like feedback loops and state machines to handle the clock signal generation and synchronization accurately. The code snippet provided is an instantiation of the module, connecting it to system-specific signals which are defined elsewhere in the larger design, indicating the modular and reusable nature of the SDRAMPLL design in various system contexts.",

It provides the primary timing reference for the PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) within the SDRAMPLL module. The system and SDRAM clocks generated by the module are typically synchronized to this reference clock.\n- **ref_reset_reset**: This is the reference reset input port.

The PLL generates this clock, which is derived from the reference clock, and it is used to drive the timing of the systemic operations that are in synchronization with the SDRAM.\n- **sdram_clk_clk**: This is the SDRAM clock output port. It specifically provides the clock for SDRAM operations, ensuring that memory access and data operations are correctly timed in relation to the rest of the system.\n- **reset_source_reset**: This port outputs a reset signal, which might be used to reset associated subsystems or modules in conjunction with or separately from the reference reset signal. This helps in ensuring that all parts of the system related to SDRAM operations can be coordinated and reset together if needed."
