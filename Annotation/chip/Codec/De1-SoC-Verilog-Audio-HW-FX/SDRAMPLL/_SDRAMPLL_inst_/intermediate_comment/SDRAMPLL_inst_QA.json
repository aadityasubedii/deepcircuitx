It provides the primary timing reference for the PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) within the SDRAMPLL module. The system and SDRAM clocks generated by the module are typically synchronized to this reference clock.\n- **ref_reset_reset**: This is the reference reset input port. It is used to reset the internal state of the PLL and other related components in the module. A reset is essential to ensure that the system begins in a known state, which is crucial for reliable operation.\n\nOutput ports:\n- sys_clk_clk\n- sdram_clk_clk\n- reset_source_reset\n\nExplanation:\n- **sys_clk_clk**: This is the system clock output port. The PLL generates this clock, which is derived from the reference clock, and it is used to drive the timing of the systemic operations that are in synchronization with the SDRAM.\n- **sdram_clk_clk**: This is the SDRAM clock output port. It specifically provides the clock for SDRAM operations, ensuring that memory access and data operations are correctly timed in relation to the rest of the system.\n- **reset_source_reset**: This port outputs a reset signal, which might be used to reset associated subsystems or modules in conjunction with or separately from the reference reset signal. This helps in ensuring that all parts of the system related to SDRAM operations can be coordinated and reset together if needed."
