Module-level comment: The SDRAMPLL module generates essential clocks for SDRAM and system operation from a reference clock. It inputs a reference clock (`ref_clk_clk`) and a reset signal (`ref_reset_reset`), producing a system-wide clock, an SDRAM-specific clock, and a synchronized reset output. The module likely uses an internal PLL for frequency synthesis, not detailed in this snippet, ensuring outputs are suitably synchronized and stable for reliable system and memory operation.
