It takes a reference clock input and a reset input, then outputs a system clock, an SDRAM-specific clock, and a reset output. Although the inner workings are not shown, typically such a module might include PLL (Phase Locked Loop) components to multiply the input clock frequency to derive the system and SDRAM clocks, ensuring they are synchronized for reliable operation of SDRAM memory operations."

Typically, internal signals within a module such as register declarations, wires, or other local signal constructs would be used to handle intermediate operations, state storage, or signal manipulations. However, since there's no such detailing in this code snippet, it implies that either this is a high-level abstract representation or the actual internal workings like phase-locked loop (PLL) configurations, frequency dividers, or any synchronization mechanisms are encapsulated in components not shown in the extracted segment. For detailed understanding, further examination of the complete module definition might be needed, including any instantiated submodules or implemented logic circuits."
