    "spec": "Module name: SDRAMPLL. \n\nModule specification: The SDRAMPLL module is primarily designed for clock management essential in SDRAM operations. It utilizes an input reference clock (`ref_clk_clk`) to generate necessary system clocks. There is also an input reset (`ref_reset_reset`) serving the purpose of reinitializing or resetting the module's state under specific conditions such as system startup or faults. The module outputs three signals: a system clock (`sys_clk_clk`) for general system operations, an SDRAM-specific clock (`sdram_clk_clk`) tailored for SDRAM component synchronization, and a reset output (`reset_source_reset`) synchronized with the system clock to facilitate coordinated resets across the system. This module does not explicitly define internal signals within this code snippet, suggesting the use of externally defined logic or submodules for detailed operations like frequency multiplication or phase alignment, typically done through a PLL. The module is structured straightforwardly with input and output declarations, hinting at encapsulated complexities not exposed in the given code snippet, potentially including intricate operations like phase locking and frequency management internally or in associated submodules.",
