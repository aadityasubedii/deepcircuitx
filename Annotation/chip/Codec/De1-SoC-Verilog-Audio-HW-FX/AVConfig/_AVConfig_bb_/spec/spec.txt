Module name: AVConfig. Module specification: The `AVConfig` module is designed for configuring audio/video hardware through an I2C interface, synchronizing with external devices using a mem-mapped I/O. It handles read and write operations to device registers specified by a 2-bit `address`. The inputs include `address`, `byteenable` for managing byte-specific data operations, `read` and `write` for initiating respective operations, `writedata` for data to be written, a `clk` for operation synchronization, and a `reset` to set initial or clear states. Outputs are `readdata` for the data read from the specified address, `waitrequest` indicating the unavailability for further operations, `I2C_SDAT` for bidirectional I/O data transactions in I2C communications, and `I2C_SCLK` as the clock output for I2C communication timing. Internally, although specific signals are not detailed in the snippet provided, they would typically manage data transfer logic, intermediate storage, and state handling necessary for the I2C and mem-mapped operations. The code defines only the interface, as it lacks implementation blocks, suggesting that the functional details occur within submodules or the main implementation not provided in the snippet.
