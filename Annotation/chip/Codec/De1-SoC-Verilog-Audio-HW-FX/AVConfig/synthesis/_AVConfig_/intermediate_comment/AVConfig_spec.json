    "spec": "Module name: AVConfig. Module specification: The AVConfig module is designed to facilitate the configuration and control of audio and video settings through interactions with an I2C interface. This module operates as a top-level or wrapper module, primarily interfacing with the internal submodule `audio_and_video_config_0`. It utilizes the following input ports: `address` (a 2-bit wire identifying the target register for read or write operations), `byteenable` (a 4-bit wire detailing byte-level access control), `read` (a control signal for initiating read operations), `write` (a control signal for initiating write operations), `writedata` (a 32-bit data for configuration settings), `clk` (the clock signal for timing), and `reset` (an active-high reset signal). The outputs include `readdata` (a 32-bit output of register values), `waitrequest` (a signal indicating operational delay), and `I2C_SCLK` (clock for the I2C interface), while `I2C_SDAT` serves as a bidirectional I2C data line. Internally, the module does not declare or utilize any additional signals, relying instead on its connectivity to the `audio_and_video_config_0` submodule, which directly handles these inputs and outputs, thus simplifying the architectural design. The entirety of the module's functionality is encapsulated within the single block that instantiates and maps these ports to the `audio_and_video_config_0` submodule, ensuring streamlined hardware interfacing for audio and video configuration tasks.",

It accepts control signals such as address, byteenable, read, and write actions, along with writedata for configurations. In response, it provides readdata and manages waitrequest signaling.
