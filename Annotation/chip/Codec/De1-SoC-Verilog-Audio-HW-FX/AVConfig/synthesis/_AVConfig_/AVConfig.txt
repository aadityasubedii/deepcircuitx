Module-level comment: The AVConfig module manages the configuration of audio and video settings via an I2C interface. It acts as a wrapper for the `audio_and_video_config_0` submodule, directly routing signals like address, byteenable, read, write, and writedata through to this internal block. These interactions are synchronized by a clock signal and can be reset via an active-high reset line. Output responses such as readdata and waitrequest, along with I2C lines SCLK and SDAT, are driven based on these configurations.
