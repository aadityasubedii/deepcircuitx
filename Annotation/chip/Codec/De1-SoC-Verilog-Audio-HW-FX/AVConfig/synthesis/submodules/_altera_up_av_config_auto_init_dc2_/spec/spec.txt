Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_dc2. 
Module specification: The 'altera_up_av_config_auto_init_dc2' is a digital logic Verilog module designed primarily to initialize configuration parameters for display or camera controllers, using a predefined set of data values based on an assessed address. The module receives a 5-bit input 'rom_address', which selectively points to various predefined configuration settings. Based on this address, the module outputs a 36-bit 'rom_data' signal formed with the aid of a 32-bit internal signal 'data'. The 'data' register assigns values using a case statement, which relies on the input address to load configuration data from numerous predefined constants, and subsequently formats this data by interspersing zeros after every 8 bits to generate 'rom_data'. This is essential for interfacing the correctly formatted data with other digital devices, and is particularly crucial during the initial device setup or reset sequences. The module keeps the configuration data logic confined within an always block that operates combinatorially (always @(*)), ensuring that updates to the output occur immediately after changes to the input address. This module serves as a critical component for managing the lower-level hardware configurations efficiently, with each input and output meticulously crafted to suit specific device interfacing requirements.
