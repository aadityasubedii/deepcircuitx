Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de1_soc.  
Module specification: The `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de1_soc` module is designed for initializing audio and video configurations on an FPGA, specifically tailored for the DE1-SoC development board. It incorporates an input port, `rom_address`, a 6-bit value used to access specific ROM addresses to fetch configuration data for audio or video settings. The module outputs configuration data through the `rom_data` port, a 27-bit wide output that represents the combined configuration settings for both audio and video, achieved by a bitwise OR operation between `audio_rom_data` and `video_rom_data`. Inside the module, `audio_rom_data` and `video_rom_data` are two critical 27-bit internal signals that carry distinct configuration data fetched from separate audio and video ROMs, managed by instantiated submodules `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_audio` and `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7180`, respectively. These submodules are parameterized with several configuration settings, such as audio line inputs, outputs, and various control paths, directly influencing the audio/video output settings. This structured setup allows precise control and initialization tailored for specific audio-visual functionalities on the FPGA platform.
