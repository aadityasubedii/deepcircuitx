Module-level comment: The module `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_lcm` initializes LCD display parameters using a lookup approach based on `rom_address`. It selects configuration based on this address and outputs through `rom_data`, which formats a 14-bit internal `data` register into a 16-bit output. The content setup uses a case statement inside an always block reacting to input changes, efficiently mapping addresses to specific LCD settings.
