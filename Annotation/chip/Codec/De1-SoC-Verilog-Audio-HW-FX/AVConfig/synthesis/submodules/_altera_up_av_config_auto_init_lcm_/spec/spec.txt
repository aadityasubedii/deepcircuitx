Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_lcm. Module specification: The altera_up_av_config_auto_init_lcm module is designed to automatically initialize configuration parameters for an LCD display. It utilizes a 5-bit input port `rom_address` to select a specific parameter from a lookup table; each address points to a unique LCD setting such as input format, power settings, or gamma correction levels. The corresponding configuration data is output through a 16-bit output port `rom_data`, which arranges its 14 bits of internal data signal and pads additional bits for formatting. The internal 14-bit register named `data` temporarily holds the necessary configuration values determined by the `rom_address`. The Verilog code involves an `always` block driven by changes in `rom_address`, which uses a `case` statement to assign values to `data` based on the current address. Each case within the statement corresponds to a different LCD configuration, set using predefined parameters. The `assign` statement outside the `always` block formats the `data` by placing two zero bits between the upper and lower 8 bits of `data` to form the final 16-bit `rom_data` output. This module is essential for setting up specific LCD parameters dynamically based on input address values, making it suitable for LCD initialization and configuration tasks in hardware designs involving displays.
