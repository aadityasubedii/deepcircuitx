It uses a lookup mechanism based on an input address (rom_address) to output corresponding configuration data (rom_data). Each address corresponds to a specific configuration parameter, which is defined using Verilog parameters with predefined values to control various aspects of the LCD such as input formats, power settings, display orientation and phases, starting positions, contrast, brightness, and gamma correction levels. The output is formatted into a 16-bit data where specific bits are filled according to the configuration values selected by the case statement using the address input."

The value of this address determines which specific configuration parameter value is retrieved and used to set up the LCD display parameters.\n\nOutput ports: rom_data. Explanation: This is a 16-bit output signal that contains the configuration data corresponding to the address specified by the input port 'rom_address'. This data is used to initialize various settings of the LCD display such as its input format, power settings, orientation and phase, etc. The output is structured such that the higher 8 bits and lower 8 bits are derived from a 14-bit internal register, forming the final 16-bit output with two bits set to zero in between."
