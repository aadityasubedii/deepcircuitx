    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_lcm. Module specification: The altera_up_av_config_auto_init_lcm module is designed to automatically initialize configuration parameters for an LCD display. It utilizes a 5-bit input port `rom_address` to select a specific parameter from a lookup table; each address points to a unique LCD setting such as input format, power settings, or gamma correction levels. The corresponding configuration data is output through a 16-bit output port `rom_data`, which arranges its 14 bits of internal data signal and pads additional bits for formatting. The internal 14-bit register named `data` temporarily holds the necessary configuration values determined by the `rom_address`. The Verilog code involves an `always` block driven by changes in `rom_address`, which uses a `case` statement to assign values to `data` based on the current address. Each case within the statement corresponds to a different LCD configuration, set using predefined parameters. The `assign` statement outside the `always` block formats the `data` by placing two zero bits between the upper and lower 8 bits of `data` to form the final 16-bit `rom_data` output. This module is essential for setting up specific LCD parameters dynamically based on input address values, making it suitable for LCD initialization and configuration tasks in hardware designs involving displays.\n",

It uses a lookup mechanism based on an input address (rom_address) to output corresponding configuration data (rom_data). Each address corresponds to a specific configuration parameter, which is defined using Verilog parameters with predefined values to control various aspects of the LCD such as input formats, power settings, display orientation and phases, starting positions, contrast, brightness, and gamma correction levels.
