    "module": "Module-level comment: The altera_up_av_config_auto_init module automatically initialises configuration settings for Altera devices by reading from ROM and managing data transfer sequences. It utilizes input control signals and internal logic to handle data output, address incrementing, and status flags for errors and completion. Operations are synchronized to the clock signal, with state machines updating outputs based on reset conditions, transfer completions, and acknowledgments."
