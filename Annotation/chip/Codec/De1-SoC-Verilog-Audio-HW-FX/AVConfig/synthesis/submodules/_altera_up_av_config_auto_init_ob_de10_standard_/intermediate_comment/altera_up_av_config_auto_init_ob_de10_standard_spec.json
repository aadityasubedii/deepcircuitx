It has one input port, `rom_address`, which is a 6-bit bus that determines the read address for retrieving configuration data from the ROMs. The module outputs on a single 27-bit port, `rom_data`, which merges the configuration settings from both audio and video ROMs using a bitwise OR operation. Internally, it utilizes two key signals, `audio_rom_data` and `video_rom_data`. Each is a 27-bit wire that carries configuration data from either audio or video ROM modules respectively. The module structure incorporates two submodules: `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_audio` and `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7180`, each responsible for handling specific ROM initialization for audio and video settings. These submodules are parameterized to handle various settings like line in/out levels, ADC/DAC paths, and power management peculiar to the audio setup. The final output, `rom_data`, ensures that the FPGA board's audiovisual peripherals are set up simultaneously according to predefined configurations encoded in the ROMs.",

It takes an address input, 'rom_address', and outputs a combined configuration data, 'rom_data', from both audio and video ROM configurations. The configurations for each peripheral are merged using a bitwise OR operation to form the final ROM data output.

It is designed to capture the output data from the audio ROM based on the address provided by the 'rom_address' input. The audio configuration parameters such as volume levels, audio path setups, power settings, and more for the audio section of the FPGA board are encoded onto this signal.\n- video_rom_data: This 27-bit wire delivers the configuration data for video settings from the video ROM submodule. Similar to 'audio_rom_data', it takes the 'rom_address' and outputs corresponding data that includes video-related settings like standard adjustments and any additional video peripheral initialization required. These settings are crucial for the proper setup and functionality of video components on the DE10-Standard FPGA board. \n\nTogether, these internal signals hold their individual peripheral configuration data which are then combined to generate the final output sent via the 'rom_data' port."
