Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de10_standard. 
Module specification: The `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de10_standard` module is designed for initializing audio and video settings on a DE10-Standard FPGA board by automatically loading configuration data from separate ROM modules for audio and video configurations. It has one input port, `rom_address`, which is a 6-bit bus that determines the read address for retrieving configuration data from the ROMs. The module outputs on a single 27-bit port, `rom_data`, which merges the configuration settings from both audio and video ROMs using a bitwise OR operation. Internally, it utilizes two key signals, `audio_rom_data` and `video_rom_data`. Each is a 27-bit wire that carries configuration data from either audio or video ROM modules respectively. The module structure incorporates two submodules: `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_audio` and `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7180`, each responsible for handling specific ROM initialization for audio and video settings. These submodules are parameterized to handle various settings like line in/out levels, ADC/DAC paths, and power management peculiar to the audio setup. The final output, `rom_data`, ensures that the FPGA board's audiovisual peripherals are set up simultaneously according to predefined configurations encoded in the ROMs.
