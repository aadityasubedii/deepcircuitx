It takes an address input, 'rom_address', and outputs a combined configuration data, 'rom_data', from both audio and video ROM configurations. The configurations for each peripheral are merged using a bitwise OR operation to form the final ROM data output. This setup ensures that both audio and video settings are simultaneously initialized based on their specified configuration parameters."

Explanation: This is a 27-bit output bus that carries the combined configuration data for both audio and video settings. The data from the audio and video ROMs are merged using a bitwise OR operation, resulting in a single output that consolidates all necessary configuration settings for the DE10-Standard FPGA board's audiovisual peripherals.

The audio configuration parameters such as volume levels, audio path setups, power settings, and more for the audio section of the FPGA board are encoded onto this signal.\n- video_rom_data: This 27-bit wire delivers the configuration data for video settings from the video ROM submodule. Similar to 'audio_rom_data', it takes the 'rom_address' and outputs corresponding data that includes video-related settings like standard adjustments and any additional video peripheral initialization required. These settings are crucial for the proper setup and functionality of video components on the DE10-Standard FPGA board. \n\nTogether, these internal signals hold their individual peripheral configuration data which are then combined to generate the final output sent via the 'rom_data' port."
