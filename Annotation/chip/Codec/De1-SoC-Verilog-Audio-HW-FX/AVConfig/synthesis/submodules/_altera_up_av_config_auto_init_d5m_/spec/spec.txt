Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_d5m.
Module specification: The `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_d5m` module is designed for initializing the configuration settings of a D5M camera by loading specific data into the camera's registers. This is determined by the input `rom_address`, a 5-bit selector that chooses configuration settings based on the needs from a ROM, and `exposure`, a 16-bit value used to adjust the cameraâ€™s exposure level dynamically. The output `rom_data` provides a 36-bit formatted camera configuration data that aligns with a communication protocol required for hardware interfacing, made up of 32 bits of configuration data with zeros interleaved every 8 bits. The module also uses an internal 32-bit register `data`, which temporarily holds the different configurations before mapping them to `rom_data`. The core of the module consists of a case statement controlled by `rom_address`, which assigns specific configurations to the `data` register depending on the ROM address value. The case block enables conditional loading of test patterns if `ENABLE_TEST_PATTERN` is defined, besides handling basic settings like resolution and binning based on predefined parameters such as `D5M_COLUMN_SIZE` and `D5M_ROW_SIZE`. This procedural approach provides a flexible yet predictable method for camera setup tailored to various operating conditions or requirements.
