Module-level comment: The `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_d5m` module initializes D5M camera configurations based on ROM address inputs, dynamically setting up the camera by selecting relevant configuration data. Configuration is loaded into a 32-bit register and formatted based on hardware protocols into a 36-bit output. The module includes a switch-case structure that manages exposures, test patterns, and basic settings, facilitating flexible configuration for various operational needs.
