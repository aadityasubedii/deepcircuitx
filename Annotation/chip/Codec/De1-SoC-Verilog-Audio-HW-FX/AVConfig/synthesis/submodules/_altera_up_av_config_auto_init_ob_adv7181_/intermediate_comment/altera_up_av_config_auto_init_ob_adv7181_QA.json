The configuration is handled through a ROM lookup table, where each address corresponds to a specific configuration command. Depending on the input address (`rom_address`), the configuration data (`data`) is set, and then formatted onto the `rom_data` output, which includes zero padding between bytes for a specific hardware interface protocol. This setup is likely used to initialize the video decoder with predefined settings for proper operation."

This address directly maps to a predefined set of configuration data that needs to be written to the ADV7181 video decoder chip to ensure proper initialization and operation.\n\nOutput ports: `[26:0] rom_data`.  \nExplanation: This output port provides the configuration data formatted for transmission. It outputs 27 bits of data which are derived from a combination of the 24-bit `data` register and additional zero padding added between each byte. This format is necessary to meet the protocol requirements of the hardware interface to which the ADV7181 chip is connected, ensuring that the data is correctly interpreted by the receiving hardware."
