Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7181. 
Module specification: The module 'altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7181' is designed primarily to initialize the ADV7181 video decoder chip by configuring it using a predefined ROM lookup table based on the input address provided. It receives a 6-bit input port named 'rom_address', which selects specific configuration settings from the internal ROM table, corresponding to particular modes and functionalities required for the ADV7181 chip. The module outputs a 27-bit data signal through the output port 'rom_data', which is a composite of the selected 24-bit configuration data with additional zero padding between bytes to meet interface protocol requirements. Internally, a 24-bit register 'data' temporarily stores the configuration data fetched based on 'rom_address'. This data is then formatted and output through 'rom_data' using bitwise operations within the 'assign' statement. A comprehensive 'always' block contains a 'case' statement that maps each 'rom_address' input to its respective configuration command, which is then stored in the 'data' register. Overall, the module serves as a key component in the proper setup and operational tuning of the video decoder through simple, address-driven configuration commands.
