Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_audio. 

Module specification: The 'altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_audio' module is designed to initialize and configure onboard audio settings using a lookup table method built into read-only memory (ROM). The functionality revolves around using a 6-bit input port named `rom_address`, which selects and maps to predefined audio configuration parameters. Corresponding to each address, the module outputs a 27-bit data (`rom_data`) containing the specific configuration data formatted suitably for audio settings. Internally, this module uses a 24-bit register, `data`, which is crucial in assembling the configuration data based on `rom_address`. This occurs in a combinational logic block where depending on the input address, `data` is assigned specific values from constants prefixed with 'AUD_', representing different audio settings like line-in, line-out, ADC/DAC paths, and more. The `rom_data` output is then constructed by interspersing the `data` bits with zeros for alignment, using combinational logic directly wired to the output. The code is clearly divided into input/output declarations, parameter definitions representing configuration constants, internal register declarations, and logically categorized procedural blocks for handling address-based data manipulation and output formatting. This structured approach enhances maintainability and readability.
