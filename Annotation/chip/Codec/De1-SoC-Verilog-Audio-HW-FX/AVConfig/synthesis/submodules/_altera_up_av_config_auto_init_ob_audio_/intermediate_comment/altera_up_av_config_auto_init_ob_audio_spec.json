    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_audio. \n\nModule specification: The 'altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_audio' module is designed to initialize and configure onboard audio settings using a lookup table method built into read-only memory (ROM). The functionality revolves around using a 6-bit input port named `rom_address`, which selects and maps to predefined audio configuration parameters. Corresponding to each address, the module outputs a 27-bit data (`rom_data`) containing the specific configuration data formatted suitably for audio settings. Internally, this module uses a 24-bit register, `data`, which is crucial in assembling the configuration data based on `rom_address`. This occurs in a combinational logic block where depending on the input address, `data` is assigned specific values from constants prefixed with 'AUD_', representing different audio settings like line-in, line-out, ADC/DAC paths, and more. The `rom_data` output is then constructed by interspersing the `data` bits with zeros for alignment, using combinational logic directly wired to the output. The code is clearly divided into input/output declarations, parameter definitions representing configuration constants, internal register declarations, and logically categorized procedural blocks for handling address-based data manipulation and output formatting. This structured approach enhances maintainability and readability.",

It is designed to map a given ROM address to specific audio settings data. The output, `rom_data`, is contingent on the input `rom_address`. Based on different addresses between 0 to 9, it assigns predefined values to parameters such as left/right line in, left/right line out, ADC path, DAC path, and other audio-related settings, likely for an FPGA-based audio application.
