Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7180. 
Module specification: The 'altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7180' module is designed to configure an ADV7180 video decoder using ROM-based address and data mapping. The module takes a 6-bit wide input port `rom_address` which specifies the address for obtaining configuration data. According to the `rom_address`, a specific configuration setting from the defined parameters is selected via a switch-case statement, and respective configuration data (24 bits) for the video and audio settings like brightness, hue, and control parameters are set. This data is held in the internal signal 'data', a 24-bit register, which temporarily stores the formatted configuration data combined with a constant value before forwarding. The output port `rom_data` is a 27-bit wide output that delivers the formatted configuration data related to the address specified by `rom_address`. The module primarily comprises parameter definitions listing various configuration settings, input and output port definitions, an internal register for handling data, a combinational block for selecting the data based on `rom_address`, and a final `assign` statement that formats and outputs the data to `rom_data`. This systematic structure ensures tailored initialization for the ADV7180 video decoder to align with expected video processing requirements.
