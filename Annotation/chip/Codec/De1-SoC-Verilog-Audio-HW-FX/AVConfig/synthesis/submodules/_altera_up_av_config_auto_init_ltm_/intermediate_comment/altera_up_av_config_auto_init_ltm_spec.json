    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ltm.  \nModule specification: The \"altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ltm\" module is a Verilog hardware design primarily used for configuring audio/video components by mapping specific input addresses to pre-defined configuration data outputs. It utilizes an input port named 'rom_address', which is a 5-bit selector determining the choice of configuration data set. The 24-bit output port 'rom_data' provides the corresponding data based on the input 'rom_address'. Internally, the module uses a 24-bit register, 'data', to temporarily hold the configuration values fetched based on the input address. The module processes input through an always block that uses a case statement to select the output value for 'data' corresponding to 'rom_address'. Finally, output 'rom_data' is constructed by selectively reformatting 'data' based on parts of its content. This module ensures each component in an audio/video system receives correct and dynamic configuration parameters required for its operation without manual intervention.\n",

It maps an input address (rom_address) to a corresponding 24-bit data value (rom_data), designed specifically for audio/video configuration. The data output changes based on the input address, as specified in a defined set of case statements within an always block.

The data changes based on the address input. The usage of this output is to feed configuration settings into other parts of the system, ensuring that each component receives the correct variables or parameters for operation based on the supplied address.
