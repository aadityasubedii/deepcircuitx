Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ltm.  
Module specification: The "altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ltm" module is a Verilog hardware design primarily used for configuring audio/video components by mapping specific input addresses to pre-defined configuration data outputs. It utilizes an input port named 'rom_address', which is a 5-bit selector determining the choice of configuration data set. The 24-bit output port 'rom_data' provides the corresponding data based on the input 'rom_address'. Internally, the module uses a 24-bit register, 'data', to temporarily hold the configuration values fetched based on the input address. The module processes input through an always block that uses a case statement to select the output value for 'data' corresponding to 'rom_address'. Finally, output 'rom_data' is constructed by selectively reformatting 'data' based on parts of its content. This module ensures each component in an audio/video system receives correct and dynamic configuration parameters required for its operation without manual intervention.
