It utilizes a counter ('clk_counter') to divide the input clock frequency, creating a slower output clock. The module also provides additional outputs indicating the rising edge, falling edge, middle of the high level, and middle of the low level of the new clock signal, helping in precise clock signal analysis and control. This functionality is vital in applications requiring specific timing adjustments or synchronization controls in digital circuits."

When high, it resets the internal counters and output signals to their initial states.\n- `enable_clk`: This signal enables the clock generation process. If high, the slow clock generator is active and the new clock generation as well as other signal processing continues based on the `clk` input.\n\nOutput ports: new_clk, rising_edge, falling_edge, middle_of_high_level, middle_of_low_level.\nExplanation:\n- `new_clk`: This is the primary output of the module, representing the slow clock generated by dividing the input clock frequency. The rate of this clock is determined by the length and value of the internal counter.\n- `rising_edge`: This output signal indicates the rising edge of the new clock (`new_clk`). It is used to detect transitions from low to high in the generated slow clock.\n- `falling_edge`: This output signal indicates the falling edge of the new clock (`new_clk`). It detects transitions from high to low, important for timing and control applications.\n- `middle_of_high_level`: This signal is high when the counter is at the middle of a high level period for the new clock. It's useful for precise timing adjustments during the high phase of the slow clock.\n- `middle_of_low_level`: Similarly, this output is high when the counter is in the middle of a low level period of the slow clock. It provides a control point midway through the low phase."

Its purpose is to divide the frequency of the input clock to generate the slower `new_clk`. The register's width is set by the parameter `CB`, which determines how many bits the counter uses, ultimately controlling the division ratio and properties of the generated clock and associated signals (edges and middle points of high and low levels). The most significant bit (`clk_counter[CB]`) is particularly significant because it toggles less frequently than the lower bits, effectively providing the new clock signal and the bases for edge and middle-point detections."
