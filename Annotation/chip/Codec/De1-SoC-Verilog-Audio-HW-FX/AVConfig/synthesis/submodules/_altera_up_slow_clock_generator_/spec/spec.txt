Module name: altera_up_slow_clock_generator. Module specification: The altera_up_slow_clock_generator is a Verilog module designed to generate a slower clock signal ('new_clk') derived from an input clock ('clk'). By utilizing the input ports 'clk' (the primary clock input), 'reset' (used to reset the module's states and outputs), and 'enable_clk' (enables the clock generation process), the module operates efficiently for applications requiring particular timing controls. The output ports include 'new_clk' (the generated slower clock), 'rising_edge' (indicates the rising edge of 'new_clk'), 'falling_edge' (indicates the falling edge of 'new_clk'), 'middle_of_high_level' (high when 'new_clk' is in the middle of a high period), and 'middle_of_low_level' (high when 'new_clk' is in the middle of a low period). An internal signal, 'clk_counter', is a counter that increments on each positive edge of 'clk' when 'enable_clk' is active; its purpose is to divide the frequency of 'clk' to generate 'new_clk'. The code blocks within the module manage the incrementation of 'clk_counter', generation and toggling of 'new_clk', detection of rising and falling edges of 'new_clk', and identifying the middle of high and low periods of 'new_clk'. Each block of code operates on the positive clock edge, implementing particular functionalities based on the status of 'reset' and 'enable_clk', accurately reflecting the design's necessity for precision in timing adjustments and synchronization controls in digital circuits.
