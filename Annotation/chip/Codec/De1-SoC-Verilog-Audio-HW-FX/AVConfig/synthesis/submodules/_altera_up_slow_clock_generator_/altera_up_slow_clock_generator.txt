Module-level comment: The altera_up_slow_clock_generator module generates a slower clock ('new_clk') from an input clock ('clk'), controlled by 'enable_clk'. It features output indicators for the rising and falling edges, and the middle points of high and low clock levels. Internally, it uses a register counter ('clk_counter') to divide the input clock frequency, toggling 'new_clk' and detecting specific clock phases, facilitating precise timing control in digital circuits.
