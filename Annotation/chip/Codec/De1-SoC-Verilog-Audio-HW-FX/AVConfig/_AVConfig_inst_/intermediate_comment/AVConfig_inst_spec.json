    "spec": "Module name: AVConfig. \nModule specification: The 'AVConfig' module is designed for configuring and managing Audio/Video (AV) settings, likely through I2C communication. It utilizes synchronous operation, governed by a clock (`clk`) and a reset (`reset`) signal. Input ports include `address`, used to specify the target address for data operations; `byteenable`, for enabling specific byte lanes during a transfer; `read` and `write`, which trigger data fetching and sending operations, respectively; `writedata`, holding the data to be written; along with `clk` and `reset`. The output ports comprise `readdata`, which presents the fetched data; `waitrequest`, signaling a need to delay the operation possibly due to data not being ready or other operational delays; and I2C-specific ports `I2C_SDAT` (data line) and `I2C_SCLK` (clock line), facilitating I2C protocol communication. Internal signals, likely including `internal_address`, `internal_data`, `control_logic`, and `i2c_control_signals`, would handle modified address computations, store temporary data, manage operation flows and sequence, and control I2C communication specifics like start/stop conditions and byte transfers, respectively. The code snippet primarily documents the instantiation and connection of these ports to other external signals or components, suggesting focus on interfacing externally rather than detailing internal logic configurations or processing blocks within the module.\n",

This module has ports for standard read and write operations, data transfer, and control signaling through byte enable, address selection, and wait request signals. The presence of clock (`clk`) and reset signals indicates it operates synchronously. Additionally, specific ports for I2C data (`I2C_SDAT`) and clock (`I2C_SCLK`) lines suggest it manages or configures AV settings through I2C communication with other devices."
