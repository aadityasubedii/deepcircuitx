This module has ports for standard read and write operations, data transfer, and control signaling through byte enable, address selection, and wait request signals. The presence of clock (`clk`) and reset signals indicates it operates synchronously. Additionally, specific ports for I2C data (`I2C_SDAT`) and clock (`I2C_SCLK`) lines suggest it manages or configures AV settings through I2C communication with other devices."
