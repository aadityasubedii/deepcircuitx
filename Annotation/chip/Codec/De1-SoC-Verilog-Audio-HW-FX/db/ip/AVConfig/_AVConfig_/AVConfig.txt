Module-level comment: The AVConfig module interfaces with audio and video settings using I2C protocol. It supports read and write operations through its ports, addressing configurations with a 2-bit address, and controls data integrity with byte enable signals. Internally, it maps these signals directly to an instantiated sub-module `audio_and_video_config_0`, facilitating efficient data transactions and synchronization without additional internal signals.
