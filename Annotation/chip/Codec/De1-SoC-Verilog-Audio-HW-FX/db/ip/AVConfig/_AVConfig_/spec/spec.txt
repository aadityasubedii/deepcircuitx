Module name: AVConfig. Module specification: The AVConfig module is designed for interfacing with an audio and video configuration component, managing input/output communications through signals like read/write operations, byte enablement, and clock synchronization using the I2C communication protocol. The module has several input ports including a 2-bit address for selecting configuration settings, a 4-bit byteenable for specifying active bytes during write operations, read and write enable signals, a 32-bit writedata for input data, a clock signal for synchronization, a reset signal, and a bidirectional I2C_SDAT for data communication. Output ports include a 32-bit readdata for outputting data, a waitrequest for flow control, and an I2C_SCLK for I2C clock signaling. Internally, the AVConfig module contains no additional signals but directly instantiates a sub-module named `audio_and_video_config_0`, which it fully wires to the input and output ports. The primary role of the AVConfig module is to act as a wrapper that facilitates communication and signal mapping between the external interfaces and the internal `audio_and_video_config_0` sub-module, ensuring efficient data transaction and configuration operations for audio and video settings.
