It connects these signals to an internal block or module called \"audio_and_video_config_0\", facilitating operations such as data transactions and control signal handling for configuring audio and video settings. The use of I2C protocol signals (I2C_SDAT and I2C_SCLK) indicates that this module likely communicates with external audio or video devices using the I2C communication protocol."
