Module name: altera_up_slow_clock_generator. 
Module specification: The "altera_up_slow_clock_generator" module is designed to generate a slower clock signal (`new_clk`) from a faster input clock signal (`clk`), along with signals that identify the rising and falling edges, and the middle points of the high and low levels of this slower clock. The inputs include `clk`, the primary clock signal; `reset`, which initializes internal states and signals; and `enable_clk`, which enables the counting process necessary for the outputs. The outputs are `new_clk`, a slower clock signal derived from the most significant bit of an internal counter (`clk_counter`); `rising_edge` and `falling_edge`, which detect transitions of `new_clk`; and `middle_of_high_level` and `middle_of_low_level`, indicating the midpoint of high and low states, respectively. Internally, `clk_counter` is a register that increments on each positive edge of `clk` when counting is enabled and is set to zero on reset. The operation of this module is divided into several sequential blocks: one block manages the counting of `clk_counter`; separate blocks handle the generation and management of `new_clk`, `rising_edge`, `falling_edge`, `middle_of_high_level`, and `middle_of_low_level`. Each block is triggered by the positive edge of `clk`, and their behavior is contingent upon the state of the `reset` and `enable_clk` signals, which control whether to reset or update the output based on the new value of `clk_counter`. This structured approach ensures that each aspect of the slower clock and its characteristics are accurately generated and managed.
