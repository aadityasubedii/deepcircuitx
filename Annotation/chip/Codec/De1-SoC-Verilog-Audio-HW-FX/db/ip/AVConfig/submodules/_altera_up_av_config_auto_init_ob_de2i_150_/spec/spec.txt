Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de2i_150. Module specification: The altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de2i_150 module is designed for initializing and configuring audio and video settings specifically for the DE2i-150 FPGA board by Altera. It takes a 6-bit input port `rom_address`, which specifies the ROM memory address from where audio and video configuration data is fetched. This module outputs a 27-bit `rom_data` which is the combined configuration data for audio and video settings, derived from two sub-modules. Inside, the module uses two internal signals: `audio_rom_data` and `video_rom_data`, each being 27-bit wide, responsible for holding configuration data fetched from the audio and video configuration sub-modules, respectively. The main body of the code is composed of two significant blocks: `Auto_Init_Audio_ROM` and `Auto_Init_Video_ROM`, each configured with specific parameters to initialize the audio and video settings. The `rom_data` output is produced by performing a logical OR operation between `audio_rom_data` and `video_rom_data`, ensuring that the module outputs comprehensive configuration data for both audio and video peripherals.
