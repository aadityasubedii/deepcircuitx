Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_d5m. 
Module specification: The 'altera_up_av_config_auto_init_d5m' is a Verilog module designed primarily for camera configuration on an Altera FPGA platform interfacing with a D5M camera. It features input ports: `rom_address`, a 5-bit index selecting specific camera configuration settings, and `exposure`, a 16-bit value specifying the camera's exposure settings. The module outputs the configuration data through the `rom_data` port, a 36-bit output that transmits configuration commands to the camera. Internally, the module employs a `data` register (32-bit) to temporarily hold the assembled configuration settings based on current `rom_address`. This assembled configuration is formatted and expanded into 36-bit via an `assign` statement to match the output specifications required by the camera. The primary operations are defined within an `always` block using a `case` statement that maps `rom_address` values to corresponding configuration commands which include setting exposure, binning, and size options. Conditional compilation is used to optionally include test pattern configuration based on the `ENABLE_TEST_PATTERN` directive. The module provides an extensive and flexible method to dynamically adjust and set parameters of a D5M camera efficiently.
