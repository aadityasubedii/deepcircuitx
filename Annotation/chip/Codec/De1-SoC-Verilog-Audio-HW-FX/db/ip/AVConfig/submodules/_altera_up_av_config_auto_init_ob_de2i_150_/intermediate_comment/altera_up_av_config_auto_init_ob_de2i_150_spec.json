Module specification: The altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de2i_150 module is designed for initializing and configuring audio and video settings specifically for the DE2i-150 FPGA board by Altera. It takes a 6-bit input port `rom_address`, which specifies the ROM memory address from where audio and video configuration data is fetched. This module outputs a 27-bit `rom_data` which is the combined configuration data for audio and video settings, derived from two sub-modules. Inside, the module uses two internal signals: `audio_rom_data` and `video_rom_data`, each being 27-bit wide, responsible for holding configuration data fetched from the audio and video configuration sub-modules, respectively. The main body of the code is composed of two significant blocks: `Auto_Init_Audio_ROM` and `Auto_Init_Video_ROM`, each configured with specific parameters to initialize the audio and video settings. The `rom_data` output is produced by performing a logical OR operation between `audio_rom_data` and `video_rom_data`, ensuring that the module outputs comprehensive configuration data for both audio and video peripherals.",

It takes a ROM address as input and outputs combined configuration data sourced from two sub-modules, one for audio and one for video. This combined data is likely used to set up and control audiovisual peripherals. The module configures various properties of audio such as line inputs, line outputs, ADC paths, DAC paths, power settings, data format, sampling control, and active state settings based on predefined parameters. Each sub-module, for audio and video, is initialized with specific configurations passed via parameters and returns configuration data which is then combined in the top module."

The signal holds configuration data specific to audio settings which is fetched from ROM based on the provided address (rom_address).\n- **video_rom_data**: This is a 27-bit signal used as the data output from the video configuration sub-module (`altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7180`). Similar to audio_rom_data, this signal contains configuration data related to video settings, obtained from ROM using the same input address. \n\nBoth these signals are integral to obtaining the respective configuration data from their modules and contribute directly to the overall output of the module by combining their information to form the `rom_data` output through a logical OR operation.
