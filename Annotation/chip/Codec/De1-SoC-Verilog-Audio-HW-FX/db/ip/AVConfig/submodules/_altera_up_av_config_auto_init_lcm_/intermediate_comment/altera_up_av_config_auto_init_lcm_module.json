    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'altera_up_av_config_auto_init_lcm' Verilog module initializes LCM display settings based on a 5-bit input 'rom_address'. It maps this address to specific LCM configurations using a 14-bit register 'data', which is processed to form a 16-bit 'rom_data' output. The mapping and data processing are implemented via a case statement controlling the data assignment and an assignment statement forming the final output. This design effectively translates address inputs into tailored LCM settings."
