Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de10_standard. 
Module specification: The `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de10_standard` module is engineered for initialization of audio and video configurations on the DE10-standard board. It systematically combines data fetched from separate ROMs designated for audio (Auto_Init_Audio_ROM) and video (Auto_Init_Video_ROM) settings. The module employs a 6-bit input port `rom_address`, which functions to specify the address for fetching data from both the audio and video ROM modules. The output is a 27-bit combined configuration data `rom_data`, which is produced by a bitwise OR operation of the audio and video ROM data outputs. Internally, the module utilizes two 27-bit signals, `audio_rom_data` and `video_rom_data`, to hold the fetched configuration data from the audio and video ROM modules, respectively. The module structure includes two instantiated blocks, `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_audio` and `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7180`, each fetching initialization settings according to the specified `rom_address` and contributing parameters for audio and video configurations. This design ensures that all necessary audio and video settings are initialized correctly and combined into a single output for further configurations on the board.
