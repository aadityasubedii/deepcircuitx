Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ltm. 

Module specification: The `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ltm` module is designed for loading and outputting configuration data based on a specified address input, potentially for initializing an Altera FPGA or similar device. It takes a 5-bit `rom_address` as input, which acts as an address selector reaching into a predefined lookup table to obtain specific configuration settings. The module outputs a 24-bit `rom_data`, which arranges and formats the data retrieved from the internal `data` register where these configuration values are preliminarily stored. The `data` register itself is 24-bits wide and temporarily holds the configuration data corresponding to the `rom_address`. The primary functionality of the module is defined within an always block and a case statement, where `data` is set to various hardcoded values depending on the `rom_address`. The output `rom_data` is then formed by reorganizing specific bits of this `data` register and adding zero-padding for proper formatting, as specified by the assign statement. This setup suggests a straightforward but critical utility in configuring hardware settings through input address driven data selection and output reformatting.
