    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'altera_up_av_config_auto_init' module initializes device configurations using ROM data, synchronized by a clock. It handles data transfer and error management through input signals like 'reset', 'ack', and 'transfer_complete', and internal sequencing facilitated by 'toggle_next_transfer'. Outputs indicate data status, error presence, and initialization completion, ensuring robust operation during sequential ROM data fetching and setup."
