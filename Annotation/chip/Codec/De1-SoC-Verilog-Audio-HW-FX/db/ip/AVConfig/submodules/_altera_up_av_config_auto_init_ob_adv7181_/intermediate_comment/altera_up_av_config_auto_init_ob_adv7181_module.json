    "module": "Module-level comment: The module `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7181` initializes configurations for an ADV7181 chip using ROM data. It accepts a 6-bit 'rom_address' to fetch pre-defined 24-bit configuration settings from internal logic. These settings are formatted into a 27-bit 'rom_data' output by interleaving zeros between 8-bit data segments, aligning with the interface requirements of the ADV7181 chip."
