Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_dc2. 

Module specification: The 'altera_up_av_config_auto_init_dc2' is a Verilog module aimed at configuring a device, likely a camera sensor, by providing it with initialization data. This module takes a 5-bit address input through the 'rom_address' port which selects specific configuration settings from a predefined list. Based on the input address, the module outputs a 36-bit formatted data through the 'rom_data' output port. The data is formatted such that each byte is interleaved with a zero bit which might be necessary for compliance with a particular transmission protocol. Internally, the module uses a 32-bit register 'data' to temporarily store the configuration settings corresponding to the input address. This data is manipulated and formatted according to the address value using a case statement within the always block. Each case of the block aligns certain configuration values like shutter width, gain settings, and others to the 'data' register based on the 'rom_address' input. The assignment outside the always block manipulates 'data' to fit the 'rom_data' output format. Thus, this module is essential for interfacing with and configuring specific camera sensor settings dynamically, guided solely by an address-driven method.
