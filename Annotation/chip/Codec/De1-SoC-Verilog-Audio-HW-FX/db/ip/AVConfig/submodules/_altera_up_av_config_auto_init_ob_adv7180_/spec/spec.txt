Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7180. Module specification: The altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7180 module is designed for FPGA-based initialization of the ADV7180 video decoder, configuring various parameters through a ROM-based setup. It accepts a 6-bit input 'rom_address' specifying the memory address in a Read-Only Memory (ROM) containing configuration data. Based on this address, the module outputs a 27-bit 'rom_data', which holds the configuration values for the video decoder settings. Internally, a 24-bit register 'data' is utilized to store the output values formulated by the module according to the input address. This mapping is established in an always block which applies a case statement to assign values to 'data' based on 'rom_address', encoding settings for input control, video and output controls, among others. The different configuration values are prefixed by a constant 8-bit value (0x40) before outputting. The computed data is then formatted through an assign block that concatenates and zero-extends each byte of the 'data' to generate the required 27-bit output structure. This module ensures precise initialization of required parameters for the ADV7180 video decoder in varied FPGA projects, providing robust control over video data handling.
