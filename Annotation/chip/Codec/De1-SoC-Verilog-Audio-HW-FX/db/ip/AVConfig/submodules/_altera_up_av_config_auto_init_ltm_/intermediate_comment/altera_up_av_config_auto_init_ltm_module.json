    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ltm` module initializes configuration data for FPGA devices using a 5-bit address input (`rom_address`) to fetch specific settings from a lookup table. It outputs a 24-bit formatted data (`rom_data`), achieved through internal manipulation of loaded data and bit reorganization in the `data` register, driven by case statements within an always block for data assignment based on the input address."
