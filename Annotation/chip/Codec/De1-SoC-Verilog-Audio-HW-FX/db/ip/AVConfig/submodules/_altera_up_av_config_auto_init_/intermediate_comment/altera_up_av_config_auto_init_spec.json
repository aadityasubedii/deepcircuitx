    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init.  \nModule specification: The 'altera_up_av_config_auto_init' module is designed to manage the automatic initialization of configuration settings using data fetched sequentially from a ROM. It operates in a synchronous manner, controlled by a 'clk' (clock) signal. The input ports include 'clk' (providing the timing for all operations), 'reset' (initializing the module's state when asserted), 'clear_error' (resets the error indicator), 'ack' (used to set an error flag if a transfer error is encountered), 'transfer_complete' (signals the completion of data transfer), and 'rom_data' (raw configuration data from ROM). Output ports comprise 'data_out' (holding the current ROM data value), 'transfer_data' (indicating ongoing data transfer), 'rom_address' (pointing to the current ROM access address), 'auto_init_complete' (signaling the end of the initialization process), and 'auto_init_error' (indicating any errors during initialization). An internal signal 'toggle_next_transfer' (a logical AND of 'transfer_data' and 'transfer_complete') controls the sequence of data transfers, particularly the increment of ROM address. Various code blocks perform specific functions: one block handles the setup or reset of various outputs, another manages the 'data_out' and 'rom_address' progression, while other blocks determine the status of 'auto_init_complete' and 'auto_init_error', thereby ensuring smooth initialization and error handling.",

It operates synchronously with a clock signal (clk). Upon reset, it clears various output registers and sets specific values to indicate the state of initialization and error presence. The module uses control flags such as `transfer_complete`, `ack`, and `clear_error` to manage data transfers and handle errors during the initialization process. The core functionality includes reading data sequentially from ROM and managing output signals which indicate the progress and state of initialization, notably, signaling when the initialization process is complete or if an error occurred."

When asserted, it initializes the module's state, setting outputs to their initial conditions.\n- **clear_error**: Signal to clear the error flag (`auto_init_error`).

It's used to set the `auto_init_error`.\n- **transfer_complete**: Signal indicating that a data transfer is complete.

It is primarily used within sequencer logic to increment the `rom_address` and manage the sequence of accessing data from ROM. The signal is defined as a logical AND between `transfer_data` and `transfer_complete`, which means it only goes high when a transfer is ongoing and a transfer completion condition has been recognized.
