    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'altera_up_av_config_auto_init_dc2' module initializes camera sensor settings by mapping a 5-bit address input ('rom_address') to specific configuration data. It outputs this data as a 36-bit value ('rom_data') with each byte separated by a zero bit for protocol compliance. The configurations are stored in a 32-bit register ('data'), set by a case statement based on 'rom_address', and formatted for output accordingly. This design facilitates dynamic device configuration via simple address-driven lookup."
