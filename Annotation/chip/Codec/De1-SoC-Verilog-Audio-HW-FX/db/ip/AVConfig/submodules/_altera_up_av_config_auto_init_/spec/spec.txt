Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init.  
Module specification: The 'altera_up_av_config_auto_init' module is designed to manage the automatic initialization of configuration settings using data fetched sequentially from a ROM. It operates in a synchronous manner, controlled by a 'clk' (clock) signal. The input ports include 'clk' (providing the timing for all operations), 'reset' (initializing the module's state when asserted), 'clear_error' (resets the error indicator), 'ack' (used to set an error flag if a transfer error is encountered), 'transfer_complete' (signals the completion of data transfer), and 'rom_data' (raw configuration data from ROM). Output ports comprise 'data_out' (holding the current ROM data value), 'transfer_data' (indicating ongoing data transfer), 'rom_address' (pointing to the current ROM access address), 'auto_init_complete' (signaling the end of the initialization process), and 'auto_init_error' (indicating any errors during initialization). An internal signal 'toggle_next_transfer' (a logical AND of 'transfer_data' and 'transfer_complete') controls the sequence of data transfers, particularly the increment of ROM address. Various code blocks perform specific functions: one block handles the setup or reset of various outputs, another manages the 'data_out' and 'rom_address' progression, while other blocks determine the status of 'auto_init_complete' and 'auto_init_error', thereby ensuring smooth initialization and error handling.
