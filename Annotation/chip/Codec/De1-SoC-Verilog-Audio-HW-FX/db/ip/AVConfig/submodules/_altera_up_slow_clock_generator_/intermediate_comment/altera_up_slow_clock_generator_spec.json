    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_slow_clock_generator. \nModule specification: The \"altera_up_slow_clock_generator\" module is designed to generate a slower clock signal (`new_clk`) from a faster input clock signal (`clk`), along with signals that identify the rising and falling edges, and the middle points of the high and low levels of this slower clock. The inputs include `clk`, the primary clock signal; `reset`, which initializes internal states and signals; and `enable_clk`, which enables the counting process necessary for the outputs. The outputs are `new_clk`, a slower clock signal derived from the most significant bit of an internal counter (`clk_counter`); `rising_edge` and `falling_edge`, which detect transitions of `new_clk`; and `middle_of_high_level` and `middle_of_low_level`, indicating the midpoint of high and low states, respectively. Internally, `clk_counter` is a register that increments on each positive edge of `clk` when counting is enabled and is set to zero on reset. The operation of this module is divided into several sequential blocks: one block manages the counting of `clk_counter`; separate blocks handle the generation and management of `new_clk`, `rising_edge`, `falling_edge`, `middle_of_high_level`, and `middle_of_low_level`. Each block is triggered by the positive edge of `clk`, and their behavior is contingent upon the state of the `reset` and `enable_clk` signals, which control whether to reset or update the output based on the new value of `clk_counter`. This structured approach ensures that each aspect of the slower clock and its characteristics are accurately generated and managed.",

When high, it resets the internal counter and output signals to their initial states, ensuring the module can start or restart in a known condition.\n- `enable_clk`: This signal enables the counting operation that ultimately affects outputs.
