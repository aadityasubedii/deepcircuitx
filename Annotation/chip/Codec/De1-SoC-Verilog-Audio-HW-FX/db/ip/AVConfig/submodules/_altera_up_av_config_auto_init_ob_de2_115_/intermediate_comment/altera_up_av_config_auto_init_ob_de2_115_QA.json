It receives an address input, `rom_address`, and outputs configuration data, `rom_data`, as a combination (bitwise OR operation) of audio and video configuration data. Two embedded sub-modules, `Auto_Init_Audio_ROM` and `Auto_Init_Video_ROM`, generate audio and video configuration data respectively. These sub-modules are parameterized with specific settings such as line-in, line-out, ADC and DAC paths, and sample controls to manage how audio and video outputs are handled by the system hardware."
