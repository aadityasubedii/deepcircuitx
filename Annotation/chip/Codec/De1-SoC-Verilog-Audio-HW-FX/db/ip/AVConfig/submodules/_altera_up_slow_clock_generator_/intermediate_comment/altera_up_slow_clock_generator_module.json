    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"altera_up_slow_clock_generator\" module generates a slower clock signal (`new_clk`) from a faster input (`clk`) and tracks its rising and falling edges, and middle points of high and low states. It uses an internal counter (`clk_counter`) that increments with each `clk` pulse if enabled, controlling outputs like `new_clk`, `rising_edge`, `falling_edge`, `middle_of_high_level`, and `middle_of_low_level` based on the counter's bit states and operations triggered by `clk`. Resets are handled through the `reset` input."
