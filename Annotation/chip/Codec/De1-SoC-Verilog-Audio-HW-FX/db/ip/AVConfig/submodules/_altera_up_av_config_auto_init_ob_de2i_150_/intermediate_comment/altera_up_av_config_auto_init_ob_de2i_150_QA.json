It takes a ROM address as input and outputs combined configuration data sourced from two sub-modules, one for audio and one for video. This combined data is likely used to set up and control audiovisual peripherals. The module configures various properties of audio such as line inputs, line outputs, ADC paths, DAC paths, power settings, data format, sampling control, and active state settings based on predefined parameters. Each sub-module, for audio and video, is initialized with specific configurations passed via parameters and returns configuration data which is then combined in the top module."

The signal holds configuration data specific to audio settings which is fetched from ROM based on the provided address (rom_address).\n- **video_rom_data**: This is a 27-bit signal used as the data output from the video configuration sub-module (`altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7180`). Similar to audio_rom_data, this signal contains configuration data related to video settings, obtained from ROM using the same input address. \n\nBoth these signals are integral to obtaining the respective configuration data from their modules and contribute directly to the overall output of the module by combining their information to form the `rom_data` output through a logical OR operation.
