It takes a ROM address as input and outputs configuration data. The output is a combination (OR operation) of data from both an audio initialization ROM and a video initialization ROM, which are instantiated as 'Auto_Init_Audio_ROM' and 'Auto_Init_Video_ROM' respectively. The audio and video initialization parameters like line in, line out, ADC path, DAC path, power settings, data format, sample control, and active settings are defined and passed to these ROMs for processing."
