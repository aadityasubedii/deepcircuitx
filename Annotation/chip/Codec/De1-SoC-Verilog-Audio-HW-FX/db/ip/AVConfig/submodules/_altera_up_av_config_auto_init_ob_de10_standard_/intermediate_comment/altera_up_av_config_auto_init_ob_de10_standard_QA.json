The `rom_address` input specifies the address for fetching data from these ROMs. The data from the audio ROM and the video ROM are combined through a bitwise OR operation to produce the `rom_data` output. This setup implies that the module coordinates audio and video settings initialization by accessing and merging their respective configuration values."
