Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de2_115. Module specification: The module "altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de2_115" is designed to manage the initialization of audio and video settings on the DE2-115 hardware board using specific configurations. It has an input port `rom_address`, which is a 6-bit value that specifies a particular configuration setting or register address within the initialization sequence. This input is vital for selecting configuration data from the audio and video initialization sub-modules. The output port `rom_data` provides a 27-bit combined configuration data, resulting from a bitwise OR operation between the audio configuration data (`audio_rom_data`) and video configuration data (`video_rom_data`). Internal signals include `audio_rom_data` and `video_rom_data`, which store the output data from the `Auto_Init_Audio_ROM` and `Auto_Init_Video_ROM` sub-modules respectively. These sub-modules are parameterized with specific settings related to line-in, line-out, ADC, DAC paths, and sample controls. The module showcases a structured approach where the main module integrates configurations from these two sub-modules and outputs the merged result, ensuring proper initialization of audio and video components on the hardware.
