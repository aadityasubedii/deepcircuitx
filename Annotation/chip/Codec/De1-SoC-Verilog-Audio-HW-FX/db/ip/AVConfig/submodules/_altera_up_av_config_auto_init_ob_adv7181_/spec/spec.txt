Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7181. 

Module specification: The altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_adv7181 module is designed to initialize configuration settings for an ADV7181 chip or a comparable device using pre-defined settings based on the `rom_address` input. This module takes a 6-bit `rom_address` as an input port, which specifies the address containing specific configuration data for the ADV7181. Based on this address, the internal 24-bit register `data` retrieves and holds configuration settings from a set of predefined values. The configuration data in the `data` register, which consists of three 8-bit segments, is formatted by interleaving zeros into a 27-bit output (`rom_data`). This output adaptation adapts the data to interface with the device, matching specific interfacing requirements. The core functionalities of the Verilog module involve processing the input `rom_address` in a combinational `always` block to select and assign the appropriate configuration data to the `data` register. The `assign` statement then re-formats this data to form the `rom_data` output required by external devices or interfaces. This configuration ensures the module effectively addresses the configuration needs of video processing applications interfacing with the ADV7181 chip, facilitating initial setup and specific customization based on the ROM lookup logic.
