Additionally, the module outputs signals indicating the rising edge, falling edge, the middle of the high level, and the middle of the low level of the generated slower clock. It uses a parameterizable counter (`clk_counter`) that increments on each positive edge of the input clock when enabled. The top bit (`CB`) of this counter determines the state of the new clock signal. The output signals are controlled and reset based on the input reset signal and are conditioned by the enable signal. \u092ath a reset condition, all outputs are set to low."

It serves as the reference clock for generating the slower clock and other signals.\n- `reset`: This is a control signal. When high, it resets the internal counter and output signals to their initial states, ensuring the module can start or restart in a known condition.\n- `enable_clk`: This signal enables the counting operation that ultimately affects outputs. When high, the counter (`clk_counter`) is incremented on each rising edge of `clk`; when low, the counter does not increment.\n\nOutput ports: new_clk, rising_edge, falling_edge, middle_of_high_level, middle_of_low_level.\nExplanation:\n- `new_clk`: A generated slower clock output derived from the high bit (CB) of the counter. It toggles state when the counter overflows, creating a clock frequency slower than the input `clk`.\n- `rising_edge`: This signal goes high when a rising edge is detected on the `new_clk`. Specifically, it indicates the transition of `new_clk` from low to high.\n- `falling_edge`: This signal goes high when a falling edge is detected on the `new_clk`. Specifically, it indicates the transition of `new_clk` from high to low.\n- `middle_of_high_level`: This output signal identifies the middle point of the high level of the `new_clk`. It goes high when the most significant bits of `clk_counter` are in a specific high configuration.\n- `middle_of_low_level`: Similar to `middle_of_high_level`, but for identifying the middle point of the low level of the `new_clk`. It goes high when certain conditions in the counter are met during the low phase of `new_clk`."

It increments with each rising edge of `clk` if enabled, and is reset to zero when the `reset` signal is high.
