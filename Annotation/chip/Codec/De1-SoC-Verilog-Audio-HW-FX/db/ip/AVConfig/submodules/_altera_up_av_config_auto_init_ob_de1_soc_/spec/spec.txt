Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de1_soc. Module specification: The 'altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_de1_soc' is a Verilog module designed for initializing audio and video settings on the DE1-SoC board. It employs input from the 6-bit 'rom_address' to specify the address in ROMs and outputs a 27-bit 'rom_data'. The 'rom_data' is an OR combination of 'audio_rom_data' and 'video_rom_data', which are fetched respectively from audio and video initialization ROM instances named 'Auto_Init_Audio_ROM' and 'Auto_Init_Video_ROM'. The audio settings include parameters such as line in/out levels, ADC and DAC paths, power settings, data format, sample control, and active settings. These parameters are specified using 'defparam' keyword to customize the audio ROM instance's behavior. The video configuration data is fetched similarly but only defined in the form of an instantiated module without additional parameter settings shown in the snippet. The ROM address directs both ROM instances to output relevant configuration data, which are then aggregated internally by OR operation, forming the final output that sets audio and video configurations based on the input address.
