Module name: altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_audio. Module specification: The `altera_up_av_config_auto_init_ob_audio` module is designed for FPGA-based audio hardware initialization and configuration, using a ROM address to select and output audio setup data. This module has a single 6-bit input port `rom_address` that specifies which audio configuration setting, such as volume or format, is to be accessed. The output from the module is a 27-bit `rom_data`, which provides the detailed configuration data necessary for the audio device operation. Internally, the module utilizes a 24-bit register signal `data` to construct the configuration data based on predefined audio parameters, which are then formatted into the output by appending zeros at certain bit positions through the `assign` statement. The core functionality resides in an `always` block that contains a `case` statement. This block interprets the `rom_address` input and assigns corresponding pre-configured values to the `data` signal, which are then formatted and outputted as `rom_data`. This module effectively automates the initialization sequence for audio settings by mapping ROM addresses to specific audio configurations.
