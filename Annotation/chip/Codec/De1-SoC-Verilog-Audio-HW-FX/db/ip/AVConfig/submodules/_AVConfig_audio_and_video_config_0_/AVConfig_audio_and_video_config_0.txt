Module-level comment: The AVConfig_audio_and_video_config_0 module configures audio and video settings via I2C for DE1-SoC systems. It handles communication with peripheral devices using a state machine managing read/write operations, supported by internal signals for data handling and integrated sub-modules for ROM data access and serial transmission control, ensuring synchronized and robust multimedia configuration.
