It maps specific input address values to corresponding configuration parameters of the LCM, such as input format, power management, display orientation and phase, position controls, contrast and brightness adjustments, VCOM levels, PCD levels, and gamma correction values. The resultant configurations are encoded as output (rom_data) using the input address (rom_address) to specify which specific configuration setting should be output. This allows for the initialization and setup of the LCM in a specific state as needed by the system."
