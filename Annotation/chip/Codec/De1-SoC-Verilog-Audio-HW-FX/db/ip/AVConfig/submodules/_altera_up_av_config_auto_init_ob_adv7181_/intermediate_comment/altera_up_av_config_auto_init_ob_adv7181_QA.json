It uses a ROM lookup logic to assign specific configuration values to addresses. The `rom_address` input specifies the address, and the corresponding configuration data is set in `data` which is then formatted and output through `rom_data`. Each address maps to specific register settings, which are used to configure video processing parameters. The output `rom_data` is derived by interleaving zeros with the 8-bit segments of `data`, essentially formatting it for use in applications requiring wider bus widths. This setup is common in FPGA designs to interface with and configure video-related chips."

Explanation: The `rom_address` is an input port that accepts a 6-bit value, representing the address of the configuration setting. This address is used within the module to select specific configuration data for the ADV7181 chip from a set of predefined settings. Essentially, it specifies which piece of configuration data to fetch and output.\n\nOutput ports: [rom_data]. Explanation: The `rom_data` is an output port that sends a 27-bit formatted data to an external device, likely the configuration interface of the ADV7181 video processing chip. The data from the internal register `data` which contains configuration values is formatted here by interleaving zeros between each 8-bit chunk of `data`, thus adapting it from a 24-bit format to a 27-bit format required by the specific application or interfacing requirement. This output holds the specific configuration details to be programmed into the device based on the supplied address."
