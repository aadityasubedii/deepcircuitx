It interfaces with external signals to manage clock and reset functionalities for SDRAM operations. The module takes a reference clock and a reference reset as inputs and produces three outputs: a system clock, an SDRAM clock, and a reset signal. This setup is typically used to generate specific clock frequencies and a reset signal required for proper SDRAM operation."
