Module name: SDRAMPLL. Module specification: The SDRAMPLL is a Verilog module designed primarily as a wrapper for an SDRAM Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) component called `sys_sdram_pll_0`. This module serves to interface with external signals to manage clock and reset functionalities essential for SDRAM operations. The input ports include `ref_clk_clk`, a reference clock essential for the PLL to generate required system and SDRAM clocks, and `ref_reset_reset`, a reference reset used to reset the internal states of the PLL, ensuring proper initialization and operation synchronization. The output ports comprise `reset_source_reset`, providing a reset signal for external modules; `sdram_clk_clk`, which is the clock output for SDRAM operations; and `sys_clk_clk`, another clock output for general system-level operations. The module has no internally declared signals, functioning purely as a straightforward connection point that links the external ports to `sys_sdram_pll_0`. Internally, the `SDRAMPLL` module instantiates the `SDRAMPLL_sys_sdram_pll_0` block, which directly maps the input ports to their corresponding outputs, effectively creating a streamlined signal path from the inputs to the outputs without additional processing or intermediate logic. This configuration emphasizes the moduleâ€™s role in providing a simple yet critical connection framework within an SDRAM system design.
