Module-level comment: The SDRAMPLL module acts as a wrapper for `sys_sdram_pll_0`, managing clock and reset functionalities for SDRAM operations. It directly connects the inputs, `ref_clk_clk` and `ref_reset_reset`, to the outputs `sys_clk_clk`, `sdram_clk_clk`, and `reset_source_reset` through the instantiated PLL block, facilitating straightforward mapping and signal flow from the input to output ports, ensuring efficient clock management and system synchronization.
