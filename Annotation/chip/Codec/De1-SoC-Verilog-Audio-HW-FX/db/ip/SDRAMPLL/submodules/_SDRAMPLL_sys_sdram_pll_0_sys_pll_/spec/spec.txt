Module name: SDRAMPLL_sys_sdram_pll_0_sys_pll. 

Module specification: The 'SDRAMPLL_sys_sdram_pll_0_sys_pll' is a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) module tailored for SDRAM applications, incorporating an 'altera_pll' instance to accomplish its primary functionality. It handles a reference clock and reset signal through its input ports â€“ `refclk` and `rst`. `refclk` serves as the frequency baseline for the PLL, and `rst` is employed to reset the PLL's state when active. The module proffers two output clocks (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`) and a `locked` signal, respectively used for synchronization in SDRAM operations, adjusting phase relations, and indicating phase and frequency lock status. Internally, the module comprises a substantial instantiation of `altera_pll` configured to generate various clock frequencies and phase shifts, although in this specific setup, only the first two clocks are effectively utilized with specified non-zero frequencies and distinct phase shifts. The instantiation directly maps top-level signals to and from the PLL, avoiding additional internal signal processing. This organized design encapsulates PLL functionality robustly suited for clock generation and management within SDRAM systems.
