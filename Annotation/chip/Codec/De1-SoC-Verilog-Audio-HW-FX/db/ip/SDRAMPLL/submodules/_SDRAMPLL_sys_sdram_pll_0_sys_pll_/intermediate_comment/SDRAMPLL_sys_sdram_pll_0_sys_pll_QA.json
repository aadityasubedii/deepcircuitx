It accepts a reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset signal (`rst`). The output includes two clock signals (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`) and a `locked` signal which indicates when the PLL has achieved phase and frequency lock. This PLL configuration provides one clock output at 50 MHz with a 0 ps phase shift and a second clock at the same frequency but with a -3000 ps phase shift, likely for timing adjustments in SDRAM operations. The other clock outputs and functionalities are not utilized as their frequencies are set to 0 MHz."

It provides the base frequency from which the PLL generates the output clocks. In this module, the reference clock frequency is specified as 50.0 MHz.\n- `rst`: This is the reset input for the PLL. It is used to reset the internal state of the PLL. When active, it forces the PLL to reinitialize and restart the locking process.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `locked`.\nExplanation:\n- `outclk_0`: This is the first output clock of the PLL, configured to operate at 50.000000 MHz with a phase shift of 0 ps. It serves as one of the operational clock outputs, likely used for synchronization or timing in SDRAM operations.\n- `outclk_1`: This is the second output clock of the PLL, also set to 50.000000 MHz but with a phase shift of -3000 ps. This output is particularly useful for adjusting the phase relation between different clock domains within the SDRAM system, aiding in the control of timing and data integrity.\n- `locked`: This signal indicates the lock status of the PLL. It becomes active when the PLL has successfully locked onto the input reference frequency, ensuring that the output clocks are stable and in phase/frequency alignment with the reference clock. This is critical for reliable operation of the system that the PLL is serving, such as an SDRAM."
