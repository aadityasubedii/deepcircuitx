Module specification: The `SDRAMPLL_sys_sdram_pll_0` module is designed to generate necessary system clocks for SDRAM utilizing a PLL based on a reference clock input. The module has two input ports: `ref_clk_clk`, the primary clock input for the PLL ensuring synchronous operation, and `ref_reset_reset`, which provides a reset mechanism to the PLL during initialization or errors. The outputs of this module include `sys_clk_clk` for general system operations, `sdram_clk_clk` tailored for SDRAM operations, and `reset_source_reset`, a reset signal activated based on the lock status of the PLL to ensure stable operations. The internal signal `sys_pll_locked_export` is pivotal in monitoring the PLL's lock status, where a high signal indicates a stable PLL output and low triggers a system reset via the `reset_from_locked` submodule. This submodule utilizes the lock signal to control the reset output effectively. The module integrates the `sys_pll` block for clock generation from the reference clock and the `altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal` for generating a reset signal based on the PLL's lock status, thus ensuring operational integrity and synchronization with the SDRAM's system requirements.",
