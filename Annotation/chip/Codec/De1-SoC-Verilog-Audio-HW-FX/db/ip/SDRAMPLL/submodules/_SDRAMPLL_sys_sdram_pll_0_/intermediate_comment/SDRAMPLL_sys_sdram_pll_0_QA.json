It utilizes a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) sub-module (`sys_pll`) that takes the reference clock (`ref_clk_clk`) and a reset signal (`ref_reset_reset`). This PLL generates two clocks: one for system usage (`sys_clk_clk`) and another specifically for SDRAM (`sdram_clk_clk`). The module also includes functionality to generate a reset signal (`reset_source_reset`) based on the lock status of the PLL (`sys_pll_locked_export`), ensuring that the system and SDRAM receive a reset signal when the PLL is not locked, hence maintaining system stability and integrity."

It serves as the primary clock input for the Phase Locked Loop (PLL) which is used to generate the required system and SDRAM clocks.\n- `ref_reset_reset`: This is the reset input for the module. It is used to reset the PLL in case of any operational errors or initiation procedures, ensuring that the PLL starts in a known state.\n\nOutput ports: `sys_clk_clk`, `sdram_clk_clk`, `reset_source_reset`.\nExplanation:\n- `sys_clk_clk`: This is the system clock output generated by the PLL. It is used to drive the clocking requirements of the system that interfaces with the SDRAM.\n- `sdram_clk_clk`: This is the SDRAM clock output specifically generated for the SDRAM. It ensures that the SDRAM operates synchronously with the system using a clock that is derived from the same PLL as the system clock.\n- `reset_source_reset`: This is the reset signal output which is controlled by the lock status of the PLL. If the PLL is not locked, indicating unstable or incorrect clock outputs, this reset signal is activated to reset the connected systems, preventing erroneous operations."

Specifically, this signal is fed into the `reset_from_locked` sub-module. When the PLL is properly locked, indicating stable and correct frequency synthesis, this signal is high.
