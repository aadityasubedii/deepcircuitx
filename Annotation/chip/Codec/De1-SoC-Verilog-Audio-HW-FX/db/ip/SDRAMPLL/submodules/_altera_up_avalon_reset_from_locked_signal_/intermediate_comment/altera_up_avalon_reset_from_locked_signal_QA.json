Specifically, the reset output is the inverse of the locked input. When the 'locked' signal is high (logic 1), the 'reset' signal will be low (logic 0), and vice versa. This functionality is typically used in systems where a reset needs to be triggered when a particular condition (represented by the 'locked' signal) is not met."

Explanation: The 'locked' input port receives a signal indicating a certain condition in the system (typically related to a locking mechanism or a stable state being achieved). The logic level of this input directly impacts the state of the reset signal.\n\nOutput ports: [reset]. Explanation: The 'reset' output port emits a signal used to reset parts of the system. It is the logical negation of the 'locked' signal, which means it will be active (logic 0) when 'locked' is inactive (logic 1), and inactive (logic 1) when 'locked' is active (logic 0). This setup ensures that a reset is triggered when the system is not locked or in a desired stable state."

No additional intermediate (internal) signals are generated or required for this basic operation. This design simplifies the logic and enhances clarity by directly using the available input to determine the output state."
