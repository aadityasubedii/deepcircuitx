Module name: altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal. Module specification: The "altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal" module is responsible for generating a reset signal inversely based on the input "locked" signal. The moduleâ€™s functionality is quite straightforward: it emits a reset signal which is the logical negation of the locked signal. Specifically, the input port called "locked" captures a signal indicating whether a certain stable condition or lock status is achieved within the system. The module outputs through the "reset" port, which delivers a signal utilized to reset components of the system; this signal is active low (logic 0) when the 'locked' input is inactive (logic 1), hence effectively initiating a reset when conditions are not met. Internally, this module doesn't use any additional signals; it simply directly assigns the 'reset' output by inverting the 'locked' input without intermediate stages, ensuring simplicity and clarity in the logic design. The Verilog code comprises declarations of these input and output ports, followed by a simple assignment statement that defines the operational logic of the module.
