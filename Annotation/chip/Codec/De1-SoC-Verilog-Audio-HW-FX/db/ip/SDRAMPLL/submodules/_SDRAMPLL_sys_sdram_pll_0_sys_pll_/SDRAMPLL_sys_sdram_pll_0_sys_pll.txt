Module-level comment: The 'SDRAMPLL_sys_sdram_pll_0_sys_pll' module is a PLL designed for SDRAM applications. It uses an instantiated 'altera_pll' configured to generate two operational clocks at 50 MHz with phase shifts of 0 ps and -3000 ps from a 50 MHz reference clock (`refclk`). It includes a reset (`rst`) and outputs two clocks (`outclk_0`, `outclk_1`) along with a lock status (`locked`). The instance handles all critical frequency and phase settings internally, directly mapping the I/O.
