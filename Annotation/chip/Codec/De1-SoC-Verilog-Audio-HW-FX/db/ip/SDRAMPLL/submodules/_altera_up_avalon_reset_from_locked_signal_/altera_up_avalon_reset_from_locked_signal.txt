Module-level comment: The "altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal" module generates a reset signal which is the inverse of the input "locked" signal. The module takes one input, "locked", and outputs "reset" which is active low when "locked" is inactive. This is implemented directly using an assignment statement without any internal signals, ensuring simplicity and direct mapping from input to output.
