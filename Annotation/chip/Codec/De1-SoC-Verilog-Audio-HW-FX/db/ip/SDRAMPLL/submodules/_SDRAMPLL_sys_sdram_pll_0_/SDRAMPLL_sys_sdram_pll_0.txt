Module-level comment: The `SDRAMPLL_sys_sdram_pll_0` module generates system and SDRAM clocks from a reference clock using a PLL. It has inputs for the reference clock and reset, and outputs tailored system clocks along with a conditional reset based on the PLL's lock status. This is managed through the `sys_pll` for clock outputs and `altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal` for handling resets, ensuring synchronized and stable operations.
