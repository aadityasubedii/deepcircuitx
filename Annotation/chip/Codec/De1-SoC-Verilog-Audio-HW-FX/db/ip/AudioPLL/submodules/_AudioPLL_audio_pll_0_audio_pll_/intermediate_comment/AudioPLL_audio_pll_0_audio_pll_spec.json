It includes two input ports: 'refclk', a reference clock which acts as the baseline frequency for the PLL, and 'rst', a reset signal for reinitializing the PLL\u2019s state in case of operational anomalies or during initial setup. The module also features two output ports: 'outclk_0', delivering the desired output clock frequency, and 'locked', which indicates whether the PLL has successfully locked to the output frequency. Internally, the module does not define additional signals but directly uses the ports to interface with an instantiated 'altera_pll' block, which is configured with various parameters such as the number of clocks, output clock frequency, phase shift, and duty cycle, though most are set to zero or default since only one output frequency is utilized. The altera_pll block performs the core PLL functions, generating the specified stable output frequency necessary for audio processing tasks.",
