It employs a phase-locked loop (PLL) component, identified as `AudioPLL_audio_pll_0_audio_pll`, to derive the audio clock from the reference clock. The PLL ensures the audio clock's stability and synchronization with the reference clock. Additionally, the module uses a component (`altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal`) to generate a reset signal, `reset_source_reset`, which is activated based on the PLL's lock status, ensuring the system only operates when the PLL is properly locked and stable."

The state of this signal is crucial as it determines the behavior of the `reset_source_reset` output. When `audio_pll_locked_export` is high (indicating the PLL is locked), the `reset_source_reset` is deactivated, allowing normal operation of the downstream components. Conversely, when the PLL is not locked, this signal will trigger the `reset_source_reset` to become active (high), ensuring the system remains in a reset state until stable operation is achieved."
