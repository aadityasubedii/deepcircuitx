    "spec": "Module name: AudioPLL_audio_pll_0. \nModule specification: The AudioPLL_audio_pll_0 module is a Verilog module designed to generate a stable audio clock signal from a reference clock using a phase-locked loop (PLL). It primarily functions with two input ports: `ref_clk_clk` and `ref_reset_reset`. The `ref_clk_clk` serves as the reference clock for the PLL, from which the audio clock is derived, and `ref_reset_reset` is used to reset the PLL during faults for reinitialization. The module outputs two signals: `audio_clk_clk`, the derived audio clock, and `reset_source_reset`, a reset signal controlled based on the PLL's lock status. Internally, the module employs the signal `audio_pll_locked_export` to indicate the lock status of the PLL. This signal is essential for controlling the reset behavior via `reset_source_reset`. The module includes two primary blocks: the PLL instantiation (`AudioPLL_audio_pll_0_audio_pll`), which takes the reference clock and reset as inputs to provide the audio clock and the lock status; and the `altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal` block that generates the reset signal based on the PLL\u2019s lock status, ensuring stable operation before allowing other components to function. This design ensures that the audio processing system operates with synchronization and stability, vital for high-quality audio applications.",
