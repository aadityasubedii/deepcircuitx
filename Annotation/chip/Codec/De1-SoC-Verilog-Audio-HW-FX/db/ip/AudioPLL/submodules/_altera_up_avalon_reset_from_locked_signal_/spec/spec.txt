Module name: altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal. Module specification: The `altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal` module is designed to generate a reset signal inversely based on the status of the 'locked' input signal. Specifically, the module has an input port 'locked', which indicates the lock status of perhaps a PLL; a high 'locked' signal signifies a stable state, whereas a low 'locked' indicates instability. The single output port, 'reset', is driven as the logical negation of the 'locked' input, thus active high when 'locked' is low, signifying an unstable condition and necessitating a system reset. No internal signals are used in this module, aligning with its purpose to directly transform the 'locked' signal into a reset command with minimal complexity and latency. The Verilog code mainly consists of defining these I/O ports and the straightforward assignment statement which negates the 'locked' signal to produce the 'reset' output. This design idealizes prompt responsiveness suitable for systems requiring rapid response to changes in stability detected by the 'locked' input.
