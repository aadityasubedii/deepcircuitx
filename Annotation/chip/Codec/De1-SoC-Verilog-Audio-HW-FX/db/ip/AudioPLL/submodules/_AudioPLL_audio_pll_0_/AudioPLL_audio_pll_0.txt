Module-level comment: The AudioPLL_audio_pll_0 module generates a stable audio clock from a reference clock using a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop). It inputs the reference and reset signals, uses these in the PLL to derive the audio clock, and outputs it alongside a reset signal controlled by the PLL's lock status. This ensures that downstream components operate only under stable conditions, facilitating reliable audio processing.
