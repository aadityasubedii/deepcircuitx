Specifically, when 'locked' is high, indicating a stable or 'locked' condition possibly from another circuit component like a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop), the output 'reset' is low. Conversely, when 'locked' is low, indicating an 'unlocked' or unstable state, the output 'reset' is high. This functionality is useful in systems needing a reset triggered by a loss of lock, ensuring components are reset into a known state upon such events."

Explanation: The 'locked' input is a signal that typically represents the lock status of a component such as a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL). When this signal is high, it indicates that the component is in a stable or locked state.\n\nOutput ports: reset. Explanation: The 'reset' output is driven by the negation of the 'locked' input signal. This means that the 'reset' signal will be high (active) when the 'locked' signal is low (indicating an unstable or unlocked condition), triggering a system reset to ensure other components operate from a known stable state. Conversely, when 'locked' is high, 'reset' will be low, indicating no reset is needed as the system is stable."

The functionality of generating the reset signal is directly achieved through the assignment and logical negation of the 'locked' input signal. This simplicity ensures minimal latency and straightforward signal processing within the module, focusing solely on computing the 'reset' output as the negation of the 'locked' input."
