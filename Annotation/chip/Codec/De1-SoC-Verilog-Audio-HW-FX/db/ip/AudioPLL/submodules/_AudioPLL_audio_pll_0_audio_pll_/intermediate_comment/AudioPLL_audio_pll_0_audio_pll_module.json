    "module": "Module-level comment: The AudioPLL_audio_pll_0_audio_pll module implements a phase-locked loop for audio frequencies, specifically outputting a 12.288135 MHz clock derived from a reference clock ('refclk'). Using the 'altera_pll' block with specified configurations like frequency and duty cycle, it efficiently manages frequency synthesis and stability. Inputs include 'refclk' and 'rst'; outputs are 'outclk_0' and 'locked', which indicates lock status."
