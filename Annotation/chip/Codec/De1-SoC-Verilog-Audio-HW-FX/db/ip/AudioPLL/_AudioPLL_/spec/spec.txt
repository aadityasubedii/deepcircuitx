Module name: AudioPLL. Module specification: The AudioPLL is a Verilog module designed to generate a synchronized audio clock from a reference clock. It interfaces with an internal component named `audio_pll_0` to derive the audio clock (`audio_clk_clk`) based on the input reference clock (`ref_clk_clk`). The module also receives a reference reset signal (`ref_reset_reset`) and outputs a corresponding reset signal (`reset_source_reset`). This ensures the module and its interfacing components initiate in a known state for proper synchronization and stability. The input ports include `ref_clk_clk`, which acts as the primary timing signal, and `ref_reset_reset`, which ensures that the module starts in a pre-defined state. The output ports are `audio_clk_clk`, which is used externally where a stable audio clock is necessary, and `reset_source_reset`, providing a means to reset external devices in synchronization with the AudioPLL. Internally, the module does not utilize any explicit signals; all processes are handled within the submodule `audio_pll_0`, which directly connects the inputs to the outputs. This submodule is essential for processing the input signals and generating the necessary output signals without additional internal wiring or logic in the main module, simplifying the AudioPLL's design and operation.
