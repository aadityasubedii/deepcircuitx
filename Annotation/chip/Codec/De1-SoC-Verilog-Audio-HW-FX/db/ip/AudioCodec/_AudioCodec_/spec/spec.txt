Module name: AudioCodec. Module specification: The AudioCodec module is designed to facilitate interaction with audio codec hardware, managing digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversion processes for stereo audio channels. Specifically, the module handles input and output digital audio data through the ADC and DAC for both left and right audio channels. Input ports include data and validation signals for the DAC (`to_dac_left_channel_data`, `to_dac_left_channel_valid`, `to_dac_right_channel_data`, `to_dac_right_channel_valid`), ready signals from the ADC (`from_adc_left_channel_ready`, `from_adc_right_channel_ready`), along with various clock signals (`clk`, `AUD_ADCDAT`, `AUD_ADCLRCK`, `AUD_BCLK`, `AUD_DACLRCK`) and a reset signal (`reset`). Output ports consist of ready signals for the DAC (`to_dac_left_channel_ready`, `to_dac_right_channel_ready`), data and validation signals from the ADC (`from_adc_left_channel_data`, `from_adc_left_channel_valid`, `from_adc_right_channel_data`, `from_adc_right_channel_valid`), and a data output to the DAC (`AUD_DACDAT`). Internal signals primarily involve those related to timing and data synchronization (`AUD_ADCDAT`, `AUD_ADCLRCK`, `AUD_BCLK`, `AUD_DACDAT`, `AUD_DACLRCK`). The code includes a primary block `AudioCodec_audio_0` which integrates all inputs and outputs, implementing the functional logic to manage data transfer and synchronization effectively between the subsystems involved. This organized approach ensures proper signal processing for accurate audio data handling and streaming within digital audio processing systems.
