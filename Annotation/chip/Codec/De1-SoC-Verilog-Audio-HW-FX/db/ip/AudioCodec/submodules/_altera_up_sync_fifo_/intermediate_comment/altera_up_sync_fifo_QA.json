It uses an internal \"scfifo\" component specifically intended for Altera's Cyclone II FPGA family. The FIFO manages data flow by allowing data written into it when there is space (controlled by `write_en` and `write_data`) and reading data from it when data is available (controlled by `read_en`). It provides status signals such as `fifo_is_empty`, `fifo_is_full`, and the count of words currently stored (`words_used`). The module parameters like data width (`DW`), depth (`DATA_DEPTH`), and address width (`AW`) are configurable, enhancing its versatility in different design scenarios. The FIFO does not check for overflow or underflow conditions, as those features are turned off in this setup."
