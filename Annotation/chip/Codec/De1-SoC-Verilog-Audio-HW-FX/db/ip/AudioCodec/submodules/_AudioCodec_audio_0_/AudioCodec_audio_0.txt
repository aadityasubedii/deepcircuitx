Module-level comment: The AudioCodec_audio_0 module interfaces with audio hardware to manage data between ADCs and DACs, ensuring synchronized audio processing. It utilizes input and output ports for data and control signals, coupled with internal edge detection and FIFO status signals to control data flow and synchronization. Key blocks include edge detection, data serialization/deserialization, evaluating buffer status, and managing clock synchronization, ensuring reliable and quality audio signal processing.
