It manages this by receiving serial audio data inputs through the `serial_audio_in_data` signal and handling synchronization signals like bit and left-right clocks. It then processes and shifts incoming audio data into the appropriate left or right channel audio FIFOs depending on the state of the left_right clock. The module also manages the read and write operations to these FIFOs, ensuring that data is neither read from an empty FIFO nor written to a full FIFO. Read data from the FIFOs is output as left or right channel data. The module also provides feedback on FIFO usage, indicating how full each FIFO is and whether they are full or empty, which could assist in managing the flow of data in a larger system."
