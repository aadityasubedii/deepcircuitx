It utilizes two registers (cur_test_clk and last_test_clk) to hold the current and previous states of the test clock (test_clk) synchronized to the primary clock (clk). The module identifies an edge whenever there is a change between these two states, signaling a rising edge when transitioning from low to high and a falling edge when transitioning from high to low relative to the primary clock. This behavior is essential for applications that require precise edge detection for proper timing or operational adjustments."
