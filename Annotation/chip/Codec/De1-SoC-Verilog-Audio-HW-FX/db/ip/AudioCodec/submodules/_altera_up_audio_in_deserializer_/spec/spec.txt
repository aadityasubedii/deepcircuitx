Module name: altera_up_audio_in_deserializer.  
Module specification: The `altera_up_audio_in_deserializer` module is designed to deserialize serial audio input data into parallel audio data for both left and right audio channels. It synthesizes input ports such as `clk` (main clock), `reset` (module reset), `bit_clk_rising_edge` and `bit_clk_falling_edge` (bit clock signals), `left_right_clk_rising_edge` and `left_right_clk_falling_edge` (clock signals for channel toggling), `done_channel_sync` (channel synchronization flag), `serial_audio_in_data` (serial input data), and `read_left_audio_data_en` and `read_right_audio_data_en` (read enable signals for FIFOs). It outputs `left_audio_fifo_read_space` and `right_audio_fifo_read_space` (indicating space and full status of FIFOs), and `left_channel_data` and `right_channel_data` for the respective audio channels. Key internal signals include `valid_audio_input` (status of audio data validity), `left_channel_fifo_is_empty`, `right_channel_fifo_is_empty`, `left_channel_fifo_is_full`, and `right_channel_fifo_is_full` (status signals for FIFOs), and `data_in_shift_reg` (shift register for incoming audio bits). The module includes three sub-blocks: `Audio_Out_Bit_Counter` for managing bit counting, `Audio_In_Left_Channel_FIFO` and `Audio_In_Right_Channel_FIFO` which are FIFO memory structures for queuing the left and right channel data respectively. Each section utilizes FIFO management techniques like writing data at falling or rising edges of the left-right clock, protected by full and empty FIFO conditions, and controls data output based on read enable signals and FIFO status. This systemic division permits robust and efficient handling of serialized audio streams ensuring accurate deserialization and channel allocation.
