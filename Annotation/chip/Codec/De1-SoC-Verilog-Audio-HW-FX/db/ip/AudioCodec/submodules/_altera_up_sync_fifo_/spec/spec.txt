Module name: altera_up_sync_fifo.
Module specification: The `altera_up_sync_fifo` is a Verilog module designed as a synchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer tailored for Altera's Cyclone II FPGA family. It facilitates orderly data transfer by allowing data to be written when there's available space and read when data is existent, controlled via input ports such as `clk` (clock input for timing operations), `reset` (clears all data and resets flags), `write_en` (enables writing), `write_data` (data to be written), and `read_en` (enables reading). Output ports include `fifo_is_empty` (indicates the FIFO is empty), `fifo_is_full` (indicates the FIFO is full), `words_used` (shows number of words stored), and `read_data` (data being read). Internally, the module uses no user-defined signals and operates by mapping inputs and outputs directly to and from the `scfifo` component without intermediary processing, ensuring a straightforward transfer mechanism. The code includes module parameter definitions for data width (`DW`), data depth (`DATA_DEPTH`), and address width (`AW`), along with configurations for the `scfifo` component that dictate RAM usage, checking mechanisms (both overflow and underflow are disabled), and device specifications to align with the intended device characteristics. This structured setup provides a clear and efficient implementation of a FIFO buffer suitable for high-performance FPGA applications.
