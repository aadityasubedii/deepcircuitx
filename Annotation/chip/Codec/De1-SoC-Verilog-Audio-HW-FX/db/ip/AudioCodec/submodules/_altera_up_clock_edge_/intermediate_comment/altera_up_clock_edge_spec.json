    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_clock_edge. \nModule specification: The altera_up_clock_edge is a Verilog module designed to detect both rising and falling edges of a test clock signal (test_clk) synchronized to a primary clock signal (clk). The module inputs include 'clk', the primary clock for synchronization; 'reset', typically used for initializing hardware states but not actively used in this code; and 'test_clk', the test clock whose edges are being monitored. It produces two outputs: 'rising_edge', which flags 'high' on detecting a transition from low to high in test_clk, and 'falling_edge', which flags 'high' on detecting a transition from high to low. Internally, the module utilizes three primary signals: 'found_edge', a wire detecting any change between the current and last state of test_clk by using an XOR operation; 'cur_test_clk', a register holding the current state of test_clk at each positive clk edge; and 'last_test_clk', a register capturing the previous state of cur_test_clk. The code is organized into three main blocks: two always blocks that handle the updating of 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk' with every positive edge of 'clk', and a combinational logic section that determines and outputs the edge detection status through the 'rising_edge' and 'falling_edge' signals using logical operations relating to 'found_edge', 'cur_test_clk', and 'last_test_clk'. This design effectively provides precise edge detection capability, critical in timing and synchronization tasks in digital systems.",
