Module-level comment: The `altera_up_audio_bit_counter` manages bit counts synchronized with audio clock signals, essential for stereo audio processing. It handles initialization, resetting on specific clock edges, and decrements using a 5-bit counter. Internally, it uses `reset_bit_counter` and `bit_counter` signals, controlled via two primary blocks in response to clock edges, driving the `counting` output based on conditions set by the clock and reset signals.
