It processes incoming audio data from ADCs and outgoing audio data to DACs synchronously with various clock signals. The module handles clock edge detection, synchronizes audio data channels, and employs serializers and deserializers to manage audio data flow. This helps in audio data acquisition from input channels, processing, and output delivery through channels in a digital audio system, maintaining audio quality and synchronization."
