    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_up_audio_out_serializer` module serializes audio data for dual channels (left and right). It manages input data using FIFOs for each channel, with serialization triggered on the edge of bit and left-right clocks. The module contains FIFO instances for buffering, controlled by input enable signals and FIFO status. Audio data is serialized and output bit-by-bit, aligned to the falling edge of the bit clock, after being conditionally loaded from FIFOs based on clock toggles."
