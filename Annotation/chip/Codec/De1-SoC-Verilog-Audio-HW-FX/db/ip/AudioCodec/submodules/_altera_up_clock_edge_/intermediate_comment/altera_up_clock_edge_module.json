    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'altera_up_clock_edge' module detects rising and falling edges of a test clock relative to a primary clock. It uses two registers, 'cur_test_clk' and 'last_test_clk', updated each clk cycle, to track the state transitions of the test clock. Edge detection is realized using an XOR operation between these registers, which helps identify state changes, and the results define the outputs 'rising_edge' and 'falling_edge'."
