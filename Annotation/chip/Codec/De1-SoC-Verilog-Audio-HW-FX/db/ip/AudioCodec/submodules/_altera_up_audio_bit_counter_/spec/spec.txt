Module name: altera_up_audio_bit_counter. Module specification: The `altera_up_audio_bit_counter` is a Verilog module designed to manage a bit counter that is synchronized with audio clock signals, notably used in audio processing applications where management of stereo audio signal timing is crucial. This module operates on a positive edge system clock (`clk`) and uses various inputs like `reset`, `bit_clk_rising_edge`, `bit_clk_falling_edge`, `left_right_clk_rising_edge`, and `left_right_clk_falling_edge` to manage the bit counter and the `counting` output. The `reset` input initializes the bit counter to zero. The bit counter is set to a predefined initial value (`BIT_COUNTER_INIT` set to `5'h0F`) on any rising or falling edge of the left-right clock, which are indicated by `left_right_clk_rising_edge` and `left_right_clk_falling_edge`. Moreover, it decrements the bit counter on every falling edge of the bit clock as signified by `bit_clk_falling_edge`, if itâ€™s not already zero. The module uses internal signals like `reset_bit_counter`, which triggers the resetting of the bit counter based on the left-right clock edges, and `bit_counter`, a 5-bit register tracking the number of bit clock edges. The operation is encapsulated in two always blocks; one handling the updates to `bit_counter` based on clock edges and reset conditions, and another managing the `counting` state, which is high when the counter resets to its initial setting and low when it reaches zero. This well-structured system allows for precise control and tracking of the bit counting operations necessary for correct audio signal processing.
