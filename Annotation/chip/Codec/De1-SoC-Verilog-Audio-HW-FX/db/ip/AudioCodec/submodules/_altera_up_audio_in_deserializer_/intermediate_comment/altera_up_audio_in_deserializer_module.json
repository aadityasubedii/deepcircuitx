    "module": "Module-level comment: The `altera_up_audio_in_deserializer` deserializes serial audio data into parallel channels for left and right audio data processing. It uses input clocks and data signals to manage synchronization and data integrity with rising/falling edge detection. The module utilizes internal shift registers and FIFOs to manage, store, and output audio data based on full/empty states and read enable signals, ensuring efficient, error-free data handling."
