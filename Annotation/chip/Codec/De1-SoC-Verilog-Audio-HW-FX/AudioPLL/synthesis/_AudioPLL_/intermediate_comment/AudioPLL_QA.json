It includes an instantiation of a PLL component (AudioPLL_audio_pll_0) that takes the reference clock and reset signal as inputs and outputs the audio clock signal and a reset source. This setup is typically used in digital audio applications where a specific audio clock frequency is required that is derived from a general system reference clock."

It provides the clock signal that the PLL uses as a basis to generate the required audio clock.\n- `ref_reset_reset` is the reset input to the module. It is used to reset the PLL component, ensuring it starts from a known state or recovers from an error state.\n\nOutput ports: audio_clk_clk, reset_source_reset.\nExplanation: \n- `audio_clk_clk` is the audio clock output from the module. This signal is generated by the PLL component from the reference clock input and is used for timing in audio processing circuits.\n- `reset_source_reset` is the reset output from the module. It transmits a reset signal, which could be derived or synchronized with the reference reset input, potentially used to reset connected modules within the system, ensuring synchronized operation."

Hence, there are no additional internal signals or intermediate wiring declared or used within this module.
