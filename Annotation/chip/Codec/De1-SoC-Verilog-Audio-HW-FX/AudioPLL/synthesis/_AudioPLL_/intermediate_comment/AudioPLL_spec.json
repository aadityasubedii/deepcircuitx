    "spec": "Module name: AudioPLL. Module specification: The AudioPLL is a Verilog module designed to generate an audio clock signal derived from a reference clock, essential in digital audio applications. It consists of an input port `ref_clk_clk`, which serves as the reference clock input and `ref_reset_reset`, a reset signal input ensuring the PLL starts from a known state. The output ports include `audio_clk_clk`, the derived audio clock used in timing audio processing circuits, and `reset_source_reset`, a reset signal output that can synchronize resets in connected systems. Internally, the module does not utilize any additional signals and directly connects these inputs to the instantiated PLL component, `AudioPLL_audio_pll_0`, which further handles signal processing and clock generation. This setup simplifies the design by focusing on direct signal routing without intermediate processing or additional internal logic.",
