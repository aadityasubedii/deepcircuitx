Module-level comment: The AudioPLL_audio_pll_0 module generates a stable audio-specific clock from a reference input using a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL). It features inputs for reference clock and reset, outputs for audio clock and system reset. Internally, it uses a PLL block for clock synchronization and a reset controller that ensures system stability based on the PLL's lock status.
