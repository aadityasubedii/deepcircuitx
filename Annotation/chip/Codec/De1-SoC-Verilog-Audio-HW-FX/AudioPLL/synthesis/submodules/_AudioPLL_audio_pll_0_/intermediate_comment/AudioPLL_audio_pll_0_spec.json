    "spec": "Module name: AudioPLL_audio_pll_0. Module specification: The AudioPLL_audio_pll_0 module is designed as a clock management system for audio applications, utilizing a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to generate a stable audio clock signal from a reference clock input. It receives two input ports; `ref_clk_clk` serves as the reference clock input, essential for the PLL\u2019s synchronization with the incoming audio signals, and `ref_reset_reset`, which is used to reset the module\u2019s internal operations to ensure an accurate lock to the reference clock. The module outputs include `audio_clk_clk`, a clock signal tailored for audio systems derived from the PLL, and `reset_source_reset`, which outputs a reset signal based upon the PLL\u2019s lock status to manage dependent systems' operations. Within the module, an internal signal named `audio_pll_locked_export` is utilized to communicate the lock status of the PLL between the PLL component and a reset logic component. This signal ensures that the module\u2019s outputs are stable and reliable by preventing operation under unstable clock conditions. The module comprises two main blocks: `AudioPLL_audio_pll_0_audio_pll`, which handles the actual PLL operation including clock generation and lock detection; and `altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal`, which uses the lock status to control the reset logic, thereby maintaining system stability.",
