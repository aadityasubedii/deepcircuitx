Module-level comment: The 'altera_up_avalon_reset_from_locked_signal' module inversely generates a 'reset' signal from its 'locked' input, automatically causing a reset when 'locked' is low. This functionality is achieved through a simple assignment where 'reset' is the bitwise NOT of 'locked', ensuring a prompt and efficient response to changes in system stability.
