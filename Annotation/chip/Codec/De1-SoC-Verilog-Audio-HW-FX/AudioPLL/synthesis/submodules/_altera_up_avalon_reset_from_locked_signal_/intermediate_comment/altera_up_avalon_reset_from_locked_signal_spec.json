The module takes a single input port, 'locked', which denotes whether a system is in a stable or desired state; 'locked' being low (0) indicates instability. Based on this input, the module outputs 'reset', which is high (1) when 'locked' is low, suggesting a reset is needed to regain stability. Remarkably, this module does not utilize any internal signals, reflecting its direct and uncomplicated functionality. The core operation involves an assignment statement where 'reset' is derived using a bitwise NOT operation on 'locked'. This straightforward approach ensures minimal processing delay and resource usage, making the module efficient for scenarios requiring immediate response based on system stability status.",
