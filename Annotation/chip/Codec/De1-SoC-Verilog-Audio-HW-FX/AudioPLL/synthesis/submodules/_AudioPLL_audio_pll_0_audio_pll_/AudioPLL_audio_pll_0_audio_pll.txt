Module-level comment: The AudioPLL_audio_pll_0_audio_pll module implements a PLL to generate a 12.288135 MHz clock from a 50 MHz reference using an Altera PLL component. It manages initialization and output stability using `rst` and `locked` signals respectively, directly interfacing with the `altera_pll_i` instantiation to configure phase, duty cycle, and output frequency without extra internal signals.
