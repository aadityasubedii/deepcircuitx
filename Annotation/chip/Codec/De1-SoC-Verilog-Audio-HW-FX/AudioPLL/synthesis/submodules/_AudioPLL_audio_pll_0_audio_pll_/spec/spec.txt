Module name: AudioPLL_audio_pll_0_audio_pll. 
Module specification: The AudioPLL_audio_pll_0_audio_pll is a Verilog module implementing a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) to generate a specific output clock frequency from a reference clock input. The purpose of the module is to synthesize an output clock frequency of 12.288135 MHz from a 50 MHz reference clock. It incorporates an Altera PLL component configured with specific parameters such as a non-fractional VCO multiplier and a single output clock with a 0 ps phase shift and a 50% duty cycle. The module's input ports include `refclk`, the 50 MHz reference clock input, and `rst`, the reset input that reinitializes the PLL when activated. The output ports are `outclk_0`, delivering the synthesized 12.288135 MHz clock, and `locked`, a status signal indicating PLL locking status. Internally, the module instantiates the `altera_pll` component (`altera_pll_i`), leveraging its parameters to achieve the desired output. This instantiation directly connects the external input and output ports without utilizing additional internal wires or signals, thus simplifying the internal signal handling and focusing on the PLL configuration and output generation.
