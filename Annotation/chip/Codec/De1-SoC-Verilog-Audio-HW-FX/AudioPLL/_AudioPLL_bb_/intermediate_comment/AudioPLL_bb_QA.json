It takes a reference clock input (`ref_clk_clk`) and a reference reset signal (`ref_reset_reset`). It outputs an audio-specific clock signal (`audio_clk_clk`) and a reset signal specific to some source (`reset_source_reset`). Hence, the primary functionality is to generate an audio clock that is synchronized with the reference clock, typically used in digital audio systems to maintain timing integrity."
