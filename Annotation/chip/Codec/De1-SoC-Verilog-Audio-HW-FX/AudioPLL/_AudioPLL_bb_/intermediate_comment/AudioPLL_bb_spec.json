    "spec": "Module name: AudioPLL. \nModule specification: The AudioPLL module serves as a phase-locked loop specifically designed for audio applications, ensuring synchronization of generated audio clock signals with an input reference clock. It includes two input ports: `ref_clk_clk`, which acts as the primary timing reference, and `ref_reset_reset`, used for resetting the module to a known state. The outputs consist of `audio_clk_clk`, a tailored clock signal for audio applications, and `reset_source_reset`, which is utilized to reset related components in the audio path. The Verilog code provided does not detail any internal signals, hence no internal structure can be discerned. This code snippet essentially outlines a simple module interface without specifying operational blocks or internal signal processing details, emphasizing its role in interfacing rather than the specifics of PLL operation. This high-level description is suitable for understanding the interfacing of the AudioPLL module without delving into its implementation specifics.",
