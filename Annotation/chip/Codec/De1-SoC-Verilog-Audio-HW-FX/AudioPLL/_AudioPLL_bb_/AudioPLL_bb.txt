Module-level comment: // The AudioPLL module generates an audio-specific clock synchronized with a reference clock. It inputs 'ref_clk_clk' for timing and 'ref_reset_reset' for resetting to known states. Outputs include 'audio_clk_clk' for audio timing and 'reset_source_reset' to ensure synchronous resets in related audio components. The implementation details are abstract in this snippet, focusing on interface definitions without internal signal processing or control logic descriptions.
