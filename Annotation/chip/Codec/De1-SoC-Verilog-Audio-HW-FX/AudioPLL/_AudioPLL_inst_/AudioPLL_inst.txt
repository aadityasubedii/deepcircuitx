Module-level comment: The AudioPLL module functions as a phase-locked loop designed specifically for audio applications, utilizing a reference clock (ref_clk_clk) to generate a synchronized audio-specific clock (audio_clk_clk). It requires an input reset signal (ref_reset_reset) for initialization or operational resets, managing these signals to ensure coherence and reliable audio processing without internal signal details exposed in this snippet.
