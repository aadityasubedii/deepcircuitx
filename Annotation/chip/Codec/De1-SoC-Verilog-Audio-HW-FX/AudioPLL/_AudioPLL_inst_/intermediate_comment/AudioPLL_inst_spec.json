    "spec": "Module name: AudioPLL. Module specification: The AudioPLL module is a phase-locked loop tailored specifically for audio applications, essential in synchronizing systems that process audio signals. This module features two primary input ports: `ref_clk_clk`, serving as the reference clock input that dictates the basic timing for audio signal synchronization, and `ref_reset_reset`, which is used to reset the PLL to a known state as needed during operation. The outputs of the module include `audio_clk_clk`, an audio-specific clock derived from the reference clock to ensure system coherence and smooth audio processing, and `reset_source_reset`, an output reset signal that can be used to reset other system components in sync with the audio clock. Internal signals or deeper internal workings within the `AudioPLL` are abstracted away in the provided code snippet, highlighting primarily the module's interfacing with external components through its ports. The overall structure of the code snippet is simple and oriented towards connecting these input and output ports to appropriate signals in the broader system, emphasizing the module's role as an interface rather than detailing its internal processing architecture.",
