It processes both input and output audio signals through separate channels for left and right audio. The module interacts with external components through various signals including data, clock, and control lines. Specifically, it handles data for digital-to-analog conversion (DAC) and analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), for both left and right audio channels, ensuring synchronized audio operations."
