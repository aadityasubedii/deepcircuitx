    "spec": "Module name: AudioCodec. Module specification: The AudioCodec is a Verilog module designed to interface with audio hardware to manage digital audio data. It processes input and output audio signals for both left and right channels through digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC). The input ports include `to_dac_left_channel_data` and `to_dac_right_channel_data`, which carry digital audio data to be converted to analog; `to_dac_left_channel_valid` and `to_dac_right_channel_valid`, which signal the validity of DAC data; `from_adc_left_channel_ready` and `from_adc_right_channel_ready`, indicating readiness to receive new ADC data; `AUD_ADCDAT` for incoming digitized audio from the ADC; `clk` for synchronization, and `reset` for initializing the module state. Output ports consist of `to_dac_left_channel_ready` and `to_dac_right_channel_ready` showing readiness for more DAC data; `from_adc_left_channel_data` and `from_adc_right_channel_data` which output digital data from ADC; `from_adc_left_channel_valid` and `from_adc_right_channel_valid` indicating the validity of ADC outputs; and `AUD_DACDAT`, `AUD_DACLRCK`, `AUD_ADCLRCK`, and `AUD_BCLK` for DAC data, DAC left/right clock, ADC left/right clock, and bit clock respectively. Internal signals such as `AUD_ADCDAT`, `AUD_ADCLRCK`, `AUD_BCLK`, `AUD_DACDAT`, and `AUD_DACLRCK` are fundamental for data transfer timing and synchronization across DAC and ADC conversions, ensuring coherent audio processing. The code is organized in a manner that links these inputs and outputs through connections specified as `<connected-to-...>` placeholders, suggesting a modular approach where the AudioCodec module integrates into a larger system with defined responsibilities for handling various digital audio processing tasks.",
