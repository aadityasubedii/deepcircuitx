    "module": "Module-level comment: The AudioCodec module interfaces with audio hardware handling digital-to-analog (DAC) and analog-to-digital (ADC) conversions for stereo audio. It accepts digital audio data, validates it, and channels it through DAC for analog output while processing incoming analog signals via ADC to produce digital outputs. Synchronization is maintained using internal signals like clock lines and data-ready indicators, ensuring accurate timing and data coherence across the audio processing channels."
