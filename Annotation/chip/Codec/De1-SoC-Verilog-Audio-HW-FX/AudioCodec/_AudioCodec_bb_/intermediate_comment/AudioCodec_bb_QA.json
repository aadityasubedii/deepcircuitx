There are inputs and outputs for both left and right audio channels. It deals with Digital-to-Analog and Analog-to-Digital conversions, where data is sent to a DAC (left and right channels) and received from an ADC (left and right channels). This module interfaces with audio codec hardware using several signals, including a clock signal (`AUD_BCLK`), a bit stream input (`AUD_ADCDAT`), and a data output (`AUD_DACDAT`). Additionally, the module synchronizes data with left and right clock signals (`AUD_ADCLRCK` and `AUD_DACLRCK`). The reset signal suggests the presence of initialization or synchronous reset functionality."
