    "spec": "Module name: AudioCodec. Module specification: The 'AudioCodec' module is specifically designed to facilitate audio data transmission between a digital audio codec hardware and an audio signal processing system. It handles input and output for both left and right audio channels, performing Digital-to-Analog (DAC) and Analog-to-Digital (ADC) conversions. The input ports include `to_dac_left_channel_data` and `to_dac_right_channel_data` for audio data to the DAC, with accompanying valid signals `to_dac_left_channel_valid` and `to_dac_right_channel_valid`, and ready signals from the ADC in the form of `from_adc_left_channel_ready` and `from_adc_right_channel_ready`. Clock signals like `clk`, `AUD_ADCDAT`, `AUD_ADCLRCK`, `AUD_BCLK`, `AUD_DACLRCK`, and a `reset` port are used to synchronize and reset the module. Output ports consist of `to_dac_left_channel_ready` and `to_dac_right_channel_ready` indicating DAC readiness, `from_adc_left_channel_data` and `from_adc_right_channel_data` providing ADC output data along with their validity signals `from_adc_left_channel_valid` and `from_adc_right_channel_valid`. Additionally, `AUD_DACDAT` outputs the audio bitstream for DACs. The module, as defined, contains no internal signals explicitly, but should include internal wiring and logic to manage data transfer, signal synchronization, DAC data buffering, and ADC data reception based on the detailed port functions described. The module should include various functional blocks to handle DAC data writing, ADC data reading, and overall synchronization and control governed by the clock and reset signals.",

It deals with Digital-to-Analog and Analog-to-Digital conversions, where data is sent to a DAC (left and right channels) and received from an ADC (left and right channels).

Additionally, the module synchronizes data with left and right clock signals (`AUD_ADCLRCK` and `AUD_DACLRCK`).
