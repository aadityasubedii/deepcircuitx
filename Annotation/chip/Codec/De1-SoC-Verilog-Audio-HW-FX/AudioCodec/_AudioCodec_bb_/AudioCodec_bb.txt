Module-level comment: The 'AudioCodec' module interfaces with audio codec hardware, managing audio data for both DAC and ADC across left and right channels. It utilizes input/output ports for data and control signals, including data validity and readiness signals, synchronized by audio clocks (`AUD_BCLK`, `AUD_ADCLRCK`, `AUD_DACLRCK`) and a system clock (`clk`). It handles data buffering, synchronization, and stream direction control, facilitated by a reset mechanism. This module is crucial for achieving real-time audio processing in digital communication systems.
