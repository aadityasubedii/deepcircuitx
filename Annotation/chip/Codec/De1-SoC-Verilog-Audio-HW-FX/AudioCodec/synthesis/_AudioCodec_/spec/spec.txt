Module name: AudioCodec. 
Module specification: The AudioCodec module interfaces with audio codec hardware to handle audio data for playback and recording via DAC and ADC, respectively. It manages the transfer and validation of audio data, synchronizing operations under controlled conditions. The module includes input ports such as 16-bit `to_dac_left_channel_data` and `to_dac_right_channel_data` for sending data to the DAC, boolean `to_dac_left_channel_valid` and `to_dac_right_channel_valid` indicating data validity, boolean `from_adc_left_channel_ready` and `from_adc_right_channel_ready` indicating system readiness to receive data from the ADC, and audio codec signals (`AUD_ADCDAT`, `AUD_ADCLRCK`, `AUD_BCLK`, `AUD_DACLRCK`). The output ports include 16-bit `from_adc_left_channel_data` and `from_adc_right_channel_data` representing received ADC data, boolean `from_adc_left_channel_valid` and `from_adc_right_channel_valid` signaling data validity from ADC, and `AUD_DACDAT` for sending serial audio data to the DAC. The module uses these external signals directly in an instantiation of a sub-module `AudioCodec_audio_0`, which is responsible for the actual data handling and signal processing. The absence of explicitly defined internal signals in the provided code suggests that the significant functions reside within this sub-module. The `AudioCodec` acts essentially as an interface layer, facilitating signal connections between the external environment and the `AudioCodec_audio_0` sub-module, under the synchronization of a clock input `clk` and a reset input `reset`.
