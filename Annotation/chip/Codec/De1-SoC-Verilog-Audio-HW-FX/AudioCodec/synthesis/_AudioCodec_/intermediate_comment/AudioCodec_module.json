    "module": "Module-level comment: The AudioCodec module interfaces with audio codec hardware, managing audio data for DAC playback and ADC recording. It accomplishes this via direct connections to an instantiated sub-module, AudioCodec_audio_0, which performs signal processing and data handling. Input and output ports relay audio data and validity signals, synchronized by the system clock and reset conditions, linking directly to the sub-module for efficient data transfer and validation."
