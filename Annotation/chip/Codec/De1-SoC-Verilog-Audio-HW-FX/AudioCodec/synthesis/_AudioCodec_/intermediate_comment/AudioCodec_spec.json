    "spec": "Module name: AudioCodec. \nModule specification: The AudioCodec module interfaces with audio codec hardware to handle audio data for playback and recording via DAC and ADC, respectively. It manages the transfer and validation of audio data, synchronizing operations under controlled conditions. The module includes input ports such as 16-bit `to_dac_left_channel_data` and `to_dac_right_channel_data` for sending data to the DAC, boolean `to_dac_left_channel_valid` and `to_dac_right_channel_valid` indicating data validity, boolean `from_adc_left_channel_ready` and `from_adc_right_channel_ready` indicating system readiness to receive data from the ADC, and audio codec signals (`AUD_ADCDAT`, `AUD_ADCLRCK`, `AUD_BCLK`, `AUD_DACLRCK`). The output ports include 16-bit `from_adc_left_channel_data` and `from_adc_right_channel_data` representing received ADC data, boolean `from_adc_left_channel_valid` and `from_adc_right_channel_valid` signaling data validity from ADC, and `AUD_DACDAT` for sending serial audio data to the DAC. The module uses these external signals directly in an instantiation of a sub-module `AudioCodec_audio_0`, which is responsible for the actual data handling and signal processing. The absence of explicitly defined internal signals in the provided code suggests that the significant functions reside within this sub-module. The `AudioCodec` acts essentially as an interface layer, facilitating signal connections between the external environment and the `AudioCodec_audio_0` sub-module, under the synchronization of a clock input `clk` and a reset input `reset`.",

AUD_ADCDAT is the serial audio data from the ADC, AUD_ADCLRCK is the left-right clock for the ADC, AUD_BCLK is the bit clock for audio data, and AUD_DACLRCK is the left-right clock for the DAC.\n- reset: A boolean input to reset the module's internal states.\n\nOutput ports:\n- to_dac_left_channel_ready, to_dac_right_channel_ready: These boolean outputs indicate that the module is ready to accept more data for the left and right DACs, respectively.\n- from_adc_left_channel_data, from_adc_right_channel_data: These are 16-bit outputs where the module sends the left and right channel audio data it has received from the ADC.\n- from_adc_left_channel_valid, from_adc_right_channel_valid: These boolean outputs signal when the left and right ADC channel data respectively are valid and ready to be used by the rest of the system.\n- AUD_DACDAT: This output sends the serial audio data to the DAC.\n\nExplanation: \nInput ports mainly handle data validation and readiness signals to ensure synchronized data transfer between the module and the external audio codec. They include data to be sent (to_dac_*_channel_data), validation signals for DAC data inputs (to_dac_*_channel_valid), readiness for receiving ADC data (from_adc_*_channel_ready), and various synchronization-related signals from the codec. The reset signal is essential for initializing or reinitializing the module upon necessity.\nOutput ports primarily provide readiness, data, and validation signals concerning data received from the ADC (from_adc_*_channel_*), along with an output signal for audio data to the DAC (AUD_DACDAT). These outputs ensure the proper transfer and usage of audio data within and outside the module, maintaining continuous audio data play and record functions effectively under synchronized conditions."
