It handles synchronous operations with multiple clock signals, manages FIFO buffers for both audio channels, and tracks data availability and buffer fullness. The deserialization process leverages rising and falling edges of bit clocks and left-right clocks to correctly sample the incoming serialized audio data and to store them into respective FIFO buffers until they are read out. This setup is crucial in digital audio processing systems where separate handling of audio channels is needed."
