Module name: altera_up_audio_in_deserializer. 

Module specification: The 'altera_up_audio_in_deserializer' module is designed to deserialize serialized audio data into separate left and right audio channels. It functions by capturing audio data from a serial input on bit clock edges, using internal shift and control logic to manage the flow of data into dual FIFO buffers designated for the left and right audio channels. Input ports include `clk` and `reset` for fundamental control, `bit_clk_rising_edge`, `bit_clk_falling_edge`, `left_right_clk_rising_edge`, and `left_right_clk_falling_edge` for clock-edge detection, `done_channel_sync` for synchronization acknowledgment, `serial_audio_in_data` as the primary data input, and `read_left_audio_data_en` and `read_right_audio_data_en` to manage FIFO reading operations. Output ports are `left_audio_fifo_read_space` and `right_audio_fifo_read_space` to signal the buffer status, and `left_channel_data` and `right_channel_data` for the separated audio outputs. Internal signals such as `valid_audio_input`, `left_channel_fifo_is_empty`, `right_channel_fifo_is_empty`, `left_channel_fifo_is_full`, `right_channel_fifo_is_full`, `left_channel_fifo_used`, `right_channel_fifo_used`, and `data_in_shift_reg` aid in handling FIFO space management and data flow control. The module incorporates `altera_up_audio_bit_counter` to handle bit counting, `altera_up_sync_fifo Audio_In_Left_Channel_FIFO`, and `altera_up_sync_fifo Audio_In_Right_Channel_FIFO` to manage FIFO operations for each channel. Collectively, these logical blocks and constructs facilitate the deserialization process critical in high-fidelity audio processing systems requiring separate channel handling.
