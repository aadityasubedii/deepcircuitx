    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'altera_up_audio_in_deserializer' module deserializes serialized audio data into separate left and right channel outputs. It leverages synchronized clock signals for edge detection and internal FIFO buffers for each channel, managed by a shift register and bit counters. Control signals and enable inputs govern data capture and buffer management, ensuring efficient and synchronized audio processing."
