Module name: altera_up_audio_bit_counter. 

Module specification: The "altera_up_audio_bit_counter" module is used for audio bit counting, primarily managing transitions and synchronization in stereo audio bit streams. It handles this by decrementing a bit counter on every falling edge of a bit clock, as long as the counter is not zero, and also resets the counter on specific conditions. The input ports include `clk` (main module synchronization clock), `reset` (resets internal states), `bit_clk_rising_edge` and `bit_clk_falling_edge` (for monitoring bit clock transitions), and `left_right_clk_rising_edge` and `left_right_clk_falling_edge` (for detecting synchronization points in stereo data courtesy of left/right channel transitions). The sole output port, `counting`, indicates if the bit counter is actively counting or not. Internally, the module uses `reset_bit_counter`, a signal derived from any edge of the left/right clock, determining when to reset the `bit_counter` to its predefined initial value specified by `BIT_COUNTER_INIT`. The module's logic is primarily governed by two `always` blocks: the first handles the resetting and counting down of `bit_counter` based on clock edges and reset conditions; the second manages the `counting` output to indicate active counting status. Additionally, an `assign` statement manages the logic for `reset_bit_counter`, setting it upon any edge detection on the left/right clock. This module offers clear partitioning between input handling, internal state management, and output signaling, well-designed for tasks requiring synchronous audio data handling and bit manipulation.
