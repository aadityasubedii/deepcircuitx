Module-level comment: The "altera_up_audio_bit_counter" manages an audio bit counter that decrements on bit clock falling edges and resets on left/right clock edges, handling synchronization in stereo audio streams. It features input signals for clock edges and reset, utilizes internal logic for counter management, and outputs a status signal indicating active counting. The implementation is structured around conditional logic in clock-triggered blocks, ensuring precise timing and state transitions.
