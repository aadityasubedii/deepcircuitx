    "spec": "Module name: altera_up_audio_bit_counter. \n\nModule specification: The \"altera_up_audio_bit_counter\" module is used for audio bit counting, primarily managing transitions and synchronization in stereo audio bit streams. It handles this by decrementing a bit counter on every falling edge of a bit clock, as long as the counter is not zero, and also resets the counter on specific conditions. The input ports include `clk` (main module synchronization clock), `reset` (resets internal states), `bit_clk_rising_edge` and `bit_clk_falling_edge` (for monitoring bit clock transitions), and `left_right_clk_rising_edge` and `left_right_clk_falling_edge` (for detecting synchronization points in stereo data courtesy of left/right channel transitions). The sole output port, `counting`, indicates if the bit counter is actively counting or not. Internally, the module uses `reset_bit_counter`, a signal derived from any edge of the left/right clock, determining when to reset the `bit_counter` to its predefined initial value specified by `BIT_COUNTER_INIT`. The module's logic is primarily governed by two `always` blocks: the first handles the resetting and counting down of `bit_counter` based on clock edges and reset conditions; the second manages the `counting` output to indicate active counting status. Additionally, an `assign` statement manages the logic for `reset_bit_counter`, setting it upon any edge detection on the left/right clock. This module offers clear partitioning between input handling, internal state management, and output signaling, well-designed for tasks requiring synchronous audio data handling and bit manipulation.",

Additionally, the counter can be initialized to a predefined value and will decrement on every falling edge of the bit clock unless it's already at zero. The output \"counting\" indicates whether the counter is actively counting or not, and this status is managed based on reset conditions, initialization, or the counter reaching zero.

It synchronizes the operation of the module's internal processes.\n- **reset:** This signal is used to reset the module's internal state. When activated, it sets the bit counter to zero and disables the counting function.\n- **bit_clk_rising_edge:** This signal indicates the rising edge of the bit clock, used in monitoring transitions for synchronization purposes but does not actively affect the state in the given logic.\n- **bit_clk_falling_edge:** It represents the falling edge of the bit clock. This is crucial for decrementing the bit counter as long as the counter is not zero.\n- **left_right_clk_rising_edge:** Indicates the rising edge of the left/right clock, used to reset the bit counter to its initial value, which is a point of synchronization in stereo audio data.\n- **left_right_clk_falling_edge:** Similar to the rising edge, this signal's falling edge is also used to reset the bit counter to its initial value.\n\n**Output ports:** counting.\n**Explanation:**\n- **counting:** This output indicates whether the bit counter is actively counting. It is set to 1 when the counter is reset to its initial value (not zero) and turned off when the bit counter decrements to zero or when the module is reset. This output helps in indicating the active counting state of the module in the audio processing context."

It derives its value from an OR operation between left_right_clk_rising_edge and left_right_clk_falling_edge. Whenever there's a rising or falling edge on the left/right clock, this signal is set to '1', indicating that the bit counter is to be reset, which aligns with synchronization events in the processing of audio data.\n\n- **bit_counter:** This register holds the current count of the bit_counter. It's a 5-bit register initialized to a pre-defined value (BIT_COUNTER_INIT) when reset_bit_counter is active or when the module is initially reset. This counter decrements upon each falling edge of the bit_clk, provided it's not already zero. This is crucial for tracking the position or state in the bit stream particularly relevant for managing audio data bit frames. When the bit_counter reaches zero, it affects the output signal 'counting,' impacting the active counting state."
