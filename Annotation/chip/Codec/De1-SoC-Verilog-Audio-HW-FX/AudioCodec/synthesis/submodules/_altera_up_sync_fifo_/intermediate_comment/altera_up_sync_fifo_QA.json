The FIFO supports basic operations such as write (enqueue) and read (dequeue). Control signals include a clock (`clk`), a reset signal (`reset`), write enable (`write_en`), and read enable (`read_en`). The module interfaces with data lines for input (`write_data`) and output (`read_data`). The FIFO queue provides status outputs indicating whether it is full (`fifo_is_full`), empty (`fifo_is_empty`), and the count of words used (`words_used`). This module uses a parameterized data width (`DW`) and depth (`DATA_DEPTH`) to configure the FIFO size and word size accordingly. The internal implementation leverages a configurable synchronous FIFO component (`scfifo` from the standard library) with specific attributes like output registering and error checking disabled to fit the intended hardware application."

Used to initialize or reset the FIFO's state, clearing all contents.\n- `write_en`: Write enable input. When activated (logic high), it allows data on the `write_data` port to be written into the FIFO.\n- `write_data`: Data input for writing. This bus carries the data to be stored into the FIFO when `write_en` is active.\n- `read_en`: Read enable input. When activated (logic high), it allows data to be read from the FIFO through the `read_data` output.\n\nOutput ports: fifo_is_empty, fifo_is_full, words_used, read_data.\nExplanation:\n- `fifo_is_empty`: FIFO empty status output. Indicates (logic high) when the FIFO is completely empty, meaning no data is available to be read.\n- `fifo_is_full`: FIFO full status output. Indicates (logic high) when the FIFO is completely full, meaning no additional data can be written.\n- `words_used`: FIFO data count output.
