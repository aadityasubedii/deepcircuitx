Module name: altera_up_sync_fifo. Module specification: The `altera_up_sync_fifo` module serves as a synchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) queue designed specifically for use with Altera's Cyclone II FPGA series, facilitating basic operations like enqueue (write) and dequeue (read). This module incorporates input ports for the clock (`clk`) which synchronizes all operations, reset (`reset`) which initializes the FIFO's contents, write enable (`write_en`) that allows data placement into the FIFO, data input (`write_data`), and read enable (`read_en`) which permits data to be read from the FIFO. The outputs include FIFO status signals (`fifo_is_empty`, `fifo_is_full`), the count of words within the FIFO (`words_used`), and data output (`read_data`). The module does not utilize any additional internal signals as all functionalities are handled directly by the `scfifo` component. The core of the module is the instantiation of the `scfifo` component which is configured with parameters like data width, depth, and specific FIFO attributes that are set through `defparam` statements. These settings include disabling output registering and error checking, and adjusting the FIFO to the appropriate specifications for the Cyclone II series and the intended FIFO size and word size.
