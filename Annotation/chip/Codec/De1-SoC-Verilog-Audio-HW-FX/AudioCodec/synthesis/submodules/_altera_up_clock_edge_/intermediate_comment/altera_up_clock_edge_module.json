    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"altera_up_clock_edge\" module detects rising and falling edges of a test clock (`test_clk`) synchronized to a primary clock (`clk`). It utilizes registers `cur_test_clk` and `last_test_clk` to capture and compare `test_clk` states on each `clk` cycle, outputting `rising_edge` and `falling_edge` signals when state changes are detected. This operation ensures edge detection is aligned with the primary clock, enhancing signal synchronization."
