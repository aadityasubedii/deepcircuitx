It stores the current and last state of the test clock signal at each rising edge of the primary clock (`clk`). The module outputs a `rising_edge` signal when a transition from low to high is detected between the last and current test clock states and a `falling_edge` signal when a transition from high to low is detected, both synchronized to the primary clock."
