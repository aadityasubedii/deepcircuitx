Module name: altera_up_clock_edge. Module specification: The "altera_up_clock_edge" module is designed to detect the rising and falling edges of a test clock signal (`test_clk`) relative to a primary clock signal (`clk`). The input ports include `clk`, which is the primary clock signal; `reset`, which is typically used for asynchronous resetting though it's not utilized in the current implementation; and `test_clk`, the test signal whose edge transitions are to be identified. The outputs of the module are `rising_edge` and `falling_edge`, which indicate the detection of a rising and falling edge in `test_clk`, respectively, both synchronized to the `clk`. Internally, the module uses three signals: `found_edge` to indicate any change in the state of `test_clk`; `cur_test_clk`, a register holding the current state of `test_clk` at each rising edge of `clk`; and `last_test_clk`, a register to keep the state of `cur_test_clk` from the previous clock cycle to detect changes. The code consists of two `always` blocks for updating `cur_test_clk` and `last_test_clk` with the state of `test_clk` on each positive edge of `clk`, and `assign` statements where `rising_edge` and `falling_edge` outputs are determined by the presence of an edge and the state of `test_clk`.
