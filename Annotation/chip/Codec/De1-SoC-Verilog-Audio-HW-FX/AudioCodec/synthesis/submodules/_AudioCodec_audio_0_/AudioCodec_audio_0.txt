Module-level comment: The AudioCodec_audio_0 module manages audio data exchange between ADC and DAC, processing and synchronizing audio streams. It uses edge detection mechanisms for clock signals, FIFO buffers for data management, and serializers/deserializers for audio data flow control. This module ensures efficient real-time audio data handling by leveraging rising and falling edge detections of various clocks, and controls data integrity through extensive use of internal synchronization signals and state machines.
