It processes incoming audio data from ADC and outputs the processed data to DAC while ensuring synchronization and data alignment. This module uses edge detection for bit clocks and LR clocks (Left-Right Clocks) provided via external signals to control the read and write operations efficiently. Additionally, it handles channel synchronization, data serialization and deserialization, and FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer space management to facilitate uninterrupted audio data flow between the ADC, system, and DAC."
