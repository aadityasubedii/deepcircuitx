Module-level comment: The 'clock_pll' module in Verilog serves as a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) that generates two clock outputs ('c0', 'c1') from a single clock input ('inclk0'). This module outlines the interface for clock generation, but lacks internal logic in this snippet, indicating that additional definition is needed to fully implement PLL operations and functionalities.
