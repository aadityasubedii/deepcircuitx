Module name: clock_pll. Module specification: The 'clock_pll' module is a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) designed in Verilog, used primarily to generate multiple clock signals from a single clock input. The input port, 'inclk0', acts as the reference clock for the PLL from which the output clocks, 'c0' and 'c1', are derived. These outputs may have different frequencies or phase shifts relative to the input clock, serving to drive diverse parts of a digital system synchronously with varied timing specifications. The provided Verilog code does not define or use any internal signals, nor does it include details of internal blocks or computational elements, as it only includes the module declaration and interface definition. The code essentially outlines the basic interface of the module, highlighting its capability to interface with external signals but not the internal workings or mechanisms of the PLL itself. The absence of any defined internal logic or components in the snippet suggests that additional code or modules would be necessary to implement the actual PLL functionality.
