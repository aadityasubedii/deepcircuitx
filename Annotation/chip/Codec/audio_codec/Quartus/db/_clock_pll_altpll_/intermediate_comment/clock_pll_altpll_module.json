    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"clock_pll_altpll\" module utilizes two PLL instances (generic_pll1 and generic_pll2) to generate and manage multiple clock signals from an input clock `inclk`. It processes these through parameters like frequency and phase settings, providing outputs `clk`, `fbout`, and `locked`. Internal signals and PLL configurations ensure stable and precise clock operations suited for synchronized digital systems."
