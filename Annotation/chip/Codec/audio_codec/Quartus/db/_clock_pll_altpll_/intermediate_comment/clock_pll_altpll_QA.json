It generates multiple clock outputs from given input clock signals. The module utilizes two instances of a generic PLL component (generic_pll1 and generic_pll2) to manipulate the clock signal characteristics such as frequency and phase shift. The module outputs a set of clock signals (clk), a feedback output signal (fbout), and a lock status (locked) which indicates if the PLL has successfully synchronized. The clock signals and feedback are adjusted based on predefined parameters such as duty cycle, output clock frequency, and reference clock frequency specified in each generic PLL instance. The module uses these components to achieve desired clock management for applications requiring precise timing adjustments and stable clock outputs."

The role of this port is to output the manipulated clock signals, suitable for further use in a digital system requiring multiple clock phases or frequencies.\n- 'fbout' is an output port returning a feedback signal from one of the PLLs. This signal is used to monitor the output behavior of the PLL, often for stability control or further synchronization tasks.\n- 'locked' is an output port that signals whether the PLLs are correctly synchronized with the input clocks. A high signal on this port indicates stable and locked operation of the PLLs, crucial for reliable system performance."

It is used internally to provide a feedback path, which helps in stabilizing the PLL's output.\n- `wire_generic_pll1_locked`: This wire signal indicates whether the first PLL (generic_pll1) has successfully locked onto its input clock signal. It is used to monitor the lock status and ensure the output clocks are stable.\n- `wire_generic_pll1_outclk`: This wire signal is the primary clock output from the first PLL (generic_pll1). It forms part of the final clock output `clk` and is critical for delivering a manipulated clock signal as per the specified parameters.\n- `wire_generic_pll2_outclk`: This wire signal is derived from the second PLL (generic_pll2) and contributes to the `clk` output. It is used to provide additional clock outputs to meet specific application needs requiring different clock frequencies or phases.\n- `areset`: This wire signal acts as a reset control for both PLLs. It is set to a constant low (0) which means the PLLs do not undergo a reset after their initial configuration, ensuring continuous operation.\n- `fb_clkin`: This wire functions as an internal routed signal that connects the feedback output clock `wire_generic_pll1_fboutclk` back into the input of the PLLs for further stabilization and adjustment. This feedback loop is crucial for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the PLL outputs."
