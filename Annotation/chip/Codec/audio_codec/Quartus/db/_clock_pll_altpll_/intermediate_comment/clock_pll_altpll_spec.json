    "spec": "Module name: clock_pll_altpll. Module specification: The \"clock_pll_altpll\" is a Verilog module designed for clock signal management using dual instances of phase-locked loops (PLLs), named generic_pll1 and generic_pll2. This module accepts an input clock signal `inclk` (2-bit) which serves as the reference clock for both PLL instances. It outputs a 5-bit clock signal `clk` produced by the PLL instances, a feedback output signal `fbout`, and a lock status signal `locked` indicating successful synchronization of the PLLs. Internally, the module features several wire signals like `wire_generic_pll1_fboutclk` for the feedback clock of generic_pll1, `wire_generic_pll1_locked` for the lock status of generic_pll1, `wire_generic_pll1_outclk` and `wire_generic_pll2_outclk` for the output clocks from respective PLLs, `areset` as a reset control, and `fb_clkin` that routes the feedback clock for internal syncing. The module defines two instances of a generic PLL, with parameters for duty cycle, output and reference clock frequencies, phase shift, and type. The code employs assign statements for setting the reset control to a continuous operation, configuring the output clocks, assigning input to the feedback loop, and setting up the primary feedback and lock status outputs. This dual PLL setup allows for flexible and reliable clock signal management tailored for digital systems requiring precise timing adjustments and stable clock operations.",

It generates multiple clock outputs from given input clock signals. The module utilizes two instances of a generic PLL component (generic_pll1 and generic_pll2) to manipulate the clock signal characteristics such as frequency and phase shift. The module outputs a set of clock signals (clk), a feedback output signal (fbout), and a lock status (locked) which indicates if the PLL has successfully synchronized. The clock signals and feedback are adjusted based on predefined parameters such as duty cycle, output clock frequency, and reference clock frequency specified in each generic PLL instance. The module uses these components to achieve desired clock management for applications requiring precise timing adjustments and stable clock outputs."
