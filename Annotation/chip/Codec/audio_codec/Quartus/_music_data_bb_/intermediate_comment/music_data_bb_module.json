    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"music_data\" module serves as an interface skeleton for music data handling with 17-bit address input and 16-bit data output. It includes conditional tri-state control for the clock signal, possibly for FPGA compatibility. The actual data processing logic is not contained within this template, suggesting integration into a larger system where specific functionality is defined externally."
