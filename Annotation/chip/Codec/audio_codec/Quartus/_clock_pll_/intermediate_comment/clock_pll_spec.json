    "spec": "Module name: clock_pll. Module specification: The \"clock_pll\" is a Verilog module that uses a phase-locked loop (PLL) component to manage and generate clock signals with specific frequencies and characteristics from an input clock signal. It integrates the \"altpll\" component from the Cyclone IV E FPGA library to accept the input clock 'inclk0' and deliver two output clocks 'c0' and 'c1'. The input port, 'inclk0', serves as the primary input clock signal to the module, which is utilized by the PLL to derive the desired output clock frequencies. Output ports include 'c0' and 'c1', with 'c0' drawing from the first bit and 'c1' from the second bit of a 5-bit internal signal generated by the PLL. Internal signals such as 'sub_wire0' through 'sub_wire5' facilitate the transfer and configuration of signals inside the module, with 'sub_wire0' directly connected to 'inclk0' and others like 'sub_wire1' and 'sub_wire3' constructed to organize and manipulate PLL operations strategically. The module comprises defined sections for pin declarations, wire definitions, instantiation of the 'altpll' component, and parameter settings that configure the PLL's behavior such as frequency division, multiplication, and phase shift according to module requirements. This structured approach ensures the PLL accurately meets specified timing parameters for reliable clock signal generation.",

                    "text": "Module name: clock_pll. Module specification: The \"clock_pll\" is a Verilog module that uses a phase-locked loop (PLL) component to manage and generate clock signals with specific frequencies and characteristics from an input clock signal. It integrates the \"altpll\" component from the Cyclone IV E FPGA library to accept the input clock 'inclk0' and deliver two output clocks 'c0' and 'c1'. The input port, 'inclk0', serves as the primary input clock signal to the module, which is utilized by the PLL to derive the desired output clock frequencies. Output ports include 'c0' and 'c1', with 'c0' drawing from the first bit and 'c1' from the second bit of a 5-bit internal signal generated by the PLL. Internal signals such as 'sub_wire0' through 'sub_wire5' facilitate the transfer and configuration of signals inside the module, with 'sub_wire0' directly connected to 'inclk0' and others like 'sub_wire1' and 'sub_wire3' constructed to organize and manipulate PLL operations strategically. The module comprises defined sections for pin declarations, wire definitions, instantiation of the 'altpll' component, and parameter settings that configure the PLL's behavior such as frequency division, multiplication, and phase shift according to module requirements. This structured approach ensures the PLL accurately meets specified timing parameters for reliable clock signal generation."
