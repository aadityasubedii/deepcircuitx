The module accepts an input clock signal 'inclk0' and produces two output clocks 'c0' and 'c1'. The PLL component inside the module is configured to produce these clocks with parameters such as frequency division, multiplication, and phase shift as specified in the module's parameter settings. The module effectively acts as a clock manager to provide stable and configured clock outputs based on the characteristics defined in the design parameters."

The PLL processes the 'inclk0' input signal and produces these two different clock outputs:\n- 'c0' is sourced from the first bit (bit 0) of a 5-bit internal signal generated by the PLL and corresponds to the configuration of frequency and phase shift defined for this output.\n- 'c1' is derived from the second bit (bit 1) of the same 5-bit internal signal and shares similar configurable characteristics, tailored as per different or same requirements as 'c0'. These outputs provide clock signals that can be used by other components or modules in the system that require specific timing characteristics."
