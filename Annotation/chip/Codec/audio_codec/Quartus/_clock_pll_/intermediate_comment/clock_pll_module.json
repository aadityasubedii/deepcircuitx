    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"clock_pll\" module uses a phase-locked loop (PLL) to generate two output clocks from an input clock. It employs the \"altpll\" component of Cyclone IV E FPGA library, mapping 'inclk0' to outputs 'c0' and 'c1' through internal signal processing and configuration. Specific parameters set operational characteristics like frequency and phase, ensuring tailored and stable clock outputs."
