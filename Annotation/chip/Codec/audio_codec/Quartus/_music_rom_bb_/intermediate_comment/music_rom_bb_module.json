    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"music_rom\" module emulates a ROM that outputs data synchronized with a clock input. It utilizes a 14-bit address input to access specific data locations and outputs the retrieved 16-bit data via the `q` port. The code features conditional FPGA-specific configurations and sets the clock's inactive state to high impedance, ensuring compatibility and performance on FPGA devices."
