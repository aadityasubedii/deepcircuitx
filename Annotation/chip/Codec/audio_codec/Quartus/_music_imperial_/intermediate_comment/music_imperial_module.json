    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'music_imperial' module acts as a ROM using Altera's 'altsyncram' component, designed for a Cyclone V FPGA. It outputs 16-bit data ('q') synchronized by a clock input, driven by a 20-bit address input. Internally, it uses a wire 'sub_wire0' to transfer data from the ROM to the output upon each clock cycle, configured primarily for ROM operations with specifics set in the parameters (e.g., initialization with 'vader.mif')."
