    "spec": "Module name: music_imperial. \n\nModule specification: The 'music_imperial' module serves as a ROM (Read-Only Memory), utilizing the 'altsyncram' component from Altera's library, tailored specifically for applications in a Cyclone V FPGA. The primary purpose of this module is to output 16-bit data through the 'q' output port based on a 20-bit input address provided at the 'address' input port. The data output is synchronized by a 'clock' input signal ensuring stable data retrieval. Internally, the module uses a wire named 'sub_wire0' to bridge the fetched data from the ROM component to the output port 'q'. The 'altsyncram' ROM block within the module is configured for a ROM operation mode as described by parameters like 'operation_mode' set to \"ROM\", and references to an initialization file 'vader.mif', potentially holding musical data from the \"Imperial March\" theme. Further parameters specifying device family, operation mode, and data handling characteristics are set to optimize the module's performance for specific implementation requirements. The module neatly encapsulates the process of reading from a ROM memory and providing data output, orchestrated through clear and organized sections within the code that define input/output ports, internal signal mapping, and component configuration.",
