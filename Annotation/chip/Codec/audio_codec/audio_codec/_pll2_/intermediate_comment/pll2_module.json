    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'pll2' module serves as a wrapper for the 'pll2_0002' PLL component, designed to generate synchronized clock outputs from a reference clock. It has input ports for the reference clock ('refclk') and reset ('rst'), and outputs two clock signals ('outclk_0', 'outclk_1') and a lock status ('locked'). The module directly connects these ports to the instantiated 'pll2_0002', facilitating simple integration and usage in larger designs without internal signal processing."
