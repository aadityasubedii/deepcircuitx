It is designed to receive an input reference clock ('refclk') and a reset signal ('rst'). The module outputs two clock signals ('outclk_0' and 'outclk_1') and a 'locked' signal indicating the PLL has successfully synchronized. The primary functionality of this module is to generate stable and synchronized clock outputs based on the input reference clock while handling reset conditions."

When asserted, it resets the internal state of the PLL ensuring that it starts operating from a known state whenever required.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`, `locked`. \nExplanation: \n- `outclk_0`, `outclk_1`: These are the output clock signals generated by the PLL. They are synchronized versions of the input reference clock, potentially at different frequencies or phases as configured in the PLL.\n- `locked`: This is a status signal that indicates whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the reference clock.
