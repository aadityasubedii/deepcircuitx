Module name: pll2. 

Module specification: The 'pll2' module is a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) wrapper designed for generating synchronized clock outputs from an input reference clock. Functionally, it manages the instantiation of the 'pll2_0002' PLL component, effectively passing input signals through and routing output signals back to its own ports. The input ports include 'refclk', the reference clock input which is the basis for the PLL's output clocks, and 'rst', a reset signal that ensures the PLL starts from a known state when asserted. The output ports are 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1', which are the synchronized clocks produced by the PLL, and 'locked', a signal indicating the stable and successful synchronization of the PLL to the reference clock. There are no internal signals used in the 'pll2' module; it acts purely as a conduit by connecting its ports directly to those of the 'pll2_0002' without additional processing. The module consists of a simple structural code block where the 'pll2_0002' component is instantiated and its ports are connected correspondingly to those of the 'pll2' module. This setup simplifies the usage of the PLL component by abstracting its detailed implementation away from the primary design where 'pll2' is used.
