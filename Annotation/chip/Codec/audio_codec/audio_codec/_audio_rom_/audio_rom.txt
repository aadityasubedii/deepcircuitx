Module-level comment: The 'audio_rom' module functions as a ROM for audio data storage, built using the 'altsyncram' component configured for ROM mode in Cyclone V FPGAs. It takes an 18-bit 'address' and a 'clock' signal, outputting 16-bit audio data through 'q'. Internally, 'sub_wire0' links 'altsyncram' output to 'q', ensuring quick data access aligned with the clock. Parameters like 'NONE' for address clear and unregistered output optimize performance.
