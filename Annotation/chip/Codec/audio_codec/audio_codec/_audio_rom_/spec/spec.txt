Module name: audio_rom. Module specification: The 'audio_rom' module is a Read-Only Memory (ROM) specifically designed for audio data storage in FPGA devices, particularly the Cyclone V series. This module leverages the 'altsyncram' component, configured in ROM mode, to serve audio files from "song.mif". The module has two input ports: 'address', an 18-bit signal to select the specific data location within the ROM, and 'clock', a timing signal to synchronize data access. It has a single output port 'q', a 16-bit signal that outputs the audio data stored at the addressed memory location, synchronized to the clock input. Internally, the module employs 'sub_wire0', a 16-bit signal connecting the output of 'altsyncram' ('q_a') to the primary output ('q'). The main body of the code is devoted to implementing the ROM functionality, configuring 'altsyncram_component' parameters such as operating mode, intended device family, address width, data width, and specific ROM properties like access and clear controls to ensure optimized performance for audio storage and retrieval. This setup guarantees efficient and timely access to audio data, bypassing unnecessary delays in data output.
