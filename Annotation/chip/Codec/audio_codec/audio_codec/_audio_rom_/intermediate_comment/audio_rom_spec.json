    "spec": "Module name: audio_rom. Module specification: The 'audio_rom' module is a Read-Only Memory (ROM) specifically designed for audio data storage in FPGA devices, particularly the Cyclone V series. This module leverages the 'altsyncram' component, configured in ROM mode, to serve audio files from \"song.mif\". The module has two input ports: 'address', an 18-bit signal to select the specific data location within the ROM, and 'clock', a timing signal to synchronize data access. It has a single output port 'q', a 16-bit signal that outputs the audio data stored at the addressed memory location, synchronized to the clock input. Internally, the module employs 'sub_wire0', a 16-bit signal connecting the output of 'altsyncram' ('q_a') to the primary output ('q'). The main body of the code is devoted to implementing the ROM functionality, configuring 'altsyncram_component' parameters such as operating mode, intended device family, address width, data width, and specific ROM properties like access and clear controls to ensure optimized performance for audio storage and retrieval. This setup guarantees efficient and timely access to audio data, bypassing unnecessary delays in data output.",

It utilizes the 'altsyncram' component configured primarily in ROM mode to store audio data. The module inputs an address and a clock signal, and it outputs a 16-bit data corresponding to the input address at each clock cycle. The ROM is initialized with audio data from a file named \"song.mif\". This module is optimized for use in Cyclone V FPGA devices and is configured to avoid unnecessary data clear or register operations for faster data access. The data address doesn't have any asynchronous clear, and both the input clock and output data are set to bypass, indicating minimal processing delay."
