    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"song_rom\" module is designed as a read-only memory (ROM) to output data based on a specified 16-bit address. It includes a 16-bit data output synchronized by a clock input. Without detailed internal logic or signals defined, the module is primed for custom memory implementation, ensuring data retrieval aligned with clock cycles, supported by specific settings for Quartus compilation through `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS`."
