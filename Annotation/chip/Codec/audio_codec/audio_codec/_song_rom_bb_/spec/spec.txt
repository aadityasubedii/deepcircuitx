Module name: song_rom. 
Module specification: The "song_rom" module functions as a read-only memory (ROM) setup, designed for storing and providing data output based on a given input address. The module includes three ports: two inputs and one output. The input ports are a 16-bit address (`address`) used for selecting the ROM data location, and a clock signal (`clock`) that governs the timing of data read operations. The output port is a 16-bit output (`q`) delivering the data stored at the specified address, synchronized with the clock signal. The snippet does not specify any internal signals, suggesting that internal state management or temporary storage is either not required or not included. There are provisions (`ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS`) mentioned which serve to maintain specific settings during the Quartus compilation process, particularly concerning the preservation of the clock's tri-state nature. The overall code structure is primarily declarative, with significant areas for further functional definition left unstated within the provided segment.
