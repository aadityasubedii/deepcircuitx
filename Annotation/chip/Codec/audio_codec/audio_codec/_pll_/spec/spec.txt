Module name: pll. 
Module specification: The 'pll' module functions as a phase-locked loop (PLL) configuration wrapper, crucial for setting up multiple clock domains rising from a single reference clock in phase-aligned manner. This Verilog module features two input ports and three output ports. The input ports include `refclk`, the reference clock which forms the base frequency for the PLL, and `rst`, a reset signal that initializes the PLL by resetting its internal state, ensuring output clocks and locked status are set to a known safe state. The output ports are `outclk_0` and `outclk_1`, both generated from the reference clock but potentially at different frequencies or phases, and `locked`, a signal indicating whether the PLL has successfully synchronized to the reference clock. Internally, the module does not utilize any intermediate signals and acts purely as a pass-through entity. The major block in the code is the instantiation of `pll_0002`, directly connecting the moduleâ€™s I/O ports to the equivalent ports of the `pll_0002` instance without additional processing or mediation, thereby demonstrating a straightforward implementation directed at specializing clock synchronization across differing domains.
