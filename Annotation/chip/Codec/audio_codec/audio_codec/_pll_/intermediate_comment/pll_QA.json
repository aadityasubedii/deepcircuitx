The module takes an input reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset signal (`rst`), and it outputs two clock signals (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`) as well as a `locked` signal indicating whether the PLL has successfully synchronized to the input clock frequency. This setup is used typically in systems needing multiple clock domains derived from a single reference clock, ensuring they are phase-aligned."

It serves as the base frequency from which the PLL generates the required output clock frequencies.\n- `rst`: This is the reset input, used to initialize the phase-locked loop. When active, it resets the internal state of the PLL, typically bringing the output clocks to a known state and disengaging the locked signal.\n\nOutput ports: outclk_0, outclk_1, locked.\nExplanation:\n- `outclk_0`: This is one of the output clocks generated by the PLL. It is derived from the reference clock `refclk` and is phase-aligned according to the PLL\u2019s configuration.\n- `outclk_1`: This is another output clock generated by the PLL, similar to `outclk_0` but potentially at a different frequency or phase, depending on the PLL\u2019s configuration and settings.\n- `locked`: This output signal indicates the status of the PLL, specifically whether it has successfully locked to the input reference clock. A high or '1' on this signal typically means the PLL outputs are stable and synchronized to the input clock."
