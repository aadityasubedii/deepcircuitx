This Verilog module features two input ports and three output ports. The input ports include `refclk`, the reference clock which forms the base frequency for the PLL, and `rst`, a reset signal that initializes the PLL by resetting its internal state, ensuring output clocks and locked status are set to a known safe state. The output ports are `outclk_0` and `outclk_1`, both generated from the reference clock but potentially at different frequencies or phases, and `locked`, a signal indicating whether the PLL has successfully synchronized to the reference clock. Internally, the module does not utilize any intermediate signals and acts purely as a pass-through entity. The major block in the code is the instantiation of `pll_0002`, directly connecting the module\u2019s I/O ports to the equivalent ports of the `pll_0002` instance without additional processing or mediation, thereby demonstrating a straightforward implementation directed at specializing clock synchronization across differing domains.",

It serves as the base frequency from which the PLL generates the required output clock frequencies.\n- `rst`: This is the reset input, used to initialize the phase-locked loop. When active, it resets the internal state of the PLL, typically bringing the output clocks to a known state and disengaging the locked signal.\n\nOutput ports: outclk_0, outclk_1, locked.\nExplanation:\n- `outclk_0`: This is one of the output clocks generated by the PLL. It is derived from the reference clock `refclk` and is phase-aligned according to the PLL\u2019s configuration.\n- `outclk_1`: This is another output clock generated by the PLL, similar to `outclk_0` but potentially at a different frequency or phase, depending on the PLL\u2019s configuration and settings.\n- `locked`: This output signal indicates the status of the PLL, specifically whether it has successfully locked to the input reference clock. A high or '1' on this signal typically means the PLL outputs are stable and synchronized to the input clock."
