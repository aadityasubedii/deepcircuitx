It is configured specifically with settings for output clocks outclk_0 and outclk_1 with specific frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles. This module also handles a reset signal and provides a \"locked\" output indicating when the PLL is properly synchronized. The PLL type and subtype are specified as \"General.\" This kind of module is typically used in digital circuits to generate precise clock signals with controlled frequencies derived from a single reference frequency."

It is the fundamental clock from which the output frequencies are derived.\n- rst: This is the reset input signal. When activated (typically active high), it resets the internal state of the PLL, causing it to restart the synchronization process and, effectively, re-initialize.\n\nOutput ports: outclk_0, outclk_1, locked.\nExplanation:\n- outclk_0: This output port generates a clock signal with a frequency configured within the module (specified as 12.288135 MHz). It is one of the modified clock outputs derived from the reference clock.\n- outclk_1: Similar to outclk_0, this output port provides another clock signal with a different configured frequency (2.048022 MHz). It serves as the second output clock frequency derived from the reference clock.\n- locked: This output signal indicates the lock status of the PLL. When the PLL output frequencies are stable and synchronized with the input reference clock, this signal is asserted (typically high), signaling that the PLL is locked and functioning correctly. This is critical for systems relying on stable clock outputs for proper operation."
