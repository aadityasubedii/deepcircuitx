Module-level comment: The 'pll_0002' module is a phase-locked loop (PLL) in Verilog that generates two clock outputs from a single reference clock. It includes 'refclk' (reference clock input), 'rst' (reset), 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1' (configured output clocks at specific frequencies), and 'locked' (lock status). The module configures and instantiates an 'altera_pll_i' component with specified characteristics for output frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles, aligning precisely to required clock synchronization and frequency management needs within digital systems.
