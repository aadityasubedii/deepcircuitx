Module name: pll_0002. 
Module specification: The ‘pll_0002’ module is a Verilog design implementing a phase-locked loop (PLL) which generates two distinct clock frequencies from a singular reference clock input. This module has three input ports: 'refclk' accepting the input reference clock, 'rst' which serves as the reset signal to reinitialize the PLL, and multiple output ports including 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1' that produce clock outputs at specified frequencies of 12.288135 MHz and 2.048022 MHz respectively, alongside 'locked' to indicate the lock status of the PLL. Internally, the module instantiates a PLL component named 'altera_pll_i' with specific parameters such as operational mode, clock frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles for up to 18 outputs - though only two are utilized. This instantiation connects directly to the module's input and output, with no intermediate internal signals. The usage of parameters in 'altera_pll_i' outlines the primary settings for the PLL, such as the number of clocks it handles, types of PLL, defined frequencies, phase and duty characteristics, indicating a structure tailored for scalable clock management in digital systems requiring precise clock synchronization.
