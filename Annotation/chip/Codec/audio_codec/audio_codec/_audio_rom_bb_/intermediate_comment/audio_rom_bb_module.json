    "module": "Module-level comment: The `audio_rom` module handles ROM functionalities in audio applications, using a 16-bit `address` to fetch corresponding data output on `q`. It's synchronized via a `clock` signal, optimized for Altera FPGAs with specific preprocessing directives ensuring proper clock handling. The internal logic and ROM operations details are abstracted in this snippet."
