    "spec": "Module name: audio_rom. Module specification: The `audio_rom` module is designed to manage read-only memory (ROM) functionalities for an audio application, interfacing with a 16-bit address input and a clock signal to output 16-bit data corresponding to the addressed memory location. Specifically, the module has two input ports: 'address' (16-bit width) used for selecting the memory location from which to read data, and 'clock' used for synchronizing the data read operations. The sole output port, 'q' (also 16-bit width), transmits the data fetched from the specified ROM address. Notably, the original code snippet does not demonstrate any internal signals or the implementation specifics of ROM access, such as data storage or retrieval logic. Additionally, the code includes conditional pre-compiler directives for handling synthesis attributes specific to Altera FPGAs, particularly concerning the state of the 'clock' signal (set to 'tri1' indicating a default high state when undriven). These directives might be crucial for FPGA-specific optimizations but do not directly relate to the functional logic of the ROM operations. The absence of visible internal signal processing or other functional blocks in the snippet implies that crucial parts of the ROM's operational logic are abstracted or handled elsewhere in the design. This specification thereby indicates a simplistic view of the module based on the visible interface and external configuration elements, with the underlying functional details encapsulated or not included in the provided code excerpt.",

The module takes a 16-bit address input (`address`) and a clock signal (`clock`) to possibly output a 16-bit data (`q`).

However, crucial parts of the functionality like how the data is mapped, read from memory or how the output is driven based on the address are not visible in the given code snippet.
