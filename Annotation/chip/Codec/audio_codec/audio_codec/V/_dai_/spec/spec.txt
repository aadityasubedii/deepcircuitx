Module name: dai. Module specification: The 'dai' (Digital Audio Interface) module is designed to interface with a DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter), handling clock signal manipulation and data formatting. The module receives input signals: `mclk` (a master clock), `clk_2048` (a specialized clock for internal timing), `reset` (to initialize internal states), and `rom_data` (16-bit data from a ROM). The outputs are: `bclk` (bit clock for DAC), `lrclk` (word clock for DAC), `clk_rom` (ROM clock), `rom_address` (18-bit ROM address), and `output_to_dac` (most significant bit of the shifted data directed to DAC). Internally, the module utilizes `bclk_divider` and `lrclk_divider` to create the `bclk` and `lrclk` from `clk_2048`. A sequence control for the ROM data is managed by `new_sample`, `new_sample_pos`, `new_sample_neg`, and `new_sample_delay`, used to track and trigger data refreshes. `shift_temp` temporarily holds and shifts the incoming ROM data to format it correctly for DAC output. Specific blocks of the module are responsible for clock division, ROM address incrementing, data shifting, and output generation, ensuring the synchronized operation required for audio data processing and DAC interfacing.
