    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'dai' module implements a Digital Audio Interface for DACs, managing clock signals and data formatting. It divides the 'clk_2048' through `bclk_divider` and `lrclk_divider` to generate `bclk` and `lrclk` respectively. Data from `rom_data` is sequentially shifted in `shift_temp` and output to DAC. ROM addressing and data updating are controlled via edge-detected signals `new_sample_pos` and `new_sample_neg`. Clock and reset controls ensure synchronized data processing and system stability."
