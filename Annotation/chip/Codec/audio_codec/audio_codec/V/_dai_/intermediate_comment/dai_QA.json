It takes multiple clock inputs (`mclk`, `clk_2048`) and a reset signal. The module generates bit clock (`bclk`), word clock (`lrclk`), and rom clock (`clk_rom`) signals from the `clk_2048` input. It manages an addressable ROM, incrementing `rom_address` and reading data from `rom_data`. A critical feature is managing the timing and sequencing of data bits streamed to the DAC, controlled by synchronized operation with the clocks and reset conditions. The data is temporarily held and sequentially shifted in `shift_temp`, and finally, the highest bit (bit 15) of this register is sent to the DAC through `output_to_dac`."

It increments on each positive edge of `clk_2048`, and its third bit (`bclk_divider[2]`) is used to produce the `bclk` output.\n- `lrclk_divider`: An 8-bit register that divides the `clk_2048` signal to generate the `lrclk` (word clock) and `clk_rom` (ROM clock). It also increments on each positive edge of `clk_2048`. The bit `lrclk_divider[7]` (inverted) and `lrclk_divider[6]` (inverted) define the `lrclk` and `clk_rom` respectively.\n- `shift_temp`: A 16-bit register used as a temporary storage to hold and shift the audio data bits coming from the `rom_data` input. Data is shifted out towards `output_to_dac` under control of the negative edge of `bclk` or on changes signaled by `new_sample_pos` or `new_sample_neg`.\n- `new_sample`: A single-bit signal used to track updates of `rom_address` and the loading of new data into `shift_temp` from `rom_data`. It toggles its state whenever a new address is accessed or on reset.\n- `new_sample_pos`: A derived signal indicating the positive edge of the transition of `new_sample` (from low to high). Used to trigger the loading of data from `rom_data` into `shift_temp`.\n- `new_sample_neg`: A derived signal indicating the negative edge of the transition of `new_sample` (from high to low). Also used to trigger the loading of data from `rom_data` into `shift_temp`.\n- `new_sample_delay`: A register that delays the `new_sample` signal by one `mclk` period to help generate the `new_sample_pos` and `new_sample_neg` signals, facilitating edge detection."
