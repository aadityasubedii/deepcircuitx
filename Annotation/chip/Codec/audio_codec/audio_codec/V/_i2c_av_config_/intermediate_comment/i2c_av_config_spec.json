    "spec": "Module name: i2c_av_config.  \nModule specification: The `i2c_av_config` module is designed for configuring an I2C device using a sequenced set of predefined settings stored in a lookup table. It utilizes an `i2c_controller` submodule to manage the specifics of I2C communication, including the clock line (`i2c_sclk`), data line (`i2c_sdat`), and data transmission signals. Input ports include `clk`, the clock signal that drives the module's operation, and `reset`, which is used to initialize or reset the module's state. The output port includes `i2c_sclk`, `i2c_sdat` and a 4-bit `status` that reflects the active index of the lookup table, helping monitor the configuration progress. Internal signals such as `i2c_data`, `lut_data`, `lut_index`, `i2c_start`, `i2c_done`, and `i2c_ack` assist in managing the data assembly, indexing through the lookup table, initiating I2C communication, and handling acknowledgments from the I2C slave device. The control flow of the module is managed by a state machine through `control_state`, which controls the sequence of operations, starting transmissions, and handling the completion and acknowledgment of the I2C transactions. The code is clearly sectioned into parts for defining and interfacing with the `i2c_controller` submodule, initial setup and state machine logic to control the sequence of operations based on clock signals and reset conditions.",

It utilizes an I2C controller submodule named i2c_controller to send configuration data to an I2C slave device. The settings are stored in a lookup table (lut_data) and sent in sequence to the slave device. The module controls the data transmission based on certain conditions like the I2C transaction's completion and acknowledgment status, updating the status output with the current index of the lookup table. The operation of the module can be controlled through a reset signal and depends on a clock signal for synchronization."

It serves as the data path to and from the I2C slave device, managed by the `i2c_controller` submodule.\n- `status` is a 4-bit output that reflects the current index of the lookup table (`lut_index`).

It combines a static address (`8'h34`) and the variable content from `lut_data` to form the complete data packet sent to the slave device.\n- `lut_data`: This 16-bit register is used to store one of the preset configuration values from the lookup table based on the current `lut_index`. These values are part of the data sent via the I2C bus.\n- `lut_index`: A 4-bit register that serves as an index to the lookup table. It determines which configuration setting (`lut_data`) is currently being used and updates the `status` output.\n- `i2c_start`: A single bit (boolean) register used to initiate an I2C transfer. When set high (`1'b1`), it signals the `i2c_controller` submodule to begin the data transfer process.\n- `i2c_done`: A wire signal from the `i2c_controller` that indicates the completion of an I2C transaction. It helps in managing the state transitions within the module for sequential data transmissions.\n- `i2c_ack`: A wire signal received from the `i2c_controller` indicating whether the transmitted data was acknowledged by the I2C slave device. This is crucial for error checking and flows control in the configuration process.\n- `control_state`: A 2-bit register representing the current state of the control state machine within the module. It orchestrates the control flow, determining when to start transfers, wait for completion, and handle acknowledgment from the slave device."
