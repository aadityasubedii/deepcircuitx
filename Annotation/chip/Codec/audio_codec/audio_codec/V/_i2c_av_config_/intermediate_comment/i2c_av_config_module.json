    "module": "Module-level comment: The `i2c_av_config` module configures an I2C device using settings from a lookup table. It uses an `i2c_controller` submodule for clock and data line control. Driven by a state machine, it cycles through lookup table indices, managing data transmissions based on clock signals, reset conditions, transaction completions, and acknowledgments from the slave device."
