Module-level comment: The i2c_controller module acts as an I2C master to manage transactions on an I2C bus. It uses input signals 'clk', 'start', and 'i2c_data' to control the I2C clock 'i2c_sclk' and data 'i2c_sdat' lines through a state machine. This machine handles data transmission, acknowledgments, and manages both start and stop conditions. The module outputs 'done' when the transaction completes and 'ack' based on acknowledgment bits received.
