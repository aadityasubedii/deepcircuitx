It manages the I2C clock (i2c_sclk) and data (i2c_sdat) lines based on a 24-bit input data stream (i2c_data). The controller handles the start condition, data transmission in bytes including device address and read/write bits, acknowledgment bit handling after each byte, and a stop condition at the end. The I2C clock generation is controlled by dividing the system clock and the data stages are controlled via a state machine (stage) which progresses upon reaching the calculated clock division. The module sets the `done` output high when all bits are transmitted (stage 29) and sets the `ack` output based on a series of acknowledgment bits received after sending each byte."

It is used as a timing reference for all operations inside the module, including clock division and data transmission sequencing.\n- `start`: This input signal initiates the I2C transaction process when set high. It triggers the resetting of internal states and the commencement of data transmission.\n- `i2c_data`: This 24-bit input contains the data to be transmitted over I2C. This typically includes the device address, the data byte, and the read/write bit.\n\nOutput ports: i2c_sclk, i2c_sdat, done, ack.\nExplanation:\n- `i2c_sclk`: Output I2C serial clock signal that is derived from the system clock through division controlled by the `sclk_divider`. It is essential for timing the data transactions on the I2C bus.\n- `i2c_sdat`: Bidirectional I2C serial data line used to transmit data bits and to receive acknowledgment bits. It is controlled internally by the state machine and varies between input and output modes.\n- `done`: This signal is set high when the transaction process is completed, signifying that all stages have been executed and the module has returned to its initial state (stage 29).\n- `ack`: This output indicates the acknowledgment status from the slave device. It is set high when all acknowledgment bits from transactions (collected after each byte transfer) are high, ensuring successful data transmission to the slave device."

This data is loaded from the input `i2c_data` when a transaction starts.\n- `stage`: This 5-bit register is used to keep track of the transmission stages in the I2C operation. It increments when the clock divider completes its cycle, moving the controller to the next operational stage within the transaction process, up to a total of 30 stages (0 to 29).\n- `sclk_divider`: This 7-bit register is utilized to divide the incoming `clk` signal to generate the I2C clock (`i2c_sclk`). It ensures that the I2C clock operates at a lower frequency than the system clock.\n- `clock_en`: A boolean register that enables or disables the I2C clock signal based on transaction requirements. Used to assert and deassert the I2C clock (`i2c_sclk`) during the initiation and stopping of the I2C operations.\n- `midlow`: A wire that flags when `sclk_divider` is near its halfway point, specifically when it equals 31 (`7'h1f`). It indicates a mid-cycle low point for controlled data transitions on the `i2c_sdat` line.\n- `sdat`: This signal controls the output state of the bidirectional I2C data line `i2c_sdat`. It is manipulated according to data transmission requirements and receives acknowledgments from the slave device.\n- `acks`: A 3-bit register that stores acknowledgment bits after each byte is transmitted to the I2C slave. This register is pivotal in determining the successful transmission of bytes and ultimately affects the `ack` output signal."
