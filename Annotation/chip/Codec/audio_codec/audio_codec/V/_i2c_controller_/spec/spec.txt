Module name: i2c_controller. Module specification: The i2c_controller is a Verilog module designed to facilitate I2C transactions by controlling the I2C clock (i2c_sclk) and data (i2c_sdat) lines as an I2C master. Utilizing the input ports 'clk' for the main clock signal, 'start' to trigger the beginning of a transaction, and a 24-bit 'i2c_data' carrying the address, read/write bit, and actual data, the module efficiently handles communication on an I2C bus. Output ports include 'i2c_sclk', generated through clock signal division, and a bidirectional 'i2c_sdat' for data transfer. Indicative outputs 'done' signals the completion of a transaction, and 'ack' denotes the acknowledgment received from the slave device. Internal signals such as 'data' register to buffer i2c_data, 'stage' for tracking data transfer stages, 'sclk_divider' for frequency division of the main clock, 'clock_en' to toggle clock operation, 'midlow' to indicate a specific division stage, 'sdat' for managing i2c_sdat line state, and 'acks' to store acknowledgment bits are pivotal for operation. The sequence control is implemented through a state machine, cycling through stages to process and transmit each bit, handle acknowledgements, and manage start and stop conditions effectively.
