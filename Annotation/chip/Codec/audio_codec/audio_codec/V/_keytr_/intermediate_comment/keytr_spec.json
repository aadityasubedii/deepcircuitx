    "spec": "Module name: keytr. Module specification: The `keytr` module is designed to create a debounced output from a noisy mechanical key input signal, leveraging a synchronous approach with the clock signal. It utilizes a clock input (`clock`) for synchronizing all operations, including the shift registers and the counter. The `key` input captures the raw signal from the mechanical key, which may contain noise due to bouncing. The output, `KEYON`, provides a negated signal of `q3`, representing the debounced key press state, indicating when the key is pressed (high) or not (low). Internally, the module uses three registers (`q1`, `q2`, `q3`) to store the key signal history over consecutive clock cycles, aiding in noise filtration and debounce logic. The `counter` is a 5-bit register that counts clock cycles, helping delay updates to `q3` until the key signal has stabilized. The `counter_carry` signal detects when the counter reaches its maximum set value (31), triggering necessary updates based on the debounce logic. A `clear` signal, derived from the XOR of `q1` and `q2`, resets the counter when the key's state changes. The Verilog code is segmented into initialization, counter handling, and updating of the shift registers and the debounced output, ensuring efficient and correct debounce operation. This comprehensive design prioritizes noise resilience and stable output for used-critical applications.",

The `key` input is the raw signal from a mechanical key that might contain noise due to bouncing.

This mechanism helps in debouncing the key signal by considering its history.\n- `counter`: This is a 5-bit register used to count the clock cycles. It increments every clock cycle until it reaches a predefined count (`31` in this case) unless reset by the clear signal.\n- `counter_carry`: This is a wire that generates a high signal when the `counter` reaches its maximum value (`31`). This signal is used to control the updating of `q3` to determine the debounced state of the key.\n- `clear`: This wire is a control signal derived from the XOR of `q1` and `q2`. It indicates a state change between two successive clock periods and is used to reset the `counter` to ensure that the counter only completes its cycle when the key input has been stable (unchanged) over consecutive clock cycles."
