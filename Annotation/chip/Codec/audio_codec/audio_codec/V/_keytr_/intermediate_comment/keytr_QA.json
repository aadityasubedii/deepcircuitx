It uses a synchronous approach with the clock signal to debounce the key. This is achieved using a shift register approach (with registers `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`) and a counter. The counter increments on each clock cycle until it reaches a preset value (31), at which point `q3` is updated based on `q2`. The signal `KEYON` is the negation of `q3` and provides the debounced key press state. The module effectively filters out the noise associated with a mechanical key press to provide a clean output indicating whether the key is pressed or not."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports: `clock`, `key`.\nExplanation: The `clock` input provides the timing signal for synchronization of all sequential activities within the module. It is essential for the functioning of the shift registers and the counter, ensuring they update their values at each rising edge of the clock. The `key` input is the raw signal from a mechanical key that might contain noise due to bouncing. This signal is processed and debounced within the module to determine a stable key press state.\n\nOutput ports: `KEYON`.\nExplanation: The `KEYON` output represents the debounced state of the key. It provides a clean indication of whether the key is currently pressed (`KEYON` is high) or not (`KEYON` is low). This signal is derived by inverting `q3` which holds the debounced state. This output is crucial for external modules or components that require a stable and accurate key press signal for further processing."

This mechanism helps in debouncing the key signal by considering its history.\n- `counter`: This is a 5-bit register used to count the clock cycles. It increments every clock cycle until it reaches a predefined count (`31` in this case) unless reset by the clear signal.\n- `counter_carry`: This is a wire that generates a high signal when the `counter` reaches its maximum value (`31`). This signal is used to control the updating of `q3` to determine the debounced state of the key.\n- `clear`: This wire is a control signal derived from the XOR of `q1` and `q2`. It indicates a state change between two successive clock periods and is used to reset the `counter` to ensure that the counter only completes its cycle when the key input has been stable (unchanged) over consecutive clock cycles."
