Module-level comment: The `keytr` module debounces a noisy mechanical key input using a shift register and a counter. It operates by capturing key states at each clock cycle, utilizing internal registers (`q1`, `q2`, `q3`) for temporal storage. A 5-bit counter ensures stability before updating the debounced state (`q3`). The output (`KEYON`) is generated by negating `q3`, reflecting a stable, debounced key press. This mechanism ensures reliability in the face of input noise.
