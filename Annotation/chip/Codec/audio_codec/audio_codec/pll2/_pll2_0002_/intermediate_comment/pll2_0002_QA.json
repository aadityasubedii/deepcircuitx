This PLL module generates two different clock frequencies from a single reference clock input. It takes a reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset signal (`rst`) as inputs and provides two output clocks (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`) along with a `locked` signal. The `locked` signal indicates whether the PLL has successfully synchronized to the reference clock. The PLL settings specify that the first output clock will be at 12.288135 MHz and the second at 2.048022 MHz. This module is primarily used in digital circuit designs for clock management, ensuring different parts of a system can operate at different frequencies derived from a single clock source."

It serves as the basic timing signal around which the PLL operates.\n- `rst` (reset): This input is used to reset the entire PLL module, allowing it to restart its operation and synchronization process. It is typically used during initializations or in error recovery scenarios.\n\nOutput ports: outclk_0, outclk_1, locked.\nExplanation:\n- `outclk_0`: This output port delivers the first clock frequency generated by the PLL, clocked at 12.288135 MHz as specified in the module's configuration. This clock can be used by various parts of the digital system that require this specific frequency.\n- `outclk_1`: This output port provides the second clock frequency derived from the PLL, set at 2.048022 MHz. Similar to `outclk_0`, this frequency can be utilized where needed in the system.\n- `locked`: This output is a status signal that indicates whether the PLL has successfully synchronized to the reference clock (`refclk`). A 'locked' state assures that the output clocks are stable and following the frequencies specified."

This module utilizes the `altera_pll` instantiation directly mapping external ports for its functionality, with no intermediate signal processing or additional internal logic.
