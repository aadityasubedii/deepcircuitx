    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'pll2_0002' module utilizes an 'altera_pll' instance to create a PLL that generates two distinct frequencies from a single reference clock. It accepts a reference clock ('refclk') and a reset ('rst'), producing two outputs ('outclk_0' and 'outclk_1') at specified frequencies, along with a 'locked' status indicator. The implementation directly maps input signals to the PLL inputs and routes PLL outputs to module outputs for effective clock management in digital systems."
