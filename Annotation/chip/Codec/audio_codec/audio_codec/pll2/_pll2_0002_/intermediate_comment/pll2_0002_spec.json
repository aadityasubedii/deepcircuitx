    "spec": "Module name: pll2_0002. Module specification: The 'pll2_0002' is a Verilog module that implements a phase-locked loop (PLL) using the 'altera_pll' instance for generating two distinct clock frequencies from a single reference clock input. The module has two input ports: 'refclk', which provides the primary clock signal for the PLL operation, and 'rst', a reset signal that enables restarting and synchronizing the PLL module typically during initialization or error recovery scenarios. There are three output ports: 'outclk_0' and 'outclk_1' outputting clock frequencies of 12.288135 MHz and 2.048022 MHz respectively, and 'locked', a boolean signal indicating the successful synchronization of the PLL to the 'refclk'. Internally, the module does not define additional signals, but primarily maps these ports directly to the 'altera_pll' instantiation. The key block in the code, specified by a parameterized instance of 'altera_pll', configures various aspects such as the number of output clocks, output frequencies, phase shifts, and duty cycles. The outputs from this instantiation are directly assigned to the module's output ports demonstrating a straightforward routing without intermediate logic or signal manipulation. The setup focuses on clock management for digital systems, facilitating precise frequency provision for different subsystems directly harnessed from a unified clock source.",

This PLL module generates two different clock frequencies from a single reference clock input. It takes a reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset signal (`rst`) as inputs and provides two output clocks (`outclk_0` and `outclk_1`) along with a `locked` signal. The `locked` signal indicates whether the PLL has successfully synchronized to the reference clock. The PLL settings specify that the first output clock will be at 12.288135 MHz and the second at 2.048022 MHz. This module is primarily used in digital circuit designs for clock management, ensuring different parts of a system can operate at different frequencies derived from a single clock source."
