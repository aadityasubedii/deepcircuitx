Module-level comment: The `song_rom` module acts as a ROM, storing and providing pre-defined digital data managed by `altsyncram` configured for ROM use, initialized with "song.mif". It operates with inputs `address` and `clock` for selecting and fetching data, respectively, outputting through `q`. This setup allows fixed data retrieval in digital systems.
