Module name: song_rom.
Module specification: The `song_rom` module is designed to function as a Read-Only Memory (ROM) for storing and retrieving pre-defined data, such as digital song data. This module employs an `altsyncram` component, specifically configured in ROM mode, which is initialized with data from "song.mif". The module takes two input ports: a 16-bit `address` input used to select data from a specific memory address and a `clock` signal that triggers data retrieval processes. The output port `q`, also 16-bits, outputs the data fetched from the specified memory location. An internal wire, `sub_wire0`, acts as an intermediary carrying data from the `altsyncram` output to the `q` output. The code prominently features the configuration and instantiation of the `altsyncram` component, setting it up with parameters such as the operation mode, width, memory size, among others, to function as required for storing and accessing ROM data. The clock signals and additional control lines are configured to ensure optimal integration and operation within a digital system, emphasizing pre-configured, non-volatile storage specific to applications like storing song data in digital format.
