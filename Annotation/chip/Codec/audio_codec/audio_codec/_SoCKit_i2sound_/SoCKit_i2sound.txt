Module-level comment: The `SoCKit_i2sound` module interfaces with audio hardware, managing input/output via digital audio interfaces and I2C communication. It processes audio signals with integral blocks `i2c_av_config` for device configuration, `dai` for audio data management, and `audio_rom` for data storage access. The module uses precise clock signals and control outputs to ensure synchronous audio operations and robust configuration in multimedia applications.
