    "spec": "Module name: SoCKit_i2sound.\n\nModule specification: The `SoCKit_i2sound` module serves to interface with and manage audio hardware components in systems that require digital audio processing, by configuring audio parameters via I2C and handling audio data through a digital audio interface. It receives digital audio input from the ADC through the `AUD_ADCDAT` port and sends out digital audio to the DAC via the `AUD_DACDAT` port. The module also manages several clock and control signals including `AUD_ADCLRCK`, `AUD_BCLK`, and `AUD_DACLRCK` for synchronization, and `AUD_I2C_SCLK`, `AUD_I2C_SDAT` for I2C communication facilitating device configuration. Output signals also include `AUD_MUTE` for audio muting, `AUD_XCK` for external audio processing timing, and `LED` indicators showing system status based on the FPGA logic.\n\nInternally, the module leverages signals like `dai_reset` which aids in resetting the digital audio interface `dai`, and `status` from `i2c_av_config` which influences the `dai_reset` condition. It connects to components such as `i2c_av_config` for setting up audio configuration via I2C, `dai` for managing digital audio data transition, and `audio_rom` for accessing stored audio data, controlled by signals like `clk_rom`, `rom_address`, and `rom_data`.\n\nThe code is structured into significant blocks primarily centered around integration with the `i2c_av_config` handling I2C interface setup, the `dai` as the digital audio interface managing audio output processes, and the `audio_rom` for retrieving pre-stored audio data, ensuring a fully functional audio management system in embedded or multimedia applications. Each block connects through carefully managed input and output signals as well as carefully timed internal signals ensuring robust audio data handling and device configuration.\n",

It connects to an I2C configurable audio device to set parameters and uses a digital audio interface (DAI) module to manage audio data transmission. The module receives digital audio input (`AUD_ADCDAT`) and sends digital audio output (`AUD_DACDAT`). Clocks, resets, and additional signals like BCLK and LRCK (for framing audio data) are managed for synchronization. It integrates with components for audio configuration (`i2c_av_config`), data processing (`dai`), and stored audio data (`audio_rom`). Further, it uses external control signals (`KEY` for mute control and `RESET_n`) and provides system status indicators (`LED`).
