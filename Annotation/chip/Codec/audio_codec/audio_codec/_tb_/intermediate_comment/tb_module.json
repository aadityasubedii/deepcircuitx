    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'tb' module acts as a testbench for the 'SoCKit_i2sound' module, simulating various clocks and a reset sequence to evaluate its reaction to different operational conditions. It uses internal registers for the main clock, specialized audio clocks, and reset signals, toggled in always blocks, alongside sequential control signals in initial blocks to rigorously test the audio module's response to input changes and system commands."
