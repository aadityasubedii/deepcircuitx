    "module": "Module-level comment: The LDPCDECtb is a testbench for the LDPCg5p16codec, ensuring codec reliability by simulating encode-decode cycles. It utilizes input ports like CLK for timing, RESET_N for initialization, and data signals to control encoding phases and noise levels. Outputs track encoding results and verify against expected data. Internally, the module integrates control loops to drive test vectors, conditionally manipulate inputs, and log outputs, enabling comprehensive testing and performance validation of the LDPC codec."
