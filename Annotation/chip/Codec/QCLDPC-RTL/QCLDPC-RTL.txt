The QCLDPC-RTL repository is focused on the implementation and testing of a Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codec for a g5p16 code configuration, encompassing both encoder and decoder mechanisms. The repository includes a principal module that houses the encoder and decoder submodules; the encoder generates parity bits from input data, and the decoder executes iterative decoding to reconstruct the original message from channel data. This core module supports configurable iterations and leverages internal memory for efficient data handling and processing. Additionally, the repository contains two testbenches: one ensuring codec reliability through simulated encode-decode cycles and the other testing the codec by generating random input data, introducing Gaussian noise, and decoding the noisy data to assess performance via metrics like Bit Error Rate (BER) and Raw Bit Error Rate (RBER). These testbenches use an array of memory for data storage and state machines for process control, effectively validating and verifying the functionality and performance of the LDPC codec under various conditions.
