Module name: LDPCg5p16codec. Module specification: This module is a Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) encoder and decoder for a specific code configuration (g5p16). It consists of two main submodules: LDPC_enc for encoding and LDPCDECg5p16v8 for decoding. The module takes inputs such as RESET_N, CLK, start_encode, data_in_tx (16-bit input data for encoding), data_in (48-bit input data for decoding), start_ldpc, start_Ldata, and maxiter (5-bit maximum iteration count). It outputs encoded data (parity_r), decoded bits (hardbit), and various status signals including encode_fin, dec_fin, and dec_fail. Internal signals include encode_fin, parity_r, hb_count
