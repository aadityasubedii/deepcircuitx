    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) encoder and decoder for a g5p16 code configuration. It consists of two main submodules: LDPC_enc for encoding and LDPCDECg5p16v8 for decoding. The encoder generates parity bits from input data, while the decoder performs iterative decoding on channel data to recover the original message. The module manages the encoding and decoding processes, handles data flow between submodules, and provides status signals for completion and success of operations. It supports configurable maximum iterations and uses internal memory blocks for data storage and processing."
