It simulates the encoding and decoding process of LDPC codes, including the addition of Gaussian noise to simulate a noisy channel. The testbench generates random input data, encodes it, adds noise, and then decodes it. It calculates and displays the Bit Error Rate (BER) and Raw Bit Error Rate (RBER) to evaluate the performance of the LDPC codec under different noise conditions. The testbench allows for multiple blocks of data to be processed and supports different noise levels (variance) for testing the robustness of the LDPC codec."
