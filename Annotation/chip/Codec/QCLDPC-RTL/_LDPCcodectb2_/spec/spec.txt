Module name: LDPCDECtb. Module specification: LDPCDECtb is a testbench module for simulating and evaluating the performance of an LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) encoder and decoder. It generates random input data, encodes it, adds Gaussian noise to simulate channel effects, and then decodes the noisy data. The module has input ports for clock (CLK), reset (RESET_N), and control signals (start_ldpc, start_Ldata, start_encode), along with a 16-bit data input (data_b). While there are no explicit output ports, the module calculates and displays performance metrics such as Bit Error Rate (BER) and Raw Bit Error Rate (RBER). Internal signals include data processing signals (data_in, data_in_w, data_in_gn), noise generation signals
