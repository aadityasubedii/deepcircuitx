Module-level comment: This module implements a testbench for an LDPC encoder/decoder. It generates random input data, encodes it, adds Gaussian noise to simulate channel effects, and then decodes the noisy data. The testbench simulates multiple data blocks, calculates Bit Error Rate (BER) and Raw Bit Error Rate (RBER), and allows testing with different noise levels. It uses memory arrays to store input and output data, and implements a state machine to control the encoding, noise addition, and decoding processes.
