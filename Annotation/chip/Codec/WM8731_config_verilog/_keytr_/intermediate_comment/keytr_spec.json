    "spec": "Module name: keytr. \nModule specification: The 'keytr' module is designed to detect the falling edge of a digital signal 'key' and manage output signals based on the signal status and additional input 'key1'. The module uses a clock input 'clock' to synchronize its operations. It features three input ports: 'key' which is monitored for edge transitions, 'key1' which influences internal flag settings, and 'clock' that drives the edge-triggered logic. The output ports include 'ON' (unassigned in the code, thus its behavior is unspecified), 'KEYON' indicating when a set condition related to 'key' is met, and 'counter' which is a 10-bit output used as a delay counter, likely assisting in signal debouncing. Internally, the module utilizes signals such as 'sw', a 4-bit shift register for tracking 'key' transitions; 'flag', 'D1', and 'D2' for managing conditions and synchronization of outputs; 'delay', a 16-bit counter for creating a time threshold; and 'falling_edge' to determine if a falling edge occurred. Sections in the code handle different aspects: one captures the shifting of 'key' into 'sw' based on 'flag' status, another manages the state of 'flag' under various conditions, a third handles the increment or reset of 'delay', and a final section adjusts 'D1' and 'D2' to eventually decide the 'KEYON' output state.",

The internal state is driven by a combination of clock edges and these input signals. The module handles debouncing for the \"key\" input using a delay counter. The outputs, \"KEYON\" and \"ON\" (although ON is not assigned within the provided code and its behavior cannot be discerned directly), seem to depend on the detection of the key's falling edge and the status of \"key1\", respectively.

This register shifts the 'key' input into its storage on each negative clock edge to capture and analyze the edge transitions for the falling edge detection.\n- `flag`: A boolean flag used as a control signal that determines the state of other operations in the module, such as resetting the counter or controlling the logical conditions for enabling the `KEYON` output. It's set or reset based on conditions involving 'key1', a threshold in the 'delay', and the detection of a falling edge of 'key'.\n- `D1`, `D2`: Delayed versions of the `flag` signal, used for synchronization and glitch filtering. D1 captures the state of `flag` at every negative clock edge, and D2 captures the state of D1. These are used in the calculation of the `KEYON` logic output.\n- `delay`: A 16-bit counter used to impose a timing constraint, incrementing on the positive edge of the clock when 'key' is in a specific state (likely low) and resetting otherwise. This counter is vital for enforcing a delay threshold, affecting `flag` status.\n- `falling_edge`: A computed boolean that determines if a falling edge has occurred on the 'key' input by examining the pattern in the `sw` shift register. It checks if the shifted bits match a specific sequence indicative of a high-to-low transition. \n\nThese internal signals collectively support the edge detection, timing, and output control logic of the module."
