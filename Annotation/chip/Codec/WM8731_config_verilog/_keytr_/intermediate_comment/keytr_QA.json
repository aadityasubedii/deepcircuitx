The internal state is driven by a combination of clock edges and these input signals. The module handles debouncing for the \"key\" input using a delay counter. The outputs, \"KEYON\" and \"ON\" (although ON is not assigned within the provided code and its behavior cannot be discerned directly), seem to depend on the detection of the key's falling edge and the status of \"key1\", respectively. The circuit uses a shift register 'sw' to detect the falling edge of the 'key' signal and sets flags accordingly which influence the flag values and the \"KEYON\" output generation, that is designed to reflect changes in the identified conditions."

This register shifts the 'key' input into its storage on each negative clock edge to capture and analyze the edge transitions for the falling edge detection.\n- `flag`: A boolean flag used as a control signal that determines the state of other operations in the module, such as resetting the counter or controlling the logical conditions for enabling the `KEYON` output. It's set or reset based on conditions involving 'key1', a threshold in the 'delay', and the detection of a falling edge of 'key'.\n- `D1`, `D2`: Delayed versions of the `flag` signal, used for synchronization and glitch filtering. D1 captures the state of `flag` at every negative clock edge, and D2 captures the state of D1. These are used in the calculation of the `KEYON` logic output.\n- `delay`: A 16-bit counter used to impose a timing constraint, incrementing on the positive edge of the clock when 'key' is in a specific state (likely low) and resetting otherwise. This counter is vital for enforcing a delay threshold, affecting `flag` status.\n- `falling_edge`: A computed boolean that determines if a falling edge has occurred on the 'key' input by examining the pattern in the `sw` shift register. It checks if the shifted bits match a specific sequence indicative of a high-to-low transition. \n\nThese internal signals collectively support the edge detection, timing, and output control logic of the module."
