    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'top_module' serves as the main controller for audio processing in a digital system. It interfaces with clocks, user inputs, and an audio codec, handling audio data conversion via a shift register and codec configuration through I2C. It uses internal counters to derive slower clocks for audio timing, driving LEDs for status indications and managing audio playback outputs."
