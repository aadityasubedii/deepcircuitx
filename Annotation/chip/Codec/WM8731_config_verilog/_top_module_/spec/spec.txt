Module name: top_module. Module specification: The 'top_module' serves as the primary controller in a digital system, particularly focused on audio functionalities. It processes audio data from an ADC converting it from serial to parallel form using a shift register, drives audio playback through a DAC, and configures an audio codec via I2C. It operates with two main clock inputs, CLOCK_50 and CLOCK_27, and various other controls including keys and switches. The input ports include two clock inputs (CLOCK_50 and CLOCK_27 for timing), KEY (4-bit input for system control such as reset and mode selection), SW (18-bit switch for configuration settings), and audio-related signals (AUD_ADCDAT, AUD_ADCLRCK, and AUD_BCLK for audio data and synchronization). Output ports comprise LED arrays (LEDG and LEDR for status indication), AUD_DACDAT (audio output data), AUD_XCK (additional audio clock), and I2C lines (I2C_SCLK, I2C_SDAT for codec configuration). Internal signals like 'reset' (derived from KEY[0]), 'clock' (linked to CLOCK_50), and 'COUNTER_500', 'CLOCK_500', and 'CLOCK_2' (for generating slower clocks and driving audio clocks) facilitate the module’s function. The code includes a shift register for data conversion, definitions of clock divisions, assignments for DAC output and LED displays, and an I2C configuration block, each orchestrating specific tasks within the module’s overall operation.
