It takes a single-bit input (data_in) and shifts this bit into a 16-bit register (data_out) on each positive edge of the clock, given that the reset is not active. This shifting continues until the counter reaches 15, at which point the register stops updating and sets the 'full' flag to indicate that it is full. The register and counter are reset when the reset signal is active and low."

Every positive edge of the clock triggers the shifting operation.\n- reset: This active-low signal is used to reset the shift register and counter to their initial states. When reset is low, both the data_out and counter are set to zero, and the full flag is cleared.\n- data_in: This is a single-bit input that represents the data being shifted into the register. Each positive clock edge shifts this bit into the least significant bit of the data_out register.\n\nOutput ports: data_out, counter, full.\nExplanation:\n- data_out: This output register holds the shifted-in bits. Its size is parameterized, and in this instance, it has 16 bits (data_size - 1:0).\n- counter: A 4-bit register that counts the number of shifts that have occurred. It increments with each clock cycle until it reaches 15, upon which it stops counting further.\n- full: This is a single-bit flag indicating whether the shift register is full. When the counter reaches 15, the full signal is set to high, indicating that no more data can be shifted in until the module is reset."

It stores the shifting data each time `data_in` is shifted into the register on the rising edge of the clock. Initially, or upon reset, its value is cleared to zero.\n- counter: A 4-bit counter that tracks the number of shifts that have been performed since the last reset or since it began counting. It increments by one on each positive clock edge until it reaches 15, after which it no longer increments.\n- full: A signal used as an indicator or flag. It is set to high ('1') when the counter reaches 15, signaling that the shift register is full and cannot accept any more data until a reset occurs.
