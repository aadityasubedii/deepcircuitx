    "spec": "Module name: ShiftRegister.\nModule specification: The ShiftRegister is a Verilog module designed to function as a shift register with a parameterized 16-bit data width, primarily controlled by a clock and an active-low reset signal. The input ports include 'clock', responsible for timing the shifting operations, 'reset' for resetting the shift register and counter to their initial states, and 'data_in', a single-bit input that gets shifted into the register on each positive edge of the clock. Its output ports are 'data_out', a 16-bit output register that holds the shifted-in data; 'counter', a 4-bit register that counts the number of shift operations, and 'full', a single-bit flag that indicates whether the register is full. Internally, the module uses signals such as 'data_out', 'counter', and 'full' where 'data_out' stores the shifting bits, 'counter' tracks the shifts, and 'full' flags when the counter hits 15, indicating the register's full state. The code is structured into a primary always block, triggered on the rising edge of 'clock' or the falling edge of 'reset'. Within this block, conditional checks manage the resetting of outputs when 'reset' is low, handle the typical shifting and counting when 'reset' is high and the 'counter' is less than 15, and maintain the 'data_out' and 'full' status once the shift register reaches its capacity. This detailed operational structure enables the ShiftRegister to manage data effectively with synchronous control and reset capabilities.",

Every positive edge of the clock triggers the shifting operation.\n- reset: This active-low signal is used to reset the shift register and counter to their initial states. When reset is low, both the data_out and counter are set to zero, and the full flag is cleared.\n- data_in: This is a single-bit input that represents the data being shifted into the register. Each positive clock edge shifts this bit into the least significant bit of the data_out register.\n\nOutput ports: data_out, counter, full.\nExplanation:\n- data_out: This output register holds the shifted-in bits. Its size is parameterized, and in this instance, it has 16 bits (data_size - 1:0).\n- counter: A 4-bit register that counts the number of shifts that have occurred. It increments with each clock cycle until it reaches 15, upon which it stops counting further.\n- full: This is a single-bit flag indicating whether the shift register is full. When the counter reaches 15, the full signal is set to high, indicating that no more data can be shifted in until the module is reset."
