Module name: ShiftRegister.
Module specification: The ShiftRegister is a Verilog module designed to function as a shift register with a parameterized 16-bit data width, primarily controlled by a clock and an active-low reset signal. The input ports include 'clock', responsible for timing the shifting operations, 'reset' for resetting the shift register and counter to their initial states, and 'data_in', a single-bit input that gets shifted into the register on each positive edge of the clock. Its output ports are 'data_out', a 16-bit output register that holds the shifted-in data; 'counter', a 4-bit register that counts the number of shift operations, and 'full', a single-bit flag that indicates whether the register is full. Internally, the module uses signals such as 'data_out', 'counter', and 'full' where 'data_out' stores the shifting bits, 'counter' tracks the shifts, and 'full' flags when the counter hits 15, indicating the register's full state. The code is structured into a primary always block, triggered on the rising edge of 'clock' or the falling edge of 'reset'. Within this block, conditional checks manage the resetting of outputs when 'reset' is low, handle the typical shifting and counting when 'reset' is high and the 'counter' is less than 15, and maintain the 'data_out' and 'full' status once the shift register reaches its capacity. This detailed operational structure enables the ShiftRegister to manage data effectively with synchronous control and reset capabilities.
