Module-level comment: The ShiftRegister module implements a 16-bit shift register with a clock-driven design and an active-low reset. It accepts a single-bit input 'data_in' and stores shifted bits in 'data_out'. The internal 'counter' increments with each clock cycle until it reaches 15, at which point 'full' is set, indicating the register is full. Reset clears 'data_out', 'counter', and 'full' synchronously.
