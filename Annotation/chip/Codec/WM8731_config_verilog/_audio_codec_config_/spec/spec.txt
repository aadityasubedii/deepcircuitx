Module name: audio_codec_config.
Module specification: The 'audio_codec_config' module is responsible for configuring an audio codec via an I2C interface in Verilog. This configuration involves generating and managing clock signals, handling timing counts, and transmitting configuration data to the audio codec. The inputs include a 'clock' for the base timing signal, a 'reset' to initialize states, a 'volume_key' to adjust audio volume, and a 3-bit 'sound_select' to choose audio settings. The output 'I2C_SCLK' represents the serial clock line used in I2C communication, and 'I2C_SDAT' serves as a bidirectional serial data line for I2C interactions. Internally, the module utilizes 'COUNTER_500' for dividing the input clock frequency which drives the 'CLOCK_500' signal used for I2C timing. It also uses 'DATA' to hold the configuration data, 'endI2C' to indicate the end of a transmission, and 'goI2C' to initiate data transmission. The module includes blocks for managing register configurations and handling I2C communications, individually responsible for setting up configuration data and ensuring proper communication over the I2C interface respectively. Additionally, the code ensures synchronization and error handling through defined responses to reset conditions and implementation of the I2C communication protocol with handover signals like 'endI2C' and 'goI2C'.
