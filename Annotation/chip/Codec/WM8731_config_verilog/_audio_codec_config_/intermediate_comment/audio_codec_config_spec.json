    "spec": "Module name: audio_codec_config.\nModule specification: The 'audio_codec_config' module is responsible for configuring an audio codec via an I2C interface in Verilog. This configuration involves generating and managing clock signals, handling timing counts, and transmitting configuration data to the audio codec. The inputs include a 'clock' for the base timing signal, a 'reset' to initialize states, a 'volume_key' to adjust audio volume, and a 3-bit 'sound_select' to choose audio settings. The output 'I2C_SCLK' represents the serial clock line used in I2C communication, and 'I2C_SDAT' serves as a bidirectional serial data line for I2C interactions. Internally, the module utilizes 'COUNTER_500' for dividing the input clock frequency which drives the 'CLOCK_500' signal used for I2C timing. It also uses 'DATA' to hold the configuration data, 'endI2C' to indicate the end of a transmission, and 'goI2C' to initiate data transmission. The module includes blocks for managing register configurations and handling I2C communications, individually responsible for setting up configuration data and ensuring proper communication over the I2C interface respectively. Additionally, the code ensures synchronization and error handling through defined responses to reset conditions and implementation of the I2C communication protocol with handover signals like 'endI2C' and 'goI2C'.",

It increments with each positive edge of the main `clock` signal, and rolls over automatically due to its fixed width.\n- `CLOCK_500`: This signal is derived from the 9th bit of the `COUNTER_500` register. It effectively divides the input clock frequency to produce a slower clock for timing or synchronization specific operations within the module, particularly driving the I2C timing for audio codec configuration.\n- `DATA`: A 24-bit wire that holds the configuration data to be sent via I2C to the audio codec. The composition of this data is configured based on volume and sound selection inputs.\n- `endI2C`: A signal indicating the completion of an I2C transmission cycle. Used to synchronize when the next set of data can be sent or when other related operations can be triggered.\n- `goI2C`: This signal acts as a trigger for initiating data transmission over I2C.
