Module-level comment: The 'audio_codec_config' module configures an audio codec via I2C, using a derived 500 Hz clock from the input 'clock'. It manages volume and sound settings through signals, synchronizing data transfer over I2C with 'COUNTER_500', 'CLOCK_500', and state control signals 'endI2C' and 'goI2C'. This setup facilitates robust codec configuration and communication management.
