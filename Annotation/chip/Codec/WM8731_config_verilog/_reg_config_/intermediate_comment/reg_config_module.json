    "module": "Module-level comment: The `reg_config` module configures sound and volume settings for a digital multimedia system. It processes inputs for volume adjustments and sound selection, using a ROM to store and fetch configuration data dynamically. Outputs are controlled by the address in the ROM and cycle timing managed by `COUNTER_500`. Configuration updates via `RESET` and `END` signals orchestrate address resetting and ROM data preparation, supporting operational flow and updates in real-time sound settings."
