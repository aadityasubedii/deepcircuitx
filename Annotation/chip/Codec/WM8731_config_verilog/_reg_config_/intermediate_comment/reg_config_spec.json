    "spec": "Module name: reg_config. \nModule specification: The `reg_config` module is designed for data and control signal generation in a multimedia system, handling tasks such as sound selection, volume control, and operational timing through synchronous digital logic. It utilizes input ports such as `CLOCK` for timing purposes, `END` to indicate the completion of a cycle or event, `RESET` for initializing system states, `volume_key` for adjusting system volume settings, and `sound_select` for choosing sound configurations. The outputs of this module are `GO`, a control signal to permit data fetching, and `DATA`, a 24-bit line combining a constant and dynamically generated bytes. Internally, the module uses signals like `COUNTER_500` to manage up to 2047 cycles for timing purposes, `ROM` to store configuration data, `DATA_A` for holding ROM data intended for output, and `address` to keep track of the ROM pointers. Signal `vol` tracks volume adjustments, which is used to compute `volume`. `sound_selector` is updated on system reset to map the selected sound configuration. The Verilog code defines behavior for state reset and ROM addressing in blocks triggered by `RESET` and `END`, respectively. Volume adjustment occurs on the positive edge of `volume_key`, while sound selection configuration is updated on the positive edge of `RESET`. The ROM content is modified at every positive edge of `END`, updating based on the current sound settings and volume, and at every clock pulse, the `COUNTER_500` is incremented to manage timing. This structural organization ensures efficient handling of multimedia control signals and configurations.",
