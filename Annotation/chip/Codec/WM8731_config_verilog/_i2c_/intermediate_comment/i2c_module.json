    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'i2c' module serves as an I2C master, handling communications with slave devices by generating clock (SCLK) and data (SDAT) signals. It operates based on input signals CLOCK (timing), I2C_DATA (data to transfer), GO (start signal), W_R (operation mode), and RESET (resets internal states). Outputs include transaction completion (END), acknowledgment status (ACK), and internal states/counters for monitoring operation phases (SD_COUNTER, SDO). The functionality is executed through meticulously controlled state machines in the always blocks, managing clock phases, data bit handling, and acknowledgment processing."
