    "spec": "Module name: i2c. \nModule specification: The 'i2c' module implements an I2C master protocol for communication with I2C slave devices, handling data transfer initiation, serial clock (SCLK), and data signal (SDAT) generation. The module operates with five input ports: CLOCK, I2C_DATA, GO, RESET, and W_R. CLOCK is used for internal timing; I2C_DATA carries the 24-bit data for transmission; GO initiates communication; RESET restores initial settings, and W_R determines the read/write operation mode. The outputs include I2C_SCLK for clock synchronization, I2C_SDAT for data communication, END indicating transaction completion, ACK for acknowledgement status from the slave, SD_COUNTER providing the internal state, and SDO for internal data output usage. Internal signals such as SDO (controlling SDAT line data), SCLK (driving the output clock), SD (storing 24-bit transfer data), SD_COUNTER (managing transaction states), and ACK1, ACK2, ACK3 (handling different stages of acknowledgement) govern the module\u2019s operation. The Verilog code is structured around two always blocks triggered by negative RESET or positive CLOCK edges. These blocks manage state transitions, data sending, and receiving processes, including clock cycles, start and stop conditions, and handling acknowledgment checks after data byte transmissions.",

The module uses the CLOCK input for timing, and it initiates operations when a GO signal is active. It supports both reading and writing operations as determined by the W_R input. The module checks for acknowledgment signals from the slave through the SDAT line. It operates various internal counters and state machines to manage the timing and sequence of communication, including handling start and stop conditions, and sending or receiving data bits and acknowledgment bits.

It operates bidirectionally and is used to send and receive data.\n- **END**: This signal indicates the completion of an I2C transaction. It becomes high once the entire data frame has been sent and all acknowledgments have been received.\n- **ACK**: This signal reflects the acknowledgment status from the slave device. It is an OR combination of ACK1, ACK2, and ACK3, where each represents an acknowledgment at different stages of the communication cycle.\n- **SD_COUNTER**: A 6-bit output representing the state counter of the module, it indicates the current step in the I2C communication process.\n- **SDO**: This is an internal data output used during the I2C communication sequence.

                    "text": "Module name: i2c. \nModule specification: The 'i2c' module implements an I2C master protocol for communication with I2C slave devices, handling data transfer initiation, serial clock (SCLK), and data signal (SDAT) generation. The module operates with five input ports: CLOCK, I2C_DATA, GO, RESET, and W_R. CLOCK is used for internal timing; I2C_DATA carries the 24-bit data for transmission; GO initiates communication; RESET restores initial settings, and W_R determines the read/write operation mode. The outputs include I2C_SCLK for clock synchronization, I2C_SDAT for data communication, END indicating transaction completion, ACK for acknowledgement status from the slave, SD_COUNTER providing the internal state, and SDO for internal data output usage. Internal signals such as SDO (controlling SDAT line data), SCLK (driving the output clock), SD (storing 24-bit transfer data), SD_COUNTER (managing transaction states), and ACK1, ACK2, ACK3 (handling different stages of acknowledgement) govern the module\u2019s operation. The Verilog code is structured around two always blocks triggered by negative RESET or positive CLOCK edges. These blocks manage state transitions, data sending, and receiving processes, including clock cycles, start and stop conditions, and handling acknowledgment checks after data byte transmissions."
