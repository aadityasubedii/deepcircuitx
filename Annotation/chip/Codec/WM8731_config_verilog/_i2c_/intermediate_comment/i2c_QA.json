It handles the generation of the serial clock (SCLK) and serial data (SDAT) signals based on the input data provided. The module uses the CLOCK input for timing, and it initiates operations when a GO signal is active. It supports both reading and writing operations as determined by the W_R input. The module checks for acknowledgment signals from the slave through the SDAT line. It operates various internal counters and state machines to manage the timing and sequence of communication, including handling start and stop conditions, and sending or receiving data bits and acknowledgment bits. The module exposes the END signal to indicate the completion of an I2C operation and ACK to indicate acknowledgment status."

It operates bidirectionally and is used to send and receive data.\n- **END**: This signal indicates the completion of an I2C transaction. It becomes high once the entire data frame has been sent and all acknowledgments have been received.\n- **ACK**: This signal reflects the acknowledgment status from the slave device. It is an OR combination of ACK1, ACK2, and ACK3, where each represents an acknowledgment at different stages of the communication cycle.\n- **SD_COUNTER**: A 6-bit output representing the state counter of the module, it indicates the current step in the I2C communication process.\n- **SDO**: This is an internal data output used during the I2C communication sequence. It's connected to the I2C_SDAT line as part of the data transmission mechanism."

It is used internally to control what data is sent out to the I2C_SDAT line, determining whether data bits or an idle (high-z) condition is presented on the data line.\n- **SCLK**: Serial Clock Output. This signal is internally managed to generate the correct clock phases necessary for driving the I2C protocol on the I2C_SCLK line.\n- **SD**: Serial Data Register. It holds the 24-bit data that is either sent to or received from the slave devices. The bits in this register are sequentially read or written to the SDO pin.\n- **SD_COUNTER**: Serial Data Counter. A 6-bit counter used to control the state machine of the I2C operation, indicating the specific bit of data being handled or the specific phase of the I2C cycle.\n- **ACK1, ACK2, ACK3**: Acknowledgment Signals. These signals are used to capture acknowledgment bits received from the slave device after data bytes are sent. There are three acknowledgment phases in a complete transaction, and each ACKx signal corresponds to one of these phases. The combined result of these registers (ACK = ACK1 | ACK2 | ACK3) indicates the overall acknowledgement status."
