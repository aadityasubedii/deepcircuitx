Module name: i2c. 
Module specification: The 'i2c' module implements an I2C master protocol for communication with I2C slave devices, handling data transfer initiation, serial clock (SCLK), and data signal (SDAT) generation. The module operates with five input ports: CLOCK, I2C_DATA, GO, RESET, and W_R. CLOCK is used for internal timing; I2C_DATA carries the 24-bit data for transmission; GO initiates communication; RESET restores initial settings, and W_R determines the read/write operation mode. The outputs include I2C_SCLK for clock synchronization, I2C_SDAT for data communication, END indicating transaction completion, ACK for acknowledgement status from the slave, SD_COUNTER providing the internal state, and SDO for internal data output usage. Internal signals such as SDO (controlling SDAT line data), SCLK (driving the output clock), SD (storing 24-bit transfer data), SD_COUNTER (managing transaction states), and ACK1, ACK2, ACK3 (handling different stages of acknowledgement) govern the moduleâ€™s operation. The Verilog code is structured around two always blocks triggered by negative RESET or positive CLOCK edges. These blocks manage state transitions, data sending, and receiving processes, including clock cycles, start and stop conditions, and handling acknowledgment checks after data byte transmissions.
