It uses a parameterized data width and address width to define the size and resolution of the ROM. The ROM is populated with data from a file named \"sine_rom.txt\" during initialization. In operation, the module outputs the value stored at a specific address in the ROM whenever there is a positive edge on the clock signal, making it suitable for generating sine waveforms based on the input address."

This address input selects which sine value is output based on the current requirement. 'clk' is another input port, which is a clock signal. The data is output on the positive edge of this clock, thereby synchronizing the data output with the system clock.\n\nOutput ports: q.\nExplanation: 'q' is an output port with a width specified by (DATA_WIDTH-1):0. It is used to output the sine wave data stored at the ROM address specified by the 'addr' input. The output happens at the positive clock edge, ensuring that the data output is updated in a controlled manner synchronized with the clock."
