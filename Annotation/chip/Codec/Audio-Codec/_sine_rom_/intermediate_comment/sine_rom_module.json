    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'sine_rom' module serves as a ROM for storing and outputting sine wave values, suitable for waveform generation. Parameterized by `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDR_WIDTH`, it defines the ROM size and resolution. It involves `addr` for selecting ROM addresses, `clk` to synchronize outputs, and `q` for data output. The `rom` internal register stores sine values loaded from \"sine_rom.txt\" and outputs these on each clock's positive edge, controlled by the `always` block."
