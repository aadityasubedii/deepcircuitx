    "spec": "Module name: sine_rom. Module specification: The 'sine_rom' module functions as a read-only memory (ROM) for storing and outputting sine wave values, tailored for use in generating sine waveforms. It features parameterized input and output widths defined by `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDR_WIDTH` parameters which determine the resolution and size of the ROM. There are two input ports: `addr`, an address bus of width `(ADDR_WIDTH-1):0` which specifies the ROM address from which data should be retrieved; and `clk`, a clock signal which triggers data output on its positive edge. The output port `q` of width `(DATA_WIDTH-1):0` serves to output sine wave data stored at the addressed location upon each positive clock edge. Internally, the module utilizes a register array named `rom`, sized by `[DATA_WIDTH-1:0] [2**ADDR_WIDTH-1:0]`, acting as the memory storage loaded with pre-calculated sine values from a file named \"sine_rom.txt\" using `$readmemh` in the `initial` block. The main operational behavior is defined within an `always` block that updates the output `q` on every positive edge of the clock input, based directly on the current address provided to `addr`. This structured design ensures synchronized and accurate output of sine values suitable for waveform generation based on dynamic address inputs.\n",
