Module name: PLL. 
Module specification: The "PLL" module, acronym for Phase-Locked Loop, is utilized within hardware design for frequency synthesis, clock generation, and clock recovery, by locking on to an input clock signal to produce a stable output clock. The module includes two input ports: `areset` for asynchronously resetting the internal state of the PLL; and `inclk0` that acts as the reference clock for the PLL. It features two output ports: `c0`, which is the output clock signal adjusted from the input reference, and `locked`, an indicator that shows if the PLL has successfully locked onto the input clock, ensuring output stability. The Verilog code does not explicitly declare any internal signals, suggesting that internal complexities such as phase detectors or voltage-controlled oscillators are managed within encapsulated, proprietary modules not visible in this snippet. The code includes conditional compilation blocks around `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS`, likely to address configurations specific to the Quartus synthesis tool used in FPGA designs, although these blocks do not contain active code in the provided snippet. The module sets `areset` to a weak pull-down state (`tri0`) unless overridden by `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS` settings. This setup implies a design tailored for integration with specific toolchain features or constraints.
