Module-level comment: The "PLL" module is a Phase-Locked Loop used for generating a stable output clock from an input reference clock. It features asynchronous reset (`areset`) and input clock (`inclk0`) ports, with outputs `c0` (adjusted clock) and `locked` (lock indicator). Implementation details are abstracted, hinting at reliance on proprietary setups, with conditional setups for specific synthesis tool configurations.
