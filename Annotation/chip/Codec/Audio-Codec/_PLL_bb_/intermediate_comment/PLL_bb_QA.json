The code specifies a basic structure for a PLL component with inputs for asynchronous reset (`areset`) and an input clock (`inclk0`). It also generates outputs `c0` and `locked`. `areset` is set to weak (tri-stateable) pull-down (`tri0`) when not defined under `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS`. However, specific functional behavior or internal architecture is not defined within this snippet, suggesting the real implementation or behavior of the PLL is defined elsewhere or in another configuration-specific file. Additionally, there are conditional compilation blocks related to `ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS` which might be used for handling Quartus synthesis tool specific setups or constraints."

It is used to reset the internal state of the PLL, ensuring it starts from a known state. Typically, this input is activated (set to a logic high) to reset the module.  \n- `inclk0`: This is the input clock for the PLL. It serves as the reference clock that the PLL will lock onto and use to generate the output clocks.\n\nOutput ports: `c0`, `locked`.  \nExplanation:  \n- `c0`: This is an output clock signal generated by the PLL. It is typically a manipulated version of the input clock `inclk0`, adjusted to meet certain system specifications or requirements.\n- `locked`: This output indicates whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the input clock signal. When `locked` is high (logic level 1), it indicates that the PLL's output is stable and tracking the input clock accurately. This signal is crucial for systems that depend on stable clock signals for correct operation."
