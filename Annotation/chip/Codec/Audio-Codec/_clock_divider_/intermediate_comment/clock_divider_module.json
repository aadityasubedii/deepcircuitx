    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'Clock_divider' module reduces the frequency of an input clock, 'clock_in', to produce a lower frequency output 'clock_out'. It utilizes a 28-bit counter which increments every positive edge of 'clock_in' and resets upon reaching 'DIVISOR-1'. The output, 'clock_out', toggles after half the period of 'DIVISOR', essentially dividing the clock frequency by the value of 'DIVISOR'."
