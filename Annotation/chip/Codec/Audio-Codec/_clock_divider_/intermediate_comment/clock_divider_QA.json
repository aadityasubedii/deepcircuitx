It utilizes a parameter 'DIVISOR' to set the frequency division ratio. Internally, it increments a counter every positive edge of 'clock_in'. When the counter exceeds the value of 'DIVISOR' minus one, it resets the counter to zero. The output 'clock_out' is toggled at half the period defined by 'DIVISOR', thereby outputting a clock signal at a reduced frequency."
