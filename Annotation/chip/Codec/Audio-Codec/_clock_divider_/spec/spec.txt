Module name: Clock_divider. Module specification: The 'Clock_divider' is a Verilog module that reduces the frequency of an input clock signal, 'clock_in', and outputs a modified clock signal, 'clock_out', at a lower frequency. The input port 'clock_in' captures the primary clock signal, while the output port 'clock_out' delivers the frequency-divided clock signal. A 28-bit register named 'counter' is used internally to count the number of clock cycles of 'clock_in'. It increments on each positive edge of 'clock_in' and resets when the count reaches 'DIVISOR-1'. The parameter 'DIVISOR' sets the division factor for the frequency reduction. The output signal 'clock_out' is toggled based on the comparison of the 'counter' with half the value of 'DIVISOR', resulting in a divided frequency output. The code mainly comprises an 'always' block that handles the counting and resetting of 'counter', and a continuous assignment that determines the state of 'clock_out' based on the count relative to 'DIVISOR'.
