Module name: PLL. 

Module specification: The PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) module is responsible for generating a stable output clock (c0) that is phase-locked to an input clock (inclk0). Additionally, it provides a signal (locked) to indicate when the output clock is stable and synchronized with the input clock. The essential input ports include 'areset' for an asynchronous reset, and 'inclk0' for the input clock. The output ports are 'c0' for the output clock and 'locked' which signifies the locking status of the PLL. Internally, the module employs several signals such as 'sub_wire0' to 'sub_wire5' which help in connecting and configuring the internal altpll_component, the primary component used for PLL functionality. This component is extensively parameterized to adjust various operational characteristics such as frequency, phase shift, and duty cycle. Key sections in the Verilog code include the instantiation and configuration of the altpll_component, definition of input and output connections, and parameter settings for the PLL behavior tailored to specific requirements. These configurations ensure that the PLL can meet precise timing and frequency requirements essential in digital communication and processing systems.
