It also provides a signal (`locked`) indicating when the output clock is stable and locked to the input. The module uses instantiation of an `altpll_component`, a standard component typically used in Altera FPGA designs, which is highly configurable through various parameters to adjust the PLL's operating characteristics such as input frequency, output phase shift, and duty cycle. The PLL ensures the output clock meets specific timing requirements relative to the input clock, which is crucial in digital communication and processing systems."

It is used to reset the internal state of the PLL to a known state, typically upon the startup of the system or when a reset condition is needed externally. \n- `inclk0`: This is the input clock port. It feeds the input clock signal into the PLL from which the PLL generates a stable output clock.\n\nOutput ports: `c0, locked`.\nExplanation: \n- `c0`: This is the output clock port. The PLL module generates this clock, which is phase-locked to the input clock `inclk0`. It is used as the stable clock signal output from the PLL.\n- `locked`: This output signal indicates whether the PLL has successfully synchronized its output clock `c0` to the input clock `inclk0`.

It is used to distribute the various clock outputs generated by the PLL.\n- `sub_wire1`: Derived from `sub_wire0`, specifically `sub_wire0[0:0]`, it is a singular bit wire.

It carries the locked status of the PLL.\n- `sub_wire3`: This signal directly carries the state of the `inclk0` input port into the `altpll_component`, used specifically to designate the input clock source for the PLL.\n- `sub_wire4`: This 2-bit wire combines `sub_wire5` and `sub_wire3` and is used to configure the `inclk` input of the `altpll_component`. The first bit comes from `inclk0`, whereas the second bit (`sub_wire5`) is held at logic zero, serving as an unused or auxiliary clock input that remains unconnected or inactive.\n- `sub_wire5`: This is a constant wire set to `1'h0` (logic zero) and forms part of `sub_wire4`.
