    "spec": "Module name: CLOCK_500. Module specification: The CLOCK_500 module is designed to generate a sub-frequency clock signal and manipulate data retrieved from a ROM based on input conditions. It accepts three input ports: CLOCK, which is the primary timing signal; END, which controls data processing and address incrementation; and RESET, an active-low signal that resets internal conditions. The outputs include CLOCK_500, a derived clock signal toggling at a frequency controlled by the CLOCK input; DATA, a 24-bit signal constituted of constant and ROM data; and GO, which signifies operational status subject to conditional logic. Internally, the module utilizes a COUNTER_500 register for clock division and conditional logic, a ROM array for data storage, DATA_A register to hold ROM data, and an address register to navigate ROM entries. It also contains experimental signals vol and volume, likely for undefined additional functionalities. The code is structured into several procedural blocks: one handling the negative edge of RESET and positive edge of END for address manipulation, another at the positive edge of RESET adjusting the vol register, one at each positive edge of END to update ROM data and DATA_A, and a final block responsive to the CLOCK's positive edge to increment COUNTER_500. This structured approach ensures synchronization of output signals and internal state based on the logic designed around the CLOCK and control signals.",

It utilizes a counter to derive a CLOCK_500 signal which toggles at a sub-frequency of the main CLOCK. The module interacts with a ROM (Read-Only Memory) where specific data values are predefined and are read based on the address which increments upon END signal going high, until a predefined size (`rom_size). The module outputs a 24-bit DATA signal constructed from a constant and contents of the ROM indexed by address. Another output, GO, is conditionally set based on the address and the END signal. The module also has a reset functionality that sets the address to zero when the RESET signal is low. Further behavior modification happens at the positive edge of the CLOCK, which includes incrementing the COUNTER_500, and at a positive transition of RESET and END."

When the END signal is high, it enables the increment of the address register and the data update from ROM.\n- RESET: This active-low signal is used to reset the internal state, particularly setting the address counter to zero. It initializes or clears certain conditions upon being activated.\n\nOutput ports: CLOCK_500, DATA, GO.\nExplanation:\n- CLOCK_500: This is a derived clock output which toggles at a sub-frequency of the main CLOCK input, specifically controlled by the 10th bit of the COUNTER_500 register.\n- DATA: This 24-bit output is formed by concatenating a fixed 8-bit value and 16 bits fetched from a ROM addressed by a dynamic counter. This signal represents the data read from ROM combined with a constant.\n- GO: This output signal is controlled conditionally; it remains high by default but can represent the status of the COUNTER_500[10] depending on the value of the address in relation to `rom_size` and whether the END signal is high.
