    "module": "Module-level comment: The CLOCK_500 is a Verilog module that generates a sub-frequency CLOCK_500 output and manages data interactions from a ROM based on input signals CLOCK, END, and RESET. It employs a divider (COUNTER_500) to generate the CLOCK_500 signal, uses an address register to access pre-defined ROM values, and controls output signal GO based on conditional checks involving END and address counter. The module incorporates a reset mechanism on RESET and address increment on END to facilitate sequential ROM access and data output generation, aligning outputs with the main CLOCK signal for synchronized operations."
