Module name: CLOCK_500. Module specification: The CLOCK_500 module is designed to generate a sub-frequency clock signal and manipulate data retrieved from a ROM based on input conditions. It accepts three input ports: CLOCK, which is the primary timing signal; END, which controls data processing and address incrementation; and RESET, an active-low signal that resets internal conditions. The outputs include CLOCK_500, a derived clock signal toggling at a frequency controlled by the CLOCK input; DATA, a 24-bit signal constituted of constant and ROM data; and GO, which signifies operational status subject to conditional logic. Internally, the module utilizes a COUNTER_500 register for clock division and conditional logic, a ROM array for data storage, DATA_A register to hold ROM data, and an address register to navigate ROM entries. It also contains experimental signals vol and volume, likely for undefined additional functionalities. The code is structured into several procedural blocks: one handling the negative edge of RESET and positive edge of END for address manipulation, another at the positive edge of RESET adjusting the vol register, one at each positive edge of END to update ROM data and DATA_A, and a final block responsive to the CLOCK's positive edge to increment COUNTER_500. This structured approach ensures synchronization of output signals and internal state based on the logic designed around the CLOCK and control signals.
