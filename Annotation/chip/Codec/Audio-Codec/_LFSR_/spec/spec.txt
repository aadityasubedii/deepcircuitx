Module name: LFSR. Module specification: The LFSR module implements a Linear Feedback Shift Register which generates pseudo-random sequences based on the given bit width specified by the NUM_BITS parameter. The module includes several input ports: i_Clk (the clock signal that controls the operations within the LFSR based on clock edges), i_Enable (which, when set, activates the LFSR operations), i_Seed_DV (a signal that, when asserted, allows the LFSR to load an initial seed value from i_Seed_Data), and i_Seed_Data (the initial seed data loaded into the LFSR when i_Seed_DV is high). The outputs of the module are o_LFSR_Data (reflecting the current data held in the shift register) and o_LFSR_Done (indicating when the LFSR data matches the initial seed data). Internally, the module utilizes r_LFSR (a register holding the current state of the LFSR) and r_XNOR (a signal that computes the feedback bit based on the NUM_BITS configuration using XOR and XNOR operations on selected bits of r_LFSR). The primary blocks of the code include the always block triggered on the positive edge of i_Clk, which handles the data shifting and seed loading operations, and another always block which is sensitive to changes in any input or internal signal and manages the calculation of the feedback bit using case statements for various NUM_BITS configurations. The module also includes continuous assignments that set the values of o_LFSR_Data and o_LFSR_Done based on the current state of r_LFSR and the comparisons to i_Seed_Data.
