Module-level comment: The LFSR module generates pseudo-random sequences using a Linear Feedback Shift Register with configurable bit width (NUM_BITS). It updates on every positive clock edge (i_Clk), using i_Enable for operation activation. When i_Seed_DV is high, i_Seed_Data initializes r_LFSR; otherwise, the module shifts r_LFSR and calculates feedback with r_XNOR based on NUM_BITS-specific polynomial taps. Outputs include the current LFSR value (o_LFSR_Data) and a completion signal (o_LFSR_Done) indicating a match with the initial seed.
