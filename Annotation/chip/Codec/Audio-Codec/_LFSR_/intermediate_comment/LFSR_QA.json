This specific LFSR configuration allows variable bit widths, controlled by the `NUM_BITS` parameter. The module operates based on clock cycles (`i_Clk`). When enabled (`i_Enable`), the LFSR can be seeded with an initial value (`i_Seed_Data`) if a data valid signal (`i_Seed_DV`) is asserted; otherwise, it continuously shifts its bits and computes a new bit from a feedback function determined by the `NUM_BITS` parameter. The shift register's output (`o_LFSR_Data`) and a completion signal (`o_LFSR_Done` which indicates when the output matches the seed data) are provided as outputs."
