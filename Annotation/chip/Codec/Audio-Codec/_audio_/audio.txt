Module-level comment: The 'audio' module processes digital audio data, handling both input and output streams via I2S protocol. Employing internal clocks, I2C for control, and overdrive for effects, it interfaces with external hardware for synchronization and control. The module also integrates display outputs for real-time status using 7-segment displays, efficiently managing operations via subdivided functional blocks for clock control, data transfer, audio processing, and display management.
