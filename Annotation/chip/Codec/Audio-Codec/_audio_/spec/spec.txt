Module name: audio. 

Module specification: The 'audio' module is designed to process digital audio signals by managing both input and output data streams, interfacing with ancillary components and utilizing various sub-modules for expanded functionality. The module uses the primary system clock (`clk`) and specialized clocks (`BCLK`, `ADCLRC`, `DACLRC`) for managing timing in audio processing, particularly using I2S protocol for audio data communication. The incoming digital audio data (`ADCDAT`) is processed and subsequently sent out through `DACDAT`. Control signals like `start_in` are used to initiate certain operations within the module. For external communication with control devices, I2C protocol is employed, signaled through `I2C_SCLK` for clock and `I2C_SDAT` for data, managed internally by signals like `i2c_clk`, `i2c_end`, and `i2c_go`. Audio data for both left and right channels are processed and can be delayed or affected by effects, as shown in signals like `left_data`, `right_data`, `left_data_delay`, and `right_data_delay`. Additional functions include clock division (`div_clk`), generating an audio-specific clock (`audio_clk`), and status indication through 7-segment displays (`display1`, `display2`, `display3`, `display4`) controlled by BCD-encoded signals (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`). The computer architecture is divided into functional blocks handling specific tasks: clock management (`CLOCK_500`, `Clock_divider`, `audio_clk` module), data communication (`i2c` interface, `in_i2s`, `out_i2s`), audio processing (`overdrive` effect), and display management (`dado_bcd`, `Display`). This structured approach ensures efficient audio processing and status monitoring in real-time.
