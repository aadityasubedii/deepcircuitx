Module-level comment: The "tremolo" module processes stereo audio signals by applying a tremolo effect via amplitude modulation. It utilizes a sine wave generated by an internal 'sine_generator' block, multiplying this with the input audio signals for both channels. The modulation depth is adjusted using a signed extension of the sine wave, and the final modulated audio is outputted after appropriate scaling. This module features debug outputs for real-time sine wave monitoring.
