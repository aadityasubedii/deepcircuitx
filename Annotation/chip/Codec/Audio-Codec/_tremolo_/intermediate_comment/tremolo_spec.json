    "spec": "Module name: tremolo. Module specification: The \"tremolo\" module applies an audio modulation effect known as tremolo to stereo audio inputs. This effect is achieved by modulating the amplitude of incoming audio signals with an internally generated sine wave which modulates both left and right audio channels independently. The module takes three inputs: 'clk', which is the clock signal that coordinates the sequencing of operations within the module; 'audio_right_in' and 'audio_left_in', which are the input audio streams for the right and left channels respectively. It outputs three signals: 'audio_right_out' and 'audio_left_out', which are the processed audio streams for the right and left channels, and 'debug', which helps monitor the sine wave values used in the modulation process. Internally, the module utilizes 'sine', a 16-bit unsigned wire from a sine_generator instance that holds the sine wave data. This sine is converted to a 17-bit signed wire 'signed_sine' by zero-padding at the most significant bit for correct arithmetic interactions with the signed audio inputs. The products of the signed_sine with each audio input are captured by 'mult_results_right' and 'mult_results_left', both being 43-bit signed wires, which are then scaled down to the original audio signal width in the outputs. The module integrates a 'sine_generator' sub-block, set with a specific frequency control word, to produce the sine wave. Finally, the scaling and updating of the processed audio signals are managed in an 'always' block triggered on the negative edge of the clock, effectuating the audio output assignments with appropriate bit shifts.",
