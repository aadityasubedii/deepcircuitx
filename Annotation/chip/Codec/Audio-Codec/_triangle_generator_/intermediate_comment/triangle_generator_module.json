    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"triangle_generator\" module creates a triangle waveform using DDS technique, synchronized by a clock (`clk`) and controlled by a frequency control word (`fcw`). The module employs an internal 24-bit `accumulator` that increments by `fcw` each clock cycle. The output `triangle_wave` reflects increasing or decreasing values based on the most significant bit of the `accumulator`, producing the triangular shape by conditional alteration between the direct mapping and subtractive transformation of accumulator bits."
