It takes a clock signal 'clk' and a frequency control word 'fcw' as inputs. The module outputs a triangle wave with a resolution defined by the `DATA_WIDTH` parameter. Inside the module, there is an accumulator that increments by the value of `fcw` with every rising edge of the clock. The output triangle waveform `triangle_wave` is derived by checking the most significant bit (MSB) of the accumulator. If the MSB is 0, it directly maps the next significant bits to the output; if the MSB is 1, indicating a negative slope, it subtracts those bits from the maximum possible value defined by `DATA_WIDTH`. This produces a triangle waveform by a linear increase and decrease in output values."
