Module name: triangle_generator. 
Module specification: The "triangle_generator" module utilizes a Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) technique to generate a triangle waveform, defined and parameterized by a `DATA_WIDTH`. This Verilog module operates based on an input clock signal `clk` and a frequency control word `fcw`. The `clk` input synchronizes the generation of the output waveform, while the 24-bit `fcw` determines the frequency of the triangle wave by controlling the incrementation rate of the internal `accumulator`. The output of the module is the `triangle_wave` signal, whose width is determined by `DATA_WIDTH`, delivering the resultant waveform. Internally, the key signal is the `accumulator`, a 24-bit register that increments on every positive clock edge by the value of `fcw`. The value in `accumulator` directly influences the waveform output: depending on the most significant bit (MSB) of `accumulator`, the module decides between an incrementing or decrementing output pattern to generate the ascending and descending slopes of the triangle waveform. The module includes a conditional assignment statement for `triangle_wave`, which decisively subtracts the relevant accumulator bits from a maximum possible value based on `DATA_WIDTH` when the MSB is high (1), reflecting the descending part of the triangle wave. The primary block of the code, governed by the `always @(posedge clk)` statement, facilitates the periodic update of the `accumulator` which ensures continual generation of the waveform as long as the module receives the clock input.
