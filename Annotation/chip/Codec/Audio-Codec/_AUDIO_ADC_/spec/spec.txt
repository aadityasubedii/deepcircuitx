Module name: AUDIO_ADC. 
Module specification: The AUDIO_ADC module is designed for interfacing and capturing audio data from an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). The module processes serial data input (adcdat) using a bit clock (bclk) and a left/right channel select signal (adclrc). It manages two audio channels, storing the digitally converted audio data into a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffer. The module operates mainly on two input clocks: `bclk` for bit-wise ADC data operations and `clk` for FIFO read operations. The input ports include `clk` (clock for FIFO reads), `reset` (resets internal states), `read` (trigger for FIFO data read), `bclk` (ADC data capture clock), `adclrc` (channel select), `adcdat` (serial audio data), and `clear` (clears FIFO independently). The output ports comprise `readdata` (audio data fetched from FIFO), and `empty` (indicates FIFO is empty). Internal signals such as `bit_index` (tracks bit position within a data word), `valid_bit` (controls data capturing), `reg_adc_left` (indicates the current channel being processed), `reg_adc_serial_data` (holds parallel-converted ADC data), `adcfifo_writedata` (data intended for FIFO write), `adcfifo_write` (write-enable for FIFO), `wait_one_clk` (delays operations by a clock cycle to stabilize channel switching), adcfifo_full (indicates FIFO fullness), and `is_left_ch` (derives channel status from adclrc) assist in handling data correctly. The module is divided into key sections: the ADC data capturing and processing block controlled by `bclk` which fetches and organizes serial data into complete samples, and the FIFO interaction block which involves writing to and reading from the FIFO as per FIFO and clock signals, managed by a submodule `audio_fifo` thus allowing asynchronous data transfers suitable for real-time audio applications.
