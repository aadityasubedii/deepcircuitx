Module-level comment: The AUDIO_ADC module interfaces with an audio ADC to sample and process serial audio data. It captures data via `bclk` and `adclrc`, organizing it into a FIFO for asynchronous access. Utilizing internal controls like `bit_index` and `valid_bit`, it distinguishes channel data, handles channel transitions, and manages FIFO operations effectively, ensuring data integrity and timely availability.
