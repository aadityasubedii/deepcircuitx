The module processes serial audio data input using the bit clock `bclk` and the left/right channel select `adclrc`. It handles two channels by distinguishing between them and places the converted digital audio data into a FIFO queue. The FIFO (`audio_fifo`) manages the incoming audio data, buffering it so it can be accessed asynchronously from another clock domain via the `clk`, controlled by `read` operations. The module ensures data integrity by monitoring when the FIFO is full and manages system resets and clear conditions.\n"

Its state determines which channel's data is currently being captured.\n- adcdat: Serial audio data input from the ADC.

It counts down from the most significant bit to zero, helping to organize the audio bits into complete samples.\n- valid_bit: A flag that indicates whether currently processing bits are valid. It helps in synchronizing and controlling the data capturing process, ensuring bits are processed only when valid_bit is high.\n- reg_adc_left: This register flags whether the current data being captured is from the left audio channel. It toggles based on the `adclrc` signal and helps to manage and separate data from two channels.\n- reg_adc_serial_data: This register temporarily stores the serial data bits collected from `adcdat` as they are converted into parallel form. This parallel data is then pushed into the FIFO once a complete sample is formed.\n- adcfifo_writedata: The data to be written into the FIFO. This register holds the data transferred from `reg_adc_serial_data` ready for writing into the FIFO.\n- adcfifo_write: A control signal that triggers a write operation into the FIFO, used to signal when new data is available and ready to be stored in the FIFO.\n- wait_one_clk: A flag used to introduce a one clock cycle delay after the channel change is detected before starting to store data bits. This ensures data stability and correctness by avoiding metastability issues.\n- adcfifo_full: A status signal from the FIFO, indicating whether the FIFO is full. This helps prevent overwriting data by controlling the write operations based on the FIFO status.\n- is_left_ch: This is a decoded signal derived from the `adclrc` input. It holds the logical negation of `adclrc`, thereby indicating if the data corresponds to the left audio channel (high when left, low when right). This simplifies handling of channel switching."
