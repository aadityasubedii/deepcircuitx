    "spec": "Module name: AUDIO_ADC. \nModule specification: The AUDIO_ADC module is designed for interfacing and capturing audio data from an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). The module processes serial data input (adcdat) using a bit clock (bclk) and a left/right channel select signal (adclrc). It manages two audio channels, storing the digitally converted audio data into a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffer. The module operates mainly on two input clocks: `bclk` for bit-wise ADC data operations and `clk` for FIFO read operations. The input ports include `clk` (clock for FIFO reads), `reset` (resets internal states), `read` (trigger for FIFO data read), `bclk` (ADC data capture clock), `adclrc` (channel select), `adcdat` (serial audio data), and `clear` (clears FIFO independently). The output ports comprise `readdata` (audio data fetched from FIFO), and `empty` (indicates FIFO is empty). Internal signals such as `bit_index` (tracks bit position within a data word), `valid_bit` (controls data capturing), `reg_adc_left` (indicates the current channel being processed), `reg_adc_serial_data` (holds parallel-converted ADC data), `adcfifo_writedata` (data intended for FIFO write), `adcfifo_write` (write-enable for FIFO), `wait_one_clk` (delays operations by a clock cycle to stabilize channel switching), adcfifo_full (indicates FIFO fullness), and `is_left_ch` (derives channel status from adclrc) assist in handling data correctly. The module is divided into key sections: the ADC data capturing and processing block controlled by `bclk` which fetches and organizes serial data into complete samples, and the FIFO interaction block which involves writing to and reading from the FIFO as per FIFO and clock signals, managed by a submodule `audio_fifo` thus allowing asynchronous data transfers suitable for real-time audio applications.",

The module processes serial audio data input using the bit clock `bclk` and the left/right channel select `adclrc`. It handles two channels by distinguishing between them and places the converted digital audio data into a FIFO queue. The FIFO (`audio_fifo`) manages the incoming audio data, buffering it so it can be accessed asynchronously from another clock domain via the `clk`, controlled by `read` operations.

It governs the timings for data reading operations from the buffer.\n- reset: This input is used to reset the internal states and indices of the module to their initial values, ensuring a clean start or recovery from an error state.\n- read: This signal is used to trigger data read operations from the FIFO.\n- bclk: Bit clock input, used as the clock signal for capturing the serial audio data from the ADC.\n- adclrc: This input selects between the left and right audio channels. Its state determines which channel's data is currently being captured.\n- adcdat: Serial audio data input from the ADC. This is the actual audio data being captured bit by bit on each bclk edge.\n- clear: Used to clear the FIFO and reset internal states, independent from the global reset signal.\n\nOutput ports: readdata, empty, bclk, adclrc, adcdat.\nExplanation:\n- readdata: This port outputs the digital audio data read from the FIFO, which has been captured from the ADC input.\n- empty: This signal indicates whether the FIFO buffer is empty, providing status information that can prevent read operations when no data is available.\n- bclk, adclrc, adcdat: While these are primarily inputs, their listing as outputs in the question seems to be erroneous as they are not driven by this module per the provided code listing."

It counts down from the most significant bit to zero, helping to organize the audio bits into complete samples.\n- valid_bit: A flag that indicates whether currently processing bits are valid. It helps in synchronizing and controlling the data capturing process, ensuring bits are processed only when valid_bit is high.\n- reg_adc_left: This register flags whether the current data being captured is from the left audio channel. It toggles based on the `adclrc` signal and helps to manage and separate data from two channels.\n- reg_adc_serial_data: This register temporarily stores the serial data bits collected from `adcdat` as they are converted into parallel form. This parallel data is then pushed into the FIFO once a complete sample is formed.\n- adcfifo_writedata: The data to be written into the FIFO. This register holds the data transferred from `reg_adc_serial_data` ready for writing into the FIFO.\n- adcfifo_write: A control signal that triggers a write operation into the FIFO, used to signal when new data is available and ready to be stored in the FIFO.\n- wait_one_clk: A flag used to introduce a one clock cycle delay after the channel change is detected before starting to store data bits. This ensures data stability and correctness by avoiding metastability issues.\n- adcfifo_full: A status signal from the FIFO, indicating whether the FIFO is full. This helps prevent overwriting data by controlling the write operations based on the FIFO status.\n- is_left_ch: This is a decoded signal derived from the `adclrc` input. It holds the logical negation of `adclrc`, thereby indicating if the data corresponds to the left audio channel (high when left, low when right). This simplifies handling of channel switching."
