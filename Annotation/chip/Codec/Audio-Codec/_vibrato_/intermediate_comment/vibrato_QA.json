It takes stereo audio inputs (audio_right_in, audio_left_in), processes them through an AudioBuffer to introduce a delay, and modulates this delay based on a sine wave generated by sine_generator. The module outputs the processed audio signals (audio_right_out, audio_left_out). The debug signal outputs a scaled-down version of the sine wave for monitoring or debugging purposes."

It holds the delayed version of the left audio channel signal. The delay is computed in the AudioBuffer and is influenced by the sine wave value to create a varying delay length for the vibrato effect.\n- delayed_audio_right: Similar to delayed_audio_left, this is a `signed` wire that carries the delayed version of the right audio channel signal. The depth of delay and modulation is dependent on the modified sine wave, facilitating the vibrato effect in the right channel.\n- sine: A 16-bit wire that outputs the sine wave generated by the sine_generator module. This sine wave is used to modulate the read shift in the AudioBuffer and also partially passed to the debug output after being shifted right by 9 bits. This signal is pivotal in varying the playback speed of the delayed audio signals, which creates the vibrato effect."
