    "spec": "Module name: vibrato. Module specification: The 'vibrato' module is designed to modulate audio signals to add a vibrato effect where the pitch oscillates around a central note. It takes stereo audio inputs\u2014audio_right_in and audio_left_in\u2014processes them through an internal AudioBuffer block to introduce a varying delay, and outputs the vibrato-affected audio signals through audio_right_out and audio_left_out. The module specifically uses a clock input (clk) for processing audio in the AudioBuffer and an additional clock (write_clk) for the sine wave generation and latching output signals. The internal signals delayed_audio_left and delayed_audio_right are utilized to store the delayed versions of the left and right audio channel inputs respectively, which are then modulated by the sine wave produced by an internal sine_generator, influencing the AudioBuffer's read shift. The sine_generator outputs a sine wave signal to a wire named 'sine,' which is crucial for creating the vibrato effect by varying the playback speed of the delayed signals. These processes facilitate the vibrato effect in both the channels output. A debug signal, scaled down from the 'sine' signal output of the sine_generator, is also provided to assist in monitoring or debugging the module's behavior. The module is structured around key blocks: AudioBuffer, which handles audio signal delay and modulation, and sine_generator, which produces the sine wave used for modulating the delay.",

The delay is computed in the AudioBuffer and is influenced by the sine wave value to create a varying delay length for the vibrato effect.\n- delayed_audio_right: Similar to delayed_audio_left, this is a `signed` wire that carries the delayed version of the right audio channel signal.
