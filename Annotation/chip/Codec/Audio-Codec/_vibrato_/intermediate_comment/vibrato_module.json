    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'vibrato' module processes stereo audio inputs to add a vibrato effect by modulating delayed audio signals using a sine wave. It includes an AudioBuffer for delaying audio inputs and a sine_generator for producing the modulation sine wave. Outputs are updated on the negative edge of write_clk, and a debug output offers a scaled sine wave for monitoring."
