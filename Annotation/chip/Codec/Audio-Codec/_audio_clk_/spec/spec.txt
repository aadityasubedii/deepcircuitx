Module name: audio_clk.
Module specification: The `audio_clk` module in Verilog primarily serves to generate a stable and tailored clock signal for audio applications, utilizing a phase-locked loop (PLL) via the `altpll` component from Altera. The module takes an input clock (`inclk0`) and an asynchronous reset signal (`areset`). The output from the module comprises a processed clock signal (`c0`) and a status signal (`locked`) which indicates whether the PLL has successfully locked to the input clock. Internally, the module uses several signal wires: `sub_wire0` is a 5-bit bus for output clocks from the PLL, from which `sub_wire1` derives `c0`. The `locked` signal is directly carried by `sub_wire2`, and `sub_wire3` is used to forward the input clock to the PLL. `sub_wire4` and `sub_wire5` aid in configuring the input clocks to the PLL with specific control settings. The `altpll` component itself is configured with parameters like bandwidth, frequency multiplication, and division to achieve the desired operating characteristics appropriate for audio processing tasks. Further, the module defines various conditional ports and parameter setups specific to the PLL’s operational requirements, maintaining its robustness and functionality under various conditions as outlined by defparams that tailor the PLL’s behavior and integration within the larger system.
