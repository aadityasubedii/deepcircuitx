It features adjustable data and buffer widths through parameterization. The module captures stereo audio data on each positive edge of a separate `write_clk` and increments an address counter. The audio data is written to a dual-port RAM (`ram` instance named `buffer_data`), storing interleaved left and right audio samples. Audio samples are read from the RAM based on the current address minus a `read_shift` offset, allowing for delayed playback or processing relative to the input. This setup could be used in applications like audio effects processing, buffering, or delay lines.\n"

It determines when the address counter is incremented, syncing the capture of audio data.\n- audio_data_right: The input for the right channel audio data.

Along with the right channel, it forms the stereo input that is stored in the RAM.\n- read_shift: This input specifies the offset from the current write address for reading data. It allows reading from different points in the RAM, useful for implementing delays or other effects.\n\nOutput ports: data_read_right, data_read_left.\nExplanation:\n- data_read_right: The output for the right channel audio data read from the RAM, based on the current address minus the read_shift offset.\n- data_read_left: The output for the left channel audio data read from the RAM. It is read simultaneously with the right channel data, using the same addressed offset by read_shift, resulting in synchronized output of stereo audio data."
