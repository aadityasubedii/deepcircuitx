Module-level comment: The AudioBuffer module manages stereo audio signals using a memory buffer. It processes audio data on each `write_clk` pulse, updating an `address_counter` for memory operations. Dual-port RAM, parameterized for data and buffer sizes, stores and retrieves interleaved audio samples based on `read_shift`, facilitating real-time and delayed audio processing.
