Module name: AudioBuffer. 
Module specification: The AudioBuffer module is tailored for managing stereo audio data (left and right channels) using a memory buffer, with parameterizable data and buffer widths. The module operates under two primary clocks: `clk` which manages RAM operations, and `write_clk`, which synchronizes the capture of audio data by incrementing the internal `address_counter`. The inputs to this module include `audio_data_right` and `audio_data_left` for the respective stereo audio channels, `read_shift` which defines the playback delay or processing offset, and the clock inputs `clk` and `write_clk`. The outputs are `data_read_right` and `data_read_left`, delivering the processed audio from the RAM based on current address adjusted by `read_shift`. Internally, the module leverages `address_counter` to track and update the memory address locations for data writes and reads. The module consists of an instantiation of a dual-port RAM (`ram`), named `buffer_data`, configured for simultaneous read and write operations. This RAM accepts interleaved audio samples (left followed by right) for writing, and outputs them based on calculated addresses, effectively managing buffered stereo audio data for real-time or delayed usage, suitable for audio processing applications like effects and delays.
