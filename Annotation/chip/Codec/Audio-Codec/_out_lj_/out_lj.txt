Module-level comment: The out_lj module manages digital audio data in left-justified format for DAC output, parameterized by DATA_WIDTH. It starts data transfer on a positive BCLK edge, set by 'start'. It employs 'bit_counter' to time data bits' transmission, outputting via DACDAT. DACLRC indicates the active channel, and 'data_ready' confirms data frame completion.
