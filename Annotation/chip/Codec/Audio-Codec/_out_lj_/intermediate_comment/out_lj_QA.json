It manages the timing and sequencing of audio data bits to be sent to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) based on the input bit clock (BCLK). The module takes in separate streams of left and right audio data, each of a width defined by the DATA_WIDTH parameter. On receiving a 'start' signal, the module begins outputting the audio data sequentially, starting with the left data followed by the right data corresponding to each BCLK rising edge. The DACLRC output signal indicates which channel (left or right) is active, and the DACDAT signal outputs the data bits themselves. The data_ready signal indicates when the entire data frame for both channels has been sent."

It's essential for timing the data transmission to the DAC.\n- start is a control signal that, when set high, initializes the data transmission process, resetting internal counters and enabling the module operation.\n- left_data is the input data stream that represents the digital audio signal for the left channel.

It initializes to 0 when the 'start' signal is received and increments with each BCLK pulse. When `bit_counter` equals twice the DATA_WIDTH, it indicates that all bits for both left and right audio data have been transmitted, at which point it triggers resetting of the module state.\n- **running**: This is a boolean flag used to indicate whether the module is actively transmitting data. It is set to high (1) when the 'start' signal is received, enabling the transmission of audio data. It returns to low (0) once all data has been transmitted (when 'bit_counter' completes its count), at which point the audio transmission stops until a new 'start' signal is received. This signal effectively controls the operational state of the module, ensuring data is only transmitted when intended."
