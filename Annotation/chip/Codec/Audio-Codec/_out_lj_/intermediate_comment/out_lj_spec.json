It processes and streams left and right audio channel data, triggered by an input bit clock (BCLK) on its positive edge. Key inputs include BCLK, initiating the data bits transfer timing; start, activating the transmission process; left_data and right_data, holding audio signals for respective channels, each scaled by DATA_WIDTH. Outputs comprise DACLRC, denoting the active audio channel (high for right, low for left); DACDAT, relaying the audio data sequentially; and data_ready, signaling the end of a data frame broadcast. Internally, bit_counter tracks the transmission progress of individual data bits, resetting on start and incrementing at each BCLK, while running flags the active data transfer state. The module\u2019s logic, encapsulated in an always block triggered on BCLK's rising edge, handles control signal assessments, data transmission toggling, channel switching indication via DACLRC, and data streaming through DACDAT, rounding off with the completion flag data_ready upon transmitting the complete data set for both channels.",

It manages the timing and sequencing of audio data bits to be sent to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) based on the input bit clock (BCLK). The module takes in separate streams of left and right audio data, each of a width defined by the DATA_WIDTH parameter. On receiving a 'start' signal, the module begins outputting the audio data sequentially, starting with the left data followed by the right data corresponding to each BCLK rising edge. The DACLRC output signal indicates which channel (left or right) is active, and the DACDAT signal outputs the data bits themselves. The data_ready signal indicates when the entire data frame for both channels has been sent."

It's essential for timing the data transmission to the DAC.\n- start is a control signal that, when set high, initializes the data transmission process, resetting internal counters and enabling the module operation.\n- left_data is the input data stream that represents the digital audio signal for the left channel. Its width is defined by the DATA_WIDTH parameter.\n- right_data is the input data stream that represents the digital audio signal for the right channel, also defined by the DATA_WIDTH parameter.\n\nOutput ports: DACLRC, DACDAT, data_ready.\nExplanation: \n- DACLRC is an output signal that indicates the currently active channel to the external DAC. When high, it signals that the right channel data is being transmitted; when low, the left channel data is being transmitted.\n- DACDAT is the serial data output that transmits the actual audio data bit by bit to the DAC.\n- data_ready is an output signal that indicates the completion of the data frame transmission for both left and right audio channels. It assists external systems in synchronization or triggering subsequent processing stages."

It initializes to 0 when the 'start' signal is received and increments with each BCLK pulse. When `bit_counter` equals twice the DATA_WIDTH, it indicates that all bits for both left and right audio data have been transmitted, at which point it triggers resetting of the module state.\n- **running**: This is a boolean flag used to indicate whether the module is actively transmitting data. It is set to high (1) when the 'start' signal is received, enabling the transmission of audio data. It returns to low (0) once all data has been transmitted (when 'bit_counter' completes its count), at which point the audio transmission stops until a new 'start' signal is received. This signal effectively controls the operational state of the module, ensuring data is only transmitted when intended."
