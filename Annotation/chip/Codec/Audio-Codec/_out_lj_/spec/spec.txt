Module name: out_lj.
Module specification: The out_lj module, parameterized by DATA_WIDTH, is crafted for the sequential handling of digital audio signals in a left-justified format, facilitating data transfer to a DAC. It processes and streams left and right audio channel data, triggered by an input bit clock (BCLK) on its positive edge. Key inputs include BCLK, initiating the data bits transfer timing; start, activating the transmission process; left_data and right_data, holding audio signals for respective channels, each scaled by DATA_WIDTH. Outputs comprise DACLRC, denoting the active audio channel (high for right, low for left); DACDAT, relaying the audio data sequentially; and data_ready, signaling the end of a data frame broadcast. Internally, bit_counter tracks the transmission progress of individual data bits, resetting on start and incrementing at each BCLK, while running flags the active data transfer state. The moduleâ€™s logic, encapsulated in an always block triggered on BCLK's rising edge, handles control signal assessments, data transmission toggling, channel switching indication via DACLRC, and data streaming through DACDAT, rounding off with the completion flag data_ready upon transmitting the complete data set for both channels.
