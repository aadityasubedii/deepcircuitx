It manages the synchronization and timing for transmitting 16-bit audio data for left and right channels on a single data line (`DACDAT`). It uses the `BCLK` (Bit Clock) for timing and `DACLRC` (Left Right Clock) to determine whether the current data bit belongs to the left or right audio channel. The `bit_counter` is used to keep track of which bit of the audio data is currently being transmitted. The module outputs the data bit-by-bit on each negative edge of `BCLK`. When all bits of one sample have been sent, it checks for a change in `DACLRC` to reset the counter, hence toggling between left and right audio data. The `debug` output provides a means to monitor or debug the transmission by showing the current bit of the `right_data` being output."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports: BCLK, left_data, right_data, DACLRC.\nExplanation:\n- BCLK (Bit Clock): This input signal provides the timing for the serial data transmission of audio bits. The module specifically triggers on the negative edge to transmit bits.\n- left_data: This input holds the audio data for the left channel. It consists of `DATA_WIDTH` bits (defaulted as 16 bits), which are transmitted serially when the `DACLRC` signal designates the left channel.\n- right_data: Similar to `left_data`, this input holds the audio data for the right channel and is transmitted serially when `DACLRC` signals the right channel.\n- DACLRC (Left Right Clock): This input signal is used to toggle between the left and right audio channels. A change in its state determines which channel's data (left or right) is to be transferred through `DACDAT`.\n\nOutput ports: DACDAT, debug.\nExplanation:\n- DACDAT (Digital-to-Analog Converter Data): This is the primary output port where the audio data bits are transmitted serially. It represents either the left or right channel data bit being sent on each negative edge of `BCLK`, based on the state of `DACLRC`.\n- debug: This 6-bit output is used for debugging purposes, typically to observe and track the value of a specific right channel data bit currently being processed in relation to `bit_counter`. This can aid in diagnosing transmission or synchronization issues."

It gets incremented on every negative edge of the `BCLK` signal until all DATA_WIDTH (default 16) bits are transmitted. The counter resets under specific conditions, based on states of `DACLRC`, to commence the transmission of the next set of audio data.\n\n- prevDACLRC: This register holds the previous state of the `DACLRC` signal. It is essential for detecting a change in the left-right channel signal (`DACLRC`). When a change is observed, it triggers the reset of `bit_counter` facilitating the switch between transmitting data from the left channel to the right channel or vice versa. This helps in ensuring that the channel data aligns correctly with the respective channel indication by `DACLRC`."
