    "spec": "Module name: out_i2s. Module specification: The out_i2s module, parameterized with a default DATA_WIDTH of 16 bits, is responsible for audio data transmission over the Inter-IC Sound (I2S) protocol. It manages stereo audio data by toggling between left and right channels according to the state of the DACLRC input, outputting data bit-by-bit on DACDAT at every negative edge of BCLK. Input ports include BCLK, which provides the bit clock for audio data transmission timing; left_data and right_data, both of which hold 16-bit audio data for left and right channels, respectively; and DACLRC, which signals whether the current data belongs to the left or right channel. The module outputs include DACDAT, where the audio data bits are transmitted serially, and a 6-bit debug port which provides visibility into the current data bit from the right channel that is being processed. Internally, the module utilizes a 6-bit bit_counter to track the transmitted audio bits and a prevDACLRC register to detect changes in channel toggling. The primary logic block, triggered on the negative edge of BCLK, decides whether to send data from left_data or right_data based on DACLRC, increments the bit_counter, and resets the counter when a change in channel is detected by comparing DACLRC with prevDACLRC. This efficient management of audio data ensures synchronized and timed audio output, suitable for high-fidelity audio systems.",

It manages the synchronization and timing for transmitting 16-bit audio data for left and right channels on a single data line (`DACDAT`). It uses the `BCLK` (Bit Clock) for timing and `DACLRC` (Left Right Clock) to determine whether the current data bit belongs to the left or right audio channel. The `bit_counter` is used to keep track of which bit of the audio data is currently being transmitted. The module outputs the data bit-by-bit on each negative edge of `BCLK`. When all bits of one sample have been sent, it checks for a change in `DACLRC` to reset the counter, hence toggling between left and right audio data. The `debug` output provides a means to monitor or debug the transmission by showing the current bit of the `right_data` being output."

The module specifically triggers on the negative edge to transmit bits.\n- left_data: This input holds the audio data for the left channel. It consists of `DATA_WIDTH` bits (defaulted as 16 bits), which are transmitted serially when the `DACLRC` signal designates the left channel.\n- right_data: Similar to `left_data`, this input holds the audio data for the right channel and is transmitted serially when `DACLRC` signals the right channel.\n- DACLRC (Left Right Clock): This input signal is used to toggle between the left and right audio channels. A change in its state determines which channel's data (left or right) is to be transferred through `DACDAT`.\n\nOutput ports: DACDAT, debug.\nExplanation:\n- DACDAT (Digital-to-Analog Converter Data): This is the primary output port where the audio data bits are transmitted serially. It represents either the left or right channel data bit being sent on each negative edge of `BCLK`, based on the state of `DACLRC`.\n- debug: This 6-bit output is used for debugging purposes, typically to observe and track the value of a specific right channel data bit currently being processed in relation to `bit_counter`.

It gets incremented on every negative edge of the `BCLK` signal until all DATA_WIDTH (default 16) bits are transmitted. The counter resets under specific conditions, based on states of `DACLRC`, to commence the transmission of the next set of audio data.\n\n- prevDACLRC: This register holds the previous state of the `DACLRC` signal. It is essential for detecting a change in the left-right channel signal (`DACLRC`). When a change is observed, it triggers the reset of `bit_counter` facilitating the switch between transmitting data from the left channel to the right channel or vice versa. This helps in ensuring that the channel data aligns correctly with the respective channel indication by `DACLRC`."
