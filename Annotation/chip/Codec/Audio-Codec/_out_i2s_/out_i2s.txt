Module-level comment: The out_i2s module handles stereo audio transmission using the I2S protocol. It serially outputs 16-bit left and right audio data on DACDAT, controlled by BCLK and DACLRC. The logic detects BCLK's negative edge to alternate between left and right channels using bit_counter and DACLRC state changes. It includes a debug output for observing the transmission's current state. Simple yet effective, this design ensures precise audio bit streaming and channel synchronization.
