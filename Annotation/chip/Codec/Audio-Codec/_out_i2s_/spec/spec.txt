Module name: out_i2s. Module specification: The out_i2s module, parameterized with a default DATA_WIDTH of 16 bits, is responsible for audio data transmission over the Inter-IC Sound (I2S) protocol. It manages stereo audio data by toggling between left and right channels according to the state of the DACLRC input, outputting data bit-by-bit on DACDAT at every negative edge of BCLK. Input ports include BCLK, which provides the bit clock for audio data transmission timing; left_data and right_data, both of which hold 16-bit audio data for left and right channels, respectively; and DACLRC, which signals whether the current data belongs to the left or right channel. The module outputs include DACDAT, where the audio data bits are transmitted serially, and a 6-bit debug port which provides visibility into the current data bit from the right channel that is being processed. Internally, the module utilizes a 6-bit bit_counter to track the transmitted audio bits and a prevDACLRC register to detect changes in channel toggling. The primary logic block, triggered on the negative edge of BCLK, decides whether to send data from left_data or right_data based on DACLRC, increments the bit_counter, and resets the counter when a change in channel is detected by comparing DACLRC with prevDACLRC. This efficient management of audio data ensures synchronized and timed audio output, suitable for high-fidelity audio systems.
