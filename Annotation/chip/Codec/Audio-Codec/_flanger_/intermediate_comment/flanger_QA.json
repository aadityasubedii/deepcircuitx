It takes in left and right audio inputs and processes these using a delayed version of the audio signals, which are fed into an audio buffer managed by `AudioBuffer`. The delay amount for the audio buffer is determined by a sine wave output from `sine_generator`, modulated using a right shift operation. The module outputs the original audio signals added to their delayed versions, effectively producing the flanging sound effect. Output data also includes a debug signal, which is a scaled-down version of the sine wave, possibly used for monitoring or diagnostic purposes."

They are sourced from the `AudioBuffer` where the delay is controlled by the shifted sine wave signal. These delayed signals are crucial for creating the flanging effect as they are mixed with the original audio inputs.\n- `sine`: This signal is generated by the `sine_generator` and represents the sine wave used for modulating the delay amount in the `AudioBuffer`.
