    "spec": "Module name: flanger. \nModule specification: The \"flanger\" module is designed to apply a flanging effect to stereo audio signals. It processes input signals `audio_right_in` and `audio_left_in` by combining them with a delayed version of themselves to produce the characteristic sound output. The module integrates two clocks, `clk` and `write_clk`, for managing different aspects of the module; `clk` mainly drives the audio buffer operations and `write_clk` is used for signal processing timing and driving the sine wave generator. Output signals `audio_right_out` and `audio_left_out` provide the processed audio for the right and left channels, respectively, resulting from the original signals mixed with their delayed versions, halved in amplitude, for creating the flanging effect. A 16-bit debug output port offers a scaled-down version of the sine wave from `sine_generator` for diagnostic monitoring. Internally, `delayed_audio_left` and `delayed_audio_right` are crucial as they store the delayed audio signals used for the audio mixing. The signal `sine` from `sine_generator` is pivotal for modeling the variable delay in `AudioBuffer`. The module comprises notable blocks: `AudioBuffer` for managing audio delay manipulation based on the modulated sine wave, and `sine_generator` that produces the sine wave used to dynamically alter the delay, facilitating the distinctive flanging effect. The code meticulously orchestrates these functions to ensure the audio effect corresponds accurately to the input signals modulated by the sine wave dynamics.",

It takes in left and right audio inputs and processes these using a delayed version of the audio signals, which are fed into an audio buffer managed by `AudioBuffer`. The delay amount for the audio buffer is determined by a sine wave output from `sine_generator`, modulated using a right shift operation. The module outputs the original audio signals added to their delayed versions, effectively producing the flanging sound effect. Output data also includes a debug signal, which is a scaled-down version of the sine wave, possibly used for monitoring or diagnostic purposes."
