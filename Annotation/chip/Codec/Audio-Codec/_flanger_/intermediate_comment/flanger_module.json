    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"flanger\" module creates a flanging effect on stereo audio signals. It achieves this by mixing original audio inputs with their delayed versions, manipulated by a sine-modulated delay from `AudioBuffer`. The module uses dual clock domains; `clk` for audio buffering and `write_clk` for sine generation and output processing. `sine_generator` drives the delay modulation, essential for the dynamic audio effect, and outputs are served with both processed audio and a debug signal for monitoring."
