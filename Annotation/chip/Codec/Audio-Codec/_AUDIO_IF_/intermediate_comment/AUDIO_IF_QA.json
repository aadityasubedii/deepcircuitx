The module's primary functionality is to manage audio data transfers between the system and external Digital-to-Analog (DAC) and Analog-to-Digital (ADC) converters. This involves handling data writing to the DAC through left and right FIFOs (First In First Out buffers), managing data reading from the ADC, ongoing status checks (e.g., FIFO full or empty), and clearing buffers as instructed through specific commands. The module ensures correct timing and data synchronization, which is critical in audio applications, through signal handling associated with system clocks, data clocks (BCLK), and data line controls for both input (ADCLRC) and output (DACLRC). Additionally, the module supports data widths configuration for handling 32-bit audio data, indicating a focus on high-fidelity audio applications."
