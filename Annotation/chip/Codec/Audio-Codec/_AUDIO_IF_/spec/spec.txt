Module name: AUDIO_IF. 

Module specification: The AUDIO_IF module serves as an interface between a system and external audio devices, managing audio data transfers via an Avalon Streaming interface. It handles both input and output audio streams through Digital-to-Analog (DAC) and Analog-to-Digital (ADC) converters, utilizing FIFO buffers. Key input ports include `avs_s1_clk` (system clock), `avs_s1_reset` (reset signal), `avs_s1_address` (address selector), `avs_s1_read` and `avs_s1_write` (control signals for read and write operations), `avs_s1_writedata` (data to be written), and external signal links like `avs_s1_export_BCLK`, `avs_s1_export_DACLRC`, `avs_s1_export_ADCLRC`, and `avs_s1_export_ADCDAT`. The output ports include `avs_s1_readdata` (data read from internal buffers), `avs_s1_export_DACDAT` (DAC data output), and `avs_s1_export_XCK` (clock output synchronization). Internal signals such as `reg_readdata`, `fifo_clear`, `dacfifo_full`, `dacfifo_write`, `dacfifo_writedata`, `adcfifo_empty`, `adcfifo_read`, and `adcfifo_readdata` manage data buffering, FIFO status, and read/write operations. The Verilog code contains blocks for setting FIFO clear controls, handling DAC and ADC FIFO data transfers, updating read operations based on FIFO data, and interfacing with DAC and ADC module instances. These DAC and ADC modules are parameterized for 32-bit data operations, ensuring high-resolution audio processing.
