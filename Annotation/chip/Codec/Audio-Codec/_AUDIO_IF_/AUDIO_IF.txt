Module-level comment: The AUDIO_IF module interfaces with audio devices, managing data via an Avalon Streaming interface. It supports input/output operations with external DAC and ADC, using FIFOs for data buffering. The module uses internal signals for FIFO control and data transfer, and instantiates separate DAC and ADC handling blocks parameterized for 32-bit data. Input signals include clocks, data controls, and reset, while outputs include read data and synchronized clock outputs.
