Module name: sine_generator. 
Module specification: The 'sine_generator' is a Verilog module designed to generate a sine wave using the Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) technique. It consists of two primary input ports: 'clk', a clock input that drives the timing of the operations, and 'fcw', a 24-bit Frequency Control Word that determines the incrementation step of the internal 'accumulator'. The module outputs a 16-bit signal 'sine', which represents the sine wave values fetched from a ROM. Internally, the module employs a 24-bit 'accumulator' that accumulates the 'fcw' value every clock cycle and a 10-bit 'addr' signal derived from the most significant bits of the 'accumulator'. The 'addr' acts as an address to a ROM ('sine_rom') from which the sine values are retrieved. The 'sine_rom' instantiation connects the 'addr' and 'clk' to fetch the required sine wave data. The 'always' block ensures the 'accumulator' is updated on every positive edge of 'clk', perpetuating the production of new addresses and thus, continuous sine wave generation.
