    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'sine_generator' module employs Direct Digital Synthesis to generate a sine wave. It utilizes an accumulator that increments by an input Frequency Control Word ('fcw') each clock cycle. The top bits of this accumulator form the address for a ROM ('sine_rom'), from which sine values are fetched and outputted as a 16-bit 'sine' signal. The continuous update on the clock's rising edge (posedge) facilitates real-time sine wave production."
