It takes a frequency control word (fcw) which controls the frequency of the output sine wave. An 'accumulator' is incremented by 'fcw' each clock cycle, and the most significant bits of the 'accumulator' are used as an address to fetch precomputed sine values from a ROM named 'sine_rom'. The output 'sine' is a 16-bit wide signal that represents the sine wave values retrieved from the ROM according to the calculated address."
