    "module": "Module-level comment: The Display module decodes a 4-bit input (a3, a2, a1, a0) to drive a seven-segment display through outputs (a, b, c, d, e, f, g). It employs a 7-bit register 'segmentos' to store segment activation patterns, set by a case statement based on the input. These patterns are then directly assigned to the display segments, representing numbers 0-9 and turning all segments off for other inputs."
