Module name: Display. Module specification: The Display module is designed for controlling a seven-segment display through Verilog by receiving a 4-bit binary input and converting it into an appropriate 7-segment pattern. The input ports a3, a2, a1, and a0 accept these 4-bit binary values, which each combination distinctly representing a decimal number from 0 to 9. The output ports, namely a, b, c, d, e, f, and g, correspond to the seven segments of the seven-segment display. These segments are controlled to depict numbers based on the input using a 7-bit internal register named 'segmentos'. This register stores the pattern for segment activation where each bit controls one segment. The transformation from binary input to segment output is managed through a combinational logic block implemented with a case statement. This block decodes the 4-bit input into designated 7-bit patterns (stored in 'segmentos') that turn specific segments on or off to display the corresponding numeral. A default case ensures that for any input outside the range 0 to 9, all segments are turned off (displaying an '8' with the middle bar on). Finally, the state of 'segmentos' is mapped directly to the output ports, assigning each bit of 'segmentos' to its respective segment on the display.
