Module name: in_i2s. Module specification: The "in_i2s" module is designed to convert I2S audio interface input into separate left and right data channel outputs. It utilizes input ports: BCLK (Bit Clock), which synchronizes the reading of serial audio data bits; ADCDAT (Serial Audio Data Input), where actual audio signal bits are received; and ADCLRC (Left-Right Clock), distinguishing data bits for left or right audio channels based on its state. The outputs are out_left_data and out_right_data, holding the assembled data bits for the respective audio channels once they are fully received; a counter that reflects the value of the internal bit_counter register; and a debug output mirroring the state of the ADCLRC input. Internal signals include bit_counter, a register counting the received bits; left_data and right_data, which temporarily store bits for each channel; pClock, a potentially residual or future-use register to store the previous clock state; and prevADCLRC, storing the previous state of the ADCLRC signal to detect channel switching. The code is structured into blocks handling data capture on clock edges: transfer of complete data to outputs on ADCLRC edges, storage of incoming bits on BCLK edges, and reset conditions for counting and data handling on appropriate signal changes.
