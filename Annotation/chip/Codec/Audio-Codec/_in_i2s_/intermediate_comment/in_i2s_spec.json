    "spec": "Module name: in_i2s. Module specification: The \"in_i2s\" module is designed to convert I2S audio interface input into separate left and right data channel outputs. It utilizes input ports: BCLK (Bit Clock), which synchronizes the reading of serial audio data bits; ADCDAT (Serial Audio Data Input), where actual audio signal bits are received; and ADCLRC (Left-Right Clock), distinguishing data bits for left or right audio channels based on its state. The outputs are out_left_data and out_right_data, holding the assembled data bits for the respective audio channels once they are fully received; a counter that reflects the value of the internal bit_counter register; and a debug output mirroring the state of the ADCLRC input. Internal signals include bit_counter, a register counting the received bits; left_data and right_data, which temporarily store bits for each channel; pClock, a potentially residual or future-use register to store the previous clock state; and prevADCLRC, storing the previous state of the ADCLRC signal to detect channel switching. The code is structured into blocks handling data capture on clock edges: transfer of complete data to outputs on ADCLRC edges, storage of incoming bits on BCLK edges, and reset conditions for counting and data handling on appropriate signal changes.",

The module reads serial audio data input via the ADCDAT line, which is synchronized with a bit clock (BCLK) and a left-right clock (ADCLRC). The data for the left and right audio channels is distinguished using the ADCLRC signal; data is read on the rising edge for the left channel and on the falling edge for the right channel. The module uses a counter (bit_counter) to keep track of the number of bits shifted in. Once all bits for one channel are received (as determined by DATA_WIDTH), it latches that data to the respective output (out_left_data or out_right_data) and resets the counter if the ADCLRC signal changes state, indicating the start of data for the opposite channel. Additionally, debug outputs provide visibility into the ADCLRC signal state and the bit_counter value for troubleshooting purposes."

As data is read on the positive or negative edge of BCLK, this clock signal is crucial for timing the data acquisition for left and right audio channels.\n  - ADCDAT: This is the serial audio data input, where the actual audio signal bits are received. These bits are read and stored based on the clock signals (BCLK and ADCLRC).\n  - ADCLRC: This is the left-right clock input that toggles between states to indicate whether the incoming data bits on ADCDAT belong to the left or right audio channel. A rising edge indicates left channel data, and a falling edge indicates right channel data.\n\nOutput ports: out_left_data, out_right_data, counter, debug.\n- Explanation:\n  - out_left_data: This is the output register holding the assembled data bits for the left audio channel. Once all bits are read as determined by the DATA_WIDTH parameter, the data for one audio frame is output here.\n  - out_right_data: Similar to out_left_data, this is the output register for the right audio channel's data bits. It stores the incoming audio data read when ADCLRC indicates a right channel data stream.\n  - counter: This is a 6-bit output that mirrors the 'bit_counter' register. It indicates the current count of bits received and stored, helping monitor the data loading process.\n  - debug: This 32-bit output is primarily used for debugging purposes, reflecting the state of the ADCLRC input. It assists in monitoring and troubleshooting the operation of data channel switching and data reading."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: bit_counter, left_data, right_data, pClock, prevADCLRC.\nExplanation:\n- bit_counter: This is a 6-bit register used to count the number of bits that have been shifted in from the ADCDAT input. It helps in tracking how many bits of the current audio channel data have been received. Once it reaches the value set by DATA_WIDTH, the module knows that a complete set of data (either left or right) has been received.\n- left_data: A register with a size defined by DATA_WIDTH, used to temporarily store the bits of the left audio channel as they are received from the ADCDAT input. This register accumulates the serial data bits until all are collected and then transfers them to the out_left_data output.\n- right_data: Similarly to left_data, this is a register that stores the received bits for the right audio channel from ADCDAT. It accumulates DATA_WIDTH bits corresponding to the right audio channel, and then the data is transferred to the out_right_data output.\n- pClock: This is a register used to store the state of the previous clock cycle. Although it is declared, pClock does not appear to be utilized effectively in the provided module code, suggesting it may be a residual from earlier versions or intended for future use.\n- prevADCLRC: This register captures and holds the previous state of the ADCLRC input. It's used to detect changes in the ADCLRC signal, which indicate a switch from one audio channel to another (left to right or vice versa). This helps the module manage and reset the bit_counter appropriately to start counting the bits for the next audio channel."
