    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"in_i2s\" module converts I2S audio input into separate left and right channel data. It uses BCLK for timing, ADCDAT for data input, and ADCLRC for channel switching. Data bits are processed on BCLK edges, assembled in left_data or right_data registers based on ADCLRC, and transferred to outputs when ADCLRC toggles. The module keeps track of processed bits with a bit_counter, which resets on channel change."
