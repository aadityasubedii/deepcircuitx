Module name: AUDIO_DAC. 
Module specification: The AUDIO_DAC module is primarily designed to manage the synchronization and transmission of audio data from a FIFO buffer to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). This involves handling dual-channel audio with distinct left and right channels, regulated by the input clocks `bclk` (bit clock) and `daclrc` (DAC Left/Right Clock). Audio data enters the module through input `writedata` when the `write` signal is active, and depending on the FIFO's state (signaled by `full`), the module determines if more data can be accepted. The module resets and initializes its states with the `reset` and `clear` inputs. Internally, `request_bit`, `bit_to_dac`, `bit_index`, `dac_is_left`, `data_to_dac`, `shift_data_to_dac`, `dacfifo_empty`, `dacfifo_read`, `dacfifo_readdata`, and `is_left_ch` are used to control the fetching, shifting, and outputting of audio data. The core functionality is divided into sections that handle left and right channel data block assignment based on `daclrc`, audio data loading and shifting managed at the negative edge of `bclk`, and bit-serial output of audio data indicated by the `dacdat` signal. Additionally, the module is connected to an `audio_fifo` submodule that manages the actual FIFO buffer operations, including data storage and retrieval synced with FIFO read and write clocks. This internal architecture ensures the module efficiently processes and transmits high-quality audio data to the DAC for analog output.
