    "module": "Module-level comment: The AUDIO_DAC module synchronizes and outputs audio data to a DAC from a FIFO, handling dual-channel (left/right) transmission. It uses input signals (`bclk`, `daclrc`) for synchronized bit-wise audio output via `dacdat`. Internally, it manages data fetching, bit-shifting, and conditional output processing based on channel and buffer states, interfaced with an `audio_fifo` submodule for FIFO operations."
