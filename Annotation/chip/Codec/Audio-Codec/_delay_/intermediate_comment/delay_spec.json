    "spec": "Module name: delay. Module specification: The 'delay' module is designed for audio signal processing, specifically to add a delay effect to audio signals for both left and right channels. The module operates with a primary clock (`clk`) and a writing clock (`write_clk`). The inputs include `audio_right_in` and `audio_left_in`, which are the right and left audio signals respectively, each processed to generate a delayed output through output ports `audio_right_out` and `audio_left_out`. These output ports deliver the mixed original and delayed audio signals, creating effects like reverb or echo. Internally, the module utilizes `delayed_audio_left` and `delayed_audio_right` signals to hold the delayed audio data for the left and right channels. The `AudioBuffer` sub-module processes the incoming audio signals based on the `read_shift` parameter to achieve the specified delay, mixing the original and delayed signals by averaging them. The `always` block triggered on the negative edge of `write_clk` then assigns the processed signals to the output ports. This module effectively blends audio processing with digital design to enhance audio signals in real-time applications.",

The amount of delay is adjusted with the parameter `read_shift`.
