The module takes in left and right audio inputs, processes them through an `AudioBuffer` component to add a specified delay, and then outputs the delayed versions of these signals. The amount of delay is adjusted with the parameter `read_shift`. The mixing of the original audio signal with its delayed version is done by averaging, creating an effect that might be used in audio processing applications like echo or reverb effects. The operations are synchronized to the negative edge of `write_clk`."

It enters the module and is processed to create a delayed output.\n- `audio_left_in`: Similar to `audio_right_in`, this is the input audio signal for the left channel, used for processing and obtaining the delayed left audio output.\n\nOutput ports: audio_right_out, audio_left_out.\nExplanation: \n- `audio_right_out`: This is the output port for the delayed and processed audio signal of the right channel. It outputs the mixed audio which combines the incoming audio signal (`audio_right_in`) with the delayed signal (`delayed_audio_right`) to produce an effect such as reverb or echo.\n- `audio_left_out`: This is the output port for the delayed left channel audio signal.
