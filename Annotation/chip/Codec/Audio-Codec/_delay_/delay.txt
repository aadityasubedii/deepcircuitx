Module-level comment: The 'delay' module processes audio signals, adding delay effects to left and right channels using an `AudioBuffer` sub-module. It accepts audio inputs, synchronizes operations on a `write_clk`, and mixes delayed signals with originals, outputting enhanced audio. This module combines digital processing with real-sound enhancement, effectively managed by internal wire signals and clock-driven logic.
