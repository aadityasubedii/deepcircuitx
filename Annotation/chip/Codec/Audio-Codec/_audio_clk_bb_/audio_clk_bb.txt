Module-level comment: The audio_clk module manages clock operations for audio applications, featuring inputs for an asynchronous reset (areset) and a primary clock (inclk0). It outputs a processed clock signal (c0) and a stability indicator (locked). Implementation details are sparse in this snippet, but it includes conditional compilation for Altera-specific features and a tri-state assignment for areset, implying usage in specific hardware configurations or design conditions.
