    "spec": "Module name: i2c. \nModule specification: The i2c module is designed to handle I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication protocol functionalities for transmitting and receiving data across I2C interfaces. The module leverages input ports such as CLOCK (the main clock input for synchronization), I2C_DATA (a 24-bit data input for the information exchange), GO (a signal to initiate transmission or reception), RESET (a signal to reset internal states), and W_R (a signal indicating the operation direction). Output ports include I2C_SCLK (manages I2C bus timing), END (indicates the completion of data transfer), ACK (aggregates acknowledgment signals from the slave), SD_COUNTER (a state and synchronization manager), and SDO (data output onto the I2C data line). Internal signals like SCLK, SDO, SD, ACK1, ACK2, ACK3, and END are utilized to control clock, data output, store temporary data, capture acknowledgment from the slave, and signal transfer completion, respectively. The code primarily consists of two main always blocks. The first one controls the SD_COUNTER based on GO signal and RESET conditions, and the second manages the data transmission process, switching between states for setting data bits, capturing acknowledgments, and setting the END signal appropriately. These states are driven by the SD_COUNTER\u2019s value, facilitating the sequential transmission of data bits coupled with acknowledgment checks, contributing to robust data communication.",

It uses the I2C clock (CLOCK) and data (I2C_SDAT) lines for communication, managing the data transfer, clock synchronization, acknowledgement, and operation control. The module takes inputs such as the clock signal, data to be transmitted, control signals (GO, W_R, and RESET), and processes them based on the state of a data counter (SD_COUNTER). The outputs include the I2C clock (I2C_SCLK), transfer completion signal (END), acknowledgement signal (ACK), and current counter value. Additionally, data flow and acknowledgement are handled across different states of operation indicated by SD_COUNTER, ensuring data bits are transmitted in sequence and checking for acknowledgements from the I2C device."

                    "text": "Module name: i2c. \nModule specification: The i2c module is designed to handle I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication protocol functionalities for transmitting and receiving data across I2C interfaces. The module leverages input ports such as CLOCK (the main clock input for synchronization), I2C_DATA (a 24-bit data input for the information exchange), GO (a signal to initiate transmission or reception), RESET (a signal to reset internal states), and W_R (a signal indicating the operation direction). Output ports include I2C_SCLK (manages I2C bus timing), END (indicates the completion of data transfer), ACK (aggregates acknowledgment signals from the slave), SD_COUNTER (a state and synchronization manager), and SDO (data output onto the I2C data line). Internal signals like SCLK, SDO, SD, ACK1, ACK2, ACK3, and END are utilized to control clock, data output, store temporary data, capture acknowledgment from the slave, and signal transfer completion, respectively. The code primarily consists of two main always blocks. The first one controls the SD_COUNTER based on GO signal and RESET conditions, and the second manages the data transmission process, switching between states for setting data bits, capturing acknowledgments, and setting the END signal appropriately. These states are driven by the SD_COUNTER\u2019s value, facilitating the sequential transmission of data bits coupled with acknowledgment checks, contributing to robust data communication."
