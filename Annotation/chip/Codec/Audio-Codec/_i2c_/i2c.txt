Module-level comment: The i2c module manages I2C communications for data transmission and reception using a clock (CLOCK) and 24-bit data (I2C_DATA). It uses input control signals (GO, W_R, RESET) to manage state transitions controlled by SD_COUNTER. Outputs include I2C_SCLK for bus timing, END for transmission completion, and ACK for slave acknowledgments. Internally, registers like SDO and SCLK facilitate data handling and clock control, operating through procedural blocks for state management and data processing.
