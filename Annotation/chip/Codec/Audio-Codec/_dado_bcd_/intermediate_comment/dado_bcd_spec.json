    "spec": "Module name: dado_bcd. \nModule specification: The module `dado_bcd` is designed to convert a 26-bit binary input `dado` into an 8-digit Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) format, outputting each BCD digit through eight 4-bit registers named from `zero` to `sete`. The input port `dado` receives the binary number to be converted, with the outputs `zero` (least significant digit) to `sete` (most significant digit) each representing a single BCD digit of the converted number. Internally, an integer `i` functions as a loop iterator, controlling a 26-iteration loop important for implementing the Double Dabble algorithm essential for the conversion. In this algorithm, before each shift operation, the module checks if any BCD register is greater than or equal to 5 and if so, adjusts it by adding 3 to ensure correct decimal representation. The conversion loop within the always block first initializes all BCD digit outputs to zero. Then, it carries out sequential processing for each bit of `dado`, shifting and adjusting the BCD values to represent the number in BCD format accurately. Each cycle of the loop shifts these digits, moves the highest bit of one BCD output to the lowest bit of the next significant BCD output, ensuring correct placement of weighted values across all outputs, with the least significant bit of the input `dado` being directly fed to the `zero` register at each iteration.",

The conversion process involves initializing all BCD digit outputs to zero and then employing a double dabble algorithm within a loop that iterates over each bit of the input. During each iteration, it adjusts BCD digits if they are 5 or greater by adding 3 (to ensure correct decimal representation after a left shift), and then shifts all BCD digits left, propagating bits to simulate multiplying by two (shifting in binary), and passing the highest bit of a lower BCD value to the least significant bit of the next higher BCD value. The least significant bit of the 'zero' register is shifted in from the corresponding bit of the input 'dado'. This process effectively spreads the binary weight of the 'dado' input across the BCD outputs in a manner that correctly represents the original number in decimal form divided across the outputs."

Starting from `zero` (the least significant digit) up to `sete` (the most significant digit), these outputs collectively provide the BCD equivalent of the binary number provided to the `dado` input. Each output is controlled using register logic to retain values between cycles, which allows for cumulative additions and bit manipulations as the module processes each bit of the input."
