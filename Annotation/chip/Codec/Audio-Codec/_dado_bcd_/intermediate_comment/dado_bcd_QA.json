The conversion process involves initializing all BCD digit outputs to zero and then employing a double dabble algorithm within a loop that iterates over each bit of the input. During each iteration, it adjusts BCD digits if they are 5 or greater by adding 3 (to ensure correct decimal representation after a left shift), and then shifts all BCD digits left, propagating bits to simulate multiplying by two (shifting in binary), and passing the highest bit of a lower BCD value to the least significant bit of the next higher BCD value. The least significant bit of the 'zero' register is shifted in from the corresponding bit of the input 'dado'. This process effectively spreads the binary weight of the 'dado' input across the BCD outputs in a manner that correctly represents the original number in decimal form divided across the outputs."

This input is essential as the primary data that will undergo processing to generate the BCD outputs.\n\nOutput ports: `zero, um, dois, tres, quatro, cinco, seis, sete`.\nExplanation: These output ports are each 4-bit wide and represent the individual digits of the BCD representation of the input `dado`. Starting from `zero` (the least significant digit) up to `sete` (the most significant digit), these outputs collectively provide the BCD equivalent of the binary number provided to the `dado` input. Each output is controlled using register logic to retain values between cycles, which allows for cumulative additions and bit manipulations as the module processes each bit of the input."
