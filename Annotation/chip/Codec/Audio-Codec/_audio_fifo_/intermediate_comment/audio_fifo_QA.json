It supports separate read and write clocks (rdclk and wrclk) and accompanying control signals (rdreq and wrreq) to manage read and write operations respectively. The module inputs data in a 32-bit format and provides output data also in a 32-bit format. The module also provides status flags 'rdempty' and 'wrfull' to indicate an empty read buffer and a full write buffer, respectively, helping to manage the flow control in audio data processing systems where data integrity and timing are crucial."
