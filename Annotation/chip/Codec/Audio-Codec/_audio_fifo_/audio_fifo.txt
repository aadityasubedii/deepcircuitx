Module-level comment: The 'audio_fifo' module implements a dual-clock FIFO for audio data management on Cyclone IV E FPGA, using a 'dcfifo_component'. It handles separate read and write operations with dedicated clocks and control signals. The module interfaces a 32-bit data bus and includes status indicators for empty and full conditions, leveraging internal signals for mapping component outputs to module ports, ensuring efficient and reliable audio data transfers.
