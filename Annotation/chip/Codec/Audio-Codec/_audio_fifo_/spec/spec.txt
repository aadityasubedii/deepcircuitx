Module name: audio_fifo. 
Module specification: 
The 'audio_fifo' module is designed to function as a dual-clock FIFO (First In First Out) buffer catering primarily to audio data processing on a Cyclone IV E FPGA. It employs the 'dcfifo_component' to handle varying clock domains for read and write operations. The module manages audio data through a 32-bit interface with input ports including 'aclr' (asynchronous clear), 'data' (input data bus), 'rdclk' (read clock), 'rdreq' (read request), 'wrclk' (write clock), and 'wrreq' (write request). The outputs consist of 'q' (output data bus), 'rdempty' (indicating an empty read buffer), and 'wrfull' (indicating a full write buffer). Internally, the module utilizes signals 'sub_wire0', 'sub_wire1', and 'sub_wire2' for routing the status and data between the 'dcfifo_component' and the module's outputs. The main segments in the Verilog code define the module's interface, instantiate the dual-clock FIFO with specified parameters like buffer size and data width, and map internal connections to facilitate data flow and status indication between internal FIFO mechanisms and the module's I/O ports. These configurations ensure robust and efficient data handling suitable for real-time audio applications where timing and data integrity are critical.
