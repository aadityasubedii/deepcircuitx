Module-level comment: The 'in_lj' module interfaces with an audio ADC, sampling and organizing serial audio data into left and right channel outputs using a parameterizable data width. It utilizes a Bit Clock (BCLK) for synchronization and processes data upon 'start' signal. Key functionalities are handled within an always block triggered by BCLK, managing data capture, channel differentiation, and synchronization through internal counters and state management. Outputs include separated channel data and diagnostic signals.
