    "spec": "Module name: in_lj. Module specification: The 'in_lj' module is designed to facilitate the interfacing with an audio ADC by serially sampling incoming audio data and segregating it into separate left and right channel data streams. The module has customizable data width through the DATA_WIDTH parameter and is synchronized by a Bit Clock (BCLK). It processes data when the 'start' signal is active. The module has several input ports: 'BCLK' for the bit clock, 'ADCDAT' for serial digital audio data from the ADC, and 'start' to initiate sampling. Output ports include 'ADCLRC' to indicate channel switching, 'data_ready' signaling data availability, 'left_data' and 'right_data' holding the audio samples for the respective channels, a 'counter' showing the number of bits processed, and a 'debug' port providing internal state information. Internally, 'bit_counter' (6-bit) tracks bits processed and 'running' indicates the active sampling state. The main always block triggers on the positive edge of BCLK, handling data sampling, bit counting, and channel separation based on 'bit_counter'. Conditional checks adjust bit_counter and manage muxing of bit stream into 'left_data' and 'right_data', reset the counter and 'running' state after completion, and update 'data_ready' and 'ADCLRC' as needed, thereby ensuring synchronization and data alignment.",

It includes parameterization to adjust to different data widths, utilizes a clock signal 'BCLK' to time data sampling, and employs a start signal to initiate the sampling process. It also has a 'data_ready' flag to indicate when a complete set of left and right audio data has been gathered. The bit manipulation and conditional structures within a clock-triggered always block efficiently manage the timing and storage of incoming data bits into separate left and right audio data outputs. Additional debugging outputs are provided, showing operations such as count of bits processed and real-time data width calculations."

ADCDAT carries the individual bits of audio data that are sampled on each positive edge of BCLK.\n- start: This is a control signal input used to initiate the sampling process. When this signal is set high, the module resets certain internal counters and starts processing incoming data.\n\nOutput ports: ADCLRC, data_ready, left_data, right_data, counter, debug.\nExplanation:\n- ADCLRC: An output control signal used to demarcate the boundary between left and right audio data in the bit stream. Typically used to synchronize downstream systems with the changing data channels.\n- data_ready: This is a flag output indicating that a complete set of left and right audio data has been fully captured and is ready for further processing.\n- left_data, right_data: These are outputs that hold the sampled audio data for the left and right channels, respectively. Each is DATA_WIDTH bits wide and stores the assembled audio sample from the serial bit stream.\n- counter: A 6-bit output that provides a real-time count of how many bits have been processed since the start or since the last completed sampling.\n- debug: A 32-bit output designed for debugging, which carries calculated values related to the current state of internal processing, such as current data width adjustments and bit counting status."

It is incremented each time a new bit is sampled from the ADCDAT line, providing a precise count of the sampled bits, which is crucial for correctly assembling the `left_data` and `right_data` output registers.\n- running: This is a boolean register (reg type) used as a control signal within the module to indicate whether the module is currently in an active data-sampling state. It is set to `1` (true) when the `start` input is triggered, and it gets reset to `0` (false) when the `bit_counter` reaches twice the `DATA_WIDTH`, indicating that the sampling for both left and right audio data is complete. This signal determines whether the module should continue sampling data or reset and prepare for the next start signal."
