It receives stereo audio signals (audio_left_in, audio_right_in) and processes these using four sine generators and associated audio buffers, which delay the signals by slightly varying amounts. These delays are modulated by sine waves for a more dynamic effect. The modified audio signals are then averaged and output as audio_right_out and audio_left_out, enriching the original audio with a chorus-like effect. The module operates with a parameterizable data width (DATA_WIDTH) and includes debugging outputs."

It coordinates the data flow and synchronization within audio buffers.\n- **write_clk**: This secondary clock input is primarily used for generating sine waves which modulate the audio signal delays, controlling the rate at which sine values are updated for delay modulation.\n- **audio_right_in**: This is the right channel of the incoming stereo audio signal, which will be processed to generate the chorus effect.\n- **audio_left_in**: Similar to audio_right_in, this port takes the left channel of the incoming stereo audio signal for processing.\n\nOutput ports: audio_right_out, audio_left_out, debug.\nExplanation:\n- **audio_right_out**: This is the output port for the right channel of the audio signal after processing for chorus effect, which involves delay and averageness adjustments based on sinusoidal modulation.\n- **audio_left_out**: This port provides the processed left channel audio signal. Similar to audio_right_out, it includes modifications from delay and averageness based on sinusoidal wave controls.\n- **debug**: This is a diagnostic output carrying a 16-bit signal, potentially used for debugging or testing the internal states or outputs of the module. Its specific usage would depend on additional context or design specifications not provided in the code block."

The delays are also modulated using corresponding sine waves to enrich the audio with a chorus-like sound.\n- **sine1, sine2, sine3, sine4**: These are sinusoidal waveforms generated by respective sine generators.
