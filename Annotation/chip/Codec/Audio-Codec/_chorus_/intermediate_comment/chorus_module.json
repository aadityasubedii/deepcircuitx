    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'chorus' module enhances stereo audio signals by producing a chorus effect. It processes inputs `audio_right_in` and `audio_left_in` through four sine-modulated audio buffers to create variable delays, outputting processed audio on `audio_right_out` and `audio_left_out`. Delays are dynamically controlled by sine waves generated at `write_clk`, and outputs are computed by averaging these delayed signals, effectively enriching the audio with a chorus-like effect."
