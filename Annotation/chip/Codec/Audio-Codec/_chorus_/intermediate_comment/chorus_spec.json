    "spec": "Module name: chorus.\n\nModule specification: The 'chorus' module enhances stereo audio signals by creating a chorus effect. It receives stereo audio input through the `audio_right_in` and `audio_left_in` ports, processes these through four sine-wave modulated audio buffers to introduce variable delays, and outputs the enriched audio through `audio_right_out` and `audio_left_out`. The primary clock input `clk` is used for synchronous operation in audio buffers, while `write_clk` manages the update rate of sine waves for delay modulation. Additionally, a `debug` output provides diagnostic information with a 16-bit signal. Internally, this module uses `delayed_audio_left1` to `delayed_audio_left4` and `delayed_audio_right1` to `delayed_audio_right4` to maintain the data of delayed audio channels. The `sine1` to `sine4` signals are generated by respective sine generators and used to dynamically vary the amount of delay by modifying the `read_shift` parameter in audio buffers. The code is organized into sections including sine wave generation (`sine_generator` instances), audio buffering (`AudioBuffer` instances for both channels), and output computation (averaging delayed signals in the `always` block). This structured approach allows for a dynamic and adjustable chorus effect in audio processing.",

It receives stereo audio signals (audio_left_in, audio_right_in) and processes these using four sine generators and associated audio buffers, which delay the signals by slightly varying amounts. These delays are modulated by sine waves for a more dynamic effect. The modified audio signals are then averaged and output as audio_right_out and audio_left_out, enriching the original audio with a chorus-like effect. The module operates with a parameterizable data width (DATA_WIDTH) and includes debugging outputs."

It coordinates the data flow and synchronization within audio buffers.\n- **write_clk**: This secondary clock input is primarily used for generating sine waves which modulate the audio signal delays, controlling the rate at which sine values are updated for delay modulation.\n- **audio_right_in**: This is the right channel of the incoming stereo audio signal, which will be processed to generate the chorus effect.\n- **audio_left_in**: Similar to audio_right_in, this port takes the left channel of the incoming stereo audio signal for processing.\n\nOutput ports: audio_right_out, audio_left_out, debug.\nExplanation:\n- **audio_right_out**: This is the output port for the right channel of the audio signal after processing for chorus effect, which involves delay and averageness adjustments based on sinusoidal modulation.\n- **audio_left_out**: This port provides the processed left channel audio signal. Similar to audio_right_out, it includes modifications from delay and averageness based on sinusoidal wave controls.\n- **debug**: This is a diagnostic output carrying a 16-bit signal, potentially used for debugging or testing the internal states or outputs of the module.
