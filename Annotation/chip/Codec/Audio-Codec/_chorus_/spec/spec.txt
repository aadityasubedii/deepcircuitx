Module name: chorus.

Module specification: The 'chorus' module enhances stereo audio signals by creating a chorus effect. It receives stereo audio input through the `audio_right_in` and `audio_left_in` ports, processes these through four sine-wave modulated audio buffers to introduce variable delays, and outputs the enriched audio through `audio_right_out` and `audio_left_out`. The primary clock input `clk` is used for synchronous operation in audio buffers, while `write_clk` manages the update rate of sine waves for delay modulation. Additionally, a `debug` output provides diagnostic information with a 16-bit signal. Internally, this module uses `delayed_audio_left1` to `delayed_audio_left4` and `delayed_audio_right1` to `delayed_audio_right4` to maintain the data of delayed audio channels. The `sine1` to `sine4` signals are generated by respective sine generators and used to dynamically vary the amount of delay by modifying the `read_shift` parameter in audio buffers. The code is organized into sections including sine wave generation (`sine_generator` instances), audio buffering (`AudioBuffer` instances for both channels), and output computation (averaging delayed signals in the `always` block). This structured approach allows for a dynamic and adjustable chorus effect in audio processing.
