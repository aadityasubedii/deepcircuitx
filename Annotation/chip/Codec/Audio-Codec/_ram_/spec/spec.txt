Module name: ram. Module specification: The `ram` module in Verilog acts as a parameterizable random-access memory, offering adjustable data and address widths through `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDR_WIDTH` parameters, respectively. This module consists of input ports: `data`, for receiving data to be stored in RAM; `read_addr` and `write_addr`, specifying the RAM addresses for reading and writing data, defined by `ADDR_WIDTH`; `we` (write enable), which dictates whether the module should write (when high) or read (when low); and `clk` (clock), which times the operation on rising edges. The module has one output port, `q`, which outputs the data from the address specified by `read_addr`. Internally, `ram` uses a signal array `ram`, a register array storing the data in memory locations accessible via the address supplied to either `read_addr` or `write_addr`. In the always block triggered on the positive edge of `clk`, data is written to location `write_addr` if `we` is high, and independently, data from location `read_addr` is output to `q`, thus facilitating both reading and writing in the same clock cycle based on control signals and addresses provided.
