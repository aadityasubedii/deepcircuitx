    "module": "Module-level comment: The `ram` module implements a parameterizable simple RAM with separate read and write operations. It uses `DATA_WIDTH` for data size and `ADDR_WIDTH` for address space. Data storage is handled by an internal register array `ram`, indexed by `read_addr` for output and `write_addr` for input, controlled by `we` and synchronized on the `clk`'s rising edge, allowing simultaneous read/write actions in one clock cycle."
