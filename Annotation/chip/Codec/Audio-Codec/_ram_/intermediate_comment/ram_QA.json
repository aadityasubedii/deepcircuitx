It features parameterizable data and address widths, allowing for flexibility in storage capacity and the size of the data it handles. The module accepts data input and reads or writes to an internal memory array based on the supplied address signals and a write enable signal (`we`). It outputs the data stored at the specified read address upon each positive edge of the clock (`clk`). If `we` is high, the module writes the input data to the memory at the specified write address; otherwise, it reads from the memory array and assigns the value to the output `q` at each positive clock edge."

It has a width defined by `DATA_WIDTH`.\n- `read_addr`: This is the address input used for accessing the data at a specific location within the RAM for reading. The width is defined by `ADDR_WIDTH`.\n- `write_addr`: Like `read_addr`, this address input is used for writing data into the RAM. It specifies the memory location where data is to be stored and also has a width defined by `ADDR_WIDTH`.\n- `we` (write enable): This is a control signal input. When high (`1`), it enables the writing of data into the memory at the location specified by `write_addr`; when low (`0`), the system is set to read mode.\n- `clk` (clock): This input port is essential for timing the write and read operations. On the rising edge of this clock signal, the RAM performs the read or write operation based on the status of the `we` signal.\n\nOutput ports: q.\nExplanation: \n- `q`: This is the data output port of the module. It outputs the data stored at the `read_addr` location in RAM. The width of this port is defined by `DATA_WIDTH`. The output data `q` is updated on every positive edge of the clock `clk`, reflecting the latest read data from the RAM."

The index to this array is mapped by the `read_addr` for reading data and `write_addr` for writing data.
