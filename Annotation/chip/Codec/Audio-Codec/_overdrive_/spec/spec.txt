Module name: overdrive. 
Module specification: The 'overdrive' module is designed to process stereo audio signals to prevent distortion by limiting their amplitude based on a predefined threshold. It supports 24-bit wide signed audio signals for both right and left audio channels, working synchronously with a clock signal. The primary input and output ports include `clk` for the clock signal that dictates the timing of processing, `audio_right_in` and `audio_left_in` for the right and left audio input signals respectively, and `audio_right_out` and `audio_left_out` for the processed output signals. An internal register `threshold`, of the same bit width as the audio inputs, stores the fixed value against which the inputs are compared. The Verilog code leverages conditional statements within an `always` block triggered on the negative edge of `clk` to set the output signals. If the input exceeds the `threshold`, the output is capped at this value; if it's below the negative `threshold`, it's set to this negative value; otherwise, the input passes directly to the output unaltered. This ensures outputs are maintained within a set amplitude range to avoid audio distortion.
