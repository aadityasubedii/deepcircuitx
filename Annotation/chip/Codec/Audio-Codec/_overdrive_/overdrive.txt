Module-level comment: The 'overdrive' module limits the amplitude of stereo audio signals to prevent distortion, processing at the negative edge of the clock. It compares input signals against a fixed threshold, capping outputs at this threshold or its negative if exceeded, otherwise passing inputs directly to outputs.
