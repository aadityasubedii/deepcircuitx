This is implemented for both the right and left audio channels. If the input signal (either audio_right_in or audio_left_in) exceeds the specified threshold, the output is capped at the threshold value. If the input is below the negative of the threshold, the output is set to the negative threshold value. If the input lies within the threshold bounds, it is passed directly to the output unchanged. This functionality is controlled via a clock signal, processing on the falling edge of the clock."

The output signals are also signed with the same bit width as the inputs.

If `audio_right_in` or `audio_left_in` exceeds this value (threshold), it indicates that the input signal's amplitude is too high and could potentially lead to distortion.
