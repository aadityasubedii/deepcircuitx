Module name: KEY_DEBOUNCE. 

Module specification: The KEY_DEBOUNCE module is crucial for stabilizing the state of physical key inputs by debouncing them, ensuring that electrical noise and rapid mechanical changes donâ€™t trigger multiple unintended key press events. This module operates by using a slower clock generated internally (100Hz) to sample the input states of the keys. It consists of input ports `clk_in` (the main system clock), `rst_n` (an active-low reset), and `key_in` (a 3-bit input representing the state of three keys). The module outputs the debounced key state through the `key_out` port, a 3-bit output reflecting the stable and debounced state of each key press. Internally, the module employs a few critical signals: `CLK_100Hz` (a lower-frequency clock generated for sampling the keys), `Count_100Hz` (a counter used to derive CLK_100Hz from clk_in by counting up to a predefined value), and `key_in_100Hz` (registers storing the sampled states of key inputs). Three instances of another module, EDGE, are used to detect negative edges of the debounced key signals, indicating key press events. Each EDGE module instance corresponds to a bit in the `key_in_100Hz` and `key_out`, processing signals to detect key presses individually. This modular setup helps in accurately detecting key presses even when subjected to conditions prone to generate noise and bouncing effects.
