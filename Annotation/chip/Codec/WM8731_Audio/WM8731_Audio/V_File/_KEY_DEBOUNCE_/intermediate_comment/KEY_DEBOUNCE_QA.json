It functions by sampling the key inputs at a lower frequency (100Hz) to filter out any noise or rapid unintended changes caused by the mechanical bouncing of the keys when pressed or released. The module generates a clock signal at 100Hz from the system clock (clk_in) and samples the key inputs at this reduced frequency. Then, it uses instances of another module, named EDGE, to detect and output the negative edges of the sampled key signals, indicating a key press event. This helps in ensuring that the output key signals (key_out) are stable and debounced."

It is used as the reference timing signal from which a lower frequency (100Hz) clock is derived to sample input keys.\n- `rst_n`: This is the active-low reset input. It is used to reset the internal states of the module to a known state whenever it is triggered.\n- `key_in`: This is a 3-bit input representing the state of three different keys. Each bit corresponds to a different key's instantaneous state which will be debounced within the module.\n\nOutput ports: key_out.\nExplanation: \n- `key_out`: This is a 3-bit output where each bit corresponds to the debounced state of each key input. The output specifically reflects the detection of negative edges (representing key press events) of the keys after debouncing them to eliminate noise and glitches."

It is derived from the system clock `clk_in` by dividing down the frequency through counting. This slower clock signal is used to sample the key inputs at a lower rate to effectively debounce them.\n- `Count_100Hz`: This is a counter used to generate the CLK_100Hz signal from the system clock `clk_in`. It counts up to a predefined value (`Num_100Hz`), at which point it resets to zero and toggles the `CLK_100Hz` signal, thus controlling the frequency of CLK_100Hz.\n- `key_in_100Hz`: This is a register that holds the sampled state of the `key_in` signals based on the CLK_100Hz. Sampling the inputs at a lower rate (100Hz) helps in debouncing, ensuring that fluctuations due to mechanical bounce are not registered as multiple key presses."
