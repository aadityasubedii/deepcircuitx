    "spec": "Module name: KEY_DEBOUNCE. \n\nModule specification: The KEY_DEBOUNCE module is crucial for stabilizing the state of physical key inputs by debouncing them, ensuring that electrical noise and rapid mechanical changes don\u2019t trigger multiple unintended key press events. This module operates by using a slower clock generated internally (100Hz) to sample the input states of the keys. It consists of input ports `clk_in` (the main system clock), `rst_n` (an active-low reset), and `key_in` (a 3-bit input representing the state of three keys). The module outputs the debounced key state through the `key_out` port, a 3-bit output reflecting the stable and debounced state of each key press. Internally, the module employs a few critical signals: `CLK_100Hz` (a lower-frequency clock generated for sampling the keys), `Count_100Hz` (a counter used to derive CLK_100Hz from clk_in by counting up to a predefined value), and `key_in_100Hz` (registers storing the sampled states of key inputs). Three instances of another module, EDGE, are used to detect negative edges of the debounced key signals, indicating key press events. Each EDGE module instance corresponds to a bit in the `key_in_100Hz` and `key_out`, processing signals to detect key presses individually. This modular setup helps in accurately detecting key presses even when subjected to conditions prone to generate noise and bouncing effects.",

It functions by sampling the key inputs at a lower frequency (100Hz) to filter out any noise or rapid unintended changes caused by the mechanical bouncing of the keys when pressed or released. The module generates a clock signal at 100Hz from the system clock (clk_in) and samples the key inputs at this reduced frequency. Then, it uses instances of another module, named EDGE, to detect and output the negative edges of the sampled key signals, indicating a key press event. This helps in ensuring that the output key signals (key_out) are stable and debounced."

It is derived from the system clock `clk_in` by dividing down the frequency through counting. This slower clock signal is used to sample the key inputs at a lower rate to effectively debounce them.\n- `Count_100Hz`: This is a counter used to generate the CLK_100Hz signal from the system clock `clk_in`.
