Module-level comment: The KEY_DEBOUNCE module debounces key inputs by sampling them at a reduced 100Hz frequency using an internally generated CLK_100Hz. Three instances of an EDGE detector module process these sampled inputs to detect key press events by identifying negative edges, effectively filtering mechanical noise and ensuring stable key press outputs. Each EDGE detector corresponds to one of the key inputs, ensuring individual handling and accurate key state detection.
