    "module": "Module-level comment: The RESET module generates a synchronized reset signal 'rst_n' after a user-specified delay, utilizing 'clk_in' for timing. It counts milliseconds based on 'CLK_IN' and triggers the reset when 'delay_time' is met and 'reset_key_in' is active. Internal counters and control logic manage timing and output conditions, ensuring precise delay and reset activation."
