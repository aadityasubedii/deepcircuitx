    "spec": "Module name: RESET. Module specification: The RESET module is specifically designed to issue a reset signal after a predetermined delay, measured in milliseconds, set via the 'delay_time' input. It harnesses the 'clk_in' clock signal to measure time and issue the reset when conditions are met. The inputs of the module are 'clk_in', a clock signal driving the timing; 'reset_key_in', a control signal that must be active for the reset to occur; and 'delay_time', a 10-bit input that specifies the delay duration in milliseconds before the reset signal activation. The sole output is 'rst_n', which becomes active when the internal conditions of delay match the specified input delay and the 'reset_key_in' is also active. Internally, the module utilizes 'delay_rst_n', a register that controls the reset output signal; 'Count_1Ms', a 24-bit register that counts clock cycles to measure one millisecond intervals; and 'Delay_Count', a 10-bit register that accumulates the number of milliseconds passed according to 'Count_1Ms'. The code operates with an always block that triggers on the rising edge of 'clk_in', which manages the counting of milliseconds and the conditions to finally set 'delay_rst_n' high once the 'Delay_Count' meets or surpasses the 'delay_time'. This setup ensures a properly timed reset functionality crucial for systems requiring precise initialization sequences.",

The delay duration is defined by the 'delay_time' input, measured in milliseconds. The reset sequence begins when the input clock 'clk_in' is present and counts milliseconds using the designated frequency settings (`CLK_IN` and `CLK_1MS_Count`). When the accumulated milliseconds match the specified delay time by the user, the module outputs an active reset signal 'rst_n'. This reset signal remains active as long as the input 'reset_key_in' is also active, ensuring a synchronized and conditional reset operation. This mechanism finds usage in scenarios where a system requires a stable period after power-up or any event necessitating a reset with a delay."

It resets to 0 after reaching the count corresponding to one millisecond, facilitating the measurement of time in milliseconds.\n- Delay_Count: This 10-bit register is responsible for accumulating the number of milliseconds counted by Count_1Ms. It increments once every millisecond until it equals or exceeds the value set by `delay_time`.
