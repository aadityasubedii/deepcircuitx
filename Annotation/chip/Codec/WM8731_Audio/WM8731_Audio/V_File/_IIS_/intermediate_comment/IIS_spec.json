    "spec": "Module name: IIS. Module specification: The IIS module is responsible for managing audio data streaming in the I2S (Inter-IC Sound) protocol, primarily designed for output functionality. It employs a `clk_in` as the primary timing element that drives the internal logic for I2S audio data ouput handling, and `rst_n`, an active-low reset signal, to reset the module's state for consistent operation. The outputs include `AUD_BCLK`, a Bit Clock which toggles at calculated intervals for bit synchronization; `AUD_DACLRCK`, a Left-Right Clock that toggles at half the frequency of `AUD_BCLK` to separate audio channels; and `AUD_DACDAT`, which carries serialized audio sample data. Key internal signals encompass `BIT_CLK_Count` and `LRC_CLK_Count`, used respectively for generating `AUD_BCLK` and `AUD_DACLRCK` at precise intervals; `SIN_Cont`, which increments to traverse through predefined sinusoidal sample data; `SEL_Cont`, which aids in serial output of audio data via `AUD_DACDAT`; `Send_Data_Buff`, holding the sinusoidal sample data; and `Send_Data_Buff2`, which manipulates the bit ordering of audio samples for proper serialization. The Verilog code contains several always blocks handling the incrementation and reset of counters, toggling of clocks based on the appropriate conditions, and update of sample data in sync with audio clocks, allowing comprehensive management and streaming of digital audio in compliance with I2S standards.",

It manages the generation of bit clock (AUD_BCLK) and left-right clock (AUD_DACLRCK) signals and the sending of audio data (AUD_DACDAT) following the I2S protocol. This module utilizes a master clock frequency defined to synchronize the audio data sampling rate with the digital audio system. It sequentially generates audio sample values based on a predefined sinusoidal pattern and outputs these samples bit-serially through AUD_DACDAT. The control signals ensure that the audio data is accurately clocked out according to the I2S standard, which is essential for interfacing with digital audio systems."

It serves as the primary timing element, driving the internal logic and state transitions necessary for the I2S audio data output operations.\n- **rst_n:** This is the active-low reset signal. It is used to initialize or reset the module's internal registers and states to a known default configuration when asserted.\n\n**Output ports:** AUD_BCLK, AUD_DACLRCK, AUD_DACDAT.\n**Explanation:**\n- **AUD_BCLK:** This is the Bit Clock output. It toggles at a frequency determined by the master clock and configurations related to the sample rate, bit depth, and channel number. It is crucial for synchronizing the transmission of individual bits in the audio data stream.\n- **AUD_DACLRCK:** This is the Left-Right Clock (or Word Select) output. It toggles at a frequency that is half of the AUD_BCLK to differentiate between the left and right audio channels in the I2S protocol, helping the receiving system to distinguish between channels.\n- **AUD_DACDAT:** This is the serial audio data output. It transmits the audio samples bit by bit, synchronized with the AUD_BCLK and framed by the AUD_DACLRCK. This output directly carries the audio data to be interfaced with a digital-to-analog converter or another digital audio system conforming to I2S standards."

It counts clock pulses derived from `clk_in` to toggle the **AUD_BCLK** at a rate defined by the calculation of `BIT_CLK_NUM` which factors in master clock frequency, sample rate, data width, and channel numbers. This counter helps synchronize bit transmission timing for I2S protocol implementation.\n\n- **LRC_CLK_Count:** This 8-bit counter is analogous to **BIT_CLK_Count** but operates to control the **AUD_DACLRCK** signal. It defines the left-right channel toggle rate necessary for stereo audio data separation according to I2S standard, using **LRC_CLK_NUM** to determine the toggle intervals.\n\n- **SIN_Cont:** This 6-bit counter drives the simulation of a sinusoidal waveform by iterating through specific pre-calculated analog values that represent the sinus wave. These values are used to set **Send_Data_Buff** which in turn feeds the audio output.\n\n- **SEL_Cont:** This 5-bit counter is used during the series output of audio data through **AUD_DACDAT**. It selects which bit of the **Send_Data_Buff** should be output next, effectively serializing the 32-bit audio sample data.\n\n- **Send_Data_Buff:** A 32-bit register that holds the current audio sample value to be sent out. This value is set based on the sinusoidal index provided by **SIN_Cont**. Each value here is predetermined for simplicity to represent a sine wave segment for audio tone generation.\n\n- **Send_Data_Buff2:** This signal is derived from **Send_Data_Buff** by performing a left shift operation. It effectively changes the bit ordering of the audio sample data which is essential for correct serialization in the transmission process driven by **AUD_DACDAT**. This manipulation aids in achieving the correct bit sequence alignment as per I2S protocol."

                    "text": "Module name: IIS. Module specification: The IIS module is responsible for managing audio data streaming in the I2S (Inter-IC Sound) protocol, primarily designed for output functionality. It employs a `clk_in` as the primary timing element that drives the internal logic for I2S audio data ouput handling, and `rst_n`, an active-low reset signal, to reset the module's state for consistent operation. The outputs include `AUD_BCLK`, a Bit Clock which toggles at calculated intervals for bit synchronization; `AUD_DACLRCK`, a Left-Right Clock that toggles at half the frequency of `AUD_BCLK` to separate audio channels; and `AUD_DACDAT`, which carries serialized audio sample data. Key internal signals encompass `BIT_CLK_Count` and `LRC_CLK_Count`, used respectively for generating `AUD_BCLK` and `AUD_DACLRCK` at precise intervals; `SIN_Cont`, which increments to traverse through predefined sinusoidal sample data; `SEL_Cont`, which aids in serial output of audio data via `AUD_DACDAT`; `Send_Data_Buff`, holding the sinusoidal sample data; and `Send_Data_Buff2`, which manipulates the bit ordering of audio samples for proper serialization. The Verilog code contains several always blocks handling the incrementation and reset of counters, toggling of clocks based on the appropriate conditions, and update of sample data in sync with audio clocks, allowing comprehensive management and streaming of digital audio in compliance with I2S standards."
