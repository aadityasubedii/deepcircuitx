    "module": "Module-level comment: The IIS module manages I2S audio data streaming for output by generating synchronized bit and left-right clocks (AUD_BCLK, AUD_DACLRCK) and serializing audio sample data (AUD_DACDAT) based on a predefined sinusoidal pattern. It leverages counters (BIT_CLK_Count, LRC_CLK_Count) and signal manipulation (Send_Data_Buff2) to ensure accurate timing and data formatting according to I2S standards, using an input clock (clk_in) and reset (rst_n) for operation control."
