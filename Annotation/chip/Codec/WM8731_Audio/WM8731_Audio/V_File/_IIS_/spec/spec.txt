Module name: IIS. Module specification: The IIS module is responsible for managing audio data streaming in the I2S (Inter-IC Sound) protocol, primarily designed for output functionality. It employs a `clk_in` as the primary timing element that drives the internal logic for I2S audio data ouput handling, and `rst_n`, an active-low reset signal, to reset the module's state for consistent operation. The outputs include `AUD_BCLK`, a Bit Clock which toggles at calculated intervals for bit synchronization; `AUD_DACLRCK`, a Left-Right Clock that toggles at half the frequency of `AUD_BCLK` to separate audio channels; and `AUD_DACDAT`, which carries serialized audio sample data. Key internal signals encompass `BIT_CLK_Count` and `LRC_CLK_Count`, used respectively for generating `AUD_BCLK` and `AUD_DACLRCK` at precise intervals; `SIN_Cont`, which increments to traverse through predefined sinusoidal sample data; `SEL_Cont`, which aids in serial output of audio data via `AUD_DACDAT`; `Send_Data_Buff`, holding the sinusoidal sample data; and `Send_Data_Buff2`, which manipulates the bit ordering of audio samples for proper serialization. The Verilog code contains several always blocks handling the incrementation and reset of counters, toggling of clocks based on the appropriate conditions, and update of sample data in sync with audio clocks, allowing comprehensive management and streaming of digital audio in compliance with I2S standards.
