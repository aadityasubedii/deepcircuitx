Module-level comment: The Audio_Control module configures an audio chip via I2C, transmitting predefined audio settings using a state machine. It accepts inputs clk_in, rst_n, and key_in for synchronization and control. Outputs include SCL, SDA for I2C communication, and leds for status indication. The module uses internal signals like ACK, IIC_IS_IDLE for handling I2C transactions and state transitions, and utilizes parameters and registers to sequence and dispatch the audio configurations.
