Module name: Audio_Control. 

Module specification: The Audio_Control is a Verilog module designed primarily to configure an audio chip through the I2C protocol. It manages sequential sending of predefined audio settings such as volume levels and mute states to the chip, while synchronizing operations with an internal state machine. The module's inputs include clk_in, which is the clock signal synchronizing internal operations; rst_n, an active-low reset signal to initialize the module; and key_in, a control signal for resetting the audio configuration. Outputs consist of SCL (Serial Clock Line) and SDA (Serial Data Line) for I2C communication, and a 10-bit led output reflecting the module's status through different states (idle, sending data, etc.). Internally, signals like IIC_IS_IDLE (indicating I2C bus status) and ACK (acknowledgement from audio chip) are critical controls for the state machine transitions. Other internal registers such as Reg_Count, reg_data, and IIC_Data are utilized for tracking and manipulating data set for transmission. The code comprises several segments including initial signal definitions, parameter settings for various audio features (e.g., volume, mute status), management of register values on specific triggers, and the main sequential logic controlling the state machine for I2C communication operations, ensuring regulated data sending and handling responses from the audio chip.
