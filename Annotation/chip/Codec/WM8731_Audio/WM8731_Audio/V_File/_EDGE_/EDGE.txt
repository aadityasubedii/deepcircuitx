Module-level comment: The 'EDGE' module detects edges in a digital signal 'in'. It utilizes a clock 'clk_in' for synchronization and an asynchronous reset 'rst_n'. Internally, two registers 'in_d0' and 'in_d1' store the current and previous states of 'in', respectively. Edge detection is achieved by comparing these states to generate outputs 'out_posedge', 'out_negedge', and 'out_edge' indicating positive, negative, and any edge detection.
