It accepts a clock signal (`clk_in`), an asynchronous reset signal (`rst_n`), and an input signal (`in`). The module provides three outputs: `out_posedge`, `out_negedge`, and `out_edge`. The `out_posedge` output goes high when there is a positive edge detected on 'in', the `out_negedge` goes high on a negative edge, and `out_edge` indicates any edge, either positive or negative. This detection is achieved by sampling the input signal with a two-stage shift register (using registers `in_d0` and `in_d1`), and the outputs are computed based on the transitions between these registers. The asynchronous reset ensures that the registers can be reset to zero independently of the clock."

It is used to synchronize the internal state updates, such as the sampling of the input signal and shifting the contents of internal registers.\n- `rst_n`: This is the active-low asynchronous reset input. It is used to reset the internal states of the module, specifically setting the registers `in_d0` and `in_d1` to zero, regardless of the clock signal.\n- `in`: This is the digital input signal whose edges (transitions) are to be detected by the module.\n\nOutput ports: out_posedge, out_negedge, out_edge.\nExplanation:\n- `out_posedge`: This output goes high when a positive edge (i.e., a low-to-high transition) is detected on the `in` signal. It is computed as `in_d0 && (~in_d1)` indicating that the current `in` value is high and was low in the previous cycle.\n- `out_negedge`: This output goes high when a negative edge (i.e., a high-to-low transition) is detected on the `in` signal. It is computed as `in_d1 && (~in_d0)` signaling that the current `in` value is low but was high in the previous cycle.\n- `out_edge`: This output indicates any edge, either positive or negative, on the `in` signal. It is determined by the XOR of `in_d0` and `in_d1`, meaning it will be high if there is any difference (change) between the consecutive states of the `in` signal."
