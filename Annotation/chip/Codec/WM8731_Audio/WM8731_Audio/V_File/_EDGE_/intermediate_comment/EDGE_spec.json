    "spec": "Module name: EDGE. Module specification: The 'EDGE' module is designed to detect edges in a digital input signal referred to as `in`. This module operates with a clock input `clk_in` that synchronizes the internal signal sampling and a reset input `rst_n` which is active-low for asynchronously resetting the internal states. The module outputs three signals: `out_posedge`, `out_negedge`, and `out_edge`. The `out_posedge` signals a low-to-high transition on `in`, `out_negedge` indicates a high-to-low transition, and `out_edge` is activated on any change of state in `in`. Internally, the module utilizes two registers, `in_d0` and `in_d1` \u2014 `in_d0` holds the current state of `in`, while `in_d1` holds its previous state, enabling edge detection by comparing these two consecutive states. The Verilog code forms the logic using an `always` block that updates these registers on the rising edge of `clk_in` or on the falling edge of `rst_n`, ensuring that the registers are reset when `rst_n` is low. The outputs are derived using simple logic assignments that compare the states stored in `in_d0` and `in_d1`.",

It accepts a clock signal (`clk_in`), an asynchronous reset signal (`rst_n`), and an input signal (`in`). The module provides three outputs: `out_posedge`, `out_negedge`, and `out_edge`. The `out_posedge` output goes high when there is a positive edge detected on 'in', the `out_negedge` goes high on a negative edge, and `out_edge` indicates any edge, either positive or negative. This detection is achieved by sampling the input signal with a two-stage shift register (using registers `in_d0` and `in_d1`), and the outputs are computed based on the transitions between these registers. The asynchronous reset ensures that the registers can be reset to zero independently of the clock."

It is used to reset the internal states of the module, specifically setting the registers `in_d0` and `in_d1` to zero, regardless of the clock signal.\n- `in`: This is the digital input signal whose edges (transitions) are to be detected by the module.\n\nOutput ports: out_posedge, out_negedge, out_edge.\nExplanation:\n- `out_posedge`: This output goes high when a positive edge (i.e., a low-to-high transition) is detected on the `in` signal. It is computed as `in_d0 && (~in_d1)` indicating that the current `in` value is high and was low in the previous cycle.\n- `out_negedge`: This output goes high when a negative edge (i.e., a high-to-low transition) is detected on the `in` signal. It is computed as `in_d1 && (~in_d0)` signaling that the current `in` value is low but was high in the previous cycle.\n- `out_edge`: This output indicates any edge, either positive or negative, on the `in` signal.
