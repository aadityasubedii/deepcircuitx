Module name: EDGE. Module specification: The 'EDGE' module is designed to detect edges in a digital input signal referred to as `in`. This module operates with a clock input `clk_in` that synchronizes the internal signal sampling and a reset input `rst_n` which is active-low for asynchronously resetting the internal states. The module outputs three signals: `out_posedge`, `out_negedge`, and `out_edge`. The `out_posedge` signals a low-to-high transition on `in`, `out_negedge` indicates a high-to-low transition, and `out_edge` is activated on any change of state in `in`. Internally, the module utilizes two registers, `in_d0` and `in_d1` â€” `in_d0` holds the current state of `in`, while `in_d1` holds its previous state, enabling edge detection by comparing these two consecutive states. The Verilog code forms the logic using an `always` block that updates these registers on the rising edge of `clk_in` or on the falling edge of `rst_n`, ensuring that the registers are reset when `rst_n` is low. The outputs are derived using simple logic assignments that compare the states stored in `in_d0` and `in_d1`.
