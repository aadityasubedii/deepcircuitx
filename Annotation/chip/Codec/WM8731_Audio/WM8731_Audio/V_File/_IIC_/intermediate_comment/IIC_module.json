    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"IIC\" module implements an I2C master controller for data transmission and reception. It uses a state machine driven by `clk_in` to manage communications, handling start/stop conditions, data bit transmission, and acknowledgment checks. Key inputs like `data` and `start` control data flow, while outputs `SDA`, `SCL`, `idle`, and `ACK_n` reflect the bus state and communication success. Internal mechanisms include signal edge detection and state transitions, ensuring robust serial communications."
