Module name: IIC. 

Module specification: The "IIC" module implements the master side of an I2C communication protocol that manages the transmission and reception of data over the I2C bus. This module utilizes a state machine with states such as IDLE, Start, Write, ACK, Read, and Stop to handle various aspects of the I2C communication cycle, including generating start and stop conditions, transmitting data bits, and checking for acknowledgments. The input ports include `clk_in` (clock input to synchronize operations), `rst_n` (active-low reset), `data` (24-bit data to be transmitted), and `start` (trigger for starting communication). Output ports consist of `SDA` (serial data line), `SCL` (serial clock line), `idle` (indicates idle state), and `ACK_n` (composite acknowledgment signal indicating if the last operation was acknowledged). Key internal signals like `SDA_reg`, `ACK_Temp`, and several counting and state registers assist in managing outputs, timing, and the flow of data and state transitions. The Verilog code is structured with several always blocks that respond to changes in the input clock or reset signal, to implement the I2C master functionality and control the internal state machine for managing data transmission. This structured approach ensures efficient handling of I2C communication protocols within digital integrated circuits.
