Module name: PLL_Audio. Module specification: The 'PLL_Audio' module is a Verilog design that encapsulates a phase-locked loop (PLL) specifically tailored for audio applications. The core functionality of this module is to generate a stable output clock signal 'outclk_0' from an input reference clock 'refclk', ensuring the output maintains a consistent frequency and phase relationship suitable for audio systems. It has two input ports: 'refclk', the reference clock that serves as the timing baseline, and 'rst', a reset signal that initializes and could resynchronize the PLL under certain conditions. The outputs include 'outclk_0', the stabilized clock signal, and 'locked', a boolean signal indicating whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the reference clock. Internally, the module contains no explicitly defined signals; it acts solely as a container for an instantiated component 'pll_audio_inst' of 'PLL_Audio_0002', which directly utilizes the external signals without intermediate processing. The code is organized simply with a declaration of module ports followed by the instantiation of 'PLL_Audio_0002', tying the moduleâ€™s interfaces directly to this instantiation, reflecting a direct and streamlined approach to signal handling within the module.
