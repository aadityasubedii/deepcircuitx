The primary function of this module is to generate a stable output clock signal ('outclk_0') that is derived from a reference clock signal ('refclk'). It also provides a 'locked' signal to indicate when the PLL has achieved and is maintaining the desired frequency and phase alignment with the reference clock. The module uses 'rst' (reset) input to manage the initialization and synchronization of the PLL."

The signals used within the module (`refclk`, `rst`, `outclk_0`, `locked`) are interfaced directly between external connections and the instantiated PLL without any additional internal processing or intermediate signal manipulation.
