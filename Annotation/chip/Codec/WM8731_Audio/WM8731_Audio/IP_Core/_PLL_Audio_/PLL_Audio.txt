Module-level comment: The PLL_Audio module generates a stable clock output for audio applications using an encapsulated PLL_Audio_0002 component. It uses refclk as the timing source, rst for initializing and potentially resynchronizing, and outputs a locked status and outclk_0, indicating successful frequency and phase alignment.
