The PLL ensures that the output clock is synchronized with the reference clock even in the presence of noise or other disturbances. It provides a single output clock (`outclk_0`) and a signal (`locked`) indicating whether the PLL is successfully locked to the reference clock. The module utilizes a PLL component (`altera_pll`) configured for direct operation mode, suggesting it is likely used for frequency synthesis without external feedback."

It provides the base timing reference from which the PLL generates the output clock. In this module, it operates at 50 MHz.\n- `rst`: This is the reset input to the PLL. It is used to reset the internal state of the PLL. When asserted, it resets the configuration and synchronization process of the PLL, ensuring it starts the locking process anew when deasserted.\n\nOutput ports: `outclk_0`, `locked`.\nExplanation:\n- `outclk_0`: This is the output clock of the PLL. It outputs a clock signal that has been frequency-synthesized from the reference clock. The output frequency is set to 12.5 MHz, as per the module's configuration.\n- `locked`: This signal indicates whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the reference clock. When `locked` is high (logic 1), it denotes that the PLL is providing a stable output that is correctly synchronized with the input reference clock. This signal is crucial for systems that need to ensure reliable operation contingent on stable clock sources."
