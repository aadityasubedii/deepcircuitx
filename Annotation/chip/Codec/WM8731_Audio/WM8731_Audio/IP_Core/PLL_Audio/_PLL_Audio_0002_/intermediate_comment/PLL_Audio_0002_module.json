    "module": "Module-level comment: The PLL_Audio_0002 module is a Verilog design implementing a Phase-Locked Loop for 50 MHz to 12.5 MHz clock synthesis, ideal for audio applications. It features `refclk`, `rst`, `outclk_0`, and `locked` ports, utilizing an `altera_pll` instance for direct clock management. This setup ensures the output clock is stable and synchronized with the reference clock, crucial for reliable audio processing."
