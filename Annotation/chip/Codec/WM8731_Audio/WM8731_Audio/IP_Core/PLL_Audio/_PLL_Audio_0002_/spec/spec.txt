Module name: PLL_Audio_0002. 
Module specification: The PLL_Audio_0002 is a Verilog module designed for audio applications, featuring a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) that operates with a 50 MHz reference clock and produces a 12.5 MHz output clock. The module has four primary ports: `refclk` (input) which serves as the reference clock ensuring the PLL has a timing foundation, `rst` (input) used to reset the PLL's internal state, `outclk_0` (output) which is the frequency-synthesized clock generated from `refclk`, and `locked` (output) indicating whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the reference clock. Internally, the module instantiates an `altera_pll` component configured with parameters specific to its operation such as clock frequencies, operational mode, and duty cycles. This component uses the external input signals directly for its operation without additional processing. The code structure is straightforward, primarily involving the instantiation and configuration of the `altera_pll` component, establishing direct connections between the moduleâ€™s I/O ports and the corresponding ports on the `altera_pll` instance. Overall, this design ensures that the output clock is both stable and synchronized with the input reference clock, which is critical for reliable audio processing applications.
