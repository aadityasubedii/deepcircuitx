The WM8731_Audio repository is designed for robust audio processing and control on a DE10-Standard FPGA board, featuring a comprehensive set of modules to manage audio data streaming, synchronization, and peripheral interactions. At the heart of the repository, the DE10_Standard_golden_top module coordinates the overall operation, integrating user inputs, video interfacing, and DRAM with specific sub-modules for clock management and audio/video signal processing. Notably, the PLL_Audio and its sub-module PLL_Audio_0002 precisely generate stable clock signals for audio applications via a phase-locked loop mechanism. For user interactions, the KEY_DEBOUNCE module ensures reliable key input detection by debouncing mechanisms combined with EDGE detection modules that filter signal noise. Audio data handling is adeptly managed by the IIS module, which controls I2S streaming with precise clock and data line manipulations, while the IIC module implements an I2C master controller for robust data transmission. The Audio_Control module configures audio settings through I2C communication, supported by state machine logic for seamless operation. Additionally, the RESET module provides controlled reset signaling after set delays, ensuring system stability and reliability. Collectively, these modules create a multifunctional embedded system tailored for advanced audio processing on FPGA.
