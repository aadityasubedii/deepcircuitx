Module name: Alaw_to_PCM. 
Module specification: The Alaw_to_PCM Verilog module is designed to convert 8-bit A-law encoded data into 16-bit PCM format. This module consists of an input port 'data_i' which accepts 8-bit A-law encoded data, processed to generate a 16-bit PCM output accessible through the output port 'data_o'. Internally, the module utilizes two critical signals: 'fstep' and 'sstep'. The 'fstep' is an 8-bit wire derived from XORing 'data_i' with 0x55, used for conditional branching for output computation. 'sstep', a 16-bit register, temporarily holds the transformed data based on the significant bits of 'fstep', and depending on the pattern in these bits, various segments of 'sstep' are zero-padded or assigned values derived from 'fstep'. This conditional logic is implemented using an 'always' block that checks the three significant bits of 'fstep' and modifies 'sstep' accordingly. Finally, the module determines the output by a conditional operation: if the highest bit of 'sstep' (bit 15) is high, 'data_o' directly adopts 'sstep's value; otherwise, it outputs the bitwise NOT of 'sstep', ensuring correct PCM representation from the given A-law input.
