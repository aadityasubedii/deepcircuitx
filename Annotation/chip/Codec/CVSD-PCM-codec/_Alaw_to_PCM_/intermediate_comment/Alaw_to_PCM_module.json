    "module": "Module-level comment: The Alaw_to_PCM module converts 8-bit A-law encoded data to 16-bit PCM output. It XORs input data_i with 0x55 to produce fstep, which dictates sstep's conditional assignments, padding, and value setting based on its significant bits. Output data_o is sstep or its bitwise NOT depending on sstep's highest bit, achieving the correct PCM representation."
