Module-level comment: The "comporator" module performs a digital comparison of a 4-bit input ('data_i') against two specified patterns ('0000' and '1111'). It outputs a 1 on 'data_o' if the input matches any of the patterns; otherwise, it outputs 0. This functionality is implemented using a single assignment statement that checks for equality between 'data_i' and the given binary patterns, directly setting the output accordingly.
