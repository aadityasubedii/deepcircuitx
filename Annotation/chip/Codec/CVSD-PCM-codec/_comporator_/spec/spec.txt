Module name: comporator. Module specification: The "comporator" module is designed to perform simple digital comparisons on a 4-bit input called 'data_i'. It checks whether 'data_i' matches either '0000' or '1111', and if so, outputs a 1 on 'data_o'; otherwise, it outputs a 0. This module has one input port and one output port. The input port, 'data_i', is a 4-bit signal that carries the binary data to be compared against the specific conditions. The output port, 'data_o', is a single-bit signal that indicates whether the input matches either of the defined patterns. Internally, the comporator module does not utilize any signals apart from the direct input and output ports. The logic is encapsulated in a single line of code where 'data_o' is directly assigned based on the comparison results of 'data_i' with the specified binary patterns. No additional blocks or internal signals are used, making this module straightforward and efficient in checking for specific binary values.
