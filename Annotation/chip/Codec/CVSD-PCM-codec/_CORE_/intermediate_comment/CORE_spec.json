    "spec": "Module name: CORE. Module specification: The CORE module is designed to process data through compression and encoding techniques, handling dynamic data flow based on the input selection. It features input ports including DR_i (Data Ready signal, indicating readiness for data processing), clk_i (provides the timing for operations), rst_i (used to reset the module to a known state), and select (a 2-bit signal deciding the data processing mode). Its output ports are data_o (the final processed data output), meandr_o (meandered clock output from the 'meandr' module), and FST_o (status flag output from 'meandr'). Internally, it uses signals like data_enc (encoded data from the 'coder'), uncompressed ('Alaw_to_PCM' output), toCompress (decoded data ready for compression), compressed (compressed data from 'PCM_to_Alaw'), clk (main clock signal), enable (control signal from 'meandr'), and data (multi-purpose data flow signal). The module incorporates instances of meandr (handles meandering clock and data routing based on select input), Alaw_to_PCM, coder, decoder, and PCM_to_Alaw, each dedicated to specific data transformation tasks according to the select input control, thereby ensuring flexibility in data processing for applications that require real-time data encoding and compression.",

It uses module instances within itself, specifically meandr, Alaw_to_PCM, coder, decoder, and PCM_to_Alaw, to manipulate input data based on the mode selected by the 'select' input. The 'select' input dynamically controls the data flow, choosing between raw data and compressed data. The module interfaces with external devices or processes through its inputs for data (DR_i), clock (clk_i), and reset (rst_i), and produces outputs such as the processed data signal, a meandering clock output (meandr_o), and signal flags (FST_o, data_o). This setup suggests its use in applications requiring dynamic data processing and signal generation, where real-time data encoding and compression are necessary."

It represents the encoded data, which is likely in a proprietary or optimized format for further processing.\n- uncompressed: A 16-bit wire signal output from the 'Alaw_to_PCM' module.

This signal is crucial for the encoding process that comes afterwards.\n- toCompress: A 16-bit wire signal generated by the 'decoder' module and used as input to the 'PCM_to_Alaw' module. It represents data that has been decoded (presumably for error checking or data recovery) and is ready to be compressed back into a smaller format.\n- compressed: An 8-bit wire signal resulting from the 'PCM_to_Alaw' module; it carries the compressed form of the data, ideal for reduced bandwidth transmission or storage.\n- clk: Although declared, this signal is not specifically described or utilized in the code snippet provided.
