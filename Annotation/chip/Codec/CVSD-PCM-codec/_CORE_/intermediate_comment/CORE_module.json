    "module": "Module-level comment: The CORE module processes data via compression and encoding techniques, controlled by a dynamic input 'select'. It interfaces through DR_i, clk_i, rst_i, and select inputs, and outputs processed data, a clock, and status flags. The module uses internal 'meandr', 'Alaw_to_PCM', 'coder', 'decoder', and 'PCM_to_Alaw' instances, managing data transformations based on controlled selections, facilitating efficient data handling for real-time applications."
