Module name: CORE. Module specification: The CORE module is designed to process data through compression and encoding techniques, handling dynamic data flow based on the input selection. It features input ports including DR_i (Data Ready signal, indicating readiness for data processing), clk_i (provides the timing for operations), rst_i (used to reset the module to a known state), and select (a 2-bit signal deciding the data processing mode). Its output ports are data_o (the final processed data output), meandr_o (meandered clock output from the 'meandr' module), and FST_o (status flag output from 'meandr'). Internally, it uses signals like data_enc (encoded data from the 'coder'), uncompressed ('Alaw_to_PCM' output), toCompress (decoded data ready for compression), compressed (compressed data from 'PCM_to_Alaw'), clk (main clock signal), enable (control signal from 'meandr'), and data (multi-purpose data flow signal). The module incorporates instances of meandr (handles meandering clock and data routing based on select input), Alaw_to_PCM, coder, decoder, and PCM_to_Alaw, each dedicated to specific data transformation tasks according to the select input control, thereby ensuring flexibility in data processing for applications that require real-time data encoding and compression.
