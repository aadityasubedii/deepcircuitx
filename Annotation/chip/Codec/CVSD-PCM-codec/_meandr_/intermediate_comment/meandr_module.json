    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'meandr' module functions as a digital signal generator and manipulator, driven by an input clock. It controls and generates various output signals such as modified clock, frame start, data toggle, and data validity, influenced by internal states and counters. Using multiple always blocks, it manages clock manipulations, frame signaling, data selections with counters, and sequential logic to maintain data integrity and output validity, efficiently processing inputs through conditional logic and registered outputs."
