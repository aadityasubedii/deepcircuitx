Module name: meandr. Module specification: The 'meandr' is a Verilog module designed to serve as a digital signal manipulator and generator, primarily focusing on generating and controlling various digital signals based on input conditions. The module processes inputs through four ports: 'clk_i' (the main clock signal), 'rst_i' (a reset signal for initializing internal states), 'data_i' (an 8-bit data input for data operations), and 'DR_i' (a data signal used for shifting operations). It outputs 'clk_o' (a manipulated clock signal), 'FST_o' (a frame start signal), 'DT_o' (a selectively output data bit), 'valid_o' (an indicator of data validity), and 'DR_o' (an 8-bit data output reflecting internal processing).

Internally, the module utilizes several counters and flags: 'cnt_clk' controls the manipulated output clock, 'cnt_FST' manages the frame start signal, 'cnt_DT' determines which bit of 'data_i' is output in 'DT_o', and flags like 'flag_clk' and 'flag_DR' direct the clock output and data shifting activities, respectively. Additional registers such as 'DR' (shift register for 'data_i') and 'DR_z' (holds the unshifted data) assist in data handling, while 'valid' and 'valid_stop' are used for output validity signaling.

The code organizes its logic in multiple blocks, each handling specific tasks, triggered on the rising edge of the input clock 'clk_i'. The reset logic is managed at the beginning of these blocks, ensuring the module resets correctly. The main functional blocks manage clock output toggling, frame start, data toggling, validity of the output data, and the shifting of input data into registers effectively based on the current state of the counters and the conditions set by the flags. This structured approach ensures the module efficiently manages and manipulates digital signals as designed.
