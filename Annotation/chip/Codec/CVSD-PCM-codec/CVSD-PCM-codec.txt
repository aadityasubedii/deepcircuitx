The CVSD-PCM-codec repository encapsulates a comprehensive suite of modules designed to perform audio data processing through various encoding and decoding mechanisms, achieving manipulation and conversion between different audio formats such as PCM and A-law. Each module within the repository is tailored to execute specific operations, which collectively contribute to the dynamic and efficient handling of audio signals. The repository includes modules such as the "accumulator," which computes based on arithmetic operations; the "coder" and "decoder" that handle encoding and decoding by integrating sub-modules for systematic data processing; the "mux" that operates as a multiplexer enhancing signal selection; and the "meandr" which generates and manipulates digital signals. Further, it comprises specialized modules like Alaw_to_PCM and PCM_to_Alaw for audio data conversion, alongside simpler functional units such as the "comparator" for pattern matching, and the "shift_reg" for data shifting. The overarching "CORE" module ties these components together, managing data transformations based on controlled selections to facilitate real-time audio processing applications. This structured and modular approach within the repository ensures scalability and ease of maintenance, fostering efficient real-time digital signal processing.
