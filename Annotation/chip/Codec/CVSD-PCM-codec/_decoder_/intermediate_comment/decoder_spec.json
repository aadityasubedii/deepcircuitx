    "spec": "Module name: decoder. Module specification: The 'decoder' module is a digital circuit designed to decode or process input data, using sub-modules like a shift register, comparator, multiplexer, and accumulator. It operates based on incoming signals such as 'enable_i', 'clk_i', 'rst_i', and 'data_i'. The 'enable_i' signal activates the processing, 'clk_i' provides timing for synchronization of the submodules, 'rst_i' resets the system to a known state, and 'data_i' is the main data input processed by the shift register. The output of the module is a 16-bit data signal 'data_o', representing the decoding output. Internally, the module utilizes three main signals: 'reg_out', a 4-bit output from the shift register providing data to the comparator; 'comp_out', the comparator\u2019s output that influences the multiplexer's routing logic; and 'step_out', a 16-bit output from the multiplexer used by the accumulator for final data processing. Each block within the code\u2014shift register (shift_reg), comparator (comparator), multiplexer (mux), and accumulator (accumulator)\u2014has defined roles, beginning with data intake, data comparison, route decision-making, and final data accumulation, respectively, collectively achieving the module\u2019s data processing functionality.",

The module takes an enabled signal, a clock signal, a reset signal, and an input data signal. Based on the shift register's output, the comparator generates an output used by the multiplexer, which then influences the accumulator's behavior. The final output of the module is a 16-bit data output which likely represents some form of decoding or processing based on the input data and the operations performed by the internal components. Each submodule within the decoder contributes to modifying and controlling the flow or transformation of the data being processed."

It is likely manipulated or analyzed within the shift register based on the input data, and its value impacts the comparator's operation.\n\n- comp_out: This is a wire carrying the output from the `comporator` sub-module and is used as an input to the `mux` (multiplexer) sub-module named `step_size_control`. This signal determines the behavior of the multiplexer in selecting which data path or operation to perform next based on the result of the comparison performed.\n\n- step_out: This is a 16-bit wire that serves as the output from the `mux` sub-module `step_size_control`. This signal carries the multiplexer's output, which is based on `comp_out`, and is fed into the `accumulator` sub-module.
