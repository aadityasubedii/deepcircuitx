Module name: decoder. Module specification: The 'decoder' module is a digital circuit designed to decode or process input data, using sub-modules like a shift register, comparator, multiplexer, and accumulator. It operates based on incoming signals such as 'enable_i', 'clk_i', 'rst_i', and 'data_i'. The 'enable_i' signal activates the processing, 'clk_i' provides timing for synchronization of the submodules, 'rst_i' resets the system to a known state, and 'data_i' is the main data input processed by the shift register. The output of the module is a 16-bit data signal 'data_o', representing the decoding output. Internally, the module utilizes three main signals: 'reg_out', a 4-bit output from the shift register providing data to the comparator; 'comp_out', the comparator’s output that influences the multiplexer's routing logic; and 'step_out', a 16-bit output from the multiplexer used by the accumulator for final data processing. Each block within the code—shift register (shift_reg), comparator (comparator), multiplexer (mux), and accumulator (accumulator)—has defined roles, beginning with data intake, data comparison, route decision-making, and final data accumulation, respectively, collectively achieving the module’s data processing functionality.
