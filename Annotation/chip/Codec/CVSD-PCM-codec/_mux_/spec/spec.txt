Module name: mux. Module specification: The 'mux' module functions as a multiplexer with enhanced logic for signal processing, specifically tailored for selecting between calculated data thresholds based on an input signal. It features four input ports: 'clk_i', the clock input triggering edge-sensitive updates; 'rst_i', an active-high reset that clears the internal 'data_stop' register; 'enable_i', which enables the processing when high; and 'data_i', a selector input that determines the output between two thresholds. The sole output port, 'data_o', outputs either 'data_min' or a portion of 'data_max' depending on 'data_i'. Internally, the module employs several significant signals: 'tmp' facilitates computation by representing 'data_stop' shifted left by ten bits; 'data_max' and 'data_min' are calculated limits based on 'data_stop', influenced by constants 'd_min' and 'd_max'; 'data_stop' is a register updated on each positive clock edge, subject to 'enable_i' and 'rst_i'. The code defines computational blocks for setting 'data_min' and 'data_max', a multiplexer functionality determined by 'data_i', and sequential logic for updating 'data_stop' within an always block sensitive to 'clk_i'. The configuration and dynamic functionality make 'mux' suitable for applications requiring adjustable output based on real-time computations.
