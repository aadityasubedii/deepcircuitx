    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mux' module is designed as a multiplexer with additional computational logic for selecting outputs based on dynamic thresholds. It employs input signals for control (clk_i, rst_i, enable_i) and selection (data_i), calculating thresholds ('data_min', 'data_max') using an internal 'data_stop' register, and selecting output `data_o` based on 'data_i'. It updates 'data_stop' at each positive clock edge, with reset functionality. This design efficiently handles variable data threshold calculations and selections in signal processing applications."
