    "spec": "Module name: mux. Module specification: The 'mux' module functions as a multiplexer with enhanced logic for signal processing, specifically tailored for selecting between calculated data thresholds based on an input signal. It features four input ports: 'clk_i', the clock input triggering edge-sensitive updates; 'rst_i', an active-high reset that clears the internal 'data_stop' register; 'enable_i', which enables the processing when high; and 'data_i', a selector input that determines the output between two thresholds. The sole output port, 'data_o', outputs either 'data_min' or a portion of 'data_max' depending on 'data_i'. Internally, the module employs several significant signals: 'tmp' facilitates computation by representing 'data_stop' shifted left by ten bits; 'data_max' and 'data_min' are calculated limits based on 'data_stop', influenced by constants 'd_min' and 'd_max'; 'data_stop' is a register updated on each positive clock edge, subject to 'enable_i' and 'rst_i'. The code defines computational blocks for setting 'data_min' and 'data_max', a multiplexer functionality determined by 'data_i', and sequential logic for updating 'data_stop' within an always block sensitive to 'clk_i'. The configuration and dynamic functionality make 'mux' suitable for applications requiring adjustable output based on real-time computations.",

The input `data_i` acts as a selector to switch between two calculated data values (`data_min` and `data_max`) which are derived based on the `data_stop` value and predefined constants `d_min` and `d_max`. The module updates the `data_stop` register on every positive clock edge (`clk_i`) if the module is enabled (`enable_i`) and not in reset (`rst_i`). When reset is high, `data_stop` is reset to 0. The final output `data_o` depends on the value of `data_i`; it outputs `data_min` if `data_i` is true, otherwise, it outputs a specific part (`data_max[25:10]`) of `data_max`. This module potentially uses in digital signal processing or in contexts where dynamic adjustment of output based on computed minimum and maximum thresholds is necessary."

It is assigned the value of `data_stop` with ten zeroes appended on the right, effectively multiplying `data_stop` by 1024 (left shift). This signal is primarily used in the calculation of `data_max`.\n- data_max: This wire stores the computed maximum threshold value. The calculation checks whether subtracting `tmp` from `{data_stop, 10'b0}` (another format of multiplying `data_stop` by 1024) is greater than or equal to `{d_min, 10'b0}` (d_min multiplied by 1024). If true, it assigns the result of the subtraction; if false, it assigns `{d_min, 10'b0}`. This acts as an upper limit computation involving `data_stop`.\n- data_min: This wire holds the computed minimum threshold value. It sums `data_stop` and `d_min`, and checks if the result exceeds `d_max`. If `data_stop + d_min` is greater than `d_max`, `data_max` is assigned; otherwise, the sum is taken. This provides a lower limit computation involving `data_stop`.\n- data_stop: This is a register that stores the current stopping or selected data value which is updated every positive clock edge when `enable_i` is high and not in reset. When reset (`rst_i`), `data_stop` is cleared to 0. This register's value is central in calculating the `data_min` and `data_max` and is also used in the final assignment of `data_o` based on the selector `data_i`."
