The input `data_i` acts as a selector to switch between two calculated data values (`data_min` and `data_max`) which are derived based on the `data_stop` value and predefined constants `d_min` and `d_max`. The module updates the `data_stop` register on every positive clock edge (`clk_i`) if the module is enabled (`enable_i`) and not in reset (`rst_i`). When reset is high, `data_stop` is reset to 0. The final output `data_o` depends on the value of `data_i`; it outputs `data_min` if `data_i` is true, otherwise, it outputs a specific part (`data_max[25:10]`) of `data_max`.

This signal is primarily used in the calculation of `data_max`.\n- data_max: This wire stores the computed maximum threshold value.
