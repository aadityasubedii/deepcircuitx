Module-level comment: The 'coder' module processes a 16-bit input (`data_i`) by subtracting a value (`comp`) output from a 'decoder' sub-module and emits the result's MSB (`data_o`). It functions under an enable signal (`enable_i`), synchronized by a clock (`clk_i`), and handles reset conditions (`rst_i`). The operations involve arithmetic manipulation (subtraction) and conditional flow based on control inputs, implemented with internal and submodule integrations for dynamic response adjustments in encoding/decoding systems.
