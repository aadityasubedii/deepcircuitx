    "spec": "Module name: coder. Module specification: The 'coder' is a Verilog module aimed at processing a 16-bit input data (`data_i`) by subtracting a computed value (`comp`), and then outputting the most significant bit (MSB) of the result as `data_o`. It operates under the control of an `enable_i` signal, synchronizes its operations with a `clk_i` clock input, and can be reset using the `rst_i` input. Internally, the module utilizes a `comp` signal, provided by a 'decoder' sub-module, which handles the generation of this value based on the MSB of the processing output. The result of `data_i` minus `comp` is held temporarily in a 16-bit wire `tmp`, from which `data_o` (the MSB) is derived. The Verilog code incorporates a 'decoder' sub-module that links directly with the 'coder' module, receiving `data_o` and control signals (`enable_i`, `clk_i`, and `rst_i`) and furnishing the `comp` value, essential for the primary arithmetic function of subtraction in the 'coder' module. This setup effectively supports a sequential and conditional processing, highlighting a tiered signal manipulation and response mechanism, pivotal for potential applications in signal processing or data encoding/decoding systems.",

The module integrates a sub-module named 'decoder' which outputs the `comp` value based on the processed MSB.
