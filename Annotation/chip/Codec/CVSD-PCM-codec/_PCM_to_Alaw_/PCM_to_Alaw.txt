Module-level comment: The PCM_to_Alaw module converts 16-bit PCM data to 8-bit A-law compressed data. It evaluates the sign of input data_i, adjusts magnitude based on detected sign, segments the value into ranges, encodes these into internal sstep register, and outputs compressed data by XORing sstep with 0x55. This implementation ensures efficient A-law compression suitable for audio processing.
