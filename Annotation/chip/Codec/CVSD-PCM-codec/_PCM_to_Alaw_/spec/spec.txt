Module name: PCM_to_Alaw. 

Module specification: The PCM_to_Alaw module is designed for the conversion of 16-bit PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) data to 8-bit A-law compressed data. It features an input port `data_i` that accepts the 16-bit PCM data, with the most significant bit determining the sign of the input data. The output port `data_o` delivers the derived 8-bit A-law compressed data. Internally, the module utilizes two registers: `fstep` and `sstep`. The `fstep` register holds the modified version of `data_i`, adjusting for the signalâ€™s negativity by inverting the lower 15 bits if required. The `sstep` register is used to encode the magnitude of `fstep` and its sign into A-law format. In processing, the module segments values of `fstep` into various ranges, encodes these into `sstep` based on detected magnitude, and outputs the final compressed A-law value via XOR operation with 0x55 on `sstep`. This effectively prepares and encodes the data for communications or audio processing applications requiring A-law formatted data. The module efficiently translates the input data magnitude and sign into properly compressed output through a sequence of logical and conditional operations, encapsulating the A-law algorithm requirements in hardware for optimized performance.
