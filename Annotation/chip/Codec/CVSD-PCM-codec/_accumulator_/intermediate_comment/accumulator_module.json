    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"accumulator\" module synchronously computes and adjusts a 16-bit data output based on input control signals and arithmetic operations. It uses a clock (`clk_i`) for updates, a reset (`rst_i`) to zero its values, and an enable (`enable_i`) for operational control. The module processes the input (`data_i` and `b_i`) through conditional additions/subtractions, maintaining outputs within defined limits using `data_tmp`, `data_max`, and `data_min`. Final output (`data_o`) is formatted by strategic bit-wise manipulation of internal calculated values."
