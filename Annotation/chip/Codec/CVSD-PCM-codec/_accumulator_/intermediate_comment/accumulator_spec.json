    "spec": "Module name: accumulator. \n\nModule specification: The \"accumulator\" module is designed for digital signal processing purposes, using arithmetic operations based on various input conditions to conditionally update the value of an internal accumulator. The module operates synchronously with a clock signal, `clk_i`, and incorporates a reset signal, `rst_i`, which zeros the accumulator when activated. It processes 16-bit signed data input through `data_i`, using an enable signal, `enable_i`, to allow updates and uses a boolean input `b_i` to determine the operation mode (addition or subtraction). The module outputs a 16-bit data value `data_o`, derived through masking and shifting operations performed on a modified internal value. Internally, the module utilizes several signals: `data_max` and `data_min` to bound the adjusted data within specific ranges, `data_tmp` to store intermediate calculation results, `data` which is derived by further adjustments from `data_stop` which in turn is calculated using the limits defined by `data_max` and `data_min`. The primary operations occur in a clock-triggered block where the accumulator (i.e., `data_tmp`) gets updated based on `data_y`, which is calculated from the arithmetic operations depending on the mode dictated by `b_i`. The output is then derived by selecting the upper bits of `data` to obtain `data_o`. This module effectively manages condition-based calculations and result formatting, all synchronized to a clock signal and controlled by the reset and enable states.",

The module takes in a clock signal `clk_i`, a reset signal `rst_i`, an enable signal `enable_i`, a 16-bit data input `data_i`, and a boolean input `b_i`. It produces a 16-bit data output `data_o`. Internally, it uses several local parameters to define bounds and manipulates `data_i` along with the previous output `data_o` based on the value of `b_i`. The operations involve conditional additions or subtractions and range limitations (saturating to max/min values) to produce the target result in `data_tmp`. The final output `data_o` is determined by shifting and masking operations based on `data_tmp`. The functionality is sensitive to the clock signal for synchronous updates and includes a reset condition that sets the accumulator to zero. This allows the module to accumulate or adjust data over time, conditionally reset or enable based on the input signals received."
