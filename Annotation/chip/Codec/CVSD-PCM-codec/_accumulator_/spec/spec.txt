Module name: accumulator. 

Module specification: The "accumulator" module is designed for digital signal processing purposes, using arithmetic operations based on various input conditions to conditionally update the value of an internal accumulator. The module operates synchronously with a clock signal, `clk_i`, and incorporates a reset signal, `rst_i`, which zeros the accumulator when activated. It processes 16-bit signed data input through `data_i`, using an enable signal, `enable_i`, to allow updates and uses a boolean input `b_i` to determine the operation mode (addition or subtraction). The module outputs a 16-bit data value `data_o`, derived through masking and shifting operations performed on a modified internal value. Internally, the module utilizes several signals: `data_max` and `data_min` to bound the adjusted data within specific ranges, `data_tmp` to store intermediate calculation results, `data` which is derived by further adjustments from `data_stop` which in turn is calculated using the limits defined by `data_max` and `data_min`. The primary operations occur in a clock-triggered block where the accumulator (i.e., `data_tmp`) gets updated based on `data_y`, which is calculated from the arithmetic operations depending on the mode dictated by `b_i`. The output is then derived by selecting the upper bits of `data` to obtain `data_o`. This module effectively manages condition-based calculations and result formatting, all synchronized to a clock signal and controlled by the reset and enable states.
