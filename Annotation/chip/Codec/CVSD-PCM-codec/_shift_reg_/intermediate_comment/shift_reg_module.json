    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"shift_reg\" module is a 4-bit shift register that shifts its data left by one bit on each clock cycle when enabled. It utilizes a `data` register for storing current state, shifting its contents with the rising edge of `clk_i` when `enable_i` is high. Resets to zero via `rst_i`. New bits are introduced through `data_i`, outputted through `data_o`."
