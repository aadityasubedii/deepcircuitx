    "spec": "Module name: shift_reg.\n\nModule specification:\nThe \"shift_reg\" module is a 4-bit shift register designed in Verilog, suitable for digital systems requiring sequential data manipulation. The primary function of this module is to shift its 4-bit data content left by one bit on each clock cycle when enabled. The module interfaces through several ports; `enable_i` is a control input that, when high, allows the shift operation to engage with the syncing clock input `clk_i`. The `rst_i` input serves as a reset control, clearing the shift register to zero when asserted high. `data_i` provides the new bit value that gets loaded into the least significant bit of the register post-shift. The shift register outputs its current 4-bit state via `data_o`.\n\nInternally, the module utilizes a 4-bit register `data` to hold its actual shifting value. Operational behavior of `data` is determined by edge-triggered behavior sensitive to the rising edge of `clk_i`. During each clock cycle, if `rst_i` is high, `data` is reset to zero. Conversely, if `enable_i` is high, the content of `data` shifts left by one bit, incorporating `data_i` into its least significant bit. This shifted value is then available on the output port `data_o`. A direct assignment links the internal signal `data` to output `data_o`, ensuring the module's external visibility of its internal state. This concise setup efficiently covers the typical operations required in shift register logic handling within digital circuits.",
