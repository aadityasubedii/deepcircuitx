The register shifts its data content to the left by one bit (towards more significant bits) whenever the `enable_i` input is high, and it receives a clock edge on `clk_i`. The least significant bit of the register is loaded with the input `data_i` after each shift. If the reset input `rst_i` is high during a rising clock edge, the shift register is reset, setting all bits to 0. The current state of the shift register's 4 bits is continuously outputted through `data_o`."
