Module name: audio_memory.
Module specification: The 'audio_memory' module is designed for accessing or storing audio data. This module interfaces with inputs that determine the location within the memory and synchronize the data access as well as an output that manages the data retrieved from memory. Specifically, the input ports include 'address_sig' and 'clock_sig'. 'address_sig' is used to specify the particular memory address to fetch or record audio data, ensuring accurate data location is referenced. 'clock_sig' serves as a critical input that synchronizes the memory operations with the system's clock for consistent timing across operations. The module has one output port, 'q_sig', which outputs the data fetched from the memory location set by 'address_sig'. Internally, these signals function as connectors within the module instanceâ€”'address_sig' and 'clock_sig' facilitate correct timing and address specification, while 'q_sig' provides the necessary data output. The code is primarily structured around the instantiation of the 'audio_memory' block, which effectively manages the interfacing and operational logistics for memory management concerning audio data, encapsulating critical functionalities of address specification, operation timing, and data retrieval within a synchronized environment.
