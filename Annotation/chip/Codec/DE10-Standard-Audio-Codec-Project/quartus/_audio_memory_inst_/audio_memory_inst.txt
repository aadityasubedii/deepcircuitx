Module-level comment: The 'audio_memory' module is designed for storing and retrieving audio data. It utilizes 'address_sig' to select memory locations, 'clock_sig' to synchronize operations, and 'q_sig' to output the data from the desired address. This setup ensures efficient and timed data access within audio systems.
