Module name: Unreadable. 

Module specification: Unfortunately, the Verilog code provided remains corrupted and contains non-readable characters, rendering it impossible to accurately determine the module's name, functionality, input and output ports, internal signals, and block descriptions. The corrupted content does not allow for any meaningful interpretation or processing in its current state. To proceed with generating a detailed and accurate Verbiage module specification, it is essential to resubmit the code in a clear, uncorrupted format. This would enable a comprehensive analysis and thereby foster the creation of a precise specification reflecting the true design and operation of the intended Verilog module.
