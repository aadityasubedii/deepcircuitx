Module name: audio_memory. Module specification: The audio_memory module, designed with Verilog, serves as a read-only memory (ROM) specifically for storing and retrieving pre-defined audio data on an FPGA using internal memory blocks. It includes input ports 'address' (18-bit) which allows users to specify the ROM memory address for data retrieval, and 'clock' (1-bit) which synchronizes the reading operations with the system clock. The output port 'q' (16-bit) outputs the audio data retrieved from the ROM. An internal signal, 'sub_wire0' (16-bit), is used as an intermediary connection between the output 'q_a' of the 'altsyncram' component and the module's output 'q'. The module encapsulates an 'altsyncram' block configured primarily for ROM with parameters like device family and memory initialization file specified, facilitating efficient data management. Key parameter settings include no address clearing, clock bypass enabled for input and output, and defining the operating mode as ROM to optimize the FPGA's resources for fixed audio content storage and retrieval. This structure ensures low-latency access to audio data, critical for applications where audio playback timing is crucial.
