It receives a memory address via the 'address' input and outputs the corresponding 16-bit data stored at that address through 'q'. This operation is synchronized with a clock signal 'clock'. The module utilizes an 'altsyncram' component, configured primarily for ROM usage with specific parameters like device family and memory initialization file. This setup indicates that the module is used for storing and retrieving pre-defined audio data efficiently."

This port is used to access specific locations in the ROM to retrieve audio data. \n- 'clock' is a single bit input that provides the timing signal for the module's operations. It ensures that the reading operations are synchronized with the system's clock, hence aiding in consistent and timely data retrieval.\n\nOutput ports: [q]. \nExplanation: \n- 'q' is a 16-bit output that represents the data retrieved from the memory at the specified address.
