Module-level comment: The `audio_memory` module acts as a read-only memory (ROM) designed for storing and retrieving audio data within an FPGA. It deploys an `altsyncram` component, configured as ROM, enabling efficient, pre-defined audio playback. The module uses an 18-bit address input for data location and a clock signal for synchronization, while delivering 16-bit audio data at the output. This streamlined approach ensures consistent and timely access to audio content, optimized by the FPGA's internal memory capabilities.
