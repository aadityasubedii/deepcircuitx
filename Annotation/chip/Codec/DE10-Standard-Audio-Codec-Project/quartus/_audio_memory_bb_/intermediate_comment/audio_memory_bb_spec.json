    "spec": "Module name: audio_memory. Module specification: The `audio_memory` module is designed specifically for memory interfacing within an audio application, handling the transfer and retrieval of data based on memory addressing. It is primarily configured to receive an 18-bit wide input `address` and a `clock` signal. The `address` input indicates the specific memory location from which data should be retrieved, crucial for read operations. The `clock` input ensures synchronization of data operations, maintaining stable data flow and integrity during memory accesses. The module outputs a 16-bit data on the `q` output port, which holds the data fetched from the specified memory address, ready for further processing or use in the system. There are no internal signals defined in the visible code snippet, suggesting minimal internal state handling or data processing within this module itself. The code includes conditional compilation sections identified by `ifndef ALTERA_RESERVED_QIS`, which are likely included for better integration and compatibility with specific Altera synthesis tool settings in Quartus II environments. These sections do not contain additional code in the provided snippet, highlighting that their primary purpose might be configuration management or tool-specific directives. Moreover, the `clock` signal is also defined as `tri1`, suggesting a possible tri-state configuration used under specific conditions not detailed in the snippet, likely part of a larger, integrated design or tool-specific requirement. The overall setup hints at a template or a subsection of a larger system where the actual memory handling logic could be situated elsewhere or in other modules.",
