Module name: audio_pll. Module specification: The `audio_pll` module is a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) designed for audio applications, ensuring stability and synchronization of output signals with a reference clock for precise audio processing. The module features two input ports: `refclk` (Reference Clock), which provides the reference signal for the PLL to synchronize the output clock, and `rst` (Reset), used to reinitialize the PLL state during power-up or re-synchronization. The output ports include `outclk_0` (Output Clock 0), delivering a stable, phase-aligned clock signal essential for audio applications, and `locked`, an indicator signal that confirms whether the PLL output is synchronized with the reference clock. Internally, the `audio_pll` module does not define or use any signals; it functions mainly as a wrapper that interfaces with an instantiated module `audio_pll_0002`, passing input and output signals directly through without additional processing. This structure highlights a focused design where `audio_pll` acts predominantly as a conduit, facilitating seamless connection and signal integrity between `audio_pll_0002` and other system components.
