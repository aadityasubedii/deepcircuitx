    "spec": "Module name: audio_pll. Module specification: The `audio_pll` module is a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) designed for audio applications, ensuring stability and synchronization of output signals with a reference clock for precise audio processing. The module features two input ports: `refclk` (Reference Clock), which provides the reference signal for the PLL to synchronize the output clock, and `rst` (Reset), used to reinitialize the PLL state during power-up or re-synchronization. The output ports include `outclk_0` (Output Clock 0), delivering a stable, phase-aligned clock signal essential for audio applications, and `locked`, an indicator signal that confirms whether the PLL output is synchronized with the reference clock. Internally, the `audio_pll` module does not define or use any signals; it functions mainly as a wrapper that interfaces with an instantiated module `audio_pll_0002`, passing input and output signals directly through without additional processing. This structure highlights a focused design where `audio_pll` acts predominantly as a conduit, facilitating seamless connection and signal integrity between `audio_pll_0002` and other system components.",

It takes a reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset signal (`rst`) as inputs and provides a derived output clock (`outclk_0`) and a lock indicator (`locked`). The PLL is used to generate a stable clock signal which is phase-aligned to the reference clock, useful for maintaining consistent timing in audio processing operations. The instantiation of `audio_pll_0002` suggests this is a specific configuration or version of the audio PLL."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports: refclk, rst.\nExplanation: \n- `refclk` (Reference Clock): This is the input clock signal to the PLL. It serves as the reference for the PLL to lock its generated clock signal to, ensuring the output clock is synchronized with this reference.\n- `rst` (Reset): This is a control signal used to reset the PLL. When active, it initializes the internal state of the PLL, effectively starting the lock process afresh. This is crucial for scenarios where the PLL needs to be re-synchronized or during power-up.\n\nOutput ports: outclk_0, locked.\nExplanation: \n- `outclk_0` (Output Clock 0): This is the output clock signal from the PLL. It is a stable clock signal that is phase-aligned to the reference clock, refclk. This clock is typically used for timing critical audio processing applications where synchronization with the input clock is essential.\n- `locked` (Locked Indicator): This is an output signal that indicates whether the PLL has successfully locked its output to the reference clock. A high signal generally means the PLL is locked and the output clock is stable, while a low signal indicates it's not locked and thus might still be trying to synchronize or stabilize."
