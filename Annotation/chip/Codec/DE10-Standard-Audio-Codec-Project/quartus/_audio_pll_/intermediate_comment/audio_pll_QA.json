It takes a reference clock (`refclk`) and a reset signal (`rst`) as inputs and provides a derived output clock (`outclk_0`) and a lock indicator (`locked`). The PLL is used to generate a stable clock signal which is phase-aligned to the reference clock, useful for maintaining consistent timing in audio processing operations. The instantiation of `audio_pll_0002` suggests this is a specific configuration or version of the audio PLL."

It serves as the reference for the PLL to lock its generated clock signal to, ensuring the output clock is synchronized with this reference.\n- `rst` (Reset): This is a control signal used to reset the PLL. When active, it initializes the internal state of the PLL, effectively starting the lock process afresh. This is crucial for scenarios where the PLL needs to be re-synchronized or during power-up.\n\nOutput ports: outclk_0, locked.\nExplanation: \n- `outclk_0` (Output Clock 0): This is the output clock signal from the PLL. It is a stable clock signal that is phase-aligned to the reference clock, refclk. This clock is typically used for timing critical audio processing applications where synchronization with the input clock is essential.\n- `locked` (Locked Indicator): This is an output signal that indicates whether the PLL has successfully locked its output to the reference clock. A high signal generally means the PLL is locked and the output clock is stable, while a low signal indicates it's not locked and thus might still be trying to synchronize or stabilize."
