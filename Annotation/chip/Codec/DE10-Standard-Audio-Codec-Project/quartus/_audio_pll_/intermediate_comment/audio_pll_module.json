    "module": "Module-level comment: The `audio_pll` module is a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) designed for audio applications, ensuring clock synchronization with an input reference (`refclk`). It uses the `audio_pll_0002` instantiation to achieve its functionality, interfacing directly through its inputs (`refclk`, `rst`) and outputs (`outclk_0`, `locked`), serving primarily as a pass-through module without additional logic or internal signals. This setup provides phase-aligned clock output and a locked status indicator, crucial for maintaining precise timing in audio systems."
