Module name: audio_pll_0002. Module specification: The `audio_pll_0002` module utilizes a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to generate a stabilized output clock frequency of 12.000000 MHz from a 50.0 MHz reference clock, indicated for use in systems requiring precise signal synchronization. The module holds two input ports: `refclk`, which is the reference clock input essential for baseline frequency settings, and `rst`, functioning as the reset control that initializes the PLL's configuration when asserted. The outputs consist of `outclk_0`, the derived 12.000000 MHz clock, and `locked`, a status signal confirming whether the PLL has locked to the desired frequency. Internally, the `fboutclk` is mentioned but unused, symbolizing a potential feedback path for more complex adaptations; `fbclk` is statically set to `1'b0`, indicating a non-dynamic feedback input in this design. The core of the module leverages an instantiated altera_pll block parameterized for single frequency output, embedded within which is the PLL's main operational logic responsible for frequency synthesis and stabilization based on the input reference clock. This structure ensures the module efficiently maintains the desired output frequency under standard operational conditions.
