Module-level comment: The `audio_pll_0002` module generates a 12 MHz clock from a 50 MHz input using a PLL. It includes inputs `refclk` (reference clock) and `rst` (reset), and outputs `outclk_0` (resultant clock) and `locked` (status). Internally, it features an altera_pll instance for frequency synthesis, with the feedback mechanism statically defined, ensuring stable clock output under predefined settings.
