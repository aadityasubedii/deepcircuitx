Module-level comment: The Audio_Tri_State module manages the tri-state logic for an I2C audio interface data line, AUD_SDAT. It uses two input signals: I2C_data_to_send and ACK_cycle, to either drive AUD_SDAT with data or set it to high impedance. The output, returned_ack_n, directly reflects the state of AUD_SDAT, facilitating feedback on its transmission status. The implementation uses conditional assignments for efficient state management of the data line.
