The data line (AUD_SDAT) can be driven with a data signal (I2C_data_to_send) or be set to high-impedance (Z) based on the control signal (ACK_cycle). The module returns an acknowledgment signal (returned_ack_n) that is directly connected to the state of AUD_SDAT, allowing external systems to detect the current status of the data line. When ACK_cycle is high, AUD_SDAT is set to high-impedance, otherwise, it carries the I2C data."

This is typically part of the I2C communication where data is sent from this module to another device.\n- ACK_cycle is a control signal used to determine whether the AUD_SDAT should be driven with the I2C_data_to_send or left in a high-impedance state (1'bz). When ACK_cycle is high, AUD_SDAT is set to high-impedance, making it inactive for data transmission.\n\nOutput ports: returned_ack_n.\nExplanation:\n- returned_ack_n is an output signal that mirrors the state of the AUD_SDAT line. It is used to acknowledge whether AUD_SDAT is actively driving a signal or set to high-impedance. It directly follows the state of AUD_SDAT, providing feedback about the data line status to external systems or other parts of the design.\n\nInout port: AUD_SDAT.\nExplanation:\n- AUD_SDAT is a bi-directional data line for the I2C bus, which can either drive the I2C_data_to_send to external devices or be set to a high-impedance (Z) state. It's controlled based on the ACK_cycle signal, facilitating different modes of operation depending on the I2C communication needs and timing."
