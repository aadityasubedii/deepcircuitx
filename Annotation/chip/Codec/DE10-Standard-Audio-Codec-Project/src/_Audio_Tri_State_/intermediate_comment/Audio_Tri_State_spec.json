    "spec": "Module name: Audio_Tri_State.\nModule specification: The Audio_Tri_State module is designed to control the data line AUD_SDAT of an audio interface, specifically handling tri-state logic for I2C communications. It includes three ports: \"I2C_data_to_send\" (input), which carries the data signal to be driven onto AUD_SDAT; \"ACK_cycle\" (input), a control signal that determines whether AUD_SDAT should output I2C_data_to_send or be left in high-impedance; and \"returned_ack_n\" (output), which reflects the current state of AUD_SDAT to indicate whether it is actively driving a signal or is in high impedance. Internally, the module does not use additional signals; instead, it directly manipulates the AUD_SDAT bi-directional port and returned_ack_n output based on the states of the I2C_data_to_send and ACK_cycle inputs. The code is succinctly divided into two assignment statements: one that links AUD_SDAT's state to the ACK_cycle and I2C_data_to_send, and another that mirrors AUD_SDAT's state onto returned_ack_n, thereby providing a simple yet effective mechanism to manage the data line\u2019s tri-state and acknowledgment functionalities within I2C communication scenarios.",

The data line (AUD_SDAT) can be driven with a data signal (I2C_data_to_send) or be set to high-impedance (Z) based on the control signal (ACK_cycle). The module returns an acknowledgment signal (returned_ack_n) that is directly connected to the state of AUD_SDAT, allowing external systems to detect the current status of the data line.
