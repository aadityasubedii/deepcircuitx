Module name: Audio_Tri_State.
Module specification: The Audio_Tri_State module is designed to control the data line AUD_SDAT of an audio interface, specifically handling tri-state logic for I2C communications. It includes three ports: "I2C_data_to_send" (input), which carries the data signal to be driven onto AUD_SDAT; "ACK_cycle" (input), a control signal that determines whether AUD_SDAT should output I2C_data_to_send or be left in high-impedance; and "returned_ack_n" (output), which reflects the current state of AUD_SDAT to indicate whether it is actively driving a signal or is in high impedance. Internally, the module does not use additional signals; instead, it directly manipulates the AUD_SDAT bi-directional port and returned_ack_n output based on the states of the I2C_data_to_send and ACK_cycle inputs. The code is succinctly divided into two assignment statements: one that links AUD_SDAT's state to the ACK_cycle and I2C_data_to_send, and another that mirrors AUD_SDAT's state onto returned_ack_n, thereby providing a simple yet effective mechanism to manage the data lineâ€™s tri-state and acknowledgment functionalities within I2C communication scenarios.
