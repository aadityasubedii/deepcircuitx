The module controls the I2C clock (SCLK) and data (SDAT) lines based on the current state of the operation defined in parameters and state transitions. It handles the initialization and cycling of states from detecting when to transmit, generating start and stop conditions, addressing, and handling data transfers including sending data bytes and receiving acknowledgments (ACKs) from the I2C device. The state transitions are managed through a sequence of defined states including Wait_For_Transmit, Start_Condition, Send_Address, acknowledgment receptions, and data sends, finishing with a Stop_Condition to end the communication cycle."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports: `clk`, `reset_n`.\nExplanation: \n- `clk`: This is the clock input. It provides the timing signal that drives the operations of the entire state machine, synchronizing the state transitions and data handling.\n- `reset_n`: This is the reset input, which is active low. It is used to reset the state machine to the initial state (Wait_For_Transmit) and initialize any other necessary signals and registers. This ensures the state machine starts in a known state when powered up or after a reset is triggered.\n\nOutput ports: `FPGA_I2C_SCLK`, `FPGA_I2C_SDAT`.\nExplanation:\n- `FPGA_I2C_SCLK`: This output port drives the I2C clock line (SCLK). It controls the timing of data transfer on the I2C bus, aligning with the requirements for synchronization between the FPGA and the connected I2C device.\n- `FPGA_I2C_SDAT`: This is an inout port that manages the I2C data line (SDAT). It serves dual purposes: it sends data to the I2C device and also reads data back from the I2C device, particularly for acknowledgment (ACK) checking during data transfers. The control logic within the module configures it either as an output when sending data or address, and as an input when waiting for ACK from the I2C device."
