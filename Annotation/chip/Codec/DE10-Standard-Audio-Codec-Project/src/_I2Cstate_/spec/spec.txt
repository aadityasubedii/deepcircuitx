Module name: I2Cstate. Module specification: The "I2Cstate" module implements an I2C state machine for facilitating communication between an FPGA and an I2C device, managing the I2C clock (SCLK) and data (SDAT) lines. Input ports include `clk` (a clock signal that synchronizes state transitions and data operations) and `reset_n` (an active low reset that initializes the state machine). Output ports include `FPGA_I2C_SCLK` (drives the I2C clock line) and `FPGA_I2C_SDAT` (controls the I2C data line allowing data sending and ACK reception). Internal signals such as `current_state`, `next_state`, `SDAT`, and derived clocks (`dataClk`, `clkClk`) manage the processes within each state of the state machine. The code is organized into several always blocks: one controls the production of derived clocks based on the input clock, another handles state transitions, one block manages the sending data and reading ACKs across the states using state-dependant logic, and a last block is used for updating the clock signal to drive the I2C bus. Additionally, the module parameterizes states for clarity and operational direction, including states for initializing transmission, sending an address, handling ACKs, and sending data.
