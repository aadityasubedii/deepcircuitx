Module name: Digital_Audio_Interface. Module specification: The Digital_Audio_Interface module is designed to handle audio data for interfacing with external audio systems, such as DACs. It uses input ports 'reset_n', an active low reset signal that initializes internal states and counters, and 'clkin', which provides the clocking mechanism for the module's data processing activities. The output ports include 'AUD_DACDAT', which outputs processed audio data, 'AUD_DACLRCK', a latch clock to synchronize audio data with external devices, and 'AUD_BCLK', a bit clock essential for internal timing and management of data synchronization. The module utilizes several internal signals: 'memOut', a temporary storage for audio data fetched from memory; 'address', which points to the current data location in memory; 'dataOut', a wider bus to accommodate audio data formatted for output; 'clock_counter', which is crucial for managing data fetching and output timings; 'DACLRCK_DAT', which toggles in sync with 'clock_counter' to manage the output latch clock; 'DataAcquisition', which indicates when the module is in the data fetching state; and 'Q', serving as an auxiliary counter that influences the address and timing within the module. Two primary blocks in the Verilog code handle different aspects of operation: one block triggers on the negative edge of 'AUD_BCLK' for handling the auxiliary counter 'Q' and data acquisition states. The other block also triggers on the negative edge of 'AUD_BCLK' or on reset ('reset_n'), managing audio data fetching, processing timelines through 'address', 'clock_counter', 'DACLRCK_DAT', and updating the 'dataOut' which is directly assigned to 'AUD_DACDAT', following the duplicating of 'memOut' data to fill the 32-bit 'dataOut' register. This detailed structuring ensures efficient data handling and synchronization with external audio components.
