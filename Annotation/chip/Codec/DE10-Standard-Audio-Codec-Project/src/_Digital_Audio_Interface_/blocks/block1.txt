Comment: 
This Verilog code block assigns the output `AUD_DACDAT` to the value of `dataOut`. This operation directly outputs the audio data stored in `dataOut` to the `AUD_DACDAT` line, which is typically connected to a digital-to-analog converter in audio applications. This assignment enables the seamless transmission of digital audio data for analog playback.
