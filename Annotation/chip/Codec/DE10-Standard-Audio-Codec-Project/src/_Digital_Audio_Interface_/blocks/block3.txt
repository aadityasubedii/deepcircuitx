Comment: 
This Verilog code block functions as a counter controller with condition-based reset for data acquisition. It triggers on the negative edge of the `AUD_BCLK` clock signal. When the `DataAcquisition` signal is high and the counter `Q` reaches 240254, the counter is reset to 0. If `Q` is not at 240254, it incrementally advances by 1. If neither condition is met, `Q` also resets to 0, ensuring it does not exceed the specified maximum value.
