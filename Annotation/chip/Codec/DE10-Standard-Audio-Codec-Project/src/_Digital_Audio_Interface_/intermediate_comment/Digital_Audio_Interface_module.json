    "module": "Module-level comment: The Digital_Audio_Interface module interfaces audio data with external systems, leveraging input controls through 'reset_n' and 'clkin'. It outputs processed audio via 'AUD_DACDAT', 'AUD_DACLRCK', and 'AUD_BCLK'. Internal mechanisms facilitated by 'address', 'clock_counter', 'DACLRCK_DAT', and others, manage data synchronization and timing. Both memory reading from 'audio_memory_inst' and processing logic in sequential always blocks are tuned to the negative edge of 'AUD_BCLK', ensuring accurate data handling and output synchronization."
