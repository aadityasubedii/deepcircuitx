    "spec": "Module name: Digital_Audio_Interface. Module specification: The Digital_Audio_Interface module is designed to handle audio data for interfacing with external audio systems, such as DACs. It uses input ports 'reset_n', an active low reset signal that initializes internal states and counters, and 'clkin', which provides the clocking mechanism for the module's data processing activities. The output ports include 'AUD_DACDAT', which outputs processed audio data, 'AUD_DACLRCK', a latch clock to synchronize audio data with external devices, and 'AUD_BCLK', a bit clock essential for internal timing and management of data synchronization. The module utilizes several internal signals: 'memOut', a temporary storage for audio data fetched from memory; 'address', which points to the current data location in memory; 'dataOut', a wider bus to accommodate audio data formatted for output; 'clock_counter', which is crucial for managing data fetching and output timings; 'DACLRCK_DAT', which toggles in sync with 'clock_counter' to manage the output latch clock; 'DataAcquisition', which indicates when the module is in the data fetching state; and 'Q', serving as an auxiliary counter that influences the address and timing within the module. Two primary blocks in the Verilog code handle different aspects of operation: one block triggers on the negative edge of 'AUD_BCLK' for handling the auxiliary counter 'Q' and data acquisition states. The other block also triggers on the negative edge of 'AUD_BCLK' or on reset ('reset_n'), managing audio data fetching, processing timelines through 'address', 'clock_counter', 'DACLRCK_DAT', and updating the 'dataOut' which is directly assigned to 'AUD_DACDAT', following the duplicating of 'memOut' data to fill the 32-bit 'dataOut' register. This detailed structuring ensures efficient data handling and synchronization with external audio components.",

Key operations include reading audio data from a memory (`audio_memory_inst`), managing an address counter (`address`), and handling data sampling controlled through a clock count mechanism (`clock_counter`). The module continuously updates its internal counters and states based on the negative edge of the audio bit clock (`AUD_BCLK`) and a reset signal (`reset_n`). The DAC data rights signaling is toggled and controlled by `DACLRCK_DAT`, which also manages data acquisition timing and reset conditions. The end behavior is to feed dual-channel audio data, possibly to a DAC, where `dataOut` includes mirrored audio data from `memOut`."

It acts as a temporary register holding audio samples that are eventually processed and assigned to `dataOut` for output.\n- `address`: An 18-bit register that serves as the address pointer for the `audio_memory_inst`. It is updated based on specific conditions (like reset or specific clock cycles) to fetch the next required piece of audio data from memory.\n- `dataOut`: A 32-bit wire used to hold the audio data output that will be passed on to the `AUD_DACDAT` port.

It essentially orchestrates the timing of data handling and processing within the module.\n- `DACLRCK_DAT`: A single-bit register toggled between 0 and 1 based on the `clock_counter` value to control the audio data latch clock (`AUD_DACLRCK`). This signal helps in synchronization and indicates when new audio data should be considered stable and read by an external DAC.\n- `DataAcquisition`: A single-bit register used as a flag to indicate the active period of data acquisition. It is set when the clock cycle and conditions are right for acquiring and processing new audio data from memory.\n- `Q`: A 20-bit register acting as a secondary counter or more accurately, an extended part of addressing or control logic which is reset upon reaching a certain condition or is incremented otherwise to facilitate specific operational timing within the module, particularly influencing the `address` register."
