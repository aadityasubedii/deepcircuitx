Module-level comment: The 'tb' module serves as a testbench for the `I2Cstate` I2C state machine. It manipulates a clock (`clk`) and a reset (`reset_n`) signal to test the module under various conditions. Outputs (`FPGA_I2C_SCLK`, `FPGA_I2C_SDAT`) simulate I2C communication lines. The sequence and behavior of these signals are controlled via toggles and delays in the `always` and `initial` blocks, ensuring comprehensive testing of state transitions and error handling within `I2Cstate`.
