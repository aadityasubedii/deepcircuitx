Module name: tb. Module specification: The 'tb' module is a testbench designed for simulating and verifying the behavior of an I2C state machine encapsulated in the `I2Cstate` module. It employs a clock signal (`clk`) and a reset signal (`reset_n`, active low) as input ports, crucial for driving the state transitions and initialization of the I2C state machine respectively. The output ports include `FPGA_I2C_SCLK` and `FPGA_I2C_SDAT`, which respectively handle the serial clock and data lines for the I2C communication protocol. An internal signal, `current_state[3:0]`, is declared but not utilized in the provided code, indicating it's reserved for monitoring or debugging, showing the current state of the I2C state machine. The code starts with an `always` block, toggling the clock every 10 units of time. An `initial` block sequences the simulation; it initializes the clock and reset signal, provides a scenario of the reset sequence, and displays simulation status at critical points, thereby facilitating a controlled environment to validate the behavior of the `I2Cstate` module under different operational conditions.
