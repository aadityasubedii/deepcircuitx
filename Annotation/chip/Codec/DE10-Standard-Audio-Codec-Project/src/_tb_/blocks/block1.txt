Comment: 
This block initializes and controls the simulation environment timing for a digital system. It starts by setting `clk` to 0 and `reset_n` to 0 to maintain an initial reset state. After a delay of 20 time units, it de-asserts the reset (`reset_n = 1`) signaling the start of the simulation, as indicated by a display message. Subsequent reset signals and timing delays prepare and simulate different phases of operation, culminating in a final display message indicating completion after 35,000 time units.
