    "module": "Module-level comment: The Audio_Codec module configures FPGA for audio signal processing, interfacing through DAC/ADC, DRAM, and I2C communication. It utilizes quadruple 50 MHz clocks for various operations, keys and switches for control, and orchestrates multiple display and LED outputs. Internally, the module utilizes an audio-generated PLL clock and a clock divider to manage timing, alongside an I2C state machine to handle protocol communications, effectively managing audio data flow and device interfacing."
