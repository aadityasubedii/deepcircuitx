    "spec": "Module name: Audio_Codec. \nModule specification: The Audio_Codec module is designed to handle audio processing and interfacing on an FPGA, receiving four 50 MHz clock inputs and various user inputs through keys and switches to manage audio data via ADCs and DACs, as well as DRAM for storage. The module's inputs include `CLOCK2_50`, `CLOCK3_50`, `CLOCK4_50`, `CLOCK_50` for clock signals, `KEY` for button-based inputs, and `SW` for switch configurations. The outputs are multiple LEDs (`LEDR`), hexadecimal displays (`HEX0` to `HEX5`), DRAM control signals (`DRAM_*`), audio-specific outputs (`AUD_DACDAT`, `AUD_XCK`), and ADC control signals (`ADC_*`). Additionally, I2C communication signals (`FPGA_I2C_SCLK`, `FPGA_I2C_SDAT`) are included. Internal signals such as `next_state` for managing state transitions in I2C communications, `clk` derived from `clk_divider` for internal timing, `Chip_Address` for specifying target device addresses in communications, and `pllClk` from the `audio_pll` for synchronizing audio operations underscore the module\u2019s functionality. The code integrates `audio_pll` for generating necessary clock adaptations, a `clk_divider` for adjusting main clock frequency to required operational speeds, and an `I2Cstate` machine for handling I2C communication protocols efficiently. These elements collectively facilitate effective configuration and interfacing with audio components, while also managing data flows between the module and external devices or storage solutions.",
