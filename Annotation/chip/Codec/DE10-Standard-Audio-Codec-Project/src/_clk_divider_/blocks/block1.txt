Comment: 
This block of code defines a 1 Hz clock signal named `CLOCK_1_HZ` by assigning it the value of `slow_clock`. The implementation simply maps an existing slower clock signal, presumably already scaled down from a higher frequency, directly to a new signal, effectively renaming or reusing it for clarity or modular design purposes within the larger digital system. This allows for easy reference to the 1 Hz clock in other parts of the circuit design.
