    "spec": "Module name: clk_divider. \nModule specification: The clk_divider module enables frequency reduction by taking a high-frequency input signal 'main_clock' and producing a lower frequency output signal 'CLOCK_1_HZ'. It functions using an internal counter mechanism. The input port, 'main_clock', serves as the high-frequency clock source. The output port, 'CLOCK_1_HZ', provides the divided, low-frequency clock signal, reflecting the toggled state of the internal signal 'slow_clock'. Internally, the module utilizes three signals: 'divide' set to 25, to determine the total division factor; 'divide_counter', a counter that increments on each positive edge of 'main_clock' until it matches 'divide' - 1; and 'slow_clock', which toggles its state when 'divide_counter' resets, defining the output frequency. The core functional block of the code, contained within an always block, checks the value of 'divide_counter' and either resets it while toggling 'slow_clock' or increments it, ensuring precise control over the timing and frequency generation. This module essentially halves the input clock frequency specified by twice the value of 'divide', resulting in the output 'CLOCK_1_HZ'.",

It achieves this by using a counter ('divide_counter') which increments on each rising edge of the input clock. When this counter matches the predetermined value ('divide' minus 1), it resets to zero and toggles the state of the 'slow_clock'.
