    "block_comment": "This block generates a slower clock from a faster main clock. It achieves this by using a counter (`divide_counter`) that increments on each positive edge of the main clock (`main_clock`). When the counter matches a preset value (`divide - 1`), it resets to zero and toggles the state of `slow_clock`, effectively reducing the frequency of `slow_clock` by a factor of `divide`. If the counter has not reached the target, it simply increments by one."
