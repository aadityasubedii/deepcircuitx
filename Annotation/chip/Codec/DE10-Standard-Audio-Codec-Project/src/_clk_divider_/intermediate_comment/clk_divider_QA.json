It achieves this by using a counter ('divide_counter') which increments on each rising edge of the input clock. When this counter matches the predetermined value ('divide' minus 1), it resets to zero and toggles the state of the 'slow_clock'. This toggling effectively divides the frequency of 'main_clock' by twice the value stored in 'divide', generating the slow clock signal 'CLOCK_1_HZ'."

Explanation: 'CLOCK_1_HZ' is the output signal of the module and represents the divided clock signal.
