    "module": "Module-level comment: The full_adder_subtractor module performs bitwise addition and subtraction on two inputs, x and y, using cin for addition carry-in and bin for subtraction borrow-in. It calculates sum, diff using XOR operations, cout using AND and OR for carry propagation, and bout using NOT, AND, and OR to determine borrow necessity. This integrates essential arithmetic functionalities through simple logical operations."
