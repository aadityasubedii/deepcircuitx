Module name: full_adder_subtractor. Module specification: The full_adder_subtractor module is specifically designed to perform both addition and subtraction on two binary inputs, `x` and `y`. The operations utilize an additional input carry (`cin`) for addition and a borrow input (`bin`) for subtraction. The module outputs the results through four ports: `sum` displays the result of the bitwise addition, `diff` shows the outcome of the bitwise subtraction, `cout` is the carry-out from the addition, and `bout` is the borrow-out from the subtraction. Internally, the module utilizes XOR operations to compute `sum` and `diff`. The computation of `sum` requires an XOR operation across `x`, `y`, and `cin`, factoring in the carry during addition, while `diff` uses XOR for `x`, `y`, and `bin`, accounting for the borrow during subtraction. The `cout` is obtained from a combination of AND and OR operations to check where carry propagates during addition, specifically `(x & y) | ((x ^ y) & cin)`. The `bout` is calculated using NOT, AND, and OR operations, designated as `((~x) & y) | ((~(x ^ y)) & bin)`, to determine the necessity of a borrow in the subtraction operation. This module efficiently handles basic arithmetic operations, showing a clear division of functionality in its design and implementation, utilizing gate-level logic operations in its internal calculations.
