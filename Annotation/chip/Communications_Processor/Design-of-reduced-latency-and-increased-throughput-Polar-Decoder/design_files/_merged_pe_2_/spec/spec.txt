Module name: merged_pe_2. Module specification: The 'merged_pe_2' module is responsible for merging and processing two 9-bit input signals, labeled 'merge_in1' and 'merge_in2', each consisting of an 8-bit magnitude and a sign bit. The module produces three 9-bit output signals named 'merge_out1', 'merge_out2', and 'merge_out3'. The functionality is primarily centered around arithmetic operations and sign handling, and it involves two's complement to sign-magnitude conversions, exclusive OR operations for sign bit comparisons, sum and difference calculations, and conditional operations based on arithmetic and sign results. Internally, the module utilizes wires such as 't_to_s_merge1' and 't_to_s_merge2' to store the sign-magnitude converted forms of inputs, 'int_sum' and 'int_diff' for resultant sum and differences, 'ex_or_out' for the XOR result of input signs, signals like 'merge_cmp_out' and 'merge_combined_cmp_out' for handling conditional logic, and 'sign_o_q2' and 'sign_o_q3' from a sign processing unit to adjust the output signs. Major blocks within the code include instances of the 'two_to_sign' module for conversions, 'pe_1_modified' for arithmetic operations, and 'sign_processing_unit' for determining output signs based on various conditions. 'merged_pe_2' efficiently combines these elements to output the processed signals through converting, calculating, and conditional selection stages, ensuring accurate output representations post processing.
