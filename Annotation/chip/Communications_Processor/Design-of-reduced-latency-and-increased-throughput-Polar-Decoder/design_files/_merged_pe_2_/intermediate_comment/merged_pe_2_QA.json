The transformations inside the module include sign conversion from two's complement, comparison operations, conditional selection, and sum and difference calculations with sign adjustment. The module employs blocks like 'two_to_sign' and 'pe_1_modified' to perform specific tasks like converting two's complement to sign-magnitude form and performing arithmetic operations respectively, along with sign adjustments and conditional selections, culminating in outputs in the required form."

Each 9-bit input consists of an 8-bit magnitude and a sign bit (most significant bit).\n\nOutput ports: [merge_out1, merge_out2, merge_out3].\nExplanation: The outputs 'merge_out1', 'merge_out2', and 'merge_out3' are 9-bit wide signals that result from the processed inputs. 'merge_out1' is formed by applying sign conversion, comparison, and conditional operation based on the inputs and their computed exclusive OR. 'merge_out2' and 'merge_out3' represent the sum and difference, respectively, of the input values processed through arithmetic operations and sign adjustment stages, suitably converted to have the correct sign. Each output consists of an 8-bit magnitude and a sign bit (most significant bit), providing the final processed values after the module's computation stages."

They play a role in making the inputs ready for further comparison and arithmetic operations.\n  \n- **ex_or_out**: This signal stores the result of the XOR operation between the sign bits of `t_to_s_merge1` and `t_to_s_merge2`. It reflects whether the signs of the two input numbers are different; used for controlling certain conditional logic in the code.\n\n- **int_sum** and **int_diff**: These are the outputs from the `pe_1_modified` module, representing the sum and difference of the lower 8 bits (magnitude parts) of `t_to_s_merge1` and `t_to_s_merge2`. These values are the intermediates needed to create the signed outputs `merge_out2` and `merge_out3`.\n\n- **b_n**: This is a control signal generated by the `pe_1_modified` unit indicating the borrow output as `bout_n` in subtraction. This signal helps decide the flow of conditional logic for magnitude comparison inputs to create the combined outputs.\n\n- **merge_cmp_out**: It holds the output from a conditional logic block, selecting either the lower 8 bits of `t_to_s_merge1` or `t_to_s_merge2` depending on the status of `b_n`. This selection is used to aid in setting combined outputs reflexive of magnitude and sign from either input according to the match conditions.\n\n- **merge_combined_cmp_out**: This signal combines `ex_or_out` with `merge_cmp_out` resulting in a 9-bit output where the MSB is the XOR result indicating differing signs, and the lower bits are selected based on the conditional logic controlled by `b_n`. This represents the conditional operations performed based on input sign comparison.\n\n- **sign_o_q2** and **sign_o_q3**: These are outputs from the `sign_processing_unit` that determine the signs of the outputs based on several conditions including the original signs of the inputs and the borrow out flags from arithmetic operations. They determine how the signs are set for sums and differences created.\n\n- **sum_combined_out** and **diff_combined_out**: These are the final intermediary signals before converting to final outputs. They combine the calculated sum and difference magnitudes with their respective signs (`sign_o_q2` for sum and `sign_o_q3` for difference) to form the inputs to additional sign conversions, producing the final output values `merge_out2` and `merge_out3`."
