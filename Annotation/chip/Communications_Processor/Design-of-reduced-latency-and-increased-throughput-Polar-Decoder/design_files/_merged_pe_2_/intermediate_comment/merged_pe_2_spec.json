Module specification: The 'merged_pe_2' module is responsible for merging and processing two 9-bit input signals, labeled 'merge_in1' and 'merge_in2', each consisting of an 8-bit magnitude and a sign bit. The module produces three 9-bit output signals named 'merge_out1', 'merge_out2', and 'merge_out3'. The functionality is primarily centered around arithmetic operations and sign handling, and it involves two's complement to sign-magnitude conversions, exclusive OR operations for sign bit comparisons, sum and difference calculations, and conditional operations based on arithmetic and sign results. Internally, the module utilizes wires such as 't_to_s_merge1' and 't_to_s_merge2' to store the sign-magnitude converted forms of inputs, 'int_sum' and 'int_diff' for resultant sum and differences, 'ex_or_out' for the XOR result of input signs, signals like 'merge_cmp_out' and 'merge_combined_cmp_out' for handling conditional logic, and 'sign_o_q2' and 'sign_o_q3' from a sign processing unit to adjust the output signs. Major blocks within the code include instances of the 'two_to_sign' module for conversions, 'pe_1_modified' for arithmetic operations, and 'sign_processing_unit' for determining output signs based on various conditions. 'merged_pe_2' efficiently combines these elements to output the processed signals through converting, calculating, and conditional selection stages, ensuring accurate output representations post processing.",

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: [t_to_s_merge1, t_to_s_merge2, ex_or_out, int_sum, int_diff, b_n, merge_cmp_out, merge_combined_cmp_out, sign_o_q2, sign_o_q3, sum_combined_out, diff_combined_out].\nExplanation: \n- **t_to_s_merge1** and **t_to_s_merge2**: These signals are the outputs from the instances of the `two_to_sign` module which convert the input signals `merge_in1` and `merge_in2` from two's complement to sign-magnitude representation. They play a role in making the inputs ready for further comparison and arithmetic operations.\n  \n- **ex_or_out**: This signal stores the result of the XOR operation between the sign bits of `t_to_s_merge1` and `t_to_s_merge2`. It reflects whether the signs of the two input numbers are different; used for controlling certain conditional logic in the code.\n\n- **int_sum** and **int_diff**: These are the outputs from the `pe_1_modified` module, representing the sum and difference of the lower 8 bits (magnitude parts) of `t_to_s_merge1` and `t_to_s_merge2`. These values are the intermediates needed to create the signed outputs `merge_out2` and `merge_out3`.\n\n- **b_n**: This is a control signal generated by the `pe_1_modified` unit indicating the borrow output as `bout_n` in subtraction. This signal helps decide the flow of conditional logic for magnitude comparison inputs to create the combined outputs.\n\n- **merge_cmp_out**: It holds the output from a conditional logic block, selecting either the lower 8 bits of `t_to_s_merge1` or `t_to_s_merge2` depending on the status of `b_n`. This selection is used to aid in setting combined outputs reflexive of magnitude and sign from either input according to the match conditions.\n\n- **merge_combined_cmp_out**: This signal combines `ex_or_out` with `merge_cmp_out` resulting in a 9-bit output where the MSB is the XOR result indicating differing signs, and the lower bits are selected based on the conditional logic controlled by `b_n`. This represents the conditional operations performed based on input sign comparison.\n\n- **sign_o_q2** and **sign_o_q3**: These are outputs from the `sign_processing_unit` that determine the signs of the outputs based on several conditions including the original signs of the inputs and the borrow out flags from arithmetic operations. They determine how the signs are set for sums and differences created.\n\n- **sum_combined_out** and **diff_combined_out**: These are the final intermediary signals before converting to final outputs. They combine the calculated sum and difference magnitudes with their respective signs (`sign_o_q2` for sum and `sign_o_q3` for difference) to form the inputs to additional sign conversions, producing the final output values `merge_out2` and `merge_out3`."
