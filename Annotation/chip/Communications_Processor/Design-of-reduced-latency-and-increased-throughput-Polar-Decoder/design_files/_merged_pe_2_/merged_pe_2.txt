Module-level comment: The 'merged_pe_2' module processes two 9-bit inputs ('merge_in1', 'merge_in2'), performing sign magnitude conversions, arithmetic operations, and conditional selections to produce three 9-bit outputs ('merge_out1', 'merge_out2', 'merge_out3'). It utilizes internal modules (two_to_sign, pe_1_modified) for conversions and computations, and manages sign handling and conditional outputs based on the computation results and sign comparisons.
