Module-level comment: The "pe_2" module processes two 9-bit inputs `q1` and `q2`, transforming and comparing them to generate a 9-bit output `o1`. Internally, it uses `two_to_sign` modules for signed conversion of inputs and a `comparator_module` for numeric comparison. An XOR operation checks sign consistency, while comparison results merge into the final output through subsequent transformation.
