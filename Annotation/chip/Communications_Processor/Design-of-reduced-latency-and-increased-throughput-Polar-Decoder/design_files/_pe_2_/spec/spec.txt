Module name: pe_2. Module specification: The "pe_2" module processes two 9-bit input vectors, `q1` and `q2`, and outputs a 9-bit vector `o1`. These inputs, `q1` and `q2`, are initially passed through two instances of a module called `two_to_sign` where they are likely transformed into a signed format. The outputs from these instances are stored in internal signals `t_to_s_1` and `t_to_s_2`. An exclusive OR operation is then performed on the most significant bits of `t_to_s_1` and `t_to_s_2`, producing a single-bit output `ex_or_out`, which indicates a sign bit discrepancy or agreement. The lower eight bits of `t_to_s_1` and `t_to_s_2` are compared in another module, `comparator_module`, resulting in an 8-bit output `CMP_out` which reflects numeric comparison. These two comparison results (`ex_or_out` and `CMP_out`) are combined into a new 9-bit vector `combined_CMP_out`. This combined output is then transformed again through another instance of `two_to_sign` resulting in the final output `o1`. The module is effectively used for processing and comparing two signed inputs possibly for alignment or correction, integrating bitwise and numeric comparisons into a final signed output.
