Module name: two_to_sign. Module specification: The 'two_to_sign' module performs a two's complement operation, commonly used to represent negative numbers in binary. It accepts one 9-bit input 'tcsm_in1' that represents the binary number for which the two's complement needs to be calculated. The output 'tcsm_out1' is also a 9-bit bus which delivers this calculated two's complement. Specifically, the module captures the functionality wherein the bits of 'tcsm_in1' are inverted and 1 is added to the result, all performed in a single operation within the module itself. The Verilog RTL code does not utilize any internal signals, ensuring a straightforward and efficient computation. The code is solely comprised of a module declaration with input and output ports, and a single-line operation within the module that directly computes the two's complement, making this module concise and highly focused.
