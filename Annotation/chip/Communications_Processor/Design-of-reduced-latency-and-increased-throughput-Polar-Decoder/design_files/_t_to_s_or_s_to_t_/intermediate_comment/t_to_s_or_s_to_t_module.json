    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'two_to_sign' module computes the two's complement of a 9-bit input 'tcsm_in1', outputting the result on 'tcsm_out1'. It achieves this by inverting all bits of the input and adding 1, executed in a single line of code without using internal signals, ensuring a compact and efficient design."
