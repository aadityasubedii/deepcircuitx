The functionality of this module is to calculate the two's complement of the input signal 'tcsm_in1'. Specifically, it inverts all bits of the input (performing a bitwise NOT operation indicated by '~tcsm_in1') and then adds 1 to this inverted value. The result is the two's complement, stored in 'tcsm_out1'. This is a common operation used to represent negative numbers in binary."

Explanation: The output port 'tcsm_out1' is a 9-bit bus that delivers the two's complement of the input value 'tcsm_in1'.
