    "spec": "Module name: two_to_sign. Module specification: The 'two_to_sign' module performs a two's complement operation, commonly used to represent negative numbers in binary. It accepts one 9-bit input 'tcsm_in1' that represents the binary number for which the two's complement needs to be calculated. The output 'tcsm_out1' is also a 9-bit bus which delivers this calculated two's complement. Specifically, the module captures the functionality wherein the bits of 'tcsm_in1' are inverted and 1 is added to the result, all performed in a single operation within the module itself. The Verilog RTL code does not utilize any internal signals, ensuring a straightforward and efficient computation. The code is solely comprised of a module declaration with input and output ports, and a single-line operation within the module that directly computes the two's complement, making this module concise and highly focused.",

The functionality of this module is to calculate the two's complement of the input signal 'tcsm_in1'. Specifically, it inverts all bits of the input (performing a bitwise NOT operation indicated by '~tcsm_in1') and then adds 1 to this inverted value.
