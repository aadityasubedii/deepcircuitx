    "spec": "Module name: pe_1. Module specification: The `pe_1` module is designed as a Parametric-Processing Element that computes both the sum and difference of two 8-bit binary numbers. It receives its input through two 8-bit ports, `x` and `y`, which are binary numbers intended for simultaneous addition and subtraction operations. The results of these operations are outputted through two 8-bit ports, `s` and `d`; where `s` represents the sum and `d` represents the difference of `x` and `y`. Internally, the module utilizes an array of wires `b` and `c` (each 8 bits long), which carry the borrow and carry bits between sequential operational stages to ensure accurate computation across the bit positions. The computational core consists of one half adder/subtractor (`has1`), which processes the least significant bits and seven full adder/subtractors (`fas1` to `fas7`) that compute the results for the remaining bit positions, utilizing carry and borrow from preceding computations. Each adder/subtractor takes as inputs the corresponding bits from `x` and `y` and the carry or borrow from its predecessor to compute the sum and difference outputs for its respective bit position, alongside generating new carry and borrow outputs for the next operation in the sequence. This structured chaining of operations facilitates the accurate handling of carries in addition and borrows in subtraction through all 8-bit positions.",
