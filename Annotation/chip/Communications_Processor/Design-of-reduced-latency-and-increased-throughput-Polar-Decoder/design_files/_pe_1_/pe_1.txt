Module-level comment: The `pe_1` module performs simultaneous addition and subtraction on two 8-bit inputs (`x`, `y`), outputting the sum (`s`) and difference (`d`). It employs one half adder/subtractor for the least significant bit and seven full adder/subtractors for subsequent bits, using internal carry (`c`) and borrow (`b`) wires to manage inter-stage dependencies, thus ensuring accurate binary arithmetic across all bit positions.
