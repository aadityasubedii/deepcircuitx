Module-level comment: The half_adder_subtractor module performs both half-addition and half-subtraction on binary inputs 'x' and 'y'. Outputs 'sum' and 'diff' are generated using XOR operations, providing results without carry and borrow, respectively. 'cout' is the carry-out from addition, computed as 'x & y', and 'bout' is the borrow-out from subtraction, computed as '~x & y'. Direct assignments keep the design concise and efficient.
