Module name: half_adder_subtractor. 
Module specification: The half_adder_subtractor module is designed to perform both half-addition and half-subtraction on two binary inputs ('x' and 'y'), providing outputs that show the sum, difference, carry-out, and borrow-out of the operations. Specifically, this module utilizes the XOR logic to compute both the 'sum' and 'diff' outputs, as both addition and subtraction without carry/borrow in binary can be achieved through this operation. 'cout', which indicates carry-out, is true if both inputs are 1, using an AND operation to determine this condition. The 'bout' output reflects the borrow-out necessary for subtraction when 'x' is 0 and 'y' is 1, achieved by an AND operation between the negation of 'x' and 'y'. The module does not use any internal signals as the operations are directly assigned to the outputs. Thus, the Verilog code structure comprises of assignments connecting input operations directly to their respective outputs without intermediate processing, ensuring a compact and efficient hardware implementation.
