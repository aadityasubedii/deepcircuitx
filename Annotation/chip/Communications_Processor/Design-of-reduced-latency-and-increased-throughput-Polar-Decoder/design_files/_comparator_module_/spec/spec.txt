Module name: comparator_module. 
Module specification: The comparator_module is designed to compare two 8-bit inputs, comp_in1 and comp_in2, and output the smaller of the two values through an 8-bit output port, comp_out1. The inputs, comp_in1 and comp_in2, accept 8-bit values for comparison, gauging which one is lesser. The output, comp_out1, is an 8-bit register that displays the result of this comparison, updating dynamically in response to any change in inputs due to the module's sensitivity to all input changes denoted by "always @ (*)". Internally, the module utilizes comp_out1 not only as an output but also as a signal to temporarily hold and output the smaller value after each computation in the always block. The comparison logic itself is succinctly handled within the always block, which assesses whether comp_in1 is less than comp_in2; comp_out1 is assigned the value of comp_in1 if true, otherwise it takes the value of comp_in2. This design ensures a continuous and immediate response to fluctuating inputs, making it highly reactive and efficient for systems requiring real-time comparison of two 8-bit values.
