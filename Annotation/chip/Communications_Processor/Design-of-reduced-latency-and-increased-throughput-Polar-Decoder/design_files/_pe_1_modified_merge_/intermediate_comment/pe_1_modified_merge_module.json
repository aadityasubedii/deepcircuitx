    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'pe_1_modified' module performs parallel addition and subtraction on two 8-bit inputs, `x` and `y`, outputting their sum `s`, difference `d`, and the final borrow `bout_n`. It employs cascaded half-adder and full-adder-subtractor units across 8 stages. These units compute individual bit operations and transfer carry and borrow through internal signals `b` and `c`, ensuring accurate bit-wise arithmetic across all 8 bits."
