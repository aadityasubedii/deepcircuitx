Module name: sign_processing_unit. Module specification: The `sign_processing_unit` is a hardware module designed to calculate two output sign bits, `sign_o2` and `sign_o3`, based on two input sign bits, `sign_q1` and `sign_q2`, and a `borrow` input that indicates if a borrow is involved in a subtraction operation. The input `sign_q1` and `sign_q2` represent the signs of two quantities in an arithmetic computation where borrowing may or may not occur. The output `sign_o2` is determined by two internal signals, `i1` and `i3`, where `i1` caters to situations without a borrow and the first sign input being high, and `i3` addresses scenarios without a borrow but with the second sign input high. `sign_o2` becomes high if either of these conditions are satisfied. Similarly, `sign_o3` is high if either conditions leading to `i1` or a new internal signal `i2` (which becomes true when there is a borrow and the second sign input is high) are met. These computations occur through bitwise operations where the internal signals utilize logic gates to ascertain conditions based on the inputs and the borrow state. The module primarily consists of signal assignments for `i1`, `i2`, `i3`, `sign_o2`, and `sign_o3`, which collectively manage the sign logic in arithmetic operations involving borrowing, effectively determining the outcome based on predefined logical conditions.
