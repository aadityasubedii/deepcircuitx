    "module": "Module-level comment: The `sign_processing_unit` module calculates output signs `sign_o2` and `sign_o3` based on inputs `sign_q1`, `sign_q2`, and `borrow`. It employs bitwise operations using internal signals `i1`, `i2`, `i3` to evaluate conditions based on borrowing and sign inputs, producing results useful in arithmetic computations involving borrowing. The outputs are determined through logical OR combinations of these signals."
