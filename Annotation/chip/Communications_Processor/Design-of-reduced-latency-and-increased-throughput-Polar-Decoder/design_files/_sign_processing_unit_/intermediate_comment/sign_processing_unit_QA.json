The internal logic uses bitwise operations to first decide the intermediate signals: `i1` is true if there is no borrow and `sign_q1` is high; `i2` is true if there is a borrow and `sign_q2` is high; `i3` is true if there is no borrow and `sign_q2` is high. The output `sign_o2` is high if either `i1` or `i3` is high, whereas `sign_o3` is high if either `i1` or `i2` is high. This setup likely is used to manage sign logic in arithmetic calculations involving borrowing."
