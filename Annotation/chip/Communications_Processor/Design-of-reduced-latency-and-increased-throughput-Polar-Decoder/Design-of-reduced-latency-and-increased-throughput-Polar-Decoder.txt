The repository 'Design-of-reduced-latency-and-increased-throughput-Polar-Decoder' focuses on enhancing the processing efficiency and accuracy of Polar Decoders through sophisticated Verilog modules and tailored testbenches. The design files embody a variety of fundamental and composite arithmetic modules such as 'full_adder_subtractor', 'half_adder_subtractor', specialized 'pe_1' and 'pe_2' modules which handle parallel arithmetic operations with optimized sign processing and comparison capabilities. Modules like 'merged_pe_2', 'pe_1_modified', and 'two_to_sign' underscore the advanced functionality by handling combined operations, modified arithmetic processes, and two's complements respectively. Supporting these are comparator and sign processing units that refine output based on conditions and input variations. The robust set of testbenches corresponding to each significant module, like 'pe_2_tb', 'merged_pe_2_tb' and others, ensure that each component is rigorously validated under varied conditions to confirm their operational integrity and accuracy, crucial for reduced latency and increased throughput in Polar decoding applications. This comprehensive design and testing approach not only validates functionality but also streamlines performance, ensuring real-time application viability.
