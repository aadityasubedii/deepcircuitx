Module-level comment: The `merged_pe_2_tb` is a testbench for verifying the `merged_pe_2` module, utilizing 9-bit registers `merge_in1` and `merge_in2` as test inputs. It observes outputs `merge_out1`, `merge_out2`, and `merge_out3` through instantiated `merged_pe_2` for functionality validation. Initial block sets specific input conditions to test the processing logic of `merged_pe_2`.
