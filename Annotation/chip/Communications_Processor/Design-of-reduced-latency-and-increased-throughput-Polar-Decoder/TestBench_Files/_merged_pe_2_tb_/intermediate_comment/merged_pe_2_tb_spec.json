Module specification: The `merged_pe_2_tb` is a testbench module in Verilog designed to simulate and verify the operation of a primary module presumably named `merged_pe_2`. It initializes two 9-bit input signals, `merge_in1` and `merge_in2`, which are registered inputs used to provide test vectors to the unit under test (`merged_pe_2`). The outputs from the `merged_pe_2` are captured through three 9-bit wire signals, named `merge_out1`, `merge_out2`, and `merge_out3`, reflecting different computational results based on the logic implemented within `merged_pe_2`. These outputs help in verifying the module's response and functionality. Internally, the testbench instantiates the `merged_pe_2` unit and directly connects the inputs and outputs to facilitate this functionality verification. The test inputs are set within an `initial` block, defining specific conditions under which the `merged_pe_2` module\u2019s output behaviors are observed.",
