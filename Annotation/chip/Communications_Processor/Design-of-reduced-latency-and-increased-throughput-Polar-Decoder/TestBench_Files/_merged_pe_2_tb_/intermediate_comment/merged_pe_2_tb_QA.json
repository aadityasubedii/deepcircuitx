This module `merged_pe_2_tb` initializes two 9-bit input vectors `merge_in1` and `merge_in2`. These inputs are then passed to the `merged_pe_2` module. The functionality or computation performed by `merged_pe_2` affects the outputs observed on `merge_out1`, `merge_out2`, and `merge_out3`, although the specific operations within `merged_pe_2` are not detailed in the provided code snippet. The purpose of this testbench is to simulate the `merged_pe_2` module's behavior with predefined input vectors."

These registers serve as input vectors to the unit under test (`merged_pe_2`). They are used to provide test scenarios or patterns to evaluate how the `merged_pe_2` module processes input data.\n  \n- `merge_out1`, `merge_out2`, and `merge_out3` are the internal wire signals in the `merged_pe_2_tb` module that act as output ports from the `merged_pe_2` unit. They are designated as wires because they directly represent output values from the `merged_pe_2` module, and carry the results of whatever processing `merged_pe_2` performs on the inputs `merge_in1` and `merge_in2`.
