    "spec": "Module name: pe_2_tb. Module specification: The 'pe_2_tb' module serves as a testbench for the 'pe_2' module, structured to validate its functionality through predefined test vectors. The primary role of this testbench is to simulate and monitor the response of 'pe_2' when presented with specific input sequences. It includes two 9-bit input registers, 'q1' and 'q2', which are crucial for supplying the 'pe_2' module with test inputs. These inputs are expected to be processed by the 'pe_2' module to produce an output that reflects on the 9-bit output wire 'o1'; this output allows observers to verify the correctness of 'pe_2\u2019s operations. No internal signals are explicitly defined or used within 'pe_2_tb' beyond the input and output specifications. In terms of code organization, the initial block within the testbench sets the values for 'q1' and 'q2', initiating the simulation with specific states to test the dependent module's reaction. The instantiated module 'pe_2', referenced as 'pe_2_1', directly links its inputs and outputs to 'q1', 'q2', and 'o1', forming the functional core of the testbench. This simple but critical setup ensures the ability to conduct targeted tests on the 'pe_2' module's logic and performance.\n",
