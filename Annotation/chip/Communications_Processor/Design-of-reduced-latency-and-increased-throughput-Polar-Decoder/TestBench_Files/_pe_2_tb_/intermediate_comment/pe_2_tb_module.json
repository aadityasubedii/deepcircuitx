    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'pe_2_tb' serves as a testbench for verifying the 'pe_2' module's functionality. It initializes two 9-bit input registers, 'q1' and 'q2', which simulate test inputs to 'pe_2' and monitors the result via a 9-bit output wire 'o1'. This design allows observing how the 'pe_2' processes inputs and validates its output logic."
