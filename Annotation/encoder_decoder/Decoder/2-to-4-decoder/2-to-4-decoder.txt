The repository, 2-to-4-decoder, contains a collection of Verilog modules designed to implement and verify a 2-to-4 line decoder with an enable signal. The primary module, `decoder2to4`, interprets a 2-bit input (`a`, `b`) into one of four outputs (`i0` to `i3`) which are activated based on the combination of inputs, only when the enable signal (`en`) is asserted. This translation employs logical operations, ensuring efficiency and clarity in output responses to the input changes. It incorporates NOR and NAND gates to manage the outputs so that only one is active at any time, and defaults to lowering all outputs when disabled. Another critical module, `decoder2to4_netlist`, duplicates this functionality with an emphasis on controlling output states via internal signals. Complementing these, the `decoder2to4_tb` module functions as a test bench to verify the decoder's functionality against a series of test cases, simulating different enabling conditions and input values, checking the correctness of outputs, and concluding with validation of all test scenarios.
