Module name: decoder2to4. Module specification: The `decoder2to4` is a Verilog module that functions as a 2-to-4 line decoder with an enable signal, specifically designed to select one of four outputs based on two input signals `a` and `b` while conditioned by an enable signal `en`. There are three input ports: `a` and `b`, which are binary signals that determine which output line (`i0`, `i1`, `i2`, `i3`) will be active based on their combined binary value when `en` is high; `en` serves as the enable signal, allowing the decoder to activate one output while disabling others if high, otherwise all outputs should be low which would require external logic for implementation, not covered in this code. The output ports are `i0`, `i1`, `i2`, and `i3`, each corresponds to the decoded binary value of inputs `a` and `b`. Internally, the module uses two signals `n_0` and `n_3`, generated by NAND gates, for intermediate processing where `n_0` impacts outputs `i2` and `i3`, and `n_3` affects outputs `i0` and `i1`. These intermediate signals implement the decoding logic through a network of NOR and NAND gates that, depending on the state of `en` and the value of `a`, control which output goes high, providing an effective decoding mechanism.
