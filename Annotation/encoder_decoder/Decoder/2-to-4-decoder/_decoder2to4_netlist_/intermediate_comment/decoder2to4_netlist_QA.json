It takes two input signals `a` and `b`, along with an enable signal `en`. Outputs are four signals `i0`, `i1`, `i2`, and `i3`. The decoder outputs depend on the combination of inputs `a` and `b` only when `en` (enable) is active, generating one high output (i.e., `1`) and three low outputs (i.e., `0`) among `i0`, `i1`, `i2`, and `i3` based on the binary value of `a` and `b`. If the enable signal `en` is low (`0`), all outputs (`i0`, `i1`, `i2`, `i3`) should ideally remain low, although the implementation of this behavior requires further external logic since it's not implemented within the provided code."
