    "module": "Module-level comment: The `decoder2to4` module is a 2-to-4 line decoder with an enable signal `en`. It translates inputs `a` and `b` into one active output (`i0`, `i1`, `i2`, `i3`) when `en` is high. Utilizing NOR and NAND gates, the module employs internal signals `n_0` and `n_3` to control output states based on `a`, `b`, and `en`, ensuring only one output is active at a time, while all outputs are low if `en` is inactive."
