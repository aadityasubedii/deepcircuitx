Module name: decoder2to4_tb.
Module specification: The decoder2to4_tb module is a test bench designed to verify the functionality of a 2-to-4 decoder. It inputs binary signals 'a' and 'b' and an enable signal 'en'. The decoder outputs are wire signals 'i0', 'i1', 'i2', and 'i3', where each output represents one of the four possible decoded outputs based on the values of 'a' and 'b'. When enabled by 'en' (high or 1), only one output among 'i0' to 'i3' is high, corresponding to the binary combination of 'a' and 'b'; all other outputs are low. When 'en' is low (0), all outputs are forced to be low. The internal signals include registers 'a', 'b', and 'en' for input controls, and wires 'i0' to 'i3' for outputs. The code includes an instantiation of the decoder2to4 design under test (DUT) and an initial block that defines a series of test cases. Test cases systematically toggle the inputs 'a', 'b', and 'en' and check the output combinations through conditional checks; messages are displayed if any output combination fails to meet the expected conditions, and a success message is shown if all tests pass, concluding with a simulation termination command.
