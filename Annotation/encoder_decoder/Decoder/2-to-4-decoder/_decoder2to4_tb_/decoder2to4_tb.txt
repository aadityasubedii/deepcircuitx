Module-level comment: The decoder2to4_tb module serves as a test bench for verifying a 2-to-4 decoder's functionality, ensuring correct output based on input combinations 'a', 'b', and enable 'en'. It incorporates a sequence of test cases within an initial block to simulate enabling conditions and input values, checks the appropriateness of each decoder output, and displays results. The module concludes by validating all test scenarios and ending the simulation.
