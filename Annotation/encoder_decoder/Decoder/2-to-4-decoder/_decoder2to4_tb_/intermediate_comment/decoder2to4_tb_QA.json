The decoder's functionality is checked under various conditions controlled by inputs 'a', 'b', and 'en'. The decoder outputs 'i0', 'i1', 'i2', and 'i3' are verified against expected values for different combinations of the inputs. The tests validate that when enabled ('en' is 1), only one output corresponding to the binary value of inputs 'a' and 'b' is high (1), and all other outputs are low (0). When the decoder is not enabled ('en' is 0), all outputs should be low irrespective of 'a' and 'b' values. The test cases output messages if any of the checks fail, and a success message if all test cases pass."
