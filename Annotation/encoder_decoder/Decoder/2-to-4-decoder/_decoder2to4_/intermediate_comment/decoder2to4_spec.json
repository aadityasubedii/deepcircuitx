    "spec": "Module name: decoder2to4. Module specification: The decoder2to4 module serves as a 2-to-4 decoder with an enable control. It effectively translates a 2-bit binary input (from signals 'a' and 'b') to a specific 4-bit output, where only one of the four output lines (i0, i1, i2, i3) is activated at any given time based on the binary combination of 'a' and 'b', provided the enable signal ('en') is high. Each output line corresponds to a unique combination of 'a' and 'b': 'i0' is high if both 'a' and 'b' are 0, 'i1' is high if 'a' is 0 and 'b' is 1, 'i2' is high if 'a' is 1 and 'b' is 0, 'i3' is high if both are 1. No internal signals are defined in the module, as all outputs are directly computed using logical operations on the input signals in combination with the enable signal. The module comprises just a series of continuous assignments where each output is defined directly by these conditions, simplifying the translation from input to output without intermediary stages, ensuring clear and immediate responses to input changes when enabled. If 'en' is low, all outputs are held low, regardless of input states, ensuring controlled output based on the enable signal state.",
