Module-level comment: The decoder2to4 module is a 2-to-4 decoder with an enable signal. It translates a 2-bit input (a, b) into one of four outputs (i0-i3) based on the input combination, only when enabled (en=1). Outputs are directly assigned through logical operations combining inputs and the enable signal, ensuring clarity and efficiency in translating input changes to outputs. When disabled (en=0), all outputs remain low.
