    "spec": "Module name: up_counter. Module specification: The `up_counter` is a digital logic module designed in Verilog that implements a 13-bit up counter which increments by 1 on every rising edge of the clock signal (`clk`). The module has two input ports: `clk`, which is the clock input driving the timing of the counter, and `reset`, a reset control signal that when high, resets the counter's value to 0. It features a single output port `out`, which is a 13-bit wide signal representing the current count value of the up counter. Internally, the module utilizes a register `out` to store the current count. This register is cleared to zero on a high `reset` input or increments by 1 on the rising edge of the `clk` if `reset` is not active. The module's code is structured with an `always` block that defines the behavior of the counter on the positive edge of the clock, handling either resetting or incrementing the `out` register based on the state of `reset`. This setup ensures the counter is synchronous, relying solely on the clock's positive edge and the state of the reset signal for its operation.",
