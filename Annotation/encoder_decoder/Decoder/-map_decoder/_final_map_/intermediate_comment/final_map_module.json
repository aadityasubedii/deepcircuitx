    "module": "The Map_decoder module is designed for digital communications, specifically handling decoding tasks using inputs to compute the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR). It utilizes a structured approach with two main components: control_unit for managing synchronization and control signals, directing operations such as resets and data routing via internal signals, and MAP_Datapath which computes the LLR using these signals and input data. The module effectively integrates control and datapath operations to ensure efficient and synchronized processing."
