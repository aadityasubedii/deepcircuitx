    "spec": "Module name: Map_decoder. \nModule specification: The \"Map_decoder\" is a digital communications module integrated in Verilog for decoding signals or mapping data, possibly handling computation akin to Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLR). It has input ports [11:0] input1, input2, and L, which are 12-bit wide inputs used in the decoding process, along with `clock` and `reset` for synchronization and initializing operations. The single output, `LLR`, signifies the Log-Likelihood Ratio critical in decoding operations. Internal signals such as `reset_in`, `in_rdwr1`, `in_rdwr2`, and various gamma-related resets (`reset_gamma`, `reset2_gamma`, `reset3_gamma`) as well as read-write signals (`gamma_rdwr1`, `gamma_rdwr2`) control specific operational phases within the datapath. Multiplexer control signals (`mux_alpha, mux_beta, mux_dummy`) and alpha-related signals (`reset_alpha, alpha_rdwr1, alpha_rdwr2`) manage routing and data handling in different computational states. The architecture comprises two main blocks: `control_unit` and `MAP_Datapath`. The `control_unit` handles signal operations for synchronization and control flow, while `MAP_Datapath` deals with the computational logic using the control signals and inputs to generate the `LLR` output. The organization and interaction between these blocks bolster the module's overall functionality in handling decoding or data processing tasks efficiently.",

It interfaces with two sub-modules: a control unit and a datapath unit. The control unit likely manages signals necessary for synchronization and operational control including various reset and read/write signals for processing data. These control signals are used by the datapath which performs the core computational logic using inputs 'input1', 'input2', and 'L', finally producing the output 'LLR' (which may represent Log-Likelihood Ratio, commonly used in communication systems for decoding). The presence of multiplexers (mux_alpha, mux_beta, mux_dummy) in the signals suggests dynamic routing or selection of data paths based on states or conditions managed by the control unit."
