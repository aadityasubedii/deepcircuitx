Module name: Map_decoder. 
Module specification: The "Map_decoder" is a digital communications module integrated in Verilog for decoding signals or mapping data, possibly handling computation akin to Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLR). It has input ports [11:0] input1, input2, and L, which are 12-bit wide inputs used in the decoding process, along with `clock` and `reset` for synchronization and initializing operations. The single output, `LLR`, signifies the Log-Likelihood Ratio critical in decoding operations. Internal signals such as `reset_in`, `in_rdwr1`, `in_rdwr2`, and various gamma-related resets (`reset_gamma`, `reset2_gamma`, `reset3_gamma`) as well as read-write signals (`gamma_rdwr1`, `gamma_rdwr2`) control specific operational phases within the datapath. Multiplexer control signals (`mux_alpha, mux_beta, mux_dummy`) and alpha-related signals (`reset_alpha, alpha_rdwr1, alpha_rdwr2`) manage routing and data handling in different computational states. The architecture comprises two main blocks: `control_unit` and `MAP_Datapath`. The `control_unit` handles signal operations for synchronization and control flow, while `MAP_Datapath` deals with the computational logic using the control signals and inputs to generate the `LLR` output. The organization and interaction between these blocks bolster the module's overall functionality in handling decoding or data processing tasks efficiently.
