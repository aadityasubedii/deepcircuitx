Module name: MAP_Datapath. Module specification: The MAP_Datapath is a highly specialized digital signal processing module used primarily in communication systems for decoding signals, utilizing Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) algorithms to compute Log Likelihood Ratios (LLR). It integrates several computational steps such as up counters, skip counters, input handling RAMs, and processing units like BMC (branch metric computation), FSMCU, DBSMCU, and BSMCU, each handling distinct aspects of the MAP algorithm. The module accepts 12-bit inputs: input1, input2, and L (likely representing channel metrics or likelihood information), along with various read/write and multiplexer control signals, and reset signals, governed by a primary clock input. The main output is the LLR, a critical parameter in error correction and decoding. Internally, the setup makes extensive use of temporary storage and intermediate signals (y1, y2, wr1 to wr4, address and gamma address signals, various temporary registers) to facilitate data transfer and processing across different RAMs and internal units. Different sections of the code handle different stages of the data pathway: counting and addressing, data input and temporary storage, data processing through different computational units (BMC, FSMCU, DBSMCU, BSMCU), and the final computation of LLR, aligning transmitted data against possible outcomes to compute the likelihood ratios required for decoding processes.
