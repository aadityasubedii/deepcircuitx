    "module": "The MAP_Datapath module is engineered for digital signal processing in communication systems, particularly to decode signals using Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) algorithms and compute Log Likelihood Ratios (LLR). It processes inputs through multiple stages involving temporary storage and sophisticated computation units like BMC, FSMCU, DBSMCU, and BSMCU, synchronized by a clock, with outputs managed and staged via an assortment of RAMs and multiplexers to achieve accurate LLR calculations necessary for error correction in decoding processes."
