The BSMCU module processes multiple pairs of signed 12-bit input signals, correlating them through addition and comparison operations to produce single preferred outputs. Implementation involves eight ACS submodules, each performing additions via `adda` submodules and then selecting the larger result using `cmp` submodules, derived results are outputted on eight designated 12-bit output ports.
