Module name: BSMCU. Module specification: The BSMCU module functions as a complex signal processing controller, specifically designed to handle and process multiple pairs of signed 12-bit data streams in parallel. It integrates eight ACS submodules, which each take four signed 12-bit input values: two main input signals and two biases. These inputs are processed through internal operations involving addition and comparison to give a final selected output signal, provided through eight corresponding output ports - bl1 to bl8. Each ACS submodule within the BSMCU employs the `adda` submodule to compute the sums of the paired inputs and the `cmp` submodule to compare the results from the additions, ultimately selecting the larger of the two values as the output. The internal signals d1 and d2 represent the addition results which are then compared to produce w5, the output signal of each ACS submodule. Thus, BSMCU stands as a pivotal module for applications requiring detailed and robust handling of signal data through addition and comparative selection, ensuring enhanced signal processing capabilities in systems such as digital signal processing platforms.
