    "spec": "Module name: BSMCU. Module specification: The BSMCU module functions as a complex signal processing controller, specifically designed to handle and process multiple pairs of signed 12-bit data streams in parallel. It integrates eight ACS submodules, which each take four signed 12-bit input values: two main input signals and two biases. These inputs are processed through internal operations involving addition and comparison to give a final selected output signal, provided through eight corresponding output ports - bl1 to bl8. Each ACS submodule within the BSMCU employs the `adda` submodule to compute the sums of the paired inputs and the `cmp` submodule to compare the results from the additions, ultimately selecting the larger of the two values as the output. The internal signals d1 and d2 represent the addition results which are then compared to produce w5, the output signal of each ACS submodule. Thus, BSMCU stands as a pivotal module for applications requiring detailed and robust handling of signal data through addition and comparative selection, ensuring enhanced signal processing capabilities in systems such as digital signal processing platforms.",

The module integrates multiple ACS (Add-Compare-Select) units, each designated to perform specific operations on paired input signals. Each ACS module computes the addition of two pair inputs using `adda` submodule, compares the results from pairs of additions using `cmp` submodule, and outputs the larger of the two comparisons. The BSMCU accepts 16 pairs of signed 12-bit input signals and produces 8 signed 12-bit output signals as designated by the ports provided to each ACS submodule. This setup is typically used in applications like digital signal processing where operations on multiple data streams are performed in parallel."

The ports named 'i11' to 'i88' are likely to carry data signals, while 'b1' to 'b8' appear to be bias values used in computations within each ACS module. This configuration allows each ACS submodule to perform operations on a specific pair of main inputs (like i11, i15, etc.) alongside a specific pair of biases (like b1, b5, etc.).\n\nOutput ports: bl1, bl2, bl3, bl4, bl5, bl6, bl7, bl8.\nExplanation: These are signed 12-bit output ports corresponding to each ACS submodule within the BSMCU module. Each 'blX' output reflects the resultant value from the comparisons made in its respective ACS module, implying it carries a signal that has undergone addition and comparison operations, thus possibly representing a selected or conditioned signal based on the input criteria set by the biases and data inputs in the ACS modules. This configuration is crucial for parallel processing of multiple data streams, outputting a single result from each stream's dual input-bias calculation and comparison."

It serves as one of the operands for the subsequent comparison in the `cmp` submodule.\n\n2. **d2**: Similar to `d1`, `d2` is also an internal signal within the `ACS` module, computed by the `adda` submodule `ad2` as the sum of inputs `w3` and `w4`.
