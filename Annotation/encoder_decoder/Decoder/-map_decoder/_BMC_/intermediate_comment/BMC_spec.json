    "spec": "Module name: BMC. Module specification: The BMC module is designed to perform a series of arithmetic operations based on three 12-bit signed input values, `y1`, `y2`, and `L`. These operations produce four outputs, each reflecting different mathematical combinations of the inputs. The inputs are `y1` and `y2`, which represent the primary data values for operations, and `L`, serving as an additional scaling or offset factor. The outputs include `t1`, calculated as the negative sum of `y1` and `y2` increased by `L`; `t2`, the sum of `y1`, `y2`, and `L`; `t3`, the difference of `y1` and `y2` increased by `L`; and `t4`, the sum of the negation of `y1` and `y2` adjusted by `L`. These outputs (`t1`, `t2`, `t3`, `t4`) are all designated as 12-bit signed integers. The module utilizes direct assignment statements for computing outputs from the inputs without using intermediate internal signals, ensuring straightforward computations directly linked from inputs to outputs. This simple but effective functional arrangement allows the BMC module to efficiently execute the required calculations for further processing in digital systems.",
