It computes four different arithmetic operations based on these inputs and outputs the results. The operations performed are:\n- `t1` computes the negative sum of `y1` and `y2` increased by `L`;\n- `t2` computes the sum of `y1`, `y2`, and `L`;\n- `t3` computes the difference of `y1` and `y2` increased by `L`;\n- `t4` computes the difference between the negative of `y1` and `y2` increased by `L`.\nThese outputs might be used for further arithmetic operations or analysis in a larger digital system."

The input port `L` is also a 12-bit signed integer which acts as a scaling or offset factor in the arithmetic operations performed by the module.\n\nOutput ports: `t1`, `t2`, `t3`, `t4`.\nExplanation: The output ports consist of four different 12-bit signed integers. Each output is the result of distinct arithmetic operations involving the inputs:\n- `t1` outputs the computation result of `-(y1 + y2) + L`.\n- `t2` outputs the computation result of `y1 + y2 + L`.\n- `t3` outputs the computation result of `y1 - y2 + L`.\n- `t4` outputs the computation result of `-y1 + y2 + L`.\nEach output reflects a different combination of additions and subtractions involving the inputs, useful for separate processing or analysis downstream in a digital system."
