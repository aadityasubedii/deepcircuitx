The BMR module performs bitwise and arithmetic manipulations on two 4-bit inputs, 'a' and 'b', resulting in three 4-bit outputs 'c', 'd', and 'e'. It computes the bitwise NOT of 'a' and adds it to '4'b1111' to produce 'c', while 'b' is left-shifted and the result is subtracted from 'a' to generate the identical outputs 'd' and 'e'. The module employs specialized sub-modules for each operation: not3 for NOT, add for addition, lshift for left shift, and subt for subtraction, organizing the code into distinct functional blocks to enhance clarity and modularity.
