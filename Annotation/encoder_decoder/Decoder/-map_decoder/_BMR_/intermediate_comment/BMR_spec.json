    "spec": "Module name: BMR. Module specification: The BMR module is designed to perform a series of arithmetic and logical operations on two 4-bit inputs, 'a' and 'b'. It outputs three 4-bit values: 'c', 'd', and 'e'. Specifically, the module computes the bitwise NOT of 'a', storing it in the internal signal 'x1'. This value is then added to the constant '4'b1111' (stored in 'x2') to produce the output 'c'. Concurrently, 'b' undergoes a left shift operation, the result of which is stored in 'x3'. This shifted value is then subtracted from 'a' to derive the outputs 'd' and 'e', both of which store identical results from the subtraction, possible indicating redundancy or different usage in a broader system. The BMR module includes several sub-modules: 'not3' for computing the NOT operation, 'add' for addition, 'lshift' for the left shift operation, and 'subt' for subtraction. Each of these sub-modules is tailored to perform its specific task, contributing to the modular and clear structure of the BMR module, ensuring precise and reliable arithmetic and logical operations.",
