It calculates the bitwise NOT of 'a' which is stored in 'x1', then adds 'x1' to a constant value `4'b1111` to produce the output 'c'. It also performs a left shift operation on 'b' by 1 bit, stored as 'x3', then subtracts 'x3' from 'a' to generate outputs 'd' and 'e'. The design utilizes sub-modules not3, add, lshift, and subt to achieve these operations."
