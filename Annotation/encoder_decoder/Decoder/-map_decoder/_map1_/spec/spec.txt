Module name: MAP. 
Module specification: The MAP module is integral to a system designed for signal decoding using Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) calculations, primarily found in communication system decoders. It accepts a 2-bit input, `y`, and delivers a single-bit output `v` which indicates a decision derived from maximum likelihood estimations. The input `[1:0]y` receives binary data which cascades through interconnected submodules (gamma, beta, alpha, llr), each contributing to the final output computation. Gamma generates eight 3-bit coefficients from `y`, which along with constant outputs from beta and alpha (each providing four 3-bit values, irrespective of `y`), are utilized by the llr submodule. Inside llr, these are churned through arithmetic operations producing intermediate signals (`w11, w12, w23, ...`) that represent summations used to determine two conditional maximum values (`l0, l1`). These are then compared in a comparison module to set the output `v`. The functionality of MAP is accomplished using Verilog instantiation of each submodule, where gamma handles simple transformations based on ‘y’, beta and alpha provide fixed coefficients, and complex maximum and comparison logic resides in llr using nested modules for maximum determinations (max) and value comparison (cmp). Thereby, the module encapsulates a multi-level computation and decision-making process in a structured and modular RTL design, suitable for hardware implementation in digital communication systems.
