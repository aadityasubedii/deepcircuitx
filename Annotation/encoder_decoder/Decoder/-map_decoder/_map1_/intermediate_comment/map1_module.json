    "module": "The MAP module computes a decision output 'v' from a 2-bit input 'y' using Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) calculations, integral for decoding in communication systems. It harnesses data from 'y' through gamma, alpha, beta submodules which generate intermediate coefficients, and llr submodule, where arithmetical operations and comparisons generate the necessary decision logic from these coefficients. The implementation architecturally integrates submodules that perform specific transformations and calculations, interfacing seamlessly to aggregate their outputs into a final decision signal.\n"
