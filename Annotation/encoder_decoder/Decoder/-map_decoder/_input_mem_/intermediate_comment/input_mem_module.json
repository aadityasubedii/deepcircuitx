    "module": "The input_RAM module serves as a memory storage system capable of reading and writing signed 12-bit data, synchronized with a clock signal. It employs input signals (rdwr1, rdwr2) to control write and read operations, utilizing a memory array \"mem\" of 6144 elements indexed by a 13-bit input space. Write operations occur when rdwr1 is low; read operations retrieve data from one index prior when rdwr2 is high and index is greater than zero, ensuring conditional memory access based on input commands and clock cycles."
