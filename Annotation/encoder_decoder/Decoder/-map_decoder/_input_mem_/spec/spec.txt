Module name: input_RAM. Module specification: The input_RAM module is a memory system within a Verilog environment, equipped with capabilities for reading and writing signed 12-bit data based on a clock-triggered operation. It uses input ports such as `clock` (the main clock signal that synchronizes memory operations), `rdwr1` (a control signal that determines write operation when low), `rdwr2` (a control signal that enables read operation when high), `index` (a 13-bit addressing signal specifying memory address), and `in` (the incoming signed 12-bit data to be stored). The only output port, `out`, is a signed 12-bit line that outputs data from the previous address in the memory if conditions are right. Internally, the module maintains a `mem` array of 6144 elements, each capable of storing a signed 12-bit integer, serving as the main storage structure that handles read and write data operations. The Verilog code contains a primary `always` block that triggers on the positive edge of the clock. This block checks if the memory address given by `index` is valid and then performs either a write operation if `rdwr1` is low and `rdwr2` is inactive, or a read operation if `rdwr2` is high and the `index` is valid and greater than zero, thereby pulling data from the prior index into the `out` port. This design allows for efficient memory usage with controlled access based on the input signal conditions, ensuring data is retrieved and stored accurately within the specified bounds.
