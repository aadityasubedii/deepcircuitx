Module name: gamma_RAM. 

Module specification: The gamma_RAM is a Verilog module designed to control a small memory system with a capacity of 128 locations, each holding a 12-bit signed integer. It leverages a synchronized clock signal to manage read and write operations. The module includes input signals such as `clock` (the clock signal for timing the operations), `rdwr1` (determines if the operation is a write when low), `rdwr2` (enables read when high), and `index`, `index2`, `index3` (address inputs for writing and reading operations). The data to be written is supplied through the `in1` input. Output signals consist of `o1`, `o2`, `o3`, `o4`, and `o11`, `o12`, `o13`, `o14`, which are used to output data read from the memory. Internally, the module uses a signal `mem` which is a memory array of 128 12-bit signed integers that serves as the primary data storage. The code contains two main blocks within an `always` block triggered by the positive edge of the clock: one block handles the writing of data to `mem` if `rdwr1` is low and `index` is less than 64, and the other handles reading from `mem` whereby data from `index2 - 1` and `index3 - 1` is output to corresponding output ports when `rdwr2` is high. Each output port set (`o1` to `o4`, and `o11` to `o14`) outputs the same data read from the memory, implying parallel usage potential in different system components.
