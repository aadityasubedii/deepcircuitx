The `test1` module performs addition on pairs of 4-bit inputs using two instances of the `adda` submodule, each handling one pair to compute simultaneous output. Inputs `a[1:0]` and `b[1:0]` are directly fed into `adda` modules, where `ad1` computes `a[0]` plus `b[0]` and `ad2` computes `a[1]` plus `b[1]`, with results outputted to `c[1:0]` accordingly. This configuration streamlines the addition of two sets of inputs in parallel, showcasing a structured use of internal submodules for efficient arithmetic operations.
