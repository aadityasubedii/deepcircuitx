    "spec": "Module name: test1. Module specification: The `test1` module is designed to perform addition on pairs of 4-bit inputs using two instances of the submodule `adda`. Each `adda` submodule performs addition on a pair of 4-bit inputs (x and y) and outputs the 4-bit result (z). In the `test1` module, the input ports are `a[1:0]` and `b[1:0]`, both arrays indexed from 0 to 1, where each index represents a 4-bit input used for addition. The outputs of these operations are stored in the 4-bit output vector `c[1:0]` at corresponding indices. There are no explicit internal signals within the `test1` module outside those needed for interfacing the `adda` submodules; however, inside each `adda`, the `always` block utilizes a register `z` to hold the calculation result. The `test1` module primarily consists of connecting these inputs to the respective `adda` instances (`ad1` for `a[0], b[0]` and `ad2` for `a[1], b[1]`) and mapping their outputs to the appropriate elements of `c[1:0]`. This modular structure allows for simultaneous calculation of multiple additions, enhancing computational efficiency and organization within the design.",

Each submodule `adda` processes the input signals directly from `test1` (`a[0], a[1], b[0], b[1]`) and outputs the results directly to the output ports of `test1` (`c[0], c[1]`). Therefore, all signals are interfaced directly between the ports and the submodules without intermediate storage or processing within `test1`.
