These submodules are used to perform addition on pairs of 4-bit inputs. Specifically, 'test1' has two 4-bit input vectors 'a' and 'b', each containing 2 elements. The module performs addition on corresponding elements of these vectors using the 'adda' submodules. The results of these additions are stored in the output 4-bit vector 'c', which also contains 2 elements. The 'adda' submodule takes two 4-bit inputs 'x' and 'y', adds them, and outputs the result in a 4-bit output 'z'. This setup in 'test1' allows for simultaneous addition of two sets of numbers."

Explanation: These are two arrays of 4-bit input ports, both indexed from 0 to 1. `a[1:0]` and `b[1:0]` serve as the input operands for the addition operations performed by the module. Each element of these arrays, `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `b[0]`, and `b[1]`, is a 4-bit input that will each be added to the corresponding element from the other input array (i.e., `a[0]` with `b[0]` and `a[1]` with `b[1]`). \n\nOutput ports: `c[1:0]`. Explanation: This is an array of 4-bit output ports, indexed from 0 to 1. `c[1:0]` stores the results of the addition operations performed within the module. Each element, `c[0]` and `c[1]`, holds the sum of corresponding input elements from `a` and `b` (i.e., the result of `a[0] + b[0]` is stored in `c[0]`, and the result of `a[1] + b[1]` is stored in `c[1]`).

It does not use any additional internal signals or interconnections beyond what is required to interface with the `adda` modules. Each submodule `adda` processes the input signals directly from `test1` (`a[0], a[1], b[0], b[1]`) and outputs the results directly to the output ports of `test1` (`c[0], c[1]`). Therefore, all signals are interfaced directly between the ports and the submodules without intermediate storage or processing within `test1`. Each `adda` submodule, however, uses its local input ports `x` and `y` and an internal register `z` to perform and store the addition, which then outputs to the `test1` module's `c` array elements correspondingly. Hence, `z` in each `adda` module can be considered as an internal signal within that submodule, managing the result of the addition before passing it to the output."
