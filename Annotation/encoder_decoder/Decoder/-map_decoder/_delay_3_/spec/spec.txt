Module name: delay_3. Module specification: The 'delay_3' module is a Verilog digital design that introduces a specified delay to a 12-bit input signal 'x1' before transferring it to a 12-bit output 'x2'. This delay implementation is controlled via an internal counter 'i', which increments on each positive edge of the clock input 'clk' until it reaches 40, at which point the input 'x1' is propagated to the output 'x2'. The module includes two input ports: 'x1', which is a 12-bit data input representing the signal to be delayed, and 'clk', a clock signal that synchronizes the module's operations. The module has one output port, 'x2', which is a 12-bit register that holds the delayed output. Internally, the module utilizes an integer signal 'i' that functions as a counter to manage the delay mechanism. The main code block, triggered on the rising edge of 'clk', contains conditional statements that handle the increment or reset of the counter 'i', and assign 'x1' to 'x2' based on the value of 'i'. This design ensures that the output 'x2' reflects the input 'x1' only after 40 clock cycles, implementing a controllable delay mechanism in digital processing applications.
