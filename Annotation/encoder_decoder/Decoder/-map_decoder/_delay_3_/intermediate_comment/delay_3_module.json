    "module": "The 'delay_3' module delays a 12-bit input signal 'x1' for 40 clock cycles before outputting it to 'x2'. It uses a positive-edge triggered block with a counter 'i' that increments until it reaches 40, at which point 'x1' is assigned to 'x2'. If 'i' is below 0, it resets to 0, ensuring the timing delay is accurately maintained."
