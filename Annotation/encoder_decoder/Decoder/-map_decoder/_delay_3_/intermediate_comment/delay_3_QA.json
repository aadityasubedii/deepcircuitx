The delay is controlled by the integer variable 'i'. For each positive edge of the clock 'clk', the module checks if 'i' is equal to or greater than 40 ('7'b0101000'); if it is, 'x2' is assigned the value of 'x1'. If 'i' is less than 40, and greater than or equal to 0, 'i' is incremented by 1. If 'i' is less than 0, it is reset to 0. Through this mechanism, the module delays the passing of the input 'x1' to the output 'x2' until 'i' reaches 40."
