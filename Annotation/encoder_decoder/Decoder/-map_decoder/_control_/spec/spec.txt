Module name: control_unit. Module specification: The control_unit is a Verilog module that implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage control signals for system operations based on the current state and condition. It operates with two input ports: 'clk' for the clock signal that synchronizes state transitions and updates, and 'reset' for initializing the FSM to its default state. The output ports include various control signals like 'reset_in', 'in_rdwr1', 'in_rdwr2', several reset and read/write controls for components named 'gamma' and 'alpha', and multiplexer controls 'mux_alpha', 'mux_beta', 'mux_dummy'. The module uses internal signals such as a 13-bit 'count' to track the clock cycles since the last state transition, 'current_state' and 'next_state' both 3-bit registers to manage the current and subsequent states of the FSM. The code is organized into blocks handling state transitions on the clock edge where the current state is updated, and output signals are managed based on the state definitions. Each state sets the output control signals and determines the next state based on the 'count' value. This module is crucial for ensuring the coordinated operation and timing of system functionalities that are dependent on the states of the FSM.
