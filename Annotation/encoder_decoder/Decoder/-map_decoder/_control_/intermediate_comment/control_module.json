    "module": "The control_unit module implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage system control signals based on state transitions synchronized by a clock signal. The module has input ports for clock and reset, with multiple output ports controlling various operation signals. Internally, it uses a 13-bit counter and 3-bit registers for current and next states to direct state transitions and signal outputs. The transitions and outputs are determined conditionally within defined states to coordinate system operations effectively."
