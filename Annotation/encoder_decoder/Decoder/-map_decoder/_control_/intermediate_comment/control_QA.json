It handles multiple signals that coordinate various functionalities which might include but are not limited to resetting components, reading/writing operations, and muxing inputs based on the conditions of the current state and a counter. The FSM transitions through predefined states (from s0 to s7), modifying output signals and controlling state transitions based on a count value that is incremented every clock cycle. Each state sets specific combinations of outputs and determines the next state transition based on the value of the count. The module effectively orchestrates the timing and control signal outputs needed for system operations that are dependent on specific sequences and timing provided by the state transitions."

It is incremented every clock cycle and is reset to zero whenever a state transition occurs. The value of `count` is used as a condition in determining when to transition to the next state.\n\n- `current_state`: This is a 3-bit register that holds the current state of the finite state machine. It is updated at every positive edge of the clock based on the value of `next_state` if the reset is not active. This register determines which set of actions (output signals setting) will be taken in the current clock cycle.\n\n- `next_state`: This is a 3-bit register that holds the state to which the FSM should transition in the next clock cycle. It is determined based on the current state and conditions (like the `count` value) within each state case. On reset, or when the conditions to move to a new state are met, this signal is set to indicate the incoming state for the machine.\n\nThese internal signals are crucial for the control logic of the FSM, allowing it to maintain proper timing and sequencing of the state transitions and operations based on the current state and the duration spent in each state as tracked by the count."
