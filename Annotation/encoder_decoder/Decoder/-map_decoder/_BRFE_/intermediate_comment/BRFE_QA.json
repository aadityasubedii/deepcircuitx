The module utilizes three submodules: msb, mux, and add1. Each msb submodule compares two input signals and shifts the difference to generate an intermediate signal. Each mux submodule then selects one of the original inputs based on the msb result (acting as a selector) to produce another set of intermediate signals. Finally, each add1 submodule adds a predefined signal (lut1, lut2, lut3) to the output of corresponding mux submodule to generate the final output signals bm1, bm2, and bm3. This entire process combines comparisons, selections, and additions to process and transform the input signals into the output signals."
