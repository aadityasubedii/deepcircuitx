Module name: BRFE. 
Module specification: The BRFE module is designed for processing six 4-bit input signals (b1 to b6) and generating three 4-bit output signals (bm1, bm2, bm3) through a series of operations. The module uses three types of submodules: msb, mux, and add1. The msb submodules take pairs of input signals and compute the difference, which is then right-shifted, producing intermediate signals (a1, a2, a3) used for selection in subsequent stages. The mux submodules use these msb outputs as selectors to pick one of the original pair of inputs, generating another set of intermediate signals (a4, a5, a6). Finally, the add1 submodules add predefined signals (lut1, lut2, lut3) to these mux outputs, resulting in the final output signals. Each pair of input signals is independently processed through these three stages to produce each output signal. Input ports include b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, which are the data inputs that undergo comparisons, selections, and additions. Output ports are bm1, bm2, and bm3, where each represents the end results of these signal transformations. Internal signals, namely a1 to a6, facilitate intermediate steps and signal routing within the module, ensuring correct data processing through each operational stage of msb, mux, and add1. This structured design modularizes comparisons, selections, and additions to efficiently process and output transformed signals based on defined logical conditions.
