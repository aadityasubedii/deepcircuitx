The BRFE module processes six 4-bit input signals (b1 to b6) to produce three 4-bit output signals (bm1, bm2, bm3) through a sequence of comparison, selection, and addition operations. It employs msb submodules for comparing and shifting differences of signal pairs, mux submodules for selecting signals based on the msb outputs, and add1 submodules for adding specific values to the selected signals, thus generating the final outputs.
