    "module": "The `LLR_final` module computes the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) by performing a series of addition and comparison operations on multiple 12-bit input signals. It uses sixteen `adder_3` instances to sum groups of inputs, followed by two `magn_cmp` instances that determine the maximum values among sets of summed results. Finally, the `f_out` instance compares these maximum values to generate a single-bit LLR output, representing the computed ratio based on the input conditions."
