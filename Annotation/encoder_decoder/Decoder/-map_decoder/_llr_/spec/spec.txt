Module name: LLR_final. 
Module specification: The `LLR_final` module is designed to calculate the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) using multiple arithmetic and comparison operations on input data signals. It incorporates input ports for a clock signal and thirty-two 12-bit data signals named `a1` to `a8`, `b1` to `b8`, and `y11` to `y88`, which are involved in various addition operations. The module outputs a single-bit LLR which represents a decision or result derived from internal comparisons. Internally, the module utilizes sixteen 12-bit wires labeled from `w11` to `w88`, each outputting results from individual `adder_3` instances that sum groups of three inputs (`a`, `b`, and `y`). Additionally, two 12-bit wires `op1` and `op2` carry the maximum values from two `magn_cmp` instances, which receive inputs from the `adder_3` outputs. These two values are then compared in the `f_out` block to produce the final LLR output. The `adder_3` instances perform three-input additions, `magn_cmp` instances find the maximum value among eight inputs, and the `f_out` block outputs a comparison result based on its inputs, feeding into the LLR output of the module.
