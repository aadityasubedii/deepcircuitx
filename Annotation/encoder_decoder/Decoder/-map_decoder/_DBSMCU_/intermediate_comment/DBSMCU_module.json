    "module": "The DBSMCU module orchestrates digital signal processing through a series of ACS blocks, each processing pairs of 12-bit signed inputs alongside control data to output 12-bit signed results. It employs eight ACS instances, configured per instance with specific input signals for modularized operations, promoting efficient computation and decision-making within systems requiring robust data handling and processing."
