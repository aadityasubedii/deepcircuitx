    "spec": "Module name: MAP1. Module specification: The MAP1 module is a complex computational unit in Verilog, primarily designed to process two 10-bit wide input signals, y1 and y2, and generate a 10-bit wide output signal, v. The inputs y1 and y2 pass through multiple transformation stages using interconnected submodules\u2014gamma, alpha, beta, and llr\u2014that leverage internal signals to facilitate data processing. The internal signals include arrays a1-a4, b1-b4, and c11-c44, which store intermediate computations from the submodules. Specifically, c11-c44 are computed in the gamma submodule to represent altered versions of the inputs, which are then used by the alpha and beta submodules to compute the a and b series respectively. These intermediate arrays are critical in the decision-making logic processed in the llr submodule, which finally computes the output v. The module is structured to handle signals through stages of transformations, involving arithmetic and logical operations, wherein each submodule contributes to the processing pipeline, ensuring organized computation and data integrity at each step.",

Module specification: The MAP1 module is a complex computational unit in Verilog, primarily designed to process two 10-bit wide input signals, y1 and y2, and generate a 10-bit wide output signal, v. The inputs y1 and y2 pass through multiple transformation stages using interconnected submodules\u2014gamma, alpha, beta, and llr\u2014that leverage internal signals to facilitate data processing. The internal signals include arrays a1-a4, b1-b4, and c11-c44, which store intermediate computations from the submodules. Specifically, c11-c44 are computed in the gamma submodule to represent altered versions of the inputs, which are then used by the alpha and beta submodules to compute the a and b series respectively. These intermediate arrays are critical in the decision-making logic processed in the llr submodule, which finally computes the output v. The module is structured to handle signals through stages of transformations, involving arithmetic and logical operations, wherein each submodule contributes to the processing pipeline, ensuring organized computation and data integrity at each step."
