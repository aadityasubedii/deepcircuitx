    "module": "The MAP1 module processes two 10-bit input signals, y1 and y2, to produce a 10-bit output v reflecting complex transformations and arithmetic processing via submodules gamma, alpha, beta, and llr. Each submodule computes and passes on intermediate signals (a1-a4, b1-b4, c11-c44) utilized in sequential processing stages, cumulating in the final output through logical and comparative operations to establish a decision metric encapsulated in v."
