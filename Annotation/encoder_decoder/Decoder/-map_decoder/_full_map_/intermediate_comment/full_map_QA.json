Utilizing submodules such as gamma, beta, alpha, and llr, MAP1 processes these inputs through various computational stages defined by the submodules to ultimately generate output v. Each submodule (gamma, beta, alpha, llr) contributes to different computational aspects, such as calculating intermediate values or making comparisons, which all cumulate in the computation of v.

Each element in these arrays holds a computation result formed through comparisons and summations of specific component inputs and their predecessors. These values contribute toward the decision-making process in later stages, particularly in the `llr` (Log-Likelihood Ratio) submodule.\n  \n- **b1, b2, b3, b4**: These arrays of signals are output from the `beta` submodule and represent another layer of intermediate values that result from the recursive logic applied in `beta`. These signals factor into assessing final outputs in the `llr` module, comparing accumulated decision metrics in conjunction with the a-series values.\n\n- **c11, c12, c23, c24, c31, c32, c43, c44**: These are intermediate values calculated in the `gamma` submodule.

These values serve as critical inputs to both the `alpha` and `beta` modules, influencing the computed values `a1` through `a4` and `b1` through `b4`, respectively. They essentially modify the input data into a more usable form for deeper computation layers.\n\nEach set of these internal signals plays a crucial role bridging raw input data transitionally through each module, progressively abstracting and refining the data for output generation in `v`.
