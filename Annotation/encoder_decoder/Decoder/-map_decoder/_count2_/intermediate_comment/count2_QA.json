When a reset occurs, the output counter and an internal counter ('i') are set to 0. During normal operation post-reset, the counter 'i' is incremented every clock cycle, but 'out' is only incremented on even counts of 'i', effectively skipping every other increment to achieve an alternate cycle increment."
