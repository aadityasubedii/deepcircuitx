Module name: skip_counter. Module specification: The 'skip_counter' module is an efficient digital system engineered to increment a 13-bit output counter named 'out' on every alternate clock cycle, starting from zero. This module requires two input ports: 'clk' and 'reset'. The 'clk' (clock) input is essential for triggering events on its rising edge, ensuring the periodic check of system states and counter values, while 'reset' is a control signal that when high, initializes both the 'out' counter and an internal counter named 'i' by setting them to zero. The sole output port, 'out', serves as the alternate cycle count output of the module. Internally, 'i' operates as an integer-type counter which tracks the number of clock cycles post-reset, facilitating the conditional increment of 'out'â€”incrementing it only when 'i' is even. The Verilog implementation features an 'always' block triggered on the rising edge of 'clk'. Inside this block, if 'reset' is active, both 'out' and 'i' reset to zero. Conversely, if not in reset, the module checks if 'i' is even, in which case 'out' is incremented and 'i' incremented. If 'i' is odd, only 'i' is incremented, effectively skipping the increment of 'out' during these cycles, thereby ensuring the alternate cycle increment functionality is maintained.
