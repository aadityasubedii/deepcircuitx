The 'skip_counter' module increments a 13-bit output ('out') every alternate clock cycle post-reset, controlled by signals 'clk' (clock) and 'reset'. Internal logic utilizes an integer counter 'i', incrementing 'out' only when 'i' is even. On reset, both 'out' and 'i' revert to zero. This alternating increment functionality is realized within an always block triggered on the rising edge of 'clk', ensuring synchronous and conditional counting.
