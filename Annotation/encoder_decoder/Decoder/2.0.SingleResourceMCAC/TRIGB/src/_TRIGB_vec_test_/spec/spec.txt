Module name: test.
Module specification: The 'test' module orchestrates a comprehensive testing environment for two models 'enc' (encoder) and 'dec' (decoder), employing a submodule named 'TRIGB'. The primary functionality of this module includes dynamic test scenarios combining various rates, laws, operational modes, and model types to ensure the encoder and decoder models meet expected performance criteria. Input ports such as `reset`, `clk` (clock signal), scan-related signals (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4` and `scan_enable`), `test_mode`, `TR` (Test Ready), and `AnP` (Analog Parameter) regulate testing phases and modes while ensuring synchronization. The output ports include `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, and `AnR` (Analog Result), which are foundational for diagnosing and analyzing the state and outputs of the TRIGB during tests. Internally, the module utilizes arrays such as `rates`, `laws`, `operations`, `types`, and `models`, which define the parameters for test scenarios. Indexes like `rate`, `law`, `operation`, `type`, `model`, and looping variables `j`, and `loop` dictate the sequence and combination of test trials. The code includes initialization blocks to set up configurations and memory reads, clock inversion for signal generation, and nested looping constructs that manage the intricate test sequencing and verification, logging detailed outputs and performing stop conditions upon errors. The module culminates its test routine with a completion message, cleanly ending the simulation.
