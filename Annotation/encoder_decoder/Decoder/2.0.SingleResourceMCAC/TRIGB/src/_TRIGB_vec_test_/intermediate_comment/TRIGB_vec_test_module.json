    "module": "The 'test' module facilitates comprehensive testing of encoder and decoder models using a configurable submodule 'TRIGB'. It systematically applies a series of tests based on varying parameters (rates, laws, operations, types) driven by arrays and loops, while monitoring outputs through scan chains and analog results to ensure functional integrity. These tests are dynamically executed using nested loops and conditional checks, capturing and reporting discrepancies through detailed logging and controlled simulation halts, ensuring thorough validation of the models under test."
