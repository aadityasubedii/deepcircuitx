    "module": "The TRIGB module handles data transfer or reset operations based on the TR control signal; it transfers a 16-bit input AnP to output AnR if TR is 0, or resets AnR to 0 otherwise. Implemented using an always block that triggers on changes to AnP or TR, AnR's logic is determined by the state of TR, ensuring straightforward combinational logic operations within the module."
