Module name: TRIGB. Module specification: The TRIGB module is specifically designed for either transferring data or performing a reset operation based on the input signal TR. When TR is 0, the module transfers a 16-bit input value from AnP to the output AnR, and if TR is non-zero, it resets AnR to 0. The module has various input ports including reset and clk for synchronization purposes, scan_in0 to scan_in4 for scan chain inputs used in testing, scan_enable for enabling scan mode, test_mode to toggle between normal and test operations, and TR which is the control signal for data transfer or reset operation. Additionally, there is AnP, a 16-bit input data port. The output ports comprise scan_out0 to scan_out4, which are used in testing, and AnR, a 16-bit output that holds data or the reset value. Internally, AnR is the significant signal being either data transferred from AnP or reset to 0 based on TRâ€™s condition. The Verilog code includes an always block which determines AnR's logic based on the value of TR and changes in AnP. This block executes the data transfer or reset actions, showcasing a basic combinational logic implementation in the module.
