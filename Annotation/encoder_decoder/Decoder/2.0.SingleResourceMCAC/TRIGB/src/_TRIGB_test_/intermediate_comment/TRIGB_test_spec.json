    "spec": "Module name: test. \nModule specification: The 'test' module functions primarily as a testbench designed to validate the TRIGB module by simulating environmental conditions such as clocks and resets, alongside various input vectors. It includes input ports like `reset`, `clk` (a clock signal for synchronization), `scan_in0 to scan_in4` (scan inputs for testing flip-flops or registers), `scan_enable` (activates scan mode), `test_mode` (activates test operational mode), `TR` (a control input affecting TRIGB's behavior), and `AnP` (a 16-bit input providing specific data to TRIGB). The output ports are `scan_out0 to scan_out4` (reflecting the state of internal flip-flops post-testing) and `AnR` (a 16-bit output showing processed results from TRIGB). Internally, the module uses registers `TR`, `AnP`, and wire `AnR` to interface with the TRIGB module. The code is structured into several major blocks: instantiation of the TRIGB module, clock signal toggling setup using a defined `CLK_PERIOD`, and an initial block setting initial conditions and called upon simulation start, which also handles optional SDF annotation for scan testing based on a conditional compilation directive `ifdef SDFSCAN`. This configuration aids in thoroughly testing and understanding the TRIGB module's response to various inputs and conditions.",
