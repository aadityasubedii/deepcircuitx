    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is designed as a testbench specifically for simulating the 'boot_mem32' module, aiming to verify its behavior under various conditions including scan test configurations. It includes input ports such as 'reset', 'clk' (clock), 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' (scan inputs), 'scan_enable' (enables scan test mode), and 'test_mode' (activates test operation mode). These inputs facilitate initiating and controlling the system state and testing functionalities. The output ports, 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4', correspond to the inputs and are used to observe outputs from the scan chains inside the 'boot_mem32' module, helping in fault analysis and functionality validation. Internal signals mirror these inputs and outputs, fulfilling roles from synchronizing operations with the clock, resetting the system, feeding test vectors, and extracting test results. The module encapsulates signal initialization and connection to the 'boot_mem32' module, with optional Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotation for timing analysis during gate-level simulation, indicated by a conditional compilation block (`ifdef SDFSCAN`). This testbench effectively initializes all signals and concludes its operation, thereby setting up an environment to test the associated 'boot_mem32' module systematically.",
