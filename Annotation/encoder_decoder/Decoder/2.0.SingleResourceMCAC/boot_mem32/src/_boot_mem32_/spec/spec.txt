Module name: boot_mem32. 

Module specification: The `boot_mem32` module is designed to interface with a Wishbone bus for memory operations in systems that might have requirements for different configurations, especially suitable for XILINX FPGA environments. It utilizes a 32-bit address width and provides byte-enable granularity according to the input parameters: WB_DWIDTH for data width, WB_SWIDTH for select width, and MADDR_WIDTH for memory address width. The module's input ports include `i_wb_clk` (clock), `i_wb_adr` (address), `i_wb_sel` (select), `i_wb_we` (write enable), `i_wb_dat` (data for write), `i_wb_cyc` (cycle valid), and `i_wb_stb` (strobe or validity). The output ports are `o_wb_dat` (data read from memory), `o_wb_ack` (acknowledge of transaction completion), and `o_wb_err` (error signal always deasserted in this design). Internal signals such as `start_write`, `start_read`, `start_read_r`, and `jitter_r` facilitate control of read and write operations, with conditional debugging features influenced by `AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG`. The module further manages data paths through signals like `read_data`, `write_data`, `byte_enable`, and `address`. The memory block instantiation varies based on the FPGA type (`XILINX_FPGA` or generic), and conditional inclusions manage memory parameters through files for different configurations, emphasizing modular and adaptable design for various hardware or simulation needs.
