It supports both read and write operations with the ability for byte-enable granularity, making it compatible with varying data widths. This module includes conditional compilation options to adjust its behavior for different development and debugging environments, such as the inclusion of additional debug signals and different configurations for XILINX FPGAs. The interface ensures data access synchronization using the Wishbone bus signals, handling write and read enabling conditions, generating acknowledgments (o_wb_ack), and managing error signaling (o_wb_err). Additionally, memory parameter files are dynamically included based on defined macros, indicating flexible configuration depending on the specific hardware or simulation environment."

Explanation: Used as the clock signal for the module's operations, ensuring synchronous behavior of the internal logic.\n- i_wb_adr: Address input (32-bit). Explanation: Specifies the memory address for the read or write operation.\n- i_wb_sel: Select input (variable width depending on WB_SWIDTH parameter). Explanation: Indicates which bytes of the data bus are valid for the memory operation, enabling byte-level granularity.\n- i_wb_we: Write enable input. Explanation: A high signal indicates a memory write operation; a low signal indicates a memory read operation.\n- i_wb_dat: Data input (variable width depending on WB_DWIDTH parameter). Explanation: Contains the data to be written to memory during a write operation.\n- i_wb_cyc: Cycle valid input. Explanation: Indicates the presence of an active Wishbone cycle.\n- i_wb_stb: Strobe input. Explanation: Acts as a chip-select or validity signal that indicates a valid data transfer cycle.\n\nOutput ports: \n- o_wb_dat: Data output (variable width depending on WB_DWIDTH parameter). Explanation: Contains the data read from memory in response to a read operation.\n- o_wb_ack: Acknowledge output. Explanation: Indicates that the current Wishbone transaction has been accepted and processed, signaling the end of a successful read or write cycle.\n- o_wb_err: Error output. Explanation: Provides an error signal that can be asserted to indicate abnormal operation or access errors; currently, it is always deasserted in this design."

It is asserted when the `i_wb_stb` (strobe/input valid) and `i_wb_we` (write enable) are both high, and no read operation is in progress (`start_read_r` is not asserted). For debugging configurations, a `jitter_r` register might also influence the assertion.\n- `start_read`: This signal determines when a read operation should begin. It is asserted when there is a valid strobe signal (`i_wb_stb`), write is not enabled (`i_wb_we` is low), and a read hasn't previously been started (`start_read_r` is not asserted).\n- `start_read_r`: A register used to track the initiation and progress of a read operation. Depending on the debugging configuration, it can be a multi-bit register to delay read operation acknowledgment, reflecting more complex real-world timing scenarios or simpler direct mapping to `start_read`.\n- `jitter_r`: Present only in debug configurations. This register is used to introduce artificial jitter into acknowledgment signals (`o_wb_ack`) to mimic or test timing-related issues.\n- `read_data`: Holds the data fetched from memory during a read operation. This wire connections the output from the memory block to the data output port (`o_wb_dat`).\n- `write_data`: Holds the data to be written to the memory during a write operation. This wire carries data from the input port (`i_wb_dat`) to the memory block.\n- `byte_enable`: Reflects the byte-wise enables for read/write operations based on the `i_wb_sel` input. This allows operations at the granularity of a byte within a broader data width defined by `WB_DWIDTH`.\n- `address`: The lower bits of the address input (`i_wb_adr`), adjusted based on `MADDR_WIDTH`, feeding into the memory block to specify the exact memory address for the read or write operation."
