    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is designed to initialize and test the 'boot_mem32' submodule through a series of scan tests, which include setting various scan inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`) and modes (`scan_enable`, `test_mode`) to default states to check for proper functionality. The input ports include `clk` (clock signal for timing operations), `reset` (resets module states), scan inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4` for injecting test vectors), `scan_enable` (activates scan path operations), and `test_mode` (sets module in test state). The output ports consist of scan outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`), reflecting the result of the scan data tests. Internal to the module, the mentioned signals serve functions from controlling operation timings (`clk`), state initialization (`reset`), to handling specific test modes and data paths (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, `test_mode`). The module code is divided into a block that instantiates the `boot_mem32` submodule with all these connections and an initial block that sets the default states of these signals, processes timing annotation through an optional SDF file for scan tests (`$sdf_annotate`), and terminates simulation (`$finish`). This organization ensures the module can be tested under various conditions to verify functionality and integrity.",
