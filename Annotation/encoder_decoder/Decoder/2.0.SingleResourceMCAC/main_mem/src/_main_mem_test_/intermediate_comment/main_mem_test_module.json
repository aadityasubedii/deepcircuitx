    "module": "The \"test\" module is designed to interact with and test a memory module \"main_mem\" using scan chain techniques for verification. It achieves this through input ports for clock synchronization, reset, test data injection (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`), and control signals (`scan_enable`, `test_mode`), and output ports (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`) for observing test results. Internally, it uses register elements to hold these controls and inputs, and integrates with \"main_mem\" via port connections. An initial block sets initial conditions, supports optional SDF annotations for timing accuracy in simulations, and concludes with simulation termination, highlighting its primary usage in test environments."
