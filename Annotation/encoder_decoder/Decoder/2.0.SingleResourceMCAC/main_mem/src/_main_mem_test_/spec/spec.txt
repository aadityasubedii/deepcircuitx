Module name: test. Module specification: The "test" module is configured to interface with and test a primary memory module "main_mem" using scan chain techniques. It utilizes input ports including `clk` (clock) for synchronous operation, `reset` to set the module to a known state, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` for shifting test patterns into the circuit, `scan_enable` to control the scanning operations, and `test_mode` to toggle between normal and test operations. The output ports consist of `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, which capture the state of the `main_mem` after testing to facilitate output evaluation and fault detection. Internally, the module uses registers for `clk`, `reset`, and all `scan_inX` inputs along with `scan_enable` and `test_mode` to store values that control the test state of the memory module. The module includes a main instantiation of the `main_mem`, connecting the inputs and outputs accordingly. An initial block is also present, executing at simulation start, setting initial signal values and optionally annotating a Standard Delay Format (SDF) file if conditional compile flag `SDFSCAN` is defined, which enhances simulation accuracy in test environments. This block finishes simulation execution immediately after setup, indicating primary use in simulation testbenches for design verification.
