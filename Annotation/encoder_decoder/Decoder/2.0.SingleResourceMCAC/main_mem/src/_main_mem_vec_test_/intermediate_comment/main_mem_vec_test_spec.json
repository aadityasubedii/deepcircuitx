    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is designed primarily for the verification and testing of the 'main_mem' submodule under various conditions. It manages input and output scan chains and facilitates both normal and test modes of operation. The input ports include `clk` (clock input), `reset` (reset control), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (input scan chains), `scan_enable` (controls the activation of the scan), and `test_mode` (selects operation mode). The output ports, `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, are used to output the results from the scan tests. Internally, the module uses register types for control signals (`clk`, `reset`, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, `test_mode`) to manage states, and wire types for the outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`) to carry the scan results. The module includes initial blocks which set up simulation properties and states such as time format and conditions for optional SDF annotation, as well as default low states on all signals followed by a termination of the simulation. This setup primarily aims to initialize testing environments and conditions without simulating dynamic behavior within the 'test' module itself.",
