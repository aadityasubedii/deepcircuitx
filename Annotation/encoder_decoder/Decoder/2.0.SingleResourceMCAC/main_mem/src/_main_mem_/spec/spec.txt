Module name: main_mem.  
Module specification: The 'main_mem' module is designed primarily for scan testing in digital circuits, facilitating diagnostics and fault detection through a series of scan inputs and outputs synchronized by a clock signal. The module consists of several input ports including `reset` (used to initialize the module to a known state), `clk` (the clock signal for timing operations), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (test inputs for scan testing), `scan_enable` (controls the enabling of scan test operations), and `test_mode` (switches the module between normal and test modes). The output ports are `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, which are used to output the results or internal states during the scan testing process. No internal signals are detailed in the provided code snippet, implying that this preliminary module outline primarily sets up the interface for further detailed implementation. The code mainly provides the structural setup with port declarations, lacking detailed internal logic or block sections, which suggests that the core functionality and specific operations within those blocks need to be implemented subsequently based on the defined interface.
