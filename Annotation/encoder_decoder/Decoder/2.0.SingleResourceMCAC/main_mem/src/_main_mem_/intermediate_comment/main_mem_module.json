    "module": "The 'main_mem' module facilitates scan testing in digital circuits, providing fault analysis capabilities through pattern application and observation on its inputs and outputs, controlled by a clock and reset signals. It interfaces via inputs 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode' for test configuration and outputs 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' reflecting internal states, all lacking internal logic in this skeleton, set up for further development."
