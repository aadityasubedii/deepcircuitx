    "spec": "Module name: tb_uart. Module specification: The tb_uart module is a testbench component designed to simulate and test the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) functionality, specifically focusing on simulating the sending and receiving of UART data. The input ports include `clk` for the clock signal, `reset` for resetting internal states, `scan_enable` and `test_mode` which are unused in the visible code but are likely intended for test configurations, `i_uart_cts_n` for the Clear To Send signal which is active low, and `i_uart_rxd` for receiving serial data. Output ports are `o_uart_txd` for transmitting data and `o_uart_rts_n` hard-wired to '0' indicating permanent readiness to receive data. Internally, the module employs `clk_uart` as a buffered clock signal, uses several signals such as `rx_state`, `rx_byte`, `tx_state`, and `tx_byte` to manage state machines for receive and transmit functions respectively, and incorporates FIFO buffers managed by signals like `txfifo_empty` and `txfifo_full` for handling transmission data. The code is split into several key sections: setup of IO ports and internal signals, a clock buffer instantiation for `clk`, and state machines controlling the reception and transmission of UART data, all synchronously operated with `clk_uart`. Various signals and states are manipulated to ensure the UART data is processed correctly, accommodating start/stop bits and packing/unpacking data bytes efficiently.",

Module specification: The tb_uart module is a testbench component designed to simulate and test the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) functionality, specifically focusing on simulating the sending and receiving of UART data. The input ports include `clk` for the clock signal, `reset` for resetting internal states, `scan_enable` and `test_mode` which are unused in the visible code but are likely intended for test configurations, `i_uart_cts_n` for the Clear To Send signal which is active low, and `i_uart_rxd` for receiving serial data. Output ports are `o_uart_txd` for transmitting data and `o_uart_rts_n` hard-wired to '0' indicating permanent readiness to receive data. Internally, the module employs `clk_uart` as a buffered clock signal, uses several signals such as `rx_state`, `rx_byte`, `tx_state`, and `tx_byte` to manage state machines for receive and transmit functions respectively, and incorporates FIFO buffers managed by signals like `txfifo_empty` and `txfifo_full` for handling transmission data. The code is split into several key sections: setup of IO ports and internal signals, a clock buffer instantiation for `clk`, and state machines controlling the reception and transmission of UART data, all synchronously operated with `clk_uart`. Various signals and states are manipulated to ensure the UART data is processed correctly, accommodating start/stop bits and packing/unpacking data bytes efficiently."
