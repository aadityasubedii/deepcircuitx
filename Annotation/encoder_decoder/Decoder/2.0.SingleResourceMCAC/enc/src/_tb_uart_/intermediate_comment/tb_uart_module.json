    "module": "The tb_uart module simulates UART communication, handling transmission and reception of serial data based on UART protocols. It uses state machines for data handling, FIFO buffers for data transmission management, and is synchronized to a buffered version of the input clock signal, ensuring accurate timing and operation under test conditions. This testbench is crucial for verifying UART functionality in separate hardware designs."
