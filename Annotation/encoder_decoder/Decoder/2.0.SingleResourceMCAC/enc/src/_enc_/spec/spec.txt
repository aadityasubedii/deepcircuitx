Module name: enc. Module specification: The 'enc' module is a complex digital system designed for data processing and interfacing, likely serving as an encryption/decryption unit or similar data processing block in a larger system. It includes multiple components such as UART, timer, interrupt controller, and memory interfaces, coordinated through a Wishbone bus architecture. The module has numerous input and output ports for system control (reset, clk), data processing (enc_s, enc_o), testing (scan_in/out, test_mode), UART communication (uart_tx/rx), and Wishbone bus interfaces for memory and configuration. Internal signals manage clock distribution, Wishbone bus communications, interrupts, and system readiness. The module consists of several key blocks: a clock generator (CLK_GEN), Wishbone arbiter, boot memory, coprocessor (APRSC), UART, TDMI (input),
