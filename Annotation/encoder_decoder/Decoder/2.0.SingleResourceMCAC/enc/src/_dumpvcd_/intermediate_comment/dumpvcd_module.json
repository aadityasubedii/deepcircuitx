    "module": "The `dumpvcd` module manages the creation and control of Value Change Dump (VCD) files for debugging purposes in simulation environments. It initializes the VCD logging based on predefined intervals and conditions, using internal signals from various modules to monitor and record system states and activities. The module reacts to specific simulation ticks to toggle VCD logging on or off dynamically, enhancing the ability to diagnose and trace issues during processor simulation without external inputs or outputs."
