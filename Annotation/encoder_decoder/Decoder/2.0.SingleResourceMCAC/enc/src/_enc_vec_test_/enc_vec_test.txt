This testbench module verifies an encoder/decoder system's functionality and performance. It sets up a simulation environment with clock generation, reset handling, and memory initialization, loads test vectors, configures the device under test, and compares outputs against expected results. The module uses internal signals to simulate inputs, capture outputs, and manage various test scenarios including different encoding/decoding modes, laws, and rates. It incorporates memory initialization, UART simulation, configuration interface, and data generation/capture logic, along with error checking mechanisms and detailed result reporting.
