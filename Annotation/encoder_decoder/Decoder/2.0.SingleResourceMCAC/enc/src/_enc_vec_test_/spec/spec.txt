Module name: test. Module specification: This module is a testbench for an encoder/decoder system, designed to comprehensively verify its functionality and performance. It sets up a simulation environment that includes clock generation, reset handling, and memory initialization. The testbench loads test vectors, configures the device under test (DUT), and verifies its output against expected results. It has no explicit input or output ports, as it's a self-contained test environment. Key internal signals include clocks, resets, and various control signals for managing test scenarios. The module uses numerous internal registers and wires to simulate inputs to the DUT and capture outputs for verification. It incorporates several functional blocks, including memory initialization, UART simulation, configuration interface, and data generation/capture logic. The testbench supports various test scenarios with different encoding/decoding modes, laws, and rates. It also includes error checking mechanisms and provides detailed output for test results.
