    "module": "This testbench module simulates and verifies an encryption/decryption system. It generates clock signals, initializes memory, loads test vectors, and configures the device under test (DUT) with various operational parameters. The module applies test vectors to the DUT, captures outputs, and compares them with expected results. It implements error checking, supports different operational modes and rates, and provides comprehensive logging and reporting functionality."
