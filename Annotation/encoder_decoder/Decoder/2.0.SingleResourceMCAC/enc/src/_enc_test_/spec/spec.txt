Module name: test. Module specification: This module is a comprehensive testbench for an encryption/decryption system. It simulates the entire system, including clock generation, memory initialization, and various test configurations. The module doesn't have explicit input or output ports, as it's a self-contained testbench. It generates stimuli internally and monitors the behavior of the device under test (DUT). Key internal signals include clocks (clk, uart_clk), reset signals, memory-related signals for initialization, UART interface signals, and numerous control and data signals for the encryption/decryption process. The testbench is structured into several main sections: initialization, memory loading, test vector generation, DUT instantiation, and result checking. It loads test vectors from files, applies them to the DUT, and compares outputs with expected results. The module simulates different operational modes, laws, and rates for the encryption/decryption process
