    "spec": "Module name: main_mem. Module specification: The 'main_mem' module is designed to provide a simulated memory interface, compatible with the Wishbone bus protocol, and supports both read and write operations. The module is configurable through parameters allowing it to operate with 128-bit or 32-bit data widths (`WB_DWIDTH`). It maintains diverse input ports such as 'clk' (clock signal), 'reset' (to reset the state), 'scan_enable' (for scan mode, not actively used), 'test_mode', 'i_mem_ctrl' (for addressing mode), and various Wishbone-specific signals like 'i_wb_adr' (address), 'i_wb_sel' (selection for byte lanes in memory), 'i_wb_we' (write enable), 'i_wb_dat' (data input), 'i_wb_cyc' (bus cycle indicator), and 'i_wb_stb' (strobe signal). Output ports incorporate 'o_wb_dat' (output data to the bus), 'o_wb_ack' (acknowledge signal), and 'o_wb_err' (error indication, statically assigned).\n\nInternally, the module employs signals such as 'ram' (emulated memory storage consisting of 128-bit registers), 'start_write', 'start_read' (signals to initiate write and read operations), 'busy' (indicating ongoing operations), and various delayed and mask signals to correctly sequence and process memory transactions based on bus and control inputs.\n\nThe module is structured into main segments based on data width - a 'wb128' block handling 128-bit operations and a 'wb32' block managing 32-bit operations. These segments are primarily responsible for managing read/write cycles, data manipulation and alignment, signal masking, and updating memory content and outputs. Furthermore, these blocks include conditional elements (generate blocks) that allow for the distinction in operations dependent on parametric configuration. Memory initializations and data manipulations in read and write cycles are detailed, providing a robust emulation suitable for larger system simulations where memory behavior needs to be closely mimicked.",

                    "text": "Module name: main_mem. Module specification: The 'main_mem' module is designed to provide a simulated memory interface, compatible with the Wishbone bus protocol, and supports both read and write operations. The module is configurable through parameters allowing it to operate with 128-bit or 32-bit data widths (`WB_DWIDTH`). It maintains diverse input ports such as 'clk' (clock signal), 'reset' (to reset the state), 'scan_enable' (for scan mode, not actively used), 'test_mode', 'i_mem_ctrl' (for addressing mode), and various Wishbone-specific signals like 'i_wb_adr' (address), 'i_wb_sel' (selection for byte lanes in memory), 'i_wb_we' (write enable), 'i_wb_dat' (data input), 'i_wb_cyc' (bus cycle indicator), and 'i_wb_stb' (strobe signal). Output ports incorporate 'o_wb_dat' (output data to the bus), 'o_wb_ack' (acknowledge signal), and 'o_wb_err' (error indication, statically assigned).\n\nInternally, the module employs signals such as 'ram' (emulated memory storage consisting of 128-bit registers), 'start_write', 'start_read' (signals to initiate write and read operations), 'busy' (indicating ongoing operations), and various delayed and mask signals to correctly sequence and process memory transactions based on bus and control inputs.\n\nThe module is structured into main segments based on data width - a 'wb128' block handling 128-bit operations and a 'wb32' block managing 32-bit operations. These segments are primarily responsible for managing read/write cycles, data manipulation and alignment, signal masking, and updating memory content and outputs. Furthermore, these blocks include conditional elements (generate blocks) that allow for the distinction in operations dependent on parametric configuration. Memory initializations and data manipulations in read and write cycles are detailed, providing a robust emulation suitable for larger system simulations where memory behavior needs to be closely mimicked."
