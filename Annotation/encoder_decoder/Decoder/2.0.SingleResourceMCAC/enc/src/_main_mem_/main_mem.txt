The 'main_mem' module simulates a memory interface designed to handle read and write operations, configurable for 128-bit or 32-bit data widths, compatible with the Wishbone bus protocol. It employs internal registers and memory arrays ('ram'), controlled by signals for write and read commands, data masking, and handling bus signals (address, select, and strobe). The module operates through generate blocks that distinguish between 128-bit and 32-bit operations, ensuring appropriate data mapping, synchronization, and responses through 'o_wb_dat', 'o_wb_ack', and 'o_wb_err' outputs based on bus communication and control inputs.
