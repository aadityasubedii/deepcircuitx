    "module": "The 'test' module is a testbench developed to verify the functionality of the 'mcac' module under various conditions, effectively ensuring robust operation. It initializes and simulates input and output signals including clocks, resets, and control signals for encoders and decoders, alongside testing UART and Master module Wishbone protocol functionalities. The module employs internal signals for monitoring operation and sets up the simulation environment using initial blocks and potentially SDF annotations for precise timing analysis, preparing the system by setting all inputs and operational modes to default states initially."
