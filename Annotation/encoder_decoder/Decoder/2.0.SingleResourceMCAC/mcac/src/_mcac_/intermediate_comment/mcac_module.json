    "module": "The mcac module integrates communication and control functionalities, supporting parameterized configurations for data and selection widths, and handles test and scan operations, UART interfacing, and memory-mapped controls. It uses internal signals for configuration and data handling, encapsulating processes in submodules CFG_INT, ENC_INST0, and DEC_INST0, which manage system settings, encoding, and decoding respectively, all coordinated via specific input and output bus signals for effective data transfer and operation control in varying digital system applications."
