Module name: mcac. 
Module specification: The module "mcac" is designed to integrate communication and control functionalities in a parameterized manner, supporting configurations tailored for different environments. It features inputs like system clock (`clk`) and reset (`reset`), and specific inputs for scan chain and test mode operations (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, `test_mode`), as well as communication input/output through UART (`i_uart0_tx_e`, `o_uart0_rx_e`, etc.) and memory-mapped interfaces (`i_mm_wb_dat_e`, `o_mm_wb_dat_e`, etc.). The module operates with a width defined by parameters `WB_DWIDTH` for data width, `WB_SWIDTH` for selection width, and specifies the number of slave modules (`WB_SLAVES`). Internal signals such as configuration address (`o_cfg_wb_adr_e`), data (`o_cfg_wb_dat_e`), and control signals (`o_cfg_wb_we_e`) enable detailed memory and peripheral management. The mcac module contains submodules `CFG_INT`, `ENC_INST0`, and `DEC_INST0` which handle system configuration, encoding, and decoding functionalities respectively with their operations well-coordinated through specific bus cycles and control signals set out in the design. Each submodule is interconnected using a configuration interface that is controlled by both input and output data and bus signals, providing robust data transfer capabilities. This versatile module is essential for complex digital system applications such as system testing, data encoding/decoding, and interfacing through complex communication protocols.
