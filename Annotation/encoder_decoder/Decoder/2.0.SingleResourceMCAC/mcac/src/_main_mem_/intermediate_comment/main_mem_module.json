    "module": "The `main_mem` module interfaces with a memory system, handling memory read and write operations with configurable 32-bit or 128-bit data widths, managed by the `WB_DWIDTH` parameter. It utilizes input signals for control (`i_wb_we`, `i_wb_stb`) and data transaction (`i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_adr`) and synchronizes these operations using internal pipeline stages and conditional processing based on the data width. Memory operations are executed in specific blocks (`wb128`, `wb32`), handling different data width configurations and alignment, ensuring accurate data read/write with support for partial writes through byte enable (`i_wb_sel`)."
