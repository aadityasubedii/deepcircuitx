    "module": "The tb_uart module simulates a UART interface for testing serial data transmission and reception. It manages data flow control and byte serialization/deserialization through input/output ports and internal state machines, handling timings and buffer operations based on configurable parameters such as clock frequency and baud rate, thereby ensuring accurate operation of UART communications in test environments."
