Module name: tb_uart. Module specification: The 'tb_uart' module is designed as a testbench for simulating a UART communication interface in Verilog. It effectively tests UART reception and transmission functionalities by processing and sending serial data. Input ports include `clk` serving as a clock signal for sequential operations, `reset` to initialize system states, `scan_enable` and `test_mode` for testing controls, `i_uart_cts_n` a clear to send signal for flow control, and `i_uart_rxd` for receiving serial data. Output ports are `o_uart_txd` for transmitting serial data and `o_uart_rts_n` for flow control indicating readiness to receive data. Key internal signals include `clk_uart` as a dedicated UART clock, `rx_state`, `rx_bit`, `rx_byte` for managing received bits and bytes, `rx_tap` and `rx_start_negedge` to detect start bits, `tx_state`, `tx_bit`, `tx_byte` for handling transmission states, bits, and bytes, and FIFO buffers (`tx_fifo`, `txfifo_empty`, `txfifo_full`) for storing bytes before transmission. The code structures these functionalities into multiple blocks controlled by state machines and sequential operations addressing UART specifics such as baud rate, bit count, and byte assembly, crucial for accurately simulating UART communication.
