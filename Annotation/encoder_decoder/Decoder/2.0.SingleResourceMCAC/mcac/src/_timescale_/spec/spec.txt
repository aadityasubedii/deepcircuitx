Module name: Not Applicable. 
Module specification: The provided Verilog snippet does not define a module; rather, it contains only a compiler directive, specifically the `timescale directive. This directive is utilized to set the time units and precision for simulations in Verilog, denoted as 1 nanosecond for the unit and 1 picosecond for precision in the snippet. Since there is no module structure or content beyond this directive, there are no input or output ports, no internal signals, and no distinct blocks or sections of code related to typical module functionalities. Hence, without further module-related code or context, no detailed specification concerning typical Verilog module components such as ports, signals, or functional blocks can be provided.
