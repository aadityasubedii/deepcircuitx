Module name: test. Module specification: This testbench module simulates and verifies a hardware design for a communication system, focusing on encoding and decoding operations. It lacks explicit input and output ports, instead generating stimuli internally and monitoring the device under test (DUT). Key internal signals include clocks (clk, uart_clk), reset, data signals (enc_s, dec_i), frame sync signals (enc_s_fs, dec_i_fs), UART signals, and Wishbone bus signals for memory interfaces. The module is structured with sections for clock generation, reset handling, memory loading, configuration setup, data generation, and output verification. It implements file I/O for loading test vectors and memory initialization, supports various operational modes (encoding/decoding), data rates, and law configurations. The testbench generates input patterns, applies them to the DUT, captures outputs, and compares them against expected results, providing error
