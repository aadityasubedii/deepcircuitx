    "module": "This testbench simulates and verifies a communication system's encoding and decoding operations. It generates input patterns, configures the device under test (DUT) with various modes and parameters, applies stimuli, captures outputs, and compares them against expected results. The module implements clock generation, reset handling, memory loading, and data verification using internal signals for clocks, data, and control. It supports file I/O for test vectors and memory initialization, and includes error checking and reporting mechanisms to ensure proper functionality of the DUT across different operational modes and configurations."
