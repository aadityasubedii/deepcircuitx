    "spec": "Module name: wishbone_arbiter.  \nModule specification:\nThe `wishbone_arbiter` is a Verilog module designed to handle arbitration between two masters and eight slaves in a Wishbone bus system, used primarily in embedded systems. This module manages and arbitrates access to a shared bus, ensuring simultaneous requests are handled according to a predefined set of rules, managing bus requests, and ensuring data integrity during transmissions. The inputs to the module include a clock signal (`i_wb_clk`), address, select, write enable, data, cycle, and strobe signals from two masters (`i_m0_*` and `i_m1_*`), and data, acknowledge, and error signals from eight slaves (`i_s0_*` to `i_s7_*`). The outputs include data, acknowledge, and error signals to the two masters (`o_m0_*` and `o_m1_*`), and address, select, write enable, data, cycle, and strobe signals to the eight slaves (`o_s0_*` to `o_s7_*`). Internally, the module utilizes registers (`m0_wb_hold_r`, `m1_wb_hold_r`, and `current_master_r`) and wires (`current_master`, `next_master`, `select_master`, `current_slave`, `master_adr`, `master_sel`, `master_we`, `master_wdat`, `master_cyc`, `master_stb`, `master_rdat`, `master_ack`, and `master_err`) to track the state and control the logic flow, deciding which master can access which slave at any time. The code is organized into blocks handling master selection based on ongoing transactions, master-to-slave signal routing, and slave feedback to the appropriate master. Overall, this module efficiently directs traffic on a Wishbone bus, handling concurrency and conflict resolution to maintain stable and reliable system operations.",

It arbitrates requests from two master devices and directs these requests to one of eight slave devices based on the memory address being accessed. The arbiter ensures that only one master accesses a particular slave at any time, decides the priority between the masters, holds transactions if the bus is busy, and handles the handshaking signals like acknowledgments and error flags between the masters and slaves. It monitors the activity on the bus, determines the destination slave based on the address locations defined in the `memory_configuration.vh` file, and navigates data flow from the active master to the selected slave and vice versa. The module employs select lines, write enable, data in/out, and cycle and strobe signals to manage the data transmission and reception across the bus system effectively."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports: \n- `i_wb_clk`: Clock input. This is the main clock signal for the module, used to synchronize all operations within the arbiter.\n- `i_m0_wb_adr`, `i_m1_wb_adr`: Address inputs from Master 0 and Master 1, respectively. These carry the memory address that each master is trying to access.\n- `i_m0_wb_sel`, `i_m1_wb_sel`: Select inputs from Master 0 and Master 1. These are used to specify which byte lanes to operate upon, allowing for partial data transfers.\n- `i_m0_wb_we`, `i_m1_wb_we`: Write-enable inputs from Master 0 and Master 1. A high value indicates a write operation; a low value indicates a read.\n- `i_m0_wb_dat`, `i_m1_wb_dat`: Data inputs from Master 0 and Master 1. These carry the data to be written to the slave devices during write operations.\n- `i_m0_wb_cyc`, `i_m1_wb_cyc`: Cycle inputs from Master 0 and Master 1. These indicate that a Wishbone cycle is active.\n- `i_m0_wb_stb`, `i_m1_wb_stb`: Strobe inputs from Master 0 and Master 1. These signals, when active, indicate that the master is requesting a data transfer.\n- `i_s0_wb_dat` to `i_s7_wb_dat`: Data inputs from Slave 0 to Slave 7. These ports carry the data read from the slaves back to the masters.\n- `i_s0_wb_ack` to `i_s7_wb_ack`: Acknowledge inputs from Slave 0 to Slave 7. These indicate that the slave has completed the requested operation (either read or write).\n- `i_s0_wb_err` to `i_s7_wb_err`: Error inputs from Slave 0 to Slave 7. Indicate an error condition in the transaction with the respective slave.\n\nOutput ports: \n- `o_m0_wb_dat`, `o_m1_wb_dat`: Data outputs to Master 0 and Master 1. These carry data read from the slave devices back to the masters.\n- `o_m0_wb_ack`, `o_m1_wb_ack`: Acknowledge outputs to Master 0 and Master 1. These indicate that the transaction has been successfully completed.\n- `o_m0_wb_err`, `o_m1_wb_err`: Error outputs to Master 0 and Master 1. Indicate an error condition in the transaction.\n- `o_s0_wb_adr` to `o_s7_wb_adr`: Address outputs to Slave 0 to Slave 7. They carry the address of the data to be accessed in the slaves.\n- `o_s0_wb_sel` to `o_s7_wb_sel`: Select outputs to Slave 0 to Slave 7. Specify which byte lanes to operate upon in the slaves.\n- `o_s0_wb_we` to `o_s7_wb_we`: Write-enable outputs to Slave 0 to Slave 7. Indicate whether the operation is a read or write.\n- `o_s0_wb_cyc` to `o_s7_wb_cyc`: Cycle outputs to Slave 0 to Slave 7. Indicate that a bus cycle is active.\n- `o_s0_wb_stb` to `o_s7_wb_stb`: Strobe outputs to Slave 0 to Slave 7. Indicate that the master is requesting a data transfer to the slave.\n\nThese inputs and outputs facilitate the arbitration of bus transactions from the masters to the appropriate slave devices, ensuring orderly access and handling in a multi-master system."

They are used to manage transaction continuations when a master does not immediately relinquish the bus after a transaction due to waiting for an acknowledge.\n- `current_master`: This wire signal determines which master is currently controlling the bus. It switches between the two masters based on bus availability and master requests.\n- `current_master_r`: This register holds the value of `current_master` across clock cycles to provide a stable indication of which master was in control in the previous cycle.\n- `next_master`: This wire signal proposes the next master to take control based on the ongoing cycles and signals from the masters.\n- `select_master`: This wire determines if a switch in control to the proposed next master should occur. It takes into consideration whether the currently controlling master is ready to release the bus.\n- `current_slave`: This wire encodes which slave is currently targeted for data transactions based on the address provided by the active master. This signal is crucial for directing bus transactions to the correct slave.\n- `master_adr`, `master_sel`, `master_we`, `master_wdat`, `master_cyc`, `master_stb`: These signals carry the address, select bits, write enable, data, cycle active, and strobe signals from the active master to the targeted slave. They represent the core bus transaction parameters carried over from the master to the slave on the Wishbone bus.\n- `master_rdat`, `master_ack`, `master_err`: These wires carry the data read, acknowledge signal, and error status from the currently addressed slave back to the appropriate master. They are crucial for closing transaction loops and providing status feedback to the masters."

This module manages and arbitrates access to a shared bus, ensuring simultaneous requests are handled according to a predefined set of rules, managing bus requests, and ensuring data integrity during transmissions. The inputs to the module include a clock signal (`i_wb_clk`), address, select, write enable, data, cycle, and strobe signals from two masters (`i_m0_*` and `i_m1_*`), and data, acknowledge, and error signals from eight slaves (`i_s0_*` to `i_s7_*`). The outputs include data, acknowledge, and error signals to the two masters (`o_m0_*` and `o_m1_*`), and address, select, write enable, data, cycle, and strobe signals to the eight slaves (`o_s0_*` to `o_s7_*`). Internally, the module utilizes registers (`m0_wb_hold_r`, `m1_wb_hold_r`, and `current_master_r`) and wires (`current_master`, `next_master`, `select_master`, `current_slave`, `master_adr`, `master_sel`, `master_we`, `master_wdat`, `master_cyc`, `master_stb`, `master_rdat`, `master_ack`, and `master_err`) to track the state and control the logic flow, deciding which master can access which slave at any time. The code is organized into blocks handling master selection based on ongoing transactions, master-to-slave signal routing, and slave feedback to the appropriate master. Overall, this module efficiently directs traffic on a Wishbone bus, handling concurrency and conflict resolution to maintain stable and reliable system operations."

It arbitrates requests from two master devices and directs these requests to one of eight slave devices based on the memory address being accessed. The arbiter ensures that only one master accesses a particular slave at any time, decides the priority between the masters, holds transactions if the bus is busy, and handles the handshaking signals like acknowledgments and error flags between the masters and slaves. It monitors the activity on the bus, determines the destination slave based on the address locations defined in the `memory_configuration.vh` file, and navigates data flow from the active master to the selected slave and vice versa. The module employs select lines, write enable, data in/out, and cycle and strobe signals to manage the data transmission and reception across the bus system effectively."

This is the main clock signal for the module, used to synchronize all operations within the arbiter.\n- `i_m0_wb_adr`, `i_m1_wb_adr`: Address inputs from Master 0 and Master 1, respectively. These carry the memory address that each master is trying to access.\n- `i_m0_wb_sel`, `i_m1_wb_sel`: Select inputs from Master 0 and Master 1. These are used to specify which byte lanes to operate upon, allowing for partial data transfers.\n- `i_m0_wb_we`, `i_m1_wb_we`: Write-enable inputs from Master 0 and Master 1. A high value indicates a write operation; a low value indicates a read.\n- `i_m0_wb_dat`, `i_m1_wb_dat`: Data inputs from Master 0 and Master 1. These carry the data to be written to the slave devices during write operations.\n- `i_m0_wb_cyc`, `i_m1_wb_cyc`: Cycle inputs from Master 0 and Master 1. These indicate that a Wishbone cycle is active.\n- `i_m0_wb_stb`, `i_m1_wb_stb`: Strobe inputs from Master 0 and Master 1. These signals, when active, indicate that the master is requesting a data transfer.\n- `i_s0_wb_dat` to `i_s7_wb_dat`: Data inputs from Slave 0 to Slave 7. These ports carry the data read from the slaves back to the masters.\n- `i_s0_wb_ack` to `i_s7_wb_ack`: Acknowledge inputs from Slave 0 to Slave 7. These indicate that the slave has completed the requested operation (either read or write).\n- `i_s0_wb_err` to `i_s7_wb_err`: Error inputs from Slave 0 to Slave 7. Indicate an error condition in the transaction with the respective slave.\n\nOutput ports: \n- `o_m0_wb_dat`, `o_m1_wb_dat`: Data outputs to Master 0 and Master 1. These carry data read from the slave devices back to the masters.\n- `o_m0_wb_ack`, `o_m1_wb_ack`: Acknowledge outputs to Master 0 and Master 1. These indicate that the transaction has been successfully completed.\n- `o_m0_wb_err`, `o_m1_wb_err`: Error outputs to Master 0 and Master 1. Indicate an error condition in the transaction.\n- `o_s0_wb_adr` to `o_s7_wb_adr`: Address outputs to Slave 0 to Slave 7. They carry the address of the data to be accessed in the slaves.\n- `o_s0_wb_sel` to `o_s7_wb_sel`: Select outputs to Slave 0 to Slave 7. Specify which byte lanes to operate upon in the slaves.\n- `o_s0_wb_we` to `o_s7_wb_we`: Write-enable outputs to Slave 0 to Slave 7. Indicate whether the operation is a read or write.\n- `o_s0_wb_cyc` to `o_s7_wb_cyc`: Cycle outputs to Slave 0 to Slave 7. Indicate that a bus cycle is active.\n- `o_s0_wb_stb` to `o_s7_wb_stb`: Strobe outputs to Slave 0 to Slave 7. Indicate that the master is requesting a data transfer to the slave.\n\nThese inputs and outputs facilitate the arbitration of bus transactions from the masters to the appropriate slave devices, ensuring orderly access and handling in a multi-master system."

They are used to manage transaction continuations when a master does not immediately relinquish the bus after a transaction due to waiting for an acknowledge.\n- `current_master`: This wire signal determines which master is currently controlling the bus. It switches between the two masters based on bus availability and master requests.\n- `current_master_r`: This register holds the value of `current_master` across clock cycles to provide a stable indication of which master was in control in the previous cycle.\n- `next_master`: This wire signal proposes the next master to take control based on the ongoing cycles and signals from the masters.\n- `select_master`: This wire determines if a switch in control to the proposed next master should occur. It takes into consideration whether the currently controlling master is ready to release the bus.\n- `current_slave`: This wire encodes which slave is currently targeted for data transactions based on the address provided by the active master. This signal is crucial for directing bus transactions to the correct slave.\n- `master_adr`, `master_sel`, `master_we`, `master_wdat`, `master_cyc`, `master_stb`: These signals carry the address, select bits, write enable, data, cycle active, and strobe signals from the active master to the targeted slave. They represent the core bus transaction parameters carried over from the master to the slave on the Wishbone bus.\n- `master_rdat`, `master_ack`, `master_err`: These wires carry the data read, acknowledge signal, and error status from the currently addressed slave back to the appropriate master. They are crucial for closing transaction loops and providing status feedback to the masters."

This module manages and arbitrates access to a shared bus, ensuring simultaneous requests are handled according to a predefined set of rules, managing bus requests, and ensuring data integrity during transmissions. The inputs to the module include a clock signal (`i_wb_clk`), address, select, write enable, data, cycle, and strobe signals from two masters (`i_m0_*` and `i_m1_*`), and data, acknowledge, and error signals from eight slaves (`i_s0_*` to `i_s7_*`). The outputs include data, acknowledge, and error signals to the two masters (`o_m0_*` and `o_m1_*`), and address, select, write enable, data, cycle, and strobe signals to the eight slaves (`o_s0_*` to `o_s7_*`). Internally, the module utilizes registers (`m0_wb_hold_r`, `m1_wb_hold_r`, and `current_master_r`) and wires (`current_master`, `next_master`, `select_master`, `current_slave`, `master_adr`, `master_sel`, `master_we`, `master_wdat`, `master_cyc`, `master_stb`, `master_rdat`, `master_ack`, and `master_err`) to track the state and control the logic flow, deciding which master can access which slave at any time. The code is organized into blocks handling master selection based on ongoing transactions, master-to-slave signal routing, and slave feedback to the appropriate master. Overall, this module efficiently directs traffic on a Wishbone bus, handling concurrency and conflict resolution to maintain stable and reliable system operations."
