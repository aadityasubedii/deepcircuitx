    "module": "This module performs soft calibration for a Memory Controller Block (MCB), including initialization, termination calibration, and dynamic DQS signal calibration. It utilizes a state machine to control the calibration process, interacting with IODRP controllers and the MCB interface. The module adjusts termination values, sets DQS delays, and performs dynamic calibration cycles to optimize signal integrity and timing. It handles various memory types and operating conditions, including self-refresh modes, and adapts calibration parameters based on measured values and predefined thresholds."
