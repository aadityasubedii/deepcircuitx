This module implements a 512x128-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA block RAM primitives. It utilizes four 36-bit wide RAMB16BWER instances, each handling a 32-bit portion of the 128-bit data width. The design supports read and write operations with a 9-bit address input, 128-bit data input/output, and 16-bit byte enable for selective writing. The module can be initialized with user-defined values through parameters and allows for efficient storage and retrieval of 128-bit wide data in 512 addressable locations.
