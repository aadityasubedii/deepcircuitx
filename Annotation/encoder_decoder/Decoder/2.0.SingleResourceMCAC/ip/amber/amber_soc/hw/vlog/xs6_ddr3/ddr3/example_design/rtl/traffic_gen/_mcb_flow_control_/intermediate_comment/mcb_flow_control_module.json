    "module": "The mcb_flow_control module manages command flow to a memory controller, handling operations like read, write, and refresh for DRAM interfacing. It utilizes input and output ports to receive commands and statuses and issue responses back to the memory controller, while internal signals and a state machine coordinate the operation's logic and sequence, optimizing command processing based on the system's state and memory interface conditions."
