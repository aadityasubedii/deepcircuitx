The `boot_mem32` module interfaces a Wishbone bus to memory, allowing for read and write operations synchronized by inputs such as address, data, and control signals. Parameterization supports various data widths and memory addressing specifics. Internally, the module orchestrates memory operations through signals like `start_write` and `start_read`, abiding by the Wishbone protocol, and includes optional debug features for enhanced operation checks under the `AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG` directive, with dual conditional memory instantiation supporting both general and FPGA-specific memories.
