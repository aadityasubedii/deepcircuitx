Module name: main_mem. Module specification: The `main_mem` is a Verilog module designed to interface with a system bus to manage memory read and write operations. It interacts with different data width buses, configurable through parameters (`WB_DWIDTH` and `WB_SWIDTH`), supporting 32 or 128 bits wide data transfers. Key input ports include `i_clk` for clock synchronization, `i_mem_ctrl` for address modification control, `i_wb_adr`, `i_wb_sel`, and `i_wb_dat` for addressing, byte selection, and data inputs from the bus, respectively. It also processes control signals `i_wb_we`, `i_wb_cyc`, and `i_wb_stb` indicating write enable, cycle validity, and transfer activity. The output ports, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_ack`, and `o_wb_err`, send data back to the bus, acknowledge transactions, and report errors (though error handling isn't implemented in the current code). Internal signals such as `ram` for internal memory storage, `start_write` and `start_read` to initiate memory operations, `start_read_d1` and `start_read_d2` as delayed signals for operation synchronization, alongside `rd_data`, `masked_wdata`, and `wr_mask` manage data flow and access within the module. The Generate block in the code selectively compiles sections for handling different widths (32 or 128 bits) and specific memory operations like masked data writing and data reading based on bus width parameter setting. The module ensures robust and adaptable memory management in hardware systems, particularly adaptable for varying bus interfaces and configurations.
