Module name: a25_execute. Module specification: The a25_execute module is a central execution unit in a microprocessor, likely part of an ARM architecture implementation. It handles various processor operations including arithmetic calculations, register operations, memory accesses, data processing, interrupt handling, and status flag management. The module accepts numerous input signals that control its operation, such as clock (i_clk), reset (i_reset), stall signals (i_core_stall, i_mem_stall), data from write-back stage (i_wb_read_data), coprocessor data (i_copro_read_data), and various control signals for different execution modes and operations. Key outputs include execution stall signal (o_exec_stall), data and instruction addresses (o_daddress, o_iaddress), write data (o_write_data), status bits (o_status_bits), and other control
