Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module is a behavioral model of a DDR3 SDRAM device, simulating its functionality and timing characteristics. It features input ports for control signals (rst_n, ck, ck_n, cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address inputs (ba, addr), data mask/termination (dm_tdqs), and on-die termination control (odt). Output ports include termination data strobe (tdqs_n), while inout ports handle data transfer (dq) and data strobes (dqs, dqs_n). Internal signals manage timing parameters, mode register settings, bank status, and various counters for operation control. The module implements key DDR3 features such as initialization sequence, mode register programming, refresh operations, read/write commands, and power-down modes.
