This module enables writing and reading operations from this RAM. The module takes a 21-bit wide data input, which it writes to the RAM when write enable is active. The address input determines the address in the RAM where data is written or from where data is read. The output, `o_read_data`, consists of reconfigured bits from two internal signals read from RAM, ensuring specific bits are accessible at the output. The module includes parameters to adjust the data width and address width, with checks on these parameters implemented at initialization."

When low (`0`), it enables reading from RAM.\n- `i_address`: An 8-bit wide address input that specifies the location in RAM where data is to be written or read.\n\nOutput ports: `o_read_data`.\nExplanation:\n- `o_read_data`: A 21-bit wide output data port that delivers data read from the RAM. The output data is specifically arranged from the contents of two internal signals `read_data_hi` and `read_data_lo`, which are combined and reconfigured to provide the desired 21 bits on the output based on the data stored in RAM at the specified address."
