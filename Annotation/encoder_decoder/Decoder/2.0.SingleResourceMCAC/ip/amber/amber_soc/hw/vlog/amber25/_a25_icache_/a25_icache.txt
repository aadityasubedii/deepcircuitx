This module implements an instruction cache for the Amber 25 processor, enhancing CPU performance by reducing instruction fetch times. It utilizes a parameterized set-associative cache structure with configurable lines, words per line, and ways. The module employs a finite state machine to manage cache operations, including initialization, idle processing, data filling, and handling cache hits/misses. It interfaces with memory through a write-back mechanism, supports cache flushing, and implements a pseudo-random replacement policy for cache line selection when all ways are filled.
