Module name: clocks_resets.

Module specification: The "clocks_resets" module is designed for handling clock and reset signals within a digital system. It processes differential clock signals and a board reset input to generate a system clock and a system reset signal, leveraging FPGA-specific resources like PLLs (Phase-Locked Loops) or MMCMs (Mixed-Mode Clock Managers) for clock signal conditioning and management. The module accepts four input ports: `i_brd_rst` (board reset signal), `i_brd_clk_n` and `i_brd_clk_p` (negative and positive differential clock inputs), and `i_ddr_calib_done` (DDR calibration completion signal). Three output ports are provided: `o_sys_rst` (system reset signal), `o_sys_clk` (system clock), and `o_clk_200` (an additional 200 MHz clock output). Internally, the module employs signals like `rst0` for reset generation, `pll_locked` for clock stability confirmation, and various synchronization registers to ensure correct timing and functionality across different clock domains. The Verilog code includes conditional compilation blocks (`ifdef XILINX_FPGA`) configuring the module for different FPGA families (Spartan6 and Virtex6) by defining FPGA-specific clock conditioning and reset logic. In non-Xilinx FPGA scenarios, it includes behavioral models for PLL and system clock functionalities, ensuring broad compatibility and ease of simulation. This comprehensive setup ensures the system's reliability and stability by providing the necessary clock and reset signals across various operating conditions and FPGA platforms.
