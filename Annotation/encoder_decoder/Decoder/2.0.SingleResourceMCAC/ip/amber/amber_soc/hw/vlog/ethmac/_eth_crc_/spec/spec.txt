Module name: eth_crc. 
Module specification: The `eth_crc` module is designed to compute a 32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) value, predominantly used in Ethernet networks for data frame integrity verification. This module includes inputs such as `Clk` (Clock), which dictates the timing for CRC updates, `Reset` to set the CRC to an all-1s state (`32'hffffffff`), `Data` (a 4-bit input segment used for CRC calculations), `Enable` for controlling the CRC computation activations, and `Initialize` for setting the CRC to a preset value. The outputs are `Crc`, which holds the calculated CRC value, and `CrcError`, a flag that indicates a mismatch between the computed and expected CRC values. Internally, the module utilizes `CrcNext`, a wire signal responsible for determining the next CRC value based on current inputs and former values through specific XOR operations. The Verilog code consists of assignments for `CrcNext` using conditional XOR operations based on the input port states. An always block updates the `Crc` register based on the `Clk` and `Reset` states, using either the reset condition, initialization value, or the calculated `CrcNext`. Another assignment detects CRC errors by comparing the current CRC value with the known good CRC. This module is crucial for ensuring the integrity of data transmission within Ethernet frameworks by detecting errors during data exchanges.
