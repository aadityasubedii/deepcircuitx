    "spec": "Module name: data_prbs_gen. \n\nModule specification: The data_prbs_gen module synthesizes a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR). The primary functions include generating PRBS values controlled by two seed inputs (`prbs_seed_i` and `prbs_fseed_i`) and a conditional reset mechanism (`rst_i` and `prbs_seed_init`). The module operates under a parameterized framework with customizable properties such as PRBS and seed widths. The module inputs are `clk_i` (clock input which synchronizes LFSR updating), `clk_en` (enables LFSR updates when high), `rst_i` (resets LFSR when high), `prbs_fseed_i` (32-bit fixed seed for LFSR initialization), `prbs_seed_init` (controls seeding of LFSR), and `prbs_seed_i` (seed value with a width as per PRBS_WIDTH). The output consists of `prbs_o`, which outputs the PRBS value. Internal signals include `prbs` (holding the current PRBS value forwarded to prbs_o), `lfsr_q` (a shift register implementing the LFSR with feedback logic), and an unused integer `i`. The code comprises an always block sensitive to the positive edge of `clk_i` handling the LFSR seeding and feedback updates, and another always block sensitive to changes in `lfsr_q` for updating `prbs`. An `assign` statement connects internal PRBS storage to the output port. This module is crucial for applications requiring PRBS generation, like testing serial communication links or cryptographic functions.",
