Module name: ddr3_afifo. 
Module specification: The "ddr3_afifo" module is designed to handle asynchronous FIFO operations across two clock domains, using the system clock (i_sys_clk) and the DDR clock (i_ddr_clk) for buffering commands and data related to DDR3 memory interactions. This module effectively prevents overflow and underflow issues in communication with DDR memory. The input ports include: `i_sys_clk` and `i_ddr_clk` for clock inputs; `i_cmd_en`, `i_cmd_instr`, and `i_cmd_byte_addr` for issuing commands; `i_wr_en`, `i_wr_mask`, `i_wr_data`, and `i_wr_addr_32` for write operations; and `i_ddr_cmd_full`, `i_ddr_wr_full`, `i_ddr_rd_data`, `i_ddr_rd_valid` as status and data signals from DDR. Output ports are `o_cmd_full`, `o_wr_full` indicating whether command or write buffers are full; `o_rd_data` and `o_rd_valid` for read operations data output; and `o_ddr_cmd_en`, `o_ddr_cmd_instr`, `o_ddr_cmd_byte_addr`, `o_ddr_wr_en`, `o_ddr_wr_mask`, `o_ddr_wr_data`, `o_ddr_wr_addr_32` that forward transactions to the DDR. Internal signals `cmd_empty`, `wr_empty`, and `rd_empty` indicate the empty status of command, write, and read FIFOs, controlling the flow and synchronization across clock domains. The module incorporates three instances of a generic FIFO sub-module (`afifo`), each configured for commands, writes, and reads, managing data push and pop operations based on the buffer's fullness or emptiness, thereby facilitating robust data handling between the system and DDR memory.
