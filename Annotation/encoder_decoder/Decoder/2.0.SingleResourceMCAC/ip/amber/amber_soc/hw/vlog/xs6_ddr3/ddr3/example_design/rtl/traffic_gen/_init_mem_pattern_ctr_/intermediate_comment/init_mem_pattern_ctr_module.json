    "module": "The `init_mem_pattern_ctr` module controls and manages memory initialization and testing patterns for FPGA designs, adapting to various configurations for tests and family-specific settings. It uses a finite state machine (FSM) to transition through stages like memory write, read initialization, and testing based on command inputs and conditions. Internal signals manage state transitions, address comparisons, and configurations dynamically adjusted through Virtual IO, enabling tailored behavior for effective memory testing and operational verification."
