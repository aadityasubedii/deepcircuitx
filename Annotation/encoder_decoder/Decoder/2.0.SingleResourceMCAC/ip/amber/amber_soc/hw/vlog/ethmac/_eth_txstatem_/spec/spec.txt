Module name: eth_txstatem. Module specification: The `eth_txstatem` module is a state machine designed to manage Ethernet transmission processes. Its primary function involves handling various states necessary for the transmission of Ethernet frames, based on input signals and clock transitions. The input ports include signals such as `MTxClk` (module's clock), `Reset` (asynchronous reset), `CarrierSense` (detects carrier presence), and `TxStartFrm` (indicates start of frame transmission), among others, each contributing to the decision-making within transmission states such as Idle, IPG (Inter Packet Gap), Preamble, etc. The output ports consist of state indicators (e.g., `StateIdle`, `StateIPG`) and signals to start specific actions like `StartFCS` (start Frame Check Sequence). Internal signals like `StartIdle` and `StartPAD` help in transitioning between states, influenced by conditions like completion of current tasks or specific counter values. The code is structured into always blocks that define state transitions and signal assignments, with conditions based on both current states and input signals, ensuring correct timing and sequence of Ethernet frame processing activities.
