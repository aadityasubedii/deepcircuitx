    "spec": "Module name: afifo. Module specification: The 'afifo' module is a synchronous or asynchronous FIFO (First In First Out) buffer, configurable via the SYNC parameter. It facilitates data storage and retrieval operations governed by two separate clock domains: `wr_clk` for writing and `rd_clk` for reading. The module accepts inputs like `wr_clk` (write clock), `rst` (reset), `wr_en` (write enable), `wr_data` (write data), `rd_en` (read enable), and `rd_clk` (read clock). It outputs `rd_data` (read data), along with status signals `full`, `empty`, and `almost_full` indicating the buffer state. Internally, it uses registers and wires like `mem` (data memory), `wr_ptr`/`rd_ptr` (write/read pointers), and `wr_gray`/`rd_gray` (write/read pointers in Gray code) to manage data and pointer states. The module is partitioned into blocks for different functionalities: managing read and write operations synchronized to respective clocks, computing buffer status (empty, full, almost_full), and handling the conversion between binary and Gray code for pointers to ensure reliable cross-clock domain operations. These sections work together to ensure smooth FIFO operations while minimizing errors across asynchronous clock domains.",

The FIFO has parameters for data size (DSIZE), FIFO depth, and address size (ASIZE). It interfaces with read and write operations distinguished by separate clocks, i.e., `wr_clk` for writing and `rd_clk` for reading. The module supports operations such as write enable (`wr_en`) and read enable (`rd_en`). It handles the pointers for read and write operations using Gray code to prevent errors during transitions. The FIFO indicates its state via output signals such as `full`, `empty`, and `almost_full`, informing whether the FIFO is full, empty, or almost full respectively."

Its width is specified by the parameter `DSIZE`.\n- `rd_en`: Read enable input, allows data to be read from the FIFO when asserted (`1`).\n- `rd_clk`: Read clock input for read operations, managing the timing of data reading from the FIFO.\n\nOutput ports: `rd_data, full, empty, almost_full`. Explanation:\n- `rd_data`: Read data output, the data bus through which data is read from the FIFO. Its width matches `DSIZE`.\n- `full`: Output signal that indicates the FIFO is full.

It facilitates data storage and retrieval operations governed by two separate clock domains: `wr_clk` for writing and `rd_clk` for reading. The module accepts inputs like `wr_clk` (write clock), `rst` (reset), `wr_en` (write enable), `wr_data` (write data), `rd_en` (read enable), and `rd_clk` (read clock). It outputs `rd_data` (read data), along with status signals `full`, `empty`, and `almost_full` indicating the buffer state. Internally, it uses registers and wires like `mem` (data memory), `wr_ptr`/`rd_ptr` (write/read pointers), and `wr_gray`/`rd_gray` (write/read pointers in Gray code) to manage data and pointer states. The module is partitioned into blocks for different functionalities: managing read and write operations synchronized to respective clocks, computing buffer status (empty, full, almost_full), and handling the conversion between binary and Gray code for pointers to ensure reliable cross-clock domain operations. These sections work together to ensure smooth FIFO operations while minimizing errors across asynchronous clock domains."
