It handles both transmission and reception of serial data, supporting configurable baud rates and FIFO buffers. The module includes features such as interrupt generation, flow control (CTS/RTS), and configurable parameters like data bits and stop bits. It interfaces with a Wishbone bus for control and data transfer, and provides standard UART signals for external communication. The module supports both FIFO-enabled and non-FIFO modes of operation, with separate logic for transmit and receive operations."
