    "module": "The `eth_rxstatem` module manages the state transitions for Ethernet packet reception via a state machine, handling different states like idle, preamble detection, and frame dropping based on Ethernet protocol rules. It leverages input signals to determine transitions (e.g., data validity and byte counts) and outputs the current state through various flags. An always block with clock and reset sensitivity handles the dynamic state transitions, while assignments outside the block set conditions for these transitions, ensuring accurate and efficient Ethernet packet processing."
