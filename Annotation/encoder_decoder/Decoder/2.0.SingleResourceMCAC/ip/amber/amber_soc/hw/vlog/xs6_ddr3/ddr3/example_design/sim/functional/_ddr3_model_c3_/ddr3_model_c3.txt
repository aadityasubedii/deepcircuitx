This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM memory device, implementing command decoding, address handling, read/write operations, and timing checks. It achieves this functionality by using state machines to track memory operations, implementing pipelines for command and data processing, and performing extensive timing checks to ensure compliance with DDR3 specifications. The module handles initialization sequences, refresh operations, power-down modes, and self-refresh, while also supporting features such as on-die termination, write leveling, and multipurpose register operations. It uses various internal signals and counters to manage timing parameters, bank states, and data transfer, providing a comprehensive behavioral model of DDR3 SDRAM functionality.
