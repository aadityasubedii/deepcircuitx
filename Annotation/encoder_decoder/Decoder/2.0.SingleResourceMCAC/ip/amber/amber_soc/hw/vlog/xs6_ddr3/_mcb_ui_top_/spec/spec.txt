Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: This module serves as a Memory Controller Block (MCB) user interface top-level wrapper, integrating various components for memory control including AXI interfaces and native MCB ports. It supports up to 6 ports with configurable memory types and operations. The module has numerous input and output ports for clock signals, reset, port-specific controls, AXI interface signals, and memory interface signals. Key internal signals include intermediate signals for connecting MCB native and AXI interfaces, as well as clock management signals. The module is structured with several main blocks: a BUFPLL_MCB instance for clock management, an mcb_raw_wrapper instance for core MCB functionality, and multiple generate blocks for each port (0-5) that instantiate either native MCB interfaces or AXI-to-MCB bridges based on configuration parameters. It handles memory read/write operations, arbit
