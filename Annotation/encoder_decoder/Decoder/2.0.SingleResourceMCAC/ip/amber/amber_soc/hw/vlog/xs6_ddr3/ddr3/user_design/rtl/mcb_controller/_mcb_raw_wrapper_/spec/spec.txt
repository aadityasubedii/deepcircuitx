Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: This module is a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) interface, designed to handle the interface between user logic and DDR/DDR2/DDR3 memory. It supports multiple memory types, data widths, and configurations. The module takes inputs such as clocks, resets, command signals, and data for multiple ports (p0 to p5), including arbitration enables, command clocks, command enables, read/write clocks, and data. It outputs memory interface signals like address, bank address, control signals, and data, as well as status signals for each port. Internally, it uses signals for clock management, reset control, and data path control. The module incorporates IOB (Input/Output Block) instantiations for interfacing with external memory pins, IODRP2 (I/O Data Rate Programming) blocks for signal calibration
