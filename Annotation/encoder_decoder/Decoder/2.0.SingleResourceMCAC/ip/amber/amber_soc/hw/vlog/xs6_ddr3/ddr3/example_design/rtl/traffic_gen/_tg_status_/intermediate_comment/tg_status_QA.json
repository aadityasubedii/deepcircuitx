The module handles error detection and reporting, indicated by the \"error_status\" output. It logs specific error-related information such as command address, burst length, and data mismatches. The error indication is reset either manually or upon reset. This module is essential for systems requiring rigorous error tracking and management, especially in data-sensitive applications where exactness between 'cmp_data_i' and 'rd_data_i' is crucial. Additionally, the module tracks the full status of command queues and read/write operations in the memory control block (\"mcb\")."

This flag plays a pivotal role in the reporting mechanism by controlling the 'error' output and ensuring that once an error condition is flagged, it remains stable and visible until manually cleared or system reset.
