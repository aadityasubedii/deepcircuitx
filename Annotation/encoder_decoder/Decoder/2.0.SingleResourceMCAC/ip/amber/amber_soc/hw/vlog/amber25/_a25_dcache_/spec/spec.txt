Module name: a25_dcache. Module specification: The a25_dcache module implements a configurable data cache for a processor, supporting multiple cache ways (2, 3, 4, or 8). It handles read and write operations, cache misses, and exclusive accesses, managing cache line filling, write-back operations, and cache coherency. The module has input ports for clock, request signals, data, addresses, and control signals, and output ports for read data, stall signals, and write-back requests. Internal signals include state machines, cache way selection logic, and data/tag management signals. The module is structured with sections for cache initialization, state management, tag and data RAM interfaces, cache hit detection, and way selection logic. It incorporates a random replacement policy and handles exclusive accesses. The design includes error checking for multiple cache way hits and supports different cache configurations through parameters. The module aims to improve memory access performance by storing
