It takes advantage of the XOR feedback mechanism. This pseudo-random number's generation is influenced by the retry counter `RetryCnt`, effectively masking certain bits when the counter is below a certain value, thereby adjusting the randomness based on the retry count. The module latches this random value when specific conditions involving signal jam states (`StateJam` and `StateJam_q`) are met. Additionally, it provides two comparison outputs: one to check if the latched random number is zero (`RandomEq0`), and another to check if it equals the byte count (`RandomEqByteCnt`) under certain conditions involving the nibble count (`NibCnt`). The module operates synchronously with the MTxClk clock signal and can be asynchronously reset by the Reset signal."

It is derived from the XOR of the 2nd and 10th bits (x[2] and x[9]) of register x. This feedback ensures the LFSR cycles through pseudo-random values.\n- x: A 10-bit register that stores the current state of the LFSR. It gets updated every positive edge of the clock or when the module is reset. The new value of x is computed by shifting its current value left by one bit and inserting the Feedback value at the lowest bit position (LSB).\n- Random: A 10-bit wire which is a masked version of x. Each bit of Random is conditionally masked based on the RetryCnt value. If RetryCnt is less than a certain index, the corresponding bit in Random is set to 0; otherwise, it reflects the actual bit from x.\n- RandomLatched: A 10-bit register that holds the value of Random under certain conditions involving StateJam and StateJam_q. This latching happens only when StateJam and the previous state StateJam_q are both high, indicating a specific operational condition during which the random value is captured and held constant until the next latching condition or reset."
