The module operates under clocked conditions and can stall based on an external stall signal. It takes additional control inputs to enable or disable the operation and to specify whether accumulation should occur. The output includes a 32-bit result and a 2-bit flag, where one bit indicates overflow and the other checks if the result is zero. The operation uses a sequential approach, counting and shifting through the bits of the operands over multiple clock cycles, with support for specific FPGA hardware optimizations for addition and subtraction operations."
