    "module": "The `init_mem_pattern_ctr` module controls and tests memory initialization patterns across configurable FPGA platforms, primarily SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6. It manages various memory operations including read and write, utilizing a state machine to transition between states like initialization, memory testing, and error handling based on input commands and detected configuration changes. The module allows dynamic reconfiguration via VIO inputs affecting data and address modes, and includes extensive parameterization to tailor behavior such as memory size, data width, and burst length."
