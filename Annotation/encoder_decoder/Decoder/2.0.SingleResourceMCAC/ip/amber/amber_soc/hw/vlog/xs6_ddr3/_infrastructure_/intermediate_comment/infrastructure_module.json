    "module": "The 'infrastructure' module manages clock synchronization, generation, and reset functionalities for FPGA systems, utilizing PLL for multiple clock outputs and ensuring proper clock distribution and reset conditions are met across components. It handles inputs for both differential and single-ended clock signals, generating various derived clocks and a synchronized reset. Internally, it uses a PLL block for generating different clock phases and frequencies, conditioning circuits to stabilize clock signals, and synchronizing mechanisms for system reset, all configured based on the specified parameters ensuring flexibility and robust operation.\n"
