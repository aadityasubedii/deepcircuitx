The ddr3_afifo module manages asynchronous FIFO operations between system and DDR clocks, ensuring synchronized and overflow-proof communication with DDR memory. It uses separate FIFOs, implemented through the `afifo` modules, for commands, writes, and reads, managing their flows with internal signals indicating buffer statuses and dynamically controlling data transfer based on buffer fullness and availability.
