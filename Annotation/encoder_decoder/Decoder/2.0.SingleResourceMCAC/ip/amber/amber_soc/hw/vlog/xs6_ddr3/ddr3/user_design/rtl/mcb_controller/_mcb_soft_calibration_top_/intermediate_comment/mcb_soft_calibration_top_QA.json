It integrates both soft and hardware-based calibration mechanisms to optimize memory operation. The module performs dynamic and input termination calibrations unless explicitly skipped by parameter configuration. It interfaces with a memory controller buffer (MCB) and an IO delay and phase detector (IODRP) for calibration processes. The module handles various signals for calibration status, memory commands, data transactions, and control purposes to ensure system stability and data integrity during the memory operation and calibration phase. Additionally, the module is capable of handling self-refresh requests which are crucial for maintaining data in memory when it is not actively being accessed."
