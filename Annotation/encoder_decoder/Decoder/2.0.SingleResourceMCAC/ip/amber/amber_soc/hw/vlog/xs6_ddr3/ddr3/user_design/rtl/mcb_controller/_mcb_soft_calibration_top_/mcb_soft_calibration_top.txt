The `mcb_soft_calibration_top` module manages DDR memory calibration via an integrated approach using both software and hardware mechanisms, optimizing memory operations. It controls various processes through input and output ports managing signals for system clocks, reset, calibration starts, and state indications such as completion and self-refresh requests. Internally, it utilizes specialized signals to interface with an IO delay and phase detectors to adjust calibration dynamically, and employs instantiated sub-modules for managing calibration functionalities focused on ensuring memory integrity and setup configurations.
