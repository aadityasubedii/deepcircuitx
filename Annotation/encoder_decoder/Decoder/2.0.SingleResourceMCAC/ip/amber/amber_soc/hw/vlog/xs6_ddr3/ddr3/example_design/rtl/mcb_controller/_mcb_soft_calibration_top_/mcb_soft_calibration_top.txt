The mcb_soft_calibration_top module manages the soft calibration processes for memory controllers, adaptable for various memory types and calibration modes. It systematically handles input and output controls, synchronization, and interfacing with memory hardware, incorporating parameterized configurations, internal logic for signal processing, and conditional compilation to optimize functionality specific to memory type and calibration requirements.
