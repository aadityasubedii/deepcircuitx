    "module": "The mcb_flow_control module manages the flow of commands within a memory controller buffer (MCB), handling synchronization and issuing of read and write operations based on buffer states and command requests. It implements a finite state machine (FSM) with states like READY, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT, and REFRESH_ST, controlling the transitions based on input signals such as command validity, data path readiness, and buffer fullness, effectively managing the data flow and command execution for optimized memory operations tailored for the SPARTAN6 family."
