It handles read and write operations for general-purpose registers (r0 to r15) and specialized banked registers for different CPU modes (user, IRQ, FIRQ, supervisor), accommodating interrupts and fast interrupts by maintaining separate registers for these modes. The module updates registers based on multiple control signals, reflecting the current mode of execution, interrupt states, and data from memory or other sources. It also outputs specific register values based on the select inputs for different stages of the instruction execution pipeline, dynamically adapting to changes in execution mode or external stall conditions."
