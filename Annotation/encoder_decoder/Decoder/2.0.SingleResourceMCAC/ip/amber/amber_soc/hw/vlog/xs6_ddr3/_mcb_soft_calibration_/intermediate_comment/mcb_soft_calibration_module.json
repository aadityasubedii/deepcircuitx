    "module": "This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block, handling input termination and dynamic DQS delay calibration. It uses a state machine to manage the calibration process, interfacing with IODRP controllers and the MCB. The module adjusts termination values, sets initial DQS delays, and dynamically adjusts these delays based on measurements. It also handles self-refresh requests and can skip certain calibration steps based on parameter settings. The implementation includes multiple calibration phases, error checking, and adaptive delay adjustments to optimize memory interface performance."
