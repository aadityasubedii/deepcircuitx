    "module": "The `eth_maccontrol` module handles Ethernet frame transmission and reception, managing the flow and synchronization of data within an Ethernet MAC layer. It uses input ports for receiving clock signals, control directives, and data, while outputting the processed data and status signals. The module coordinates its functionalities through internal logic that determines when to send or abort transmissions and incorporates submodules `eth_receivecontrol` and `eth_transmitcontrol` for detailed handling of received data and transmission controls, respectively. This structured approach ensures robust data communication adhering to Ethernet standards."
