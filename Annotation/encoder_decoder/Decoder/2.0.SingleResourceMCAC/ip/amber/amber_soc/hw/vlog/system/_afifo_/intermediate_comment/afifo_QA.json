Parameters allow customization of the data width (`D_WIDTH`). It features logic to manage the read and write pointers using Gray code to ensure safe cross-domain operation. The FIFO supports basic operations such as push (write) and pop (read), and it provides flags (`o_full` and `o_empty`) to indicate the status of the FIFO as full or empty respectively. Data is stored in a memory array (`data`) sized based on the width specified by `D_WIDTH`. Gray code conversion is used for the pointers to mitigate errors due to clock domain crossing by making only one bit change at a time, enhancing the reliability of the FIFO operation across different clock domains."
