    "module": "The `wishbone_arbiter` module arbitrates access to a Wishbone bus among two masters and eight slaves, ensuring controlled and exclusive access based on bus requests. It employs input and output control signals for managing address, data, and control flows, while internal registers and combinational logic dictate master priority and manage transaction states to route data correctly between masters and slaves, thereby handling bus conflicts and maintaining data integrity across the bus system."
