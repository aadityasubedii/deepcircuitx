Module name: a25_coprocessor. Module specification: The 'a25_coprocessor' module serves as a coprocessor interface specifically designed to manage cache operations and fault handling in a computing system. **Input Ports:**
- `i_clk`: Clock signal to synchronize module operations.
- `i_reset`: Resets module state.
- `i_core_stall`: Stalls operations during system demands.
- `i_copro_opcode1`, `i_copro_opcode2`, `i_copro_crn`, `i_copro_crm`, `i_copro_num`: Control coprocessor operations and data routing.
- `i_copro_operation`: Specifies read or write operations.
- `i_copro_write_data`: Data to be written to coprocessor registers.
- `i_fault`: Indicator for fault occurrence.
- `i_fault_status`: Type of fault occurred.
- `i_fault_address`: Memory address related to the fault.

**Output Ports:**
- `o_copro_read_data`: Outputs data from coprocessor read operations.
- `o_cache_enable`: Controls enabling of cache.
- `o_cache_flush`: Initiates cache flush.
- `o_cacheable_area`: Defines memory areas that are cacheable.

**Internal Signals:**
- `cache_control`, `cacheable_area`, `updateable_area`, `disruptive_area`: Registers managing cache settings and areas.
- `fault_status`, `fault_address`: Registers for storing fault details.
- `copro15_reg1_write`: Controls cache flush based on coprocessor commands. 

**Code Blocks/Sections:**
1. **Initialization and Control Handling**: Sets output flags for cache operations and updates internal status registers (`fault_status`, `fault_address`) on faults.
2. **Configuration Operations**: Based on incoming commands (`i_copro_crn` and `i_copro_operation`), updates internal registers (`cache_control`, `cacheable_area`, etc.) for cache configuration.
3. **Data Handling**: Depending on `i_copro_crn`, outputs data for specific coprocessor registers.
4. **Debugging (Conditional Compilation)**: Provides debug outputs tracing operations performed on the module, enhancing traceability during development.

This specification succinctly combines the complete functionality, input/output, and internal mechanics of the module, making it integral for managing cache and fault handling within a coprocessor environment.
