    "module": "The `eth_cop` module manages data transactions on a WISHBONE bus between two master interfaces and two slave interfaces, controlling data flow based on request origination and target addressing. It processes inputs from the masters to initiate transactions, directs them to appropriate slaves using internal control signals like `m1_req` and `m2_req`, and manages responses back to the masters through acknowledgment and error interface outputs. The module efficiently handles concurrent transactions, monitors transaction states with internal flags, and incorporates error management to ensure robust data communication and system stability."
