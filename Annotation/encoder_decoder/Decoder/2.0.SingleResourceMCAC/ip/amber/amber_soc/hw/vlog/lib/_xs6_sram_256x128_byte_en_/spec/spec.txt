Module name: xs6_sram_256x128_byte_en. Module specification: The 'xs6_sram_256x128_byte_en' module is designed for interfacing with an SRAM that operates with a 128-bit data width and an 8-bit address width, supporting up to 256 addresses. It primarily facilitates selective byte-level data writing and reading from the SRAM, controlled by a 16-element byte enable vector. The input ports include: 'i_clk' (clock signal for synchronization), 'i_write_data' (128-bit input data to be written into SRAM), 'i_write_enable' (control signal for enabling write operations), 'i_address' (specifies the SRAM address for data operations), and 'i_byte_enable' (controls byte-specific writing within the 128-bit word). The sole output port, 'o_read_data', outputs the 128-bit data read from the SRAM based on the specified address and control logic. Internally, the module utilizes a 'byte_write_enable' signal that combines the general write enable signal with the byte-specific enable vector, facilitating selective byte-level writing. The code is structured with a parameterized section that allows configuration adjustments, a generate block creating four instances of dual-port block RAM in Simple Dual Port (SDP) mode with specific configurations for collision checks and write modes, and initial blocks for parameter verification to display warnings if setup parameters like DATA_WIDTH or ADDRESS_WIDTH are incorrectly configured. This architecture ensures robust, flexible memory interfacing with byte-level control over read and write operations, enhancing the moduleâ€™s utility in complex digital systems.
