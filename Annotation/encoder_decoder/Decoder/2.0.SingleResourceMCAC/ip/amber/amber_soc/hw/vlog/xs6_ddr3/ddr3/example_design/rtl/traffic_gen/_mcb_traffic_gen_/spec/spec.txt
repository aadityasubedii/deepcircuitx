Module name: mcb_traffic_gen. Module specification: The mcb_traffic_gen module is designed to generate and manage traffic for memory controller blocks (MCB) in FPGA designs. It handles various memory operation modes and data patterns, simulating read and write operations to test and verify memory interfaces. The module features numerous input ports for configuration and control, including clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), run control (run_traffic_i), address range (start_addr_i, end_addr_i), seeds for command and data generation (cmd_seed_i, data_seed_i), and various mode selectors (addr_mode_i, instr_mode_i, bl_mode_i, data_mode_i). Output ports include command signals to the MCB (mcb_cmd_en_o, mcb_cmd_instr_o, mcb_cmd_addr_
