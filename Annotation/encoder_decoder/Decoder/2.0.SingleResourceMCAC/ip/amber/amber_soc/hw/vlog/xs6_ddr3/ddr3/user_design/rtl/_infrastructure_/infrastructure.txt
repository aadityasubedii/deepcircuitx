The 'infrastructure' module manages clock distribution and system resets in digital systems, handling both differential and single-ended input clocks. It utilizes a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) to generate multiple output clocks with varying frequencies and phases and ensures system reset synchronization across these clocks. Key internal mechanisms include clock buffers for signal stability, a PLL for frequency and phase adjustments, and logic for synchronized and asynchronous reset handling, ensuring robust system performance and stability.
