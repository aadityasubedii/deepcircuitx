    "module": "The `a25_wishbone` module functions as a multiplexer interfacing three peripheral ports with a Wishbone bus, managing simultaneous read and write transactions through arbitration and buffering. It uses input signals to handle requests, writes, and addresses from each port, while outputs communicate acknowledgment and data back to the ports or control the Wishbone bus based on internal buffering logic and bus response. Buffer instances for each port and control logic synchronized to the clock signal orchestrate the data handling, ensuring one port accesses the bus at a time, thereby consolidating and simplifying multi-port communications with the Wishbone standard."
