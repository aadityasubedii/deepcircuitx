The mcb_traffic_gen module generates configurable memory traffic patterns for testing and validating Memory Controller Block (MCB) systems in FPGAs. It supports various burst lengths, data and command patterns, and operating modes (read, write, or bi-directional). The module implements a command generator, flow control logic, read and write data paths, and status monitoring. It processes input configurations, generates memory access commands, manages data flow, performs data comparison for read operations, and reports errors. The design utilizes internal FIFOs, PRBS generators, and configurable logic to create flexible and comprehensive memory testing scenarios.
