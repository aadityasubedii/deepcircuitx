The `eth_rxcounters` module manages Ethernet frame reception metrics, including byte counting and Interframe Gap (IFG) control, crucial for ensuring data integrity and proper sequencing between frames. It operates using input signals to reset and control counters according to the reception state and data validity, outputting various counter statuses and byte counts. The module's design incorporates conditionally managed internal counters and flags, responding to frame status and control inputs to dynamically adjust its outputs and maintain network communication standards.
