    "module": "This Verilog snippet defines a series of parameters and configurations for Ethernet hardware management, essential in setting up and controlling various aspects of network communication, including MAC addresses and FIFO queues. The code achieves its functionality through predefined constants (`defines) that detail controller widths, default settings, memory mapping, and register addresses, assisting in initializing and interfacing Ethernet communication hardware suitably within larger system designs."
