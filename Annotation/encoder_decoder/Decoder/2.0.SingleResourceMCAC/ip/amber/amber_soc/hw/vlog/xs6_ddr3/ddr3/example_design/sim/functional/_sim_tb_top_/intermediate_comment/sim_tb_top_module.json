    "module": "The `sim_tb_top` module simulates a DDR3 memory interface, testing various functionalities including clock and reset operations, and memory calibration via error signaling and calibration completion. It toggles system clock inputs, assigns differential clock signals, and processes reset logic based on the configuration, interfacing with the `example_top` module that handles the detailed memory control. Key internal signals link to DDR3 models depending on the configuration, facilitating effective testing and validation in simulation environments."
