Module name: a25_wishbone. Module specification: The `a25_wishbone` module acts as a multiplexer for interfacing multiple ports (port0, port1, and port2) with a Wishbone bus, supporting the arbitration and buffering required for multiple concurrent transaction requests. It handles read and write operations, managing data, control signals, and bus access. Input ports include `i_clk` (clock signal), `i_reset` (reset signal), request signals (`i_port0_req`, `i_port1_req`, `i_port2_req`), write indicators (`i_port0_write`, `i_port1_write`, `i_port2_write`), write data (`i_port0_wdata`, `i_port1_wdata`, `i_port2_wdata`), byte enables (`i_port0_be`, `i_port1_be`, `i_port2_be`), addresses (`i_port0_addr`, `i_port1_addr`, `i_port2_addr`), and signals from the Wishbone bus (`i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_ack`, `i_wb_err`). Output ports include acknowledgment signals (`o_port0_ack`, `o_port1_ack`, `o_port2_ack`), read data outputs (`o_port0_rdata`, `o_port1_rdata`, `o_port2_rdata`), and Wishbone bus control signals (`o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_cyc`, `o_wb_stb`).

Internal signals such as arrays `wbuf_valid`, `wbuf_accepted`, `wbuf_write`, `wbuf_wdata`, `wbuf_be`, `wbuf_addr`, and `wbuf_rdata_valid` manage the buffering and control of data for each port, signifying state, validity, data acceptance, and read-data validity towards resolving bus conflicts and managing data flow. Additionally, signal `new_access` and register `serving_port` are used for determining the new bus access permission and tracking which port is presently served by the bus.

The code is divided into several sections: module port declarations, buffer instantiations (one for each port), signal assigments, and control logic handling the read and write operations through the buffer state and the response from the Wishbone bus. Each buffer instance (`a25_wishbone_buf`) manages buffering transactions from its respective port. The output bus control logic uses the `always @(posedge i_clk)` block to manage the bus communication based on the buffer states and the input requests, ensuring controlled, sequential access to the shared bus resource.
