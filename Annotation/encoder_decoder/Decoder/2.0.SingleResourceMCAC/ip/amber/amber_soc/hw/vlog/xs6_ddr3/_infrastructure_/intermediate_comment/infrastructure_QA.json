It includes a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) for generating multiple clock outputs with different frequencies and phases based on an input clock, which can be either differential or single-ended as specified by a parameter. The module handles synchronization and distribution of the clock signals and the reset signal across various components of the system, ensuring stable operation through reset synchronization and locked conditions from the PLL. It generates outputs including the system clocks at multiple phases and frequencies, a reset signal synchronized to one of the output clocks, and the differential clock outputs for specific uses like memory controller block (MCB) signaling."

They are crucial for situations requiring noise immunity and precise clocking.\n- `sys_clk`: This is the single-ended clock input used when the input clock type is specified as single-ended. It is a simpler input used for clocking purposes when differential signaling is not necessary.\n- `sys_rst_i`: This is the system reset input, which initiates a reset condition throughout the module for resetting the internal states and outputs. The polarity (active-high or active-low) is configurable through a parameter.\n\nOutput ports: clk0, rst0, async_rst, sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, mcb_drp_clk, pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, pll_lock. \nExplanation:\n- `clk0`: This is one of the primary clock outputs of the module, buffered and possibly divided down from the PLL-generated clock.\n- `rst0`: This is the reset output synchronized to the clk0 output clock, ensuring that downstream logic is reset in phase with this clock.\n- `async_rst`: This asynchronous reset output becomes active when the system reset is asserted or the PLL has not yet locked. It ensures that connected components are held in reset during unstable or unclocked conditions.\n- `sysclk_2x`, `sysclk_2x_180`: These outputs provide higher frequency clock signals derived from the PLL with a phase shift of 180 degrees between them, typically used for high-speed or phase-sensitive applications.\n- `mcb_drp_clk`: This specific clock output is used for driving memory controller blocks (MCB) or similar peripherals that require a separate clock domain.\n- `pll_ce_0`, `pll_ce_90`: These outputs are clock enable signals for phase-shifted clock domains, serving in data alignment and timing adjustment in high-speed data interfaces.\n- `pll_lock`: This signal indicates that the PLL has achieved phase and frequency lock, providing a stable indicator that the PLL-generated clocks are reliable for use.\n\nTogether, these inputs and outputs facilitate complex clock management and reset functionality in FPGA-based systems, accommodating both differential and single-ended input clock types."
