    "module": "The `wr_data_gen` module generates write data patterns for memory controllers, adaptable for specific FPGA families like SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6. It offers flexibility in data operations through inputs like data width and burst length and supports PRBS and fixed data patterns. Internally, it utilizes control signals and registers such as `cmd_rdy` and `user_burst_cnt` to manage data flow. Conditional instantiation of `sp6_data_gen` or `v6_data_gen` tailors data handling to FPGA architecture, ensuring efficient synchronization with external memory systems based on dynamic input signals and system states."
