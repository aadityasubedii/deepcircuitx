    "module": "The 'eth_macstatus' module is responsible for managing and monitoring the status of Ethernet MAC layer operations, specifically focusing on error detection, frame size validation, and collision detection during the transmission and reception of Ethernet frames. It implements this functionality by processing a variety of input signals related to frame status, counting mechanisms, and error detection, using internal logic and state conditions to update output statuses that signify the current state and integrity of the Ethernet frames being transmitted or received. These operations are segmented into distinct procedural blocks that handle specific tasks such as latching detected errors, checking frame sizes against predefined limits, and managing collision status and retry mechanisms, ensuring the module supports robust Ethernet communication."
