The core functioning of the module revolves around the shifting and exclusive OR (XOR) operations performed within the LFSR mechanism, heavily utilized in communication systems for data scrambling, pattern generation, and testing purposes. The module offers configurability through parameters such as PRBS width and seed initialization, and facilitates operations through enabling mechanisms (clock enable) and condition-based initialization (seed initialization and system reset). The conditional use of seeds and the addition of constants provide flexibility in tailoring the output sequence."

It acts as a buffer, capturing the internal state of the LFSR (`lfsr_q` from bits PRBS_WIDTH:1) for output purposes.\n- **lfsr_q**: A shift register with one extra bit than PRBS_WIDTH (i.e., PRBS_WIDTH+1 bits).
