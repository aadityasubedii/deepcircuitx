    "module": "This module implements a configurable data cache for a processor, supporting multiple cache ways (2, 3, 4, or 8). It manages read/write operations, cache misses, and exclusive accesses using a state machine. The module interfaces with tag and data RAMs, implements cache hit detection, and uses a random replacement policy for cache line selection. It handles cache line filling, write-back operations, and cache coherency, improving memory access performance by storing frequently accessed data closer to the processor."
