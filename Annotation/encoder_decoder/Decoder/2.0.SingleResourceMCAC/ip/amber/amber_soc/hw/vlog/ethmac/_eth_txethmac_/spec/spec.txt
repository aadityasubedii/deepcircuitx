Module name: eth_txethmac.
Module specification: The `eth_txethmac` is a complex Verilog module designed for the Ethernet MAC transmitter, handling the logic for Ethernet frame transmission including frame assembly, collision detection, retransmission, and more. The module operates under a synchronous clock input `MTxClk` and employs multiple input signals like `Reset` for initialization, `TxStartFrm` and `TxEndFrm` for framing, `TxUnderRun` for under-run handling, and `CarrierSense` and `Collision` for network conditions responses. It interacts with Ethernet frames using `TxData`, manages frame padding and Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with `Pad` and `CrcEn`, respectively, and is capable of controlling duplex settings via `FullD`. It also supports extended frames with `HugEn`. Outputs of the module include `MTxD` for the transmitted data, `MTxEn` for enabling the transmitter, `MTxErr` for error indication, and several status outputs like `TxDone`, `TxRetry`, `TxAbort`, reflecting the state of transmission based on the internal logic. Internal signals such as `Crc`, `ColWindow`, and `StateIdle` help manage the CRC calculations, collision windows, and the transmitter's idle state, respectively. This module includes several instantiations of other modules like `eth_txcounters` and `eth_txstatem` for managing transmission counters and state machine logic, and `eth_crc` and `eth_random` for CRC calculations and retry logic randomized back-off counters. The organization of this module lays a meticulous groundwork tailored for Ethernet MAC layer operations, aligning with extensive parameterization for adaptability in diverse network configurations.
