It takes inputs such as memory cell address, write data, read/write command, synchronization signals like `sync_rst` and `DRP_CLK`, and outputs signals like read data and ready/busy status. It manages the data handling using an internal finite state machine (FSM) that processes the commands, addresses, and manages data transfer phases. The states of the FSM determine the sequence of operations involving data transfer through shift registers, multiplexers, and control logic based on the command sequences received."
