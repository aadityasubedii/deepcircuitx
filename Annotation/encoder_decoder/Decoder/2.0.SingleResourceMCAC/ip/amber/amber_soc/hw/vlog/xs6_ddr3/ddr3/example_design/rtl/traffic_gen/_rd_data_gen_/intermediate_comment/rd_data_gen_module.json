    "module": "The 'rd_data_gen' module generates and manages data for FPGA families like Spartan6 and Virtex6, adapting to diverse data bus widths and memory burst lengths. It processes input commands to generate data bursts, controlled via parameters defining data patterns, address widths, and FIFO readiness. This module supports synchronized operations through clocks and resets, and handles command readiness and data validity outputs, using internal logic and conditions tailored for different FPGA configurations, all managed in structured code blocks for scalability and adaptability."
