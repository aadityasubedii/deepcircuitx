Module name: xs6_sram_512x128_byte_en. Module specification: This module implements a 512x128-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA block RAM primitives. It consists of four 36-bit wide RAMB16BWER instances, each handling a 32-bit portion of the 128-bit data width. The module has input ports for clock (i_clk), write data (i_write_data), write enable (i_write_enable), address (i_address), and byte enable (i_byte_enable), and an output port for read data (o_read_data). Internal signals include unused outputs (nc24_00 to nc24_03) from the RAMB16BWER primitives and a write enable array (wea) derived from i_write_enable an
