The `eth_receivecontrol` module controls Ethernet frame reception, focusing on pause frame detection and flow control to manage network congestion. It processes input signals to verify MAC addresses, check frame type and length, and manage timers for flow control. Utilizing two clock signals for synchronization, the module outputs control signals based on internal states dictated by byte counting and timer operations. The logic includes address verification, pause frame validation, and conditionally setting or resetting timers based on frame reception accuracy and network requirements.
