Module name: generic_sram_line_en. 
Module specification: The generic_sram_line_en is a highly versatile Verilog module designed to simulate the operations of a static random access memory (SRAM) with customizable data and address widths. Its functionalities include both read and write operations, driven by a clock input signal. The input ports include 'i_clk' (the clock signal for synchronization of read/write operations), 'i_write_data' (data to be written to the SRAM), 'i_write_enable' (a control signal that enables writing when high, and reading when low), and 'i_address' (specifies the SRAM address for both reading and writing operations). The sole output port, 'o_read_data', outputs the data read from the SRAM, delivering zeros when a read is attempted during a write operation enabled by 'i_write_enable'. Internally, the module utilizes a memory array 'mem', defined with a depth corresponding to 2 raised to the power of ADDRESS_WIDTH and a width equal to DATA_WIDTH. Additionally, the module contains a conditional generation block that initializes the memory array to zeros if the parameter INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO is set. Key operations are managed within an always block triggered by the positive edge of 'i_clk', where data writing or zero output (during concurrent read/write operations) and normal data retrieval occur as dictated by the state of 'i_write_enable'.
