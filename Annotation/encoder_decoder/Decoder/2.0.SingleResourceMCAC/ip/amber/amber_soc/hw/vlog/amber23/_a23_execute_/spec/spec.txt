Module name: a23_execute. Module specification: The a23_execute module is a crucial component of an ARM-like processor, responsible for executing instructions and managing data operations. It handles arithmetic and logical operations, data access, and control flow. The module takes numerous input signals, including clock (i_clk), data inputs (i_read_data, i_copro_read_data), control signals (i_data_access_exec, i_fetch_stall), status bits (i_status_bits_mode, i_status_bits_irq_mask, i_status_bits_firq_mask), and various selection and function signals for ALU, barrel shifter, and other operations. It produces output signals such as write data (o_write_data, o_copro_write_data), address signals (o_address, o_address_nxt), status flags (o_status_bits),
