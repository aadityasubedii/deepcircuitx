    "module": "This module implements an Ethernet Wishbone interface controller, managing communication between the Ethernet MAC and Wishbone bus for transmit and receive operations. It coordinates data transfers, handles buffer descriptors, and generates interrupts. The module uses separate clock domains for Wishbone and Ethernet, with synchronization mechanisms. It implements transmit and receive paths with FIFOs, manages buffer states and pointers, and handles various control signals and status flags. The design includes error handling for conditions like underrun and overrun, and supports features such as pause frames and flow control."
