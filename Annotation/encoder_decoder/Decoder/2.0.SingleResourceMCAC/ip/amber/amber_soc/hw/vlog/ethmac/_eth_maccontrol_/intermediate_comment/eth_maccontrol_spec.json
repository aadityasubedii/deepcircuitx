    "spec": "Module name: eth_maccontrol. \nModule specification: The `eth_maccontrol` module is a fundamental component within an Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) layer, designed to manage both transmission and reception of Ethernet frames. It is structured around input ports such as `MTxClk` and `MRxClk` for clock synchronization, `TxReset` and `RxReset` for resetting transmit and receive operations, data and control inputs such as `TxDataIn` and `RxData`, and flow control signals like `TPauseRq`. Output ports include `TxDataOut` for the transmitted data and various status indicators like `TxDoneOut` and `TxAbortOut`. Internal signals such as `TxUsedDataOutDetected` and `MuxedDone` facilitate state control and decision-making within transmission operations. The module incorporates two primary submodules: `eth_receivecontrol`, which deals with processing received frames and managing reception state, and `eth_transmitcontrol`, which handles the complexities of data transmission including flow control and error handling. This arrangement ensures efficient data handling and protocol compliance, making `eth_maccontrol` a critical part of Ethernet communication systems.",

It is structured around input ports such as `MTxClk` and `MRxClk` for clock synchronization, `TxReset` and `RxReset` for resetting transmit and receive operations, data and control inputs such as `TxDataIn` and `RxData`, and flow control signals like `TPauseRq`. Output ports include `TxDataOut` for the transmitted data and various status indicators like `TxDoneOut` and `TxAbortOut`. Internal signals such as `TxUsedDataOutDetected` and `MuxedDone` facilitate state control and decision-making within transmission operations. The module incorporates two primary submodules: `eth_receivecontrol`, which deals with processing received frames and managing reception state, and `eth_transmitcontrol`, which handles the complexities of data transmission including flow control and error handling. This arrangement ensures efficient data handling and protocol compliance, making `eth_maccontrol` a critical part of Ethernet communication systems."
