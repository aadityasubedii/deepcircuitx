    "spec": "Module name: a25_barrel_shift. Module specification: The a25_barrel_shift module is designed to apply variable bit-width shifting operations to a 32-bit input, leveraging two instances of submodule a25_shifter: one for quick shifts and another for full barrel shifts depending on the shift amount required. It takes in several inputs: a clock signal `i_clk` for synchronization, a 32-bit data `i_in` to be shifted, a carry-in `i_carry_in` which can affect certain types of shifts, an 8-bit shift amount `i_shift_amount` specifying the number and direction of shifts, a Boolean flag `i_shift_imm_zero` used to optimize shift operations, and a 2-bit shift function `i_function` determining shift type (e.g., logical or arithmetic shifts). The output ports include a 32-bit shifted output `o_out`, a carry-out `o_carry_out` indicating the carry result, and a stall signal `o_stall` that flags the necessity to stall the operation for larger shifts handled by the full barrel shifter. Internal signals such as `quick_out`, `quick_carry_out`, `full_out`, `full_carry_out`, along with registers `full_out_r`, `full_carry_out_r`, and `use_quick_r` manage the shifting logic and the transition between quick and full shifting modes. Structurally, the module is divided into sections handling the logic for determining stalling and output selection, the always block for updating registered outputs and mode selection, and the instantiation of the two different `a25_shifter` configurations for immediate and more extensive shift requirements. This design allows dynamic response to different shifting needs, optimizing speed and flexibility of operations.",

It uses two instances of `a25_shifter` to handle this operation. One instance performs a full barrel shift, suited for larger shift amounts, and the other provides a quicker shift operation optimized for smaller shifts. The module decides dynamically which output to use based on the amount of shift specified (`i_shift_amount`). If the shift amount is sizable (i.e., the higher bits of `i_shift_amount` are set), it indicates a stall condition and signals this via `o_stall` while preparing the results from the full barrel shifter to be used as output in subsequent cycles. On the other hand, for smaller shifts, it quickly outputs the results from the quick shifter. Output signals include the shifted result (`o_out`) and the carry-out (`o_carry_out`). The decision to stall and switch shifters is updated every clock cycle (`i_clk`)."
