    "module": "The \"generic_sram_byte_en\" module simulates a byte-addressable SRAM, supporting read and selective byte-write operations based on input controls. Triggered by the rising edge of `i_clk`, the module writes data from `i_write_data` to address `i_address` if `i_write_enable` is high, using `i_byte_enable` to selectively update bytes. If `i_write_enable` is low, it outputs the stored data at `i_address` to `o_read_data`. This functionality is implemented using an internal memory array `mem` and control logic within an always block."
