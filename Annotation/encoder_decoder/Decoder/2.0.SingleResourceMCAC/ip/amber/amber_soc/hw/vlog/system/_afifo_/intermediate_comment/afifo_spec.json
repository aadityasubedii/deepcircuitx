    "spec": "Module name: afifo. Module specification: The 'afifo' module is an asynchronous FIFO (First In First Out) buffer designed to handle data transfer between different clock domains using separate write (`wr_clk`) and read (`rd_clk`) clocks. It accepts data on the `i_data` input which is written to the FIFO when the `i_push` signal is asserted if the FIFO isn't full, as indicated by the `o_full` signal. Data is read from the FIFO and provided on the `o_data` output when the `i_pop` signal is asserted, if the FIFO isn't empty, as indicated by the `o_empty` signal. Internal signals such as `wr_pointer` and `rd_pointer` track the current write and read locations within the FIFO, while their delayed counterparts (`wr_pointer_d1`, `wr_pointer_d2`, `rd_pointer_d1`, `rd_pointer_d2`) and their Gray code conversions (`wr_pointer_rd`, `rd_pointer_wr`) are used to manage synchronicity across different clock domains. The module includes distinct procedural blocks for actions on the write and read clock edges, updating pointers and handling data movement, while ensuring robust cross-domain operation through Gray code conversions implemented in the functions `gray8` and `ungray8`. These conversions help maintain data integrity by permitting only a single bit change at a time during pointer updates.",

Parameters allow customization of the data width (`D_WIDTH`). It features logic to manage the read and write pointers using Gray code to ensure safe cross-domain operation. The FIFO supports basic operations such as push (write) and pop (read), and it provides flags (`o_full` and `o_empty`) to indicate the status of the FIFO as full or empty respectively. Data is stored in a memory array (`data`) sized based on the width specified by `D_WIDTH`. Gray code conversion is used for the pointers to mitigate errors due to clock domain crossing by making only one bit change at a time, enhancing the reliability of the FIFO operation across different clock domains."

It has a width defined by `D_WIDTH`.\n- `i_push`: This input signal, when asserted (`1`), indicates that data on `i_data` should be pushed into the FIFO, provided the FIFO is not full.\n- `i_pop`: This input signal, when asserted (`1`), requests that data be popped, or read, from the FIFO, provided the FIFO is not empty.\n\nOutput ports: `o_data`, `o_full`, `o_empty`.\nExplanation:\n- `o_data`: This output port provides the data that is read from the FIFO. It has a width defined by `D_WIDTH`.\n- `o_full`: This output signal indicates whether the FIFO is full (`1` if full, `0` otherwise), preventing further write operations until space becomes available.\n- `o_empty`: This output signal indicates whether the FIFO is empty (`1` if empty, `0` otherwise), preventing a read operation if there is no data to read."

These delays help in synchronization across clock domains.\n- `rd_pointer_d1` and `rd_pointer_d2`: Similarly, these signals are delayed versions of the `rd_pointer`. `rd_pointer_d1` is the `rd_pointer` delayed by one read clock cycle, and `rd_pointer_d2` is delayed by an additional read clock cycle. These help in maintaining synchronization across clock domains.\n- `wr_pointer_rd`: This is the write pointer converted back from Gray code to binary, as seen from the read clock domain.
