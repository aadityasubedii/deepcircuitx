Configured with a parameterizable width `WIDTH` and a reset value `RESET_VALUE`, it features input ports `DataIn`, `Write`, `Clk`, `Reset`, and `SyncReset`. `DataIn` accepts the data to be stored, `Write` acts as a control enabling data storage when high during a positive clock edge, `Clk` is the timing signal for operations, `Reset` allows for an immediate reset of the output `DataOut` to `RESET_VALUE` irrespective of the clock, and `SyncReset` resets `DataOut` synchronously on a clock edge. The output port `DataOut` represents the data held within the register, which is also an internal signal used to temporarily hold and output the data based on the described control conditions. The main operational block of the code, an `always` block triggered by a positive edge of `Clk` or `Reset`, checks for high reset conditions before overwriting `DataOut` with `DataIn` during a write operation, thus outlining the sequential logic and conditional handling based on the input signals ensuring controlled data storage and reset functionalities.",
