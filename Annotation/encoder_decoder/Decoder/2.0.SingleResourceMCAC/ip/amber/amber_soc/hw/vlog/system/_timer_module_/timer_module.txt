The timer_module manages three independent timers for the AMBER processor, interfacing with a Wishbone bus system. It processes input signals for synchronization, configuration, and control of countdown operations, and outputs timer interrupts alongside standard bus responses. The module comprises initializations, conditional write/read operations, countdown mechanisms with auto-reload and prescaler options, and debugging provisions to enhance traceability during development, encapsulated within a structured Verilog codebase.
