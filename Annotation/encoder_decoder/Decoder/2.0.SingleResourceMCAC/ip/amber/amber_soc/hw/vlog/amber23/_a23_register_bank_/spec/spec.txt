Module name: a23_register_bank. 
Module specification: The 'a23_register_bank' serves as a dynamic register management system for an ARM-like processor architecture, facilitating the reading from and writing into a variety of registers dependent on the processor's operating modes and conditions. It includes input ports such as `i_clk` (clock input), `i_fetch_stall` (inhibits register updates on active), various mode selection signals like `i_mode_idec` and `i_mode_exec`, selector signals for specific registers (`i_rm_sel`, `i_rds_sel`, `i_rn_sel`), and signals for updating the program counter and the register bank (`i_pc_wen`, `i_reg_bank_wen`). The output ports include `o_rm`, `o_rs`, `o_rd`, `o_rn` and `o_pc`, which output data from selected registers. Internal signals include multiple 32-bit general-purpose registers (`r0` to `r14`), mode-specific registers such as `r13_svc`, `r8_firq` to `r14_firq`, among others, and wires for output assignments like `r0_out` to `r15_out_rm`, indicating the data flow paths. The module operates by sequentially checking clock edges without fetch stalls to update register values based on input conditions and write enables. It also differentiates the register source based on execution and decoding modes to facilitate context switches and mode-specific operations effectively. Register output selection is managed through combinational logic blocks assessing selector inputs. This design ensures versatile and efficient handling of state and data throughout the processorâ€™s operational lifecycle.
