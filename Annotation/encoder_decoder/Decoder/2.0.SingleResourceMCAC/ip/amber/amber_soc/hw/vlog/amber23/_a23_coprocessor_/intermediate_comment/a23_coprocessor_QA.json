It receives several inputs including operation codes, coprocessor registers, and fault signals. The module can control cache enabling, flushing, and defines cacheable areas through specific register settings it receives. Additionally, it handles fault statuses and addresses, updating these values when a fault is detected. Outputs from the module also provide data read from the specified coprocessor registers based on the current operational command directed to registers concerning cache settings, fault information, and others. The included debug messaging assists in tracing the operations for further analysis during development or testing."
