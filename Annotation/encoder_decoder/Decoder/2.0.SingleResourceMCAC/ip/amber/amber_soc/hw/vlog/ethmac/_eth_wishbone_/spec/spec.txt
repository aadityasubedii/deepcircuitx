Module name: eth_wishbone. Module specification: This module implements an Ethernet Wishbone interface controller, managing communication between the Ethernet MAC and the Wishbone bus for transmit and receive operations. It handles buffer management, status handling, and interrupt generation. Key inputs include clock signals, Wishbone bus inputs, Ethernet MAC signals, and configuration inputs. Outputs consist of Wishbone bus outputs, Ethernet MAC control signals, and interrupt signals. Internal signals manage buffer states, pointers, and various control flags. The module is divided into several functional blocks: Wishbone interface logic, transmit path logic, receive path logic, FIFO management, and interrupt generation. It coordinates data transfers between the Wishbone bus and Ethernet frames, manages buffer descriptors, and handles various control signals and status flags related to Ethernet packet transmission and reception. The design incorporates synchronization mechanisms between different clock domains and implements error handling for conditions such as under
