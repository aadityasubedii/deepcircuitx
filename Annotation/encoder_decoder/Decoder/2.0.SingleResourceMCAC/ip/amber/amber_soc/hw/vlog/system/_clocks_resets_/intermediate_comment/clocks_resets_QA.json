It takes inputs such as board reset, differential clock signals, and DDR calibration completion signal, and outputs system clock, reset, and optionally a 200 MHz clock. The module involves clock signal conditioning using IBUFGDS for differential signaling and PLL or MMCM for clock management, depending on the type of FPGA (Spartan6 or Virtex6). The reset logic includes synchronization and generation of a system reset signal based on the PLL's lock status and the DDR calibration state. This module is critical in ensuring stable and synchronized operation across various components of the system by providing the necessary clock and reset signals."

It is used to reset the entire system and all synchronized registers within the module to ensure a known state upon system initialization or when a reset is required.\n- i_brd_clk_n, i_brd_clk_p: These are the negative and positive differential clock input signals, respectively. They are used as the primary clock input for the system and are typically passed through a differential buffer (IBUFGDS) to generate a single-ended clock signal inside the FPGA.\n- i_ddr_calib_done: This input indicates whether DDR calibration has been completed. It is used to ensure that the system does not start operating with the DDR memory until it is properly calibrated and ready.\n\nOutput ports: o_sys_rst, o_sys_clk, o_clk_200.\nExplanation:\n- o_sys_rst: This is the system reset output signal. It is generated based on the board reset and DDR calibration status. The signal ensures that the system reset is applied across the entire digital system post-initialization or in the event of a necessary reset.\n- o_sys_clk: This is the system clock output signal, derived from a phase-locked loop (PLL) or mixed-mode clock manager (MMCM) depending on FPGA type. This clock is used to drive the synchronous elements in the digital system, providing a stable and reliable clock.\n- o_clk_200: This is an additional clock output running at 200 MHz, provided from the input differential clock buffer directly and used for specific system requirements needing this frequency."
