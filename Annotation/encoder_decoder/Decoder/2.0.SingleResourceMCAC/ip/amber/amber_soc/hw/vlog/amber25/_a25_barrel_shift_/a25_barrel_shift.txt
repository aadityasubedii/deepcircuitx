The a25_barrel_shift module performs variable bit-width shifting on a 32-bit input using dual shifter instances (quick and full barrel) controlled by the shift amount. It selects outputs dynamically, handling larger shifts with a stall mechanism. Internal signals and registers manage data and carry propagation between cycles, enabling seamless transitions between different shift modes, optimized for speed and efficiency.
