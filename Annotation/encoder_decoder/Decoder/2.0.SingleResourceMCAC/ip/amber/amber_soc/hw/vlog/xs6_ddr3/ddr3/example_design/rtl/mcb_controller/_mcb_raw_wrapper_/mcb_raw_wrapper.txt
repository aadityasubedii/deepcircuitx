This module is a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) that interfaces with various types of DDR memory. It handles input/output signals between the user interface and memory, including address, data, and control signals. The module implements port configurations, memory width support, calibration, DQS management, and IOB instantiation. It uses OSERDES2 and IODRP2_MCB components for signal conditioning and timing control. The wrapper incorporates soft calibration logic and generates appropriate control signals for different memory types. It also includes logic for self-refresh mode and initialization sequences.
