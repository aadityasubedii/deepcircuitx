    "module": "The a25_execute module serves as the central execution unit for an ARM-based processor, handling various operations including arithmetic, logic, memory access, and interrupt handling. It implements the execution stage of the processor pipeline, utilizing an ALU, barrel shifter, multiply unit, and register bank to process instructions. The module manages status flags, handles different processor modes, and controls data flow between various functional units. It processes incoming control signals and data to determine the next processor state, updating internal registers and generating appropriate output signals for memory access, register writes, and status updates. The module also implements conditional execution and manages privileged operations, ensuring proper handling of different instruction types and processor states."
