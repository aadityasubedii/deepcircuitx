    "module": "The `read_posted_fifo` module serves as a FIFO buffer specifically designed for handling posted read operations in memory interfaces, managing synchronization of read commands and data based on availability and data/command readiness. It employs parameters such as burst length and address width to configure the FIFO operation and uses a combination of control registers, counters, and conditional logic to track and manage the state of FIFO (e.g., empty, full), data acceptance, and command handling. The internal logic adjusts depending on the FPGA family and memory configuration to ensure optimal FIFO performance and data integrity."
