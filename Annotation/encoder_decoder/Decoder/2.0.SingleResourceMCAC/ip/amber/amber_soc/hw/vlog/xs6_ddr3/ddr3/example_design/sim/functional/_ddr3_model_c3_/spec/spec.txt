Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module represents a behavioral model of a DDR3 SDRAM memory device. It simulates the operation and timing characteristics of a DDR3 memory, including command decoding, address handling, read/write operations, and various timing checks. The module has input ports for clock (ck, ck_n), control signals (cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address and bank inputs (ba, addr), data masks (dm_tdqs), and data I/O (dq, dqs, dqs_n). It also has an output port for termination data strobe (tdqs_n). Internally, the module uses numerous signals to track timing parameters, state information, and data pipelines. These include clock-related signals (e.g., tck_avg, tch_avg),
