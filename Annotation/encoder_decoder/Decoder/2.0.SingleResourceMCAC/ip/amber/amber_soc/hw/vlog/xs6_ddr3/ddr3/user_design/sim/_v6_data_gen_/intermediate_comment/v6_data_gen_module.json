    "module": "This module generates various data patterns for memory testing and simulation. It supports PRBS, address-based, walking 1's/0's, hammer, and neighbor patterns. The module uses a configurable architecture with different data generation blocks for each pattern type. It selects and processes the appropriate pattern based on input signals and configuration parameters. The module handles different data widths, burst lengths, and number of DQ pins, making it adaptable for various memory interfaces and test scenarios. Pattern generation is controlled by input signals and internal counters, with complex logic for creating and manipulating data patterns."
