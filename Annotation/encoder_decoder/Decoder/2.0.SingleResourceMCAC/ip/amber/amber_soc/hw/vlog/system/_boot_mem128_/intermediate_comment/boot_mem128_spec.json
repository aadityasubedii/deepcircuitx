    "spec": "Module name: boot_mem128.\nModule specification: The `boot_mem128` module is a memory interface tailored for Xilinx FPGA implementations, designed to interface with the Wishbone bus protocol. It facilitates both read and write operations to handle data transfers effectively. The input ports include `i_wb_clk` (input clock), `i_wb_adr` (address bus), `i_wb_sel` (byte selection signal), `i_wb_we` (write enable), and `i_wb_dat` (data input for write operations), along with `i_wb_cyc` and `i_wb_stb` that signal the start and duration of a bus transfer. The output ports are `o_wb_dat` (data output for reads), `o_wb_ack` (acknowledgment of successful transactions), and `o_wb_err` (error indicator). Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `start_write` and `start_read` to trigger write and read operations, `write_data` and `read_data` to handle data moving in and out of memory, and `byte_enable` which works in conjunction with `i_wb_sel` to specify active bytes during transactions. The `address` signal manages the memory addressing based on `i_wb_adr`. Debug configurations are supported through additional signals like `jitter_r` and `start_read_r`, which help in creating timing variations and maintaining read states across cycles, respectively. The module features conditional blocks for debug scenarios (`AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG`) and FPGA-specific configurations (`XILINX_FPGA`). Instantiation of memory blocks varies as per FPGA type or a generic implementation to ensure flexibility across different hardware setups. This makes `boot_mem128` a robust and adaptable module for memory management in FPGA-based systems.",

It is asserted when a strobe (`i_wb_stb`) is active, write enable (`i_wb_we`) is set, and no reads are currently initiated (`start_read_r` is low). This handles the control for starting write transactions on the bus.\n- `start_read`: Similar to `start_write`, this signal is used to initiate a read operation. It becomes active when there is a strobe signal (`i_wb_stb`) and the operation is not a write (`i_wb_we` is low and `start_read_r` is low). It controls the read access to the memory.\n- `read_data`: Holds the data fetched from the memory during read operations. It is connected from the memory module's output to the module's data output (`o_wb_dat`).\n- `write_data`: This signal passes the data from the input `i_wb_dat` to the memory for write operations. It simply relays the data to be written into the memory.\n- `byte_enable`: Derived from the byte selection signal (`i_wb_sel`), it is used in the memory sub-module to enable specific bytes of the data word during write operations.\n- `address`: Extracted from the `i_wb_adr` based on the defined memory address width (`MADDR_WIDTH`), this signal pinpoints the address in memory where data will be read from or written to.\n- `jitter_r`: A debug-specific signal that is used to create arbitrary jitter or variation during debug mode, affecting timing or control behaviors like start reading operations. This is used to test the robustness of the module under unusual or unexpected conditions.\n- `start_read_r`: A signal that latches or holds the state of a read operation across clock cycles, helping manage the state between consecutive operations. This latch aids in controlling and sequencing operations to ensure data integrity."

                    "text": "Module name: boot_mem128.\nModule specification: The `boot_mem128` module is a memory interface tailored for Xilinx FPGA implementations, designed to interface with the Wishbone bus protocol. It facilitates both read and write operations to handle data transfers effectively. The input ports include `i_wb_clk` (input clock), `i_wb_adr` (address bus), `i_wb_sel` (byte selection signal), `i_wb_we` (write enable), and `i_wb_dat` (data input for write operations), along with `i_wb_cyc` and `i_wb_stb` that signal the start and duration of a bus transfer. The output ports are `o_wb_dat` (data output for reads), `o_wb_ack` (acknowledgment of successful transactions), and `o_wb_err` (error indicator). Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `start_write` and `start_read` to trigger write and read operations, `write_data` and `read_data` to handle data moving in and out of memory, and `byte_enable` which works in conjunction with `i_wb_sel` to specify active bytes during transactions. The `address` signal manages the memory addressing based on `i_wb_adr`. Debug configurations are supported through additional signals like `jitter_r` and `start_read_r`, which help in creating timing variations and maintaining read states across cycles, respectively. The module features conditional blocks for debug scenarios (`AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG`) and FPGA-specific configurations (`XILINX_FPGA`). Instantiation of memory blocks varies as per FPGA type or a generic implementation to ensure flexibility across different hardware setups. This makes `boot_mem128` a robust and adaptable module for memory management in FPGA-based systems."
