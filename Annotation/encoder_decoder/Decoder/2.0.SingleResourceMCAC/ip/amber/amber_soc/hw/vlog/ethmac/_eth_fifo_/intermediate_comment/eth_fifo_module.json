    "module": "The `eth_fifo` module implements a synchronous FIFO buffer optimized for Ethernet data handling, supporting essential operations like data read/write and status reporting (full, empty, almost conditions). This module is designed with parameterizable width and depth, employing separate read and write pointers and internal counters to manage FIFO operations across generic and Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA setups, utilizing either basic register arrays or specialized distributed RAM configurations for data storage and manipulation."
