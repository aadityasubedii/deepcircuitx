The eth_transmitcontrol module manages the transmission of Ethernet control frames, specifically pause frames, to regulate network traffic based on input conditions like pause requests and buffer status. It uses an array of control and status signals (e.g., TxUsedDataIn, TPauseRq) to synchronize and control the flow of transmission events, functioning through a series of state-controlled always blocks that handle the initiation, ongoing transmission, and termination of control frames, leveraging internal counters and logic conditions to ensure timely and accurate frame management.
