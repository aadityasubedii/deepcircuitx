    "spec": "Module name: a25_alu. \nModule specification: The `a25_alu` module functions as an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for performing various arithmetic and logical operations, determined by the `i_function` input. This module handles two primary 32-bit inputs, `i_a_in` and `i_b_in`, manipulating these based on the specified function to produce a 32-bit output `o_out` and a 4-bit output `o_flags` indicating zero, sign, carry, and overflow conditions. The input ports include `i_a_in`, `i_b_in` for the data operands, `i_barrel_shift_carry` for providing a carry bit from a previous shift operation, `i_status_bits_carry` providing a status carry bit, and `i_function` which is a 9-bit input controlling the operation mode of the ALU. Internally, the module employs signals like `a`, `b` to hold swapped or direct inputs, `b_not` for bitwise negation, various selectors (`swap_sel`, `not_sel`, etc.) derived from `i_function` for controlling operations, and arithmetic outputs like `fadder_out` for addition results. It also includes conditionally compiled blocks for FPGA-specific optimizations and standard logical operations like AND, OR, XOR, and bit extensions. The outputs are managed by selectors that drive `o_out` with results from logical operations or arithmetic results, and `o_flags` that convey the result's status regarding zero, negative, carry over, and overflow conditions. This ALU is adaptable and configurable, suitable for hardware implementations needing versatile and efficient arithmetic and logical operations.",

This module handles two primary 32-bit inputs, `i_a_in` and `i_b_in`, manipulating these based on the specified function to produce a 32-bit output `o_out` and a 4-bit output `o_flags` indicating zero, sign, carry, and overflow conditions. The input ports include `i_a_in`, `i_b_in` for the data operands, `i_barrel_shift_carry` for providing a carry bit from a previous shift operation, `i_status_bits_carry` providing a status carry bit, and `i_function` which is a 9-bit input controlling the operation mode of the ALU. Internally, the module employs signals like `a`, `b` to hold swapped or direct inputs, `b_not` for bitwise negation, various selectors (`swap_sel`, `not_sel`, etc.) derived from `i_function` for controlling operations, and arithmetic outputs like `fadder_out` for addition results. It also includes conditionally compiled blocks for FPGA-specific optimizations and standard logical operations like AND, OR, XOR, and bit extensions. The outputs are managed by selectors that drive `o_out` with results from logical operations or arithmetic results, and `o_flags` that convey the result's status regarding zero, negative, carry over, and overflow conditions. This ALU is adaptable and configurable, suitable for hardware implementations needing versatile and efficient arithmetic and logical operations."
