Module name: a23_wishbone. 
Module specification: The 'a23_wishbone' module is a controller designed for interfacing with a Wishbone bus, handling both read and write operations efficiently. It is synchronized using an input clock signal 'i_clk' and manages data transactions based on the selection signal 'i_select'. Data to be written is supplied through 'i_write_data', with 'i_write_enable' indicating the nature of the transaction (read or write). Additionally, 'i_byte_enable' specifies valid data bytes, and 'i_exclusive' determines if the operation should be exclusive. The module outputs various control signals like 'o_stall' to manage processor activity during busy bus states, and also 'o_wb_adr', 'o_wb_sel', 'o_wb_we', 'o_wb_dat', 'o_wb_cyc', and 'o_wb_stb' to facilitate proper data addressing, writing, and transaction signaling on the Wishbone bus. Internally, the module leverages a state machine controlled by 'wishbone_st' for managing different stages of a Wishbone transaction, with states for idle, burst transfers, and acknowledgment waiting. Signals such as 'start_access', 'servicing_cache', and 'exclusive_access' help in initiating and managing access to the bus, catering to either core or cache requests indicated by 'i_cache_req'. Additionally, the 'wbuf_busy_r', 'wbuf_addr_r', and 'wbuf_sel_r' are utilized for buffering write operations when immediate access to the bus is not available. The code is structured into blocks handling initialization, transaction processing based on the state machine, and address configuration for the bus, enriching module response and efficiency in data management.
