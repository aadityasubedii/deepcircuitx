Module name: xs6_addsub_n. Module specification: The `xs6_addsub_n` is a Verilog module parameterized with a `WIDTH` input and is designed to perform either addition or subtraction on two inputs, `i_a` and `i_b`, depending on the control signals. It makes use of a DSP48A1 block for efficient calculations. The inputs include `i_a` and `i_b`, both up to a bit-width determined by `WIDTH`, `i_cin` for carry-in to support chained operations, and `i_sub` which selects between addition (low) and subtraction (high). The outputs are `o_sum`, delivering the operation result trimmed to `WIDTH`, and `o_co` for the carry-out signal. Internally, the module uses the `opmode` signal to set the operation mode of the DSP block, `in_a` and `in_b`, which extend `i_a` and `i_b` to 48 bits to match the DSP input requirements, and `out` which captures up to 48-bit results from the DSP block. The DSP block is configured primarily for arithmetic operations, with all its configuration parameters and operational modes set within the Verilog code, including the connection of its inputs based on parts of the `in_a` and `in_b` signals, and using `opmode` to control its operation effectively. This setup ensures that xs6_addsub_n can handle a variety of numerical operations efficiently with configurable bit widths.
