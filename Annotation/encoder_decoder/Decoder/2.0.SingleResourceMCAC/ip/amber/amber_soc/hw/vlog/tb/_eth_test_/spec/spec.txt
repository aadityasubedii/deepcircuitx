Module name: eth_test. Module specification: The 'eth_test' module is designed to handle Ethernet packet communication, managing both the transmission and reception of data through serial transmission and incorporating complex state management for packet handling. It utilizes input ports such as 'md_io' for bidirectional MII management data I/O, 'mdc_i' for MII management data clock, 'mtx_clk_i' for transmission clock synchronization, and 'mrxd_i'/'mrxdv_i' for receiving data and its validity. The output ports include 'mtxd_o', 'mtxdv_o', and 'mtxerr_o', which manage the transmitted data, its validity, and transmission errors respectively. Internal signals such as 'mem' for storing frames, 'eth' for Ethernet frame fields, and 'state_r' for transmission FSM states, amongst others, facilitate data handling and state transitions. Major sections in the code include initialization to prepare data channels, always blocks handling various state machines (transmission, reception, and MDIO interface), and tasks/functions like 'print_pkt' and 'rmem' which aid in packet analysis and memory access. The module robustly handles multiple states of Ethernet packet processing tasks, ensuring packets are correctly configured, transmitted, received, and errors or status are logged.
