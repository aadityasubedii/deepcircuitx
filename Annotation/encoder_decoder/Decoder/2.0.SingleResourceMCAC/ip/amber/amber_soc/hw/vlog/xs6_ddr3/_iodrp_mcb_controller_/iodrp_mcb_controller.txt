The `iodrp_mcb_controller` module governs interactions between memory cells and a Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP), facilitating data read/write and dynamic configuration operations via an FSM-driven architecture. Input handling, state transitions, and output generation are managed by detailed logic blocks including multiple stages of address-data phase handling, signal multiplexing for DRP interfacing, and memory operations controlled through serialized data. This setup ensures synchronized, robust data flow and operational state management in reconfigurable hardware environments.
