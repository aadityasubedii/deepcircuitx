Module name: ethmac_wb. Module specification: The "ethmac_wb" module in Verilog is designed for interfacing between a master and a slave module in an Ethernet MAC system, leveraging the Wishbone protocol. It manages data transactions, adapting to either 32-bit or 128-bit data width driven by the `WB_DWIDTH` parameter. Input ports include master-specific signals such as `i_m_wb_adr`, `i_m_wb_sel`, `i_m_wb_we`, `i_m_wb_wdat`, `i_m_wb_cyc`, `i_m_wb_stb`, `i_m_wb_rdat`, `i_m_wb_ack`, `i_m_wb_err`, and similarly structured slave-specific signals prefixed with `i_s_wb_`. Output ports mirror these inputs and are prefixed with `o_m_wb_` and `o_s_wb_` reflecting their respective master and slave interfaces. Internal signals named `wbm128`, `wbm32`, `wbs128`, and `wbs32` handle conditional configurations within generate blocks for different data widths. These blocks adjust data mapping, endianness, and signal selection based on the operational mode (32-bit or 128-bit). For each mode, specific handling of read/write data, acknowledgment, address remapping, and error processing is specially configured to ensure compliant data transactions meeting the Wishbone protocol standards.
