It uses two instances of `a25_shifter` to handle this operation. One instance performs a full barrel shift, suited for larger shift amounts, and the other provides a quicker shift operation optimized for smaller shifts. The module decides dynamically which output to use based on the amount of shift specified (`i_shift_amount`). If the shift amount is sizable (i.e., the higher bits of `i_shift_amount` are set), it indicates a stall condition and signals this via `o_stall` while preparing the results from the full barrel shifter to be used as output in subsequent cycles. On the other hand, for smaller shifts, it quickly outputs the results from the quick shifter. Output signals include the shifted result (`o_out`) and the carry-out (`o_carry_out`). The decision to stall and switch shifters is updated every clock cycle (`i_clk`)."
