Module name: ddr3. Module specification: The ddr3 module is a DDR3 memory controller interface designed for Xilinx FPGAs. It implements a configurable memory interface for DDR3 SDRAM with multiple internal ports (p0 to p5) for read/write operations and command issuing. The module has input ports for system clock (c3_sys_clk), reset (c3_sys_rst_i), and various command, write, and read signals for each port. Output ports include DDR3 SDRAM interface signals (mcb3_dram_*), calibration status (c3_calib_done), and status signals for each port. Internal signals handle clock management, reset control, and additional port functionalities. The module consists of two main blocks: an infrastructure block for clock and reset management, and a memory controller wrapper (memc_wrapper) that implements
