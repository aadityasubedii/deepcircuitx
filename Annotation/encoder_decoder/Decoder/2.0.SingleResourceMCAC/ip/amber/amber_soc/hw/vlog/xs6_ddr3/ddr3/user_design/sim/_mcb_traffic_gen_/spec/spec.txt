Module name: mcb_traffic_gen. Module specification: The mcb_traffic_gen module is designed for Memory Controller Block (MCB) traffic generation in FPGA designs, specifically for testing and validating memory systems. It generates configurable memory access patterns, supporting various burst lengths, data and command patterns, and operating modes (read, write, or bi-directional). The module features numerous input ports for configuration and control, including clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), address range (start_addr_i, end_addr_i), and various mode selection inputs (addr_mode_i, instr_mode_i, bl_mode_i, data_mode_i). Output ports include memory controller interface signals (mcb_cmd_en_o, mcb_cmd_instr_o, mcb_cmd_addr_o, mcb_cmd_bl_o) and data paths for
