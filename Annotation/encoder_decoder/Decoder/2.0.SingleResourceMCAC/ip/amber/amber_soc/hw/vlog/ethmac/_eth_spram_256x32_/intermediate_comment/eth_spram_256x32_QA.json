It interfaces with external logic via a clock signal (`clk`), a reset signal (`rst`), chip enable (`ce`), write enable bits (`we`), output enable (`oe`), a 8-bit address bus (`addr`), a 32-bit input data bus (`di`), and a 32-bit output data bus (`do`). The RAM allows byte-wise write operations indicated by the write enable bits, and the chip enable signal must be active for write operations. The module also incorporates conditionally compiled blocks for different FPGA families like Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6, as well as a generic option for other cases, which instantiate specific or generic SRAM components with byte enable functionality. The operation of reading and writing data is synchronized to the rising edge of the clock signal."

It is used to synchronize the operations of the RAM module such as reading and writing data.\n- `rst`: Reset signal input. This signal is used to reset the internal state of the RAM module or initialize it.\n- `ce`: Chip enable input. This signal must be active (usually high) for the RAM to respond to other control signals and perform read/write operations.\n- `we`: Write enable bits input. It is a 4-bit input where each bit corresponds to enabling the write operation for each byte of the 32-bit data bus. This allows byte-wise writing.\n- `oe`: Output enable input. It enables the output from the RAM module when active.\n- `addr`: Address bus input. It is an 8-bit input that specifies the address of the memory location to be accessed (read or write).\n- `di`: Data input bus. It is a 32-bit bus used to input data into the RAM module that needs to be written into the specified memory location.\n\nOutput ports: do.\nExplanation:\n- `do`: Data output bus. It is a 32-bit bus that outputs data from the RAM module. The data outputted corresponds to the data stored at the memory location specified by the address input `addr`."

The `write_enable` signal ensures that a write operation is only performed when the chip is enabled and at least one byte-enable bit is active.
