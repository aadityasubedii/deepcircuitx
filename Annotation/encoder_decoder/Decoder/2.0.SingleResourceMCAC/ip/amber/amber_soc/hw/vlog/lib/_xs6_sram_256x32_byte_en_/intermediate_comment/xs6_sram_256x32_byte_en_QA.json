The module accepts a 32-bit data input and writes it to a specified address, with control over which bytes are written via the `i_byte_enable` signal. This ensures only selected bytes are updated during a write operation. The memory is instantiated using the RAMB8BWER primitive configured for Simple Dual Port (SDP) mode with read-first behavior. The module also includes an initial block to verify if the parameter definitions for data width and address width are correctly set. If not, it outputs a warning message."

When high, the data from `i_write_data` is written into the memory at the location specified by `i_address`.\n- `i_address`: An 8-bit address bus specifying the location in the memory where data is to be read from or written to.\n- `i_byte_enable`: A 4-bit input used to control which bytes of the input data bus are written to the memory. Each bit corresponds to one byte of the data bus.\n\nOutput ports: [o_read_data].\nExplanation: \n- `o_read_data`: A 32-bit output data bus that holds the data read from the memory at the location specified by `i_address`. This data is outputted based on the read operations triggered by the clock and the memory address."

They are declared as 3-bit wide wires but are not connected to any ports or internal logic within the module.\n- `nc22`: Similar to `nc31`, `nc32`, and `nc33`, this is another no connect signal declared as a 2-bit wide wire which is unused in the module.\n- `wea`: This is a 4-bit wide wire that plays a crucial role in the module.
