Module name: tg_status. Module specification: The "tg_status" module is specifically designed to monitor and report error statuses within a system by leveraging a variety of inputs reflecting different system states and error types. This includes signals like data mismatches, command queue statuses, and memory buffer states. **Input ports** include `clk_i` (system clock), `rst_i` (system reset), `manual_clear_error` (manual reset for error status), `data_error_i` (indicates a data error), `cmp_data_i` and `rd_data_i` (expected and actual data for comparison), `cmp_addr_i` (current data transaction address), `cmp_bl_i` (burst length of the transaction), and `mcb_cmd_full_i`, `mcb_wr_full_i`, `mcb_rd_empty_i` (indicating memory control block status). **Output ports** comprise `error_status` (a detailed error log including address, data, and buffer statuses), and `error` (indicates if an error has been detected and is active). **Internal signals** include `data_error_r` (captures the previous state of `data_error_i` for edge detection) and `error_set` (maintains the error flag status). Within the code, **behavioral blocks** handle the system response to reset and manual error clear actions, error detection based on data mismatches, setting error details into the `error_status` register upon error confirmation, and maintaining the error active signal via the `error_set` flag. This module is essential for achieving accurate and timely error management in data-sensitive applications, ensuring that anomalies are flagged and can be corrected or logged appropriately.
