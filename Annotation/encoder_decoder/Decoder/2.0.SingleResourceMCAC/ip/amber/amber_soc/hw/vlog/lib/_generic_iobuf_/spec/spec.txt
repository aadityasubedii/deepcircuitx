Module name: generic_iobuf. Module specification: The "generic_iobuf" module is designed as a bidirectional buffer interface to allow a pin to function either as an input or an output based on a control signal. It includes an input port 'I' that serves as the data input, which is routed to the 'IO' pin when the control input 'T' is low. The 'T' input is crucial as it determines the behavior of the 'IO' pin; setting it high places 'IO' in a high impedance state and low connects 'I' to 'IO'. The output port 'O' acts as a monitor, reflecting the current state of the 'IO' pin. The module leverages an inout port 'IO' which is conditionally controlled by 'T' to drive 'I' or to enter a high-impedance state. Inside the module, there are no internal signals utilized; functionality is managed directly via two assignment statements: "assign O = IO;" and "assign IO = T ? 1'bz : I;". These lines directly set the output based on the state of 'IO' and conditionally control the state of 'IO' based on input 'T', encapsulating all the operational logic of the module without further segmentation.
