    "spec": "Module name: a25_multiply. Module specification: The 'a25_multiply' module is a Verilog hardware design used for multiplying two 32-bit operands and conditionally accumulating the results over multiple clock cycles. The module inputs consist of a clock signal (`i_clk`), stalling signal (`i_core_stall`), two 32-bit operands (`i_a_in` and `i_b_in`), a 2-bit control input(`i_function`), and an execution trigger (`i_execute`). Outputs include a 32-bit result (`o_out`), a 2-bit status flag (`o_flags`), indicating overflow and zero conditions, and a completion signal (`o_done`). Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `enable` and `accumulate` derived from `i_function` to control operation modes, `multiplier` and `multiplier_bar` for operand processing, and registers like `product` and `count` for storing intermediate values and tracking operation progress. Configurable sections for FPGA-specific additions and subtractions optimize calculations based on the target FPGA family specified (`XILINX_SPARTAN6_FPGA` or `XILINX_VIRTEX6_FPGA`). The sequence is managed through combinational and sequential logic blocks, handling operations from initialization, cycling through bit positions, to final accumulation and output readiness, ensuring accurate multiplication and optional accumulation based on the controls and signals provided.",

The module operates under clocked conditions and can stall based on an external stall signal. It takes additional control inputs to enable or disable the operation and to specify whether accumulation should occur. The output includes a 32-bit result and a 2-bit flag, where one bit indicates overflow and the other checks if the result is zero. The operation uses a sequential approach, counting and shifting through the bits of the operands over multiple clock cycles, with support for specific FPGA hardware optimizations for addition and subtraction operations."

                    "text": "Module name: a25_multiply. Module specification: The 'a25_multiply' module is a Verilog hardware design used for multiplying two 32-bit operands and conditionally accumulating the results over multiple clock cycles. The module inputs consist of a clock signal (`i_clk`), stalling signal (`i_core_stall`), two 32-bit operands (`i_a_in` and `i_b_in`), a 2-bit control input(`i_function`), and an execution trigger (`i_execute`). Outputs include a 32-bit result (`o_out`), a 2-bit status flag (`o_flags`), indicating overflow and zero conditions, and a completion signal (`o_done`). Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `enable` and `accumulate` derived from `i_function` to control operation modes, `multiplier` and `multiplier_bar` for operand processing, and registers like `product` and `count` for storing intermediate values and tracking operation progress. Configurable sections for FPGA-specific additions and subtractions optimize calculations based on the target FPGA family specified (`XILINX_SPARTAN6_FPGA` or `XILINX_VIRTEX6_FPGA`). The sequence is managed through combinational and sequential logic blocks, handling operations from initialization, cycling through bit positions, to final accumulation and output readiness, ensuring accurate multiplication and optional accumulation based on the controls and signals provided."
