    "module": "The `eth_register` module stores and manages data based on control signals and a clock. It uses input signals for data (`DataIn`), writing (`Write`), clock synchronizing (`Clk`), and resetting both asynchronously (`Reset`) and synchronously (`SyncReset`). The output, `DataOut`, reflects stored data, affected by writes at positive clock edges or reset conditions. The core operations are encapsulated in an `always` block sensitive to clock and reset edges, ensuring that data integrity and timing are maintained."
