It supports byte-level write enable controls, allowing selective byte writing within the 128-bit word by taking a 16-element byte enable vector. The main functionality entails writing data to or reading data from a RAM block depending on the write enable signal. The module leverages four instances of a block RAM configured in Simple Dual Port (SDP) mode with specific RAM and write characteristics. If either the DATA_WIDTH or ADDRESS_WIDTH parameters are incorrectly set, a warning is displayed at simulation start."

The computed result determines which bytes of the data can be written into each memory block.
