Module name: timer_module. Module specification: The timer_module is a versatile component tailored for the AMBER processor, integrating with a Wishbone bus interface. It manages three separate countdown timers, each having necessary control, load, interrupt, and value registers. Integral to its functionality are the input ports: `i_clk` (system clock), `i_wb_adr` (Wishbone address), `i_wb_sel` (byte select), `i_wb_we` (write enable), `i_wb_dat` (data input), `i_wb_cyc` (transaction cycle), and `i_wb_stb` (data strobe). The output ports include `o_wb_dat` (data output), `o_wb_ack` (transaction acknowledgment), `o_wb_err` (error flag), and `o_timer_int` (timer interrupts). Key internal signals such as `timer0_value_reg`, `timer1_value_reg`, `timer2_value_reg` track countdown values, while `wb_start_write`, `wb_start_read`, manage start conditions for read/write operations. The Verilog code is structured into multiple procedural blocks: initial value setups, read and write operations handling, timer countdown mechanisms, interrupt management, and optionally debugging blocks affected by compilation flags to trace operations and timer states. These blocks collectively ensure the timers operate synchronously with the system clock, handle configurations, synchronization checks, load and clear operations, as well as debugging outputs for development and testing phases.
