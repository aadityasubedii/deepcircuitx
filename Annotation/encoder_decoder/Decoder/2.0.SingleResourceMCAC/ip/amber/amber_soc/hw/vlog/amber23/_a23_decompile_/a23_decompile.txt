This module decompiles ARM processor instructions for debugging and analysis. It takes various inputs related to instruction execution and interrupt handling, decodes different instruction types, and generates human-readable disassembly. The module processes each instruction, extracts relevant information (e.g., opcodes, registers, immediates), formats it according to ARM assembly syntax, and writes the disassembled code to a file. It also tracks and reports on interrupts, jumps, and memory accesses, providing a comprehensive view of the processor's execution for debugging purposes.
