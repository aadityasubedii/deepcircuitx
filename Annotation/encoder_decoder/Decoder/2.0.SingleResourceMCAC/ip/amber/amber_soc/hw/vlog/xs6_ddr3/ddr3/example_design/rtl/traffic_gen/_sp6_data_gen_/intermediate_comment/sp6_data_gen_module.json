    "module": "This module generates various data patterns for memory interface testing, including fixed data, address patterns, pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS), walking ones/zeros, and hammer patterns. It supports 32, 64, and 128-bit data widths and different pin configurations. The module uses multiplexers to select between different data generation modes based on input signals. It implements pattern generation logic for each mode, including PRBS generation, address incrementing, and bit manipulation for walking and hammer patterns. The module synchronizes its operations with clock and reset inputs and provides control signals for data readiness and burst operations."
