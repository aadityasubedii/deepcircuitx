It manages the width and endianness of the data based on the parameter \"WB_DWIDTH\". This module interfaces the Wishbone protocol signals for both master and slave interfaces, facilitating the communication and data exchange such as address, data, select lines, control signals, and acknowledging errors. The module includes different configurations for data path width (32-bit and 128-bit) and adjusts the data and select lines accordingly to match the required endianness and segment of the data."
