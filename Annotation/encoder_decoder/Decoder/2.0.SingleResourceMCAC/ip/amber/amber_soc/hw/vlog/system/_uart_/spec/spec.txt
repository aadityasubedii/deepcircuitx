Module name: uart. Module specification: This module implements a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) interface with configurable baud rates and FIFO buffers. It handles both transmission and reception of serial data, supporting features like interrupt generation and flow control (CTS/RTS). The module interfaces with a Wishbone bus for control and data transfer. Input ports include clock (i_clk), Wishbone bus signals (i_wb_adr, i_wb_sel, i_wb_we, i_wb_dat, i_wb_cyc, i_wb_stb), UART Clear To Send (i_uart_cts_n), and UART receive data (i_uart_rxd). Output ports include Wishbone bus signals (o_wb_dat, o_wb_ack, o_wb_err), UART interrupt (o_uart_
