Module name: eth_txcounters.
Module specification: The 'eth_txcounters' module is integral to an Ethernet transmission system, primarily tasked with managing various counting operations during packet transmission. It features multiple input ports like MTxClk (module clock), Reset (resets the counters), various state signals (e.g., StatePreamble, StateIPG) that define the current stage of transmission, Start signals (e.g., StartDefer, StartIPG) that initiate counting, MinFL/MaxFL for frame size limits, and control signals like HugEn (enable huge frames) and ExDfrEn (manage excessive defer conditions). The output ports include ByteCnt (tracks bytes transmitted), NibCnt (tracks nibbles transmitted), and flags like ExcessiveDefer and MaxFrame which indicate specific conditions in the transmission. Internal signals such as ResetNibCnt and IncrementByteCnt are employed to manage the operational logic of counting based on incoming signals and conditions. The code is structured in blocks, each generally associated with detecting, managing, and resetting counts appropriately based on transitions in transmission state and control inputs. These include nibble count increments conditioned on active transmission states, byte count adjustments based on data phase and packet completion, and special counting for conditions like excessive defer and delayed CRC operations. This comprehensive setup allows the module to accurately track and manage data flow during Ethernet packet transmission, adapting dynamically to changing conditions and requirements.
