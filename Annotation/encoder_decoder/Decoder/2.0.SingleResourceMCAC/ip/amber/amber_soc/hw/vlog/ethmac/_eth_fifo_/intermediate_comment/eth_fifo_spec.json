    "spec": "Module name: eth_fifo.\n\nModule specification: The `eth_fifo` module is a parameterizable, synchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer designed primarily for Ethernet data handling within FPGA platforms, notably the Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. The module operates with fundamental operations like data writing and reading, in addition to status indications like full, almost full, empty, and almost empty conditions. It accommodates various FIFO operations synchronized by the `clk` (clock) input along with an asynchronous `reset`. Inputs include `write` and `read` controls that manage data transactions provided the FIFO isn't full or empty, respectively, as well as a `clear` signal for FIFO reset under specific conditions, with `data_in` serving as the input data bus. Output indicators such as `data_out` for the FIFO's output data, `almost_full`, `full`, `almost_empty`, `empty`, and a `cnt` representing the count of items in the FIFO provide essential status and data outputs. The module employs internal signal arrays and register pointers: `fifo` for data storage, `data_out` for outputting data, `cnt` for keeping a count of the stored items, `read_pointer`, and `write_pointer` for managing read and write operations within the FIFO buffer. Operationally, the module diverges in implementation between generic FPGAs and Xilinx-specific distributed RAM setup, the latter using a specialized `xilinx_dist_ram` component for memory management. Blocks of sequential logic control read and write operations including pointer calculations and data transfer based on clock edges, effectively managing the FIFO's internal state and ensuring data integrity and timely access.",

It holds the data entries that are being written into and read from the FIFO buffer.\n- `data_out` (FIFO output data register): A register that holds the data which is output from the FIFO upon a read operation. This register is updated every cycle where a read operation occurs and the FIFO is not empty.\n- `cnt` (Content counter): A counter that tracks the total number of data entries currently stored in the FIFO. It increases with every write operation that is not accompanied by a simultaneous read, and decreases with every read operation that is not accompanied by a simultaneous write.\n- `read_pointer` (FIFO read pointer): A pointer used to keep track of the position from which to read data next. It increments with each read operation, provided the FIFO is not empty, and wraps around when it reaches the end of the buffer.\n- `write_pointer` (FIFO write pointer): A pointer used to indicate where the next data entry should be written in the FIFO. It increments with each write operation, provided the FIFO is not full, and wraps around when it reaches the end of the buffer. \n\nThese internal signals are essential for managing the data flow within the FIFO, tracking storage, and maintaining the capability to read from and write to the buffer effectively."
