    "module": "The 'a25_coprocessor' module interfaces with coprocessor-specific operations, managing cache enabling, flushing, and fault handling based on system commands. It processes input commands through control registers, manipulating internal register settings (cache control, fault status, etc.) based on operations determined by opcode and register number inputs. Output is dynamically adjusted to reflect internal state changes, operational configurations, and fault responses, leveraging a systematic sequence of conditional checks and data assignments synchronized with the system clock."
