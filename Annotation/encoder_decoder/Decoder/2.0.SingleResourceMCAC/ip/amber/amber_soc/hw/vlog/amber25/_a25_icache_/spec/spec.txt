Module name: a25_icache. 
Module specification: The `a25_icache` module is designed specifically for the Amber 25 processor architecture, implementing an instruction cache that facilitates faster processor access to instructions by reducing fetch times from main memory. It inputs include `i_clk` (module's operation clock), `i_core_stall` (indicates core's stall status), `i_select` (cache operation selector), `i_address` (current instruction address), `i_address_nxt` (next instruction address for prefetching), `i_cache_enable` (activates cache operation), `i_cache_flush` (clears cache), and `i_wb_read_data` (data from memory for cache updates), `i_wb_ready` (indicates data readiness from memory). The outputs include `o_stall` (indicates processor should wait), `o_read_data` (data output from cache or memory) and `o_wb_req` (memory fetch request signal during cache misses). Internally, the module uses signals such as `c_state` (current state of cache FSM), `source_sel` (selects FSM source state), `tag_rdata_way` (tag data from SRAM), `data_rdata_way` (cache data from SRAM), and `random_num` (used for replacement policy in cache). The code is organized into blocks handling initialization, idle processing, data filling, and response to cache hits or misses, structured around a finite state machine (FSM) managing transitions based on cache conditions. This optimized caching module thus significantly enhances CPU task management and throughput by optimizing instruction fetch times and managing data efficiently through a sophisticated control of read-write operations based on the cache state and external signals.
