    "module": "The a25_fetch module handles instruction fetching for an ARM25 processor, deciding whether to source from cache or main memory. It processes inputs like clock, reset, stall conditions, and instruction addresses, along with cache control signals. Internally, it evaluates address cachability, manages cache and direct memory fetches based on configurable conditions, and utilizes an integrated cache module (a25_icache) to manage cache reads and stalls, ultimately outputting fetched instructions and related control signals to optimize instruction retrieval."
