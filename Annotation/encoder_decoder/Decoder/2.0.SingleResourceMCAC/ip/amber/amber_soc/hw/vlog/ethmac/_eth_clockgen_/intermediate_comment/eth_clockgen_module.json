    "module": "The eth_clockgen module generates a managed Ethernet clock signal (Mdc) from an input clock (Clk) based on a set divider value. It utilizes internal registers and counters to divide the input clock frequency, with Counter tracking decrements from a preset derived via TempDivider to handle division adjustments. Output signals Mdc, MdcEn, and MdcEn_n toggle and provide synchronization edges based on the counter reaching zero. Reset functionality ensures initialization and consistent operation in response to external conditions."
