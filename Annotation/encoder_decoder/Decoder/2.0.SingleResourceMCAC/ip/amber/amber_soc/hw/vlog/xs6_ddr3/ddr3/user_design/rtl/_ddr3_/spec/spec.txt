Module name: ddr3. Module specification: The ddr3 module is a DDR3 memory controller interface that instantiates a memory controller wrapper and infrastructure components for a DDR3 SDRAM interface. It supports multiple command, write, and read ports (p0 to p5) for interfacing with the DDR3 memory. The module has numerous input ports including mcb3_dram_dq (bidirectional data bus), c3_sys_clk (system clock), c3_sys_rst_i (system reset), and command/data interfaces for each port. Output ports include address and control signals for the DDR3 memory, status signals, and data/status for read operations. Internal signals are used for clock management, reset control, and debugging. The module is highly parameterized, allowing configuration of various memory timings, port configurations, and calibration settings. It consists of two main
