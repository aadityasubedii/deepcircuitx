    "module": "The `generic_iobuf` module serves as a bidirectional buffer controlling a single I/O pin, enabling it to function either as an input or an output based on control input. It receives a data input `I` and a control `T`. When `T` is low, `IO` is driven by `I`; when high, `IO` enters a high impedance state. The output `O` mirrors the state of `IO` without additional internal logic, implemented using straightforward continuous assignments."
