    "spec": "Module name: cmd_prbs_gen. \n\nModule specification: The cmd_prbs_gen module is designed to generate pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) determined by a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) mechanism tailored to various configurations such as PRBS width and polynomial taps. The module contains input ports including clk_i, prbs_seed_init, clk_en, and prbs_seed_i. The clk_i is a clock signal that dictates the timing of internal operations, prbs_seed_init initiates the seeding of the LFSR, clk_en is a clock enable signal for controlled operation, and prbs_seed_i carries the initial seed data. The output port, prbs_o, outputs the generated pseudorandom sequence. Internal signals such as ZEROS, a constant zero value; prbs, a register for the PRBS sequence; and lfsr_q, the main LFSR register, facilitate different aspects of the sequence generation. The Verilog code is segmented into various conditional blocks, defined using generate constructs, each corresponding to different PRBS configurations like ADDRESS, INSTR, and BLEN determined by the PRBS_CMD parameter. These configurations facilitate different LFSR feedback mechanisms and PRBS manipulations, adapting the module functionality to specific requirements such as address masking, preferred for FPGA families like SPARTAN6, informed by the FAMILY parameter. The module is configurable, flexible, and suitable for a range of PRBS generation applications, particularly in telecommunications and network systems requiring specific pattern generation for testing and validation purposes.",

It supports multiple configurations and operations based on the `PRBS_CMD` parameter which can change the behavior to generate address patterns or other specific patterns.

                    "text": "Module name: cmd_prbs_gen. \n\nModule specification: The cmd_prbs_gen module is designed to generate pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) determined by a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) mechanism tailored to various configurations such as PRBS width and polynomial taps. The module contains input ports including clk_i, prbs_seed_init, clk_en, and prbs_seed_i. The clk_i is a clock signal that dictates the timing of internal operations, prbs_seed_init initiates the seeding of the LFSR, clk_en is a clock enable signal for controlled operation, and prbs_seed_i carries the initial seed data. The output port, prbs_o, outputs the generated pseudorandom sequence. Internal signals such as ZEROS, a constant zero value; prbs, a register for the PRBS sequence; and lfsr_q, the main LFSR register, facilitate different aspects of the sequence generation. The Verilog code is segmented into various conditional blocks, defined using generate constructs, each corresponding to different PRBS configurations like ADDRESS, INSTR, and BLEN determined by the PRBS_CMD parameter. These configurations facilitate different LFSR feedback mechanisms and PRBS manipulations, adapting the module functionality to specific requirements such as address masking, preferred for FPGA families like SPARTAN6, informed by the FAMILY parameter. The module is configurable, flexible, and suitable for a range of PRBS generation applications, particularly in telecommunications and network systems requiring specific pattern generation for testing and validation purposes."
