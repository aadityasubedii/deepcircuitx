    "spec": "Module name: xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en. \n\nModule specification: The 'xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en' Verilog module encapsulates a dual-port Block RAM (BRAM) with a byte-enable feature for selective byte writing in a 256x32 memory array. It operates with a 32-bit data input (`i_write_data`) which can be written to a specified memory address (`i_address`) contingent on the byte enable signal (`i_byte_enable`). This setup allows specific bytes within the 32-bit word to be updated during write operations. The module is synchronous with a clock `i_clk` used for both reading and writing operations. Internally, the module utilizes several no connect signals (`nc31`, `nc32`, `nc33`, `nc22`) which are not used in any operations, alongside a `wea` signal. The `wea` signal determines which bytes are to be written based on the logic combination of `i_write_enable` and `i_byte_enable`. The memory is instantiated using the `RAMB8BWER` primitive configured for Simple Dual Port (SDP) mode with \"read-first\" operation on both ports. An initial block checks the parameter settings for `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDRESS_WIDTH` and issues warning messages if they are incorrectly configured. The output port `o_read_data` captures the data read from the specified memory address, providing output based on the read operations at the clock edge.",

When high, the data from `i_write_data` is written into the memory at the location specified by `i_address`.\n- `i_address`: An 8-bit address bus specifying the location in the memory where data is to be read from or written to.\n- `i_byte_enable`: A 4-bit input used to control which bytes of the input data bus are written to the memory. Each bit corresponds to one byte of the data bus.\n\nOutput ports: [o_read_data].\nExplanation: \n- `o_read_data`: A 32-bit output data bus that holds the data read from the memory at the location specified by `i_address`.

They are declared as 3-bit wide wires but are not connected to any ports or internal logic within the module.\n- `nc22`: Similar to `nc31`, `nc32`, and `nc33`, this is another no connect signal declared as a 2-bit wide wire which is unused in the module.\n- `wea`: This is a 4-bit wide wire that plays a crucial role in the module. It stands for \"write enable array\" and is used in controlling the byte-wise write operation to the memory. This signal is formed by logically ANDing the `i_write_enable` signal with the `i_byte_enable`. As a result, each bit of `wea` controls the write enable state of a corresponding byte of the data being written to the memory. If a particular bit in `wea` is high, the corresponding byte of `i_write_data` is written into the BRAM."
