    "module": "The tg_status module monitors and logs discrepancies between expected and actual read data in real-time. It initiates error detection on rising edges of the `data_error_i` signal, captures relevant error data, and sets an error flag, maintaining error state until reset or manually cleared. Key input signals comprise data values, addresses, and memory state indicators, facilitating comprehensive error analysis and reporting through the `error_status` output register."
