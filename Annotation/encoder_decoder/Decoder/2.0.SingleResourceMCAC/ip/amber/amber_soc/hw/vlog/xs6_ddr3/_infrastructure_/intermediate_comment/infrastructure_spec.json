    "spec": "Module name: infrastructure.\nModule specification: The \"infrastructure\" module is a Verilog implementation for clock management and reset control in FPGA systems, primarily handling clock synchronization, generation, and reset functionalities. The module takes the differential inputs (`sys_clk_p` and `sys_clk_n`) or a single-ended input (`sys_clk`) along with a system reset input (`sys_rst_i`) and produces various clock frequencies and phases, and synchronized reset outputs. The output ports include `clk0` (primary clock output), `rst0` (reset synchronized to `clk0`), `async_rst` (an asynchronous reset), multiple frequency and phase shifted clocks (`sysclk_2x`, `sysclk_2x_180`), a memory controller block clock (`mcb_drp_clk`), phase shift clock enable outputs (`pll_ce_0`, `pll_ce_90`), and a `pll_lock` signifying PLL lock status. Internal signals like `clk_2x_0`, `clk_2x_180`, `clk0_bufg`, and `locked` serve purposes from holding PLL-generated varied phase or frequency clocks to indicating PLL lock status. The code is structured in several sections: differential or single-ended clock input setup via conditional generate blocks, PLL instantiation for frequency synthesis and clock outputs, synchronization mechanisms for PLL lock status, and finally, a series of buffer and phase adjustments to align and distribute generated clocks. Each block and signal is strategically implemented to ensure the module's stable and efficient operation in managing system clocks and resets suitable for intricate FPGA-based applications.",

They are crucial for situations requiring noise immunity and precise clocking.\n- `sys_clk`: This is the single-ended clock input used when the input clock type is specified as single-ended.

                    "text": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: \n- `clk_2x_0`, `clk_2x_180`, `clk0_bufg`, `clk0_bufg_in`, `mcb_drp_clk_bufg_in`, `clkfbout_clkfbin`, `locked`, `rst0_sync_r`, `rst_tmp`, `powerup_pll_locked`, `syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked`, `sys_rst`, `bufpll_mcb_locked`.\n\nExplanation:\n- `clk_2x_0`: This signal receives the direct output from the PLL and serves as one of the higher frequency clocks.\n- `clk_2x_180`: Similar to `clk_2x_0`, this output from the PLL is phase shifted by 180 degrees. It is used in situations requiring phase-shifted clock signals.\n- `clk0_bufg`: This is the global buffered version of `clk0_bufg_in` used as the clk0 output, ensuring a stable and strong clock signal drive across the FPGA.\n- `clk0_bufg_in`: The direct output from the PLL used to feed `clk0_bufg` after going through a global buffer, thus creating the primary clock output `clk0`.\n- `mcb_drp_clk_bufg_in`: This is the direct PLL output used to generate the `mcb_drp_clk`, specially used for memory control interfacing after being buffered.\n- `clkfbout_clkfbin`: This is the feedback path for the PLL, connecting the output back to the input to maintain stability and regulation of the PLL\u2019s frequency synthesis.\n- `locked`: This signal indicates when the PLL has achieved a stable lock condition; it is critical for enabled signaling and controlled buffering.\n- `rst0_sync_r`: A shift register that delays the assertion of the reset signal `rst0`, ensuring it is synchronized with the clk0 output.\n- `rst_tmp`: Temporary reset signal combined state of system reset and the synchronized PLL lock condition; used for generating `rst0`.\n- `powerup_pll_locked`: This signal indicates the locked condition of the PLL during power-up, ensuring the system does not start operations until the PLL is stable.\n- `syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked`: Similar to `powerup_pll_locked`, but specifically synchronized to `clk0_bufg`, making sure `clk0` related operations await the PLL's stable lock.\n- `sys_rst`: This is the system reset signal, possibly inverted based on the configuration parameter `C_RST_ACT_LOW`, which is used throughout the module to control reset conditions.\n- `bufpll_mcb_locked`: Represents the locked status of the BUFPLL (buffered PLL) specifically used for controlling MCB and related high-speed interfaces.\n\nThese internal signals are instrumental in handling the various aspects of clock and reset management within the module, ensuring reliable and controlled operation of the clocks and resets based on the PLL\u2019s functioning and system requirements."

The module takes the differential inputs (`sys_clk_p` and `sys_clk_n`) or a single-ended input (`sys_clk`) along with a system reset input (`sys_rst_i`) and produces various clock frequencies and phases, and synchronized reset outputs. The output ports include `clk0` (primary clock output), `rst0` (reset synchronized to `clk0`), `async_rst` (an asynchronous reset), multiple frequency and phase shifted clocks (`sysclk_2x`, `sysclk_2x_180`), a memory controller block clock (`mcb_drp_clk`), phase shift clock enable outputs (`pll_ce_0`, `pll_ce_90`), and a `pll_lock` signifying PLL lock status. Internal signals like `clk_2x_0`, `clk_2x_180`, `clk0_bufg`, and `locked` serve purposes from holding PLL-generated varied phase or frequency clocks to indicating PLL lock status. The code is structured in several sections: differential or single-ended clock input setup via conditional generate blocks, PLL instantiation for frequency synthesis and clock outputs, synchronization mechanisms for PLL lock status, and finally, a series of buffer and phase adjustments to align and distribute generated clocks. Each block and signal is strategically implemented to ensure the module's stable and efficient operation in managing system clocks and resets suitable for intricate FPGA-based applications."
