It supports handling read and write requests from these ports, managing data, address, and control signals. The module arbitrates between the ports based on their request and acknowledgment signals, ensuring that one port has access to the bus at a time. It uses buffers for each port to store the transaction data and controls the Wishbone bus signals (`o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_cyc`, `o_wb_stb`) based on the active request being processed. Additionally, it manages the response back to the port depending on the status of the transactions (acknowledgment or error)."
