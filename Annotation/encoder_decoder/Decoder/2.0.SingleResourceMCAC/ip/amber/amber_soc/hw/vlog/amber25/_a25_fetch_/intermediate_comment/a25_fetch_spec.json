    "spec": "Module name: a25_fetch. \nModule specification: The \"a25_fetch\" module is crucial for the ARM25 processor, tasked with fetching instructions from cache or main memory. It processes various inputs such as the system clock (`i_clk`), reset signal (`i_reset`), memory stall signals (`i_mem_stall`, `i_exec_stall`, `i_conflict`), and the system readiness signal (`i_system_rdy`). The current, valid, and next instruction addresses are provided through `i_iaddress`, `i_iaddress_valid`, and `i_iaddress_nxt` respectively, along with cache configuration signals (`i_cache_enable`, `i_cache_flush`, and `i_cacheable_area`). Data from the write-back bus comes through `i_wb_read_data` and its readiness is signaled by `i_wb_ready`. The module outputs the fetched instruction via `o_fetch_instruction`, a stall signal for the fetch stage (`o_fetch_stall`), and controls for the write-back memory interface (`o_wb_req`, `o_wb_address`). Internally, the module uses signals like `core_stall`, `cache_stall`, and `icache_wb_req` to handle cache operations, determine cache access (`sel_cache`), handle direct memory fetch (`uncached_instruction_read`), and manage write-back requests and data routing (`wait_wb`, `wb_req_r`, `wb_rdata32`). The module integrates a cache module (`a25_icache`) for cache-related actions, determining if an address is cacheable, deciding when to fetch from cache or memory, and managing stalls related to cache activities and system readiness. This structured design facilitates efficient instruction retrieval required for processor execution, optimally using caching strategies to balance speed and resource usage.",

                    "text": "Module name: a25_fetch. \nModule specification: The \"a25_fetch\" module is crucial for the ARM25 processor, tasked with fetching instructions from cache or main memory. It processes various inputs such as the system clock (`i_clk`), reset signal (`i_reset`), memory stall signals (`i_mem_stall`, `i_exec_stall`, `i_conflict`), and the system readiness signal (`i_system_rdy`). The current, valid, and next instruction addresses are provided through `i_iaddress`, `i_iaddress_valid`, and `i_iaddress_nxt` respectively, along with cache configuration signals (`i_cache_enable`, `i_cache_flush`, and `i_cacheable_area`). Data from the write-back bus comes through `i_wb_read_data` and its readiness is signaled by `i_wb_ready`. The module outputs the fetched instruction via `o_fetch_instruction`, a stall signal for the fetch stage (`o_fetch_stall`), and controls for the write-back memory interface (`o_wb_req`, `o_wb_address`). Internally, the module uses signals like `core_stall`, `cache_stall`, and `icache_wb_req` to handle cache operations, determine cache access (`sel_cache`), handle direct memory fetch (`uncached_instruction_read`), and manage write-back requests and data routing (`wait_wb`, `wb_req_r`, `wb_rdata32`). The module integrates a cache module (`a25_icache`) for cache-related actions, determining if an address is cacheable, deciding when to fetch from cache or memory, and managing stalls related to cache activities and system readiness. This structured design facilitates efficient instruction retrieval required for processor execution, optimally using caching strategies to balance speed and resource usage."
