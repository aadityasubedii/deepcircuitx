Module name: sp6_data_gen. Module specification: The sp6_data_gen module is designed to generate various data patterns for memory interface testing. It accepts control inputs to select different generating modes such as fixed data, address patterns, pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS), and specific patterns like walking ones/zeros and hammer patterns across 32, 64, and 128-bit widths. The module has input ports for clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), PRBS seed (prbs_fseed_i), data mode selection (data_mode_i), data ready signal (data_rdy_i), command start signals (cmd_startA to cmd_startE), fixed data input (fixed_data_i), address input (addr_i), burst count (user_burst_cnt), and FIFO ready signal (fifo_rdy_i). The output port (data_
