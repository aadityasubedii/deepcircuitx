It uses the divider value to determine the frequency of the Mdc signal by counting down from a preset value. When the counter reaches zero, the Mdc signal toggles its state. Additionally, this module generates enable signals (MdcEn and MdcEn_n) that indicate the active edge of the Mdc signal for further synchronous operations. If a reset (Reset) is triggered, the counter and Mdc are reset to their initial states."

It is used to drive the counters and the toggling of the Mdc signal.\n- Reset: A synchronous reset input that initializes the Counter and the Mdc signal when asserted.\n- Divider: An 8-bit value that sets the division factor for the Mdc clock generation. This value directly influences the frequency of the Mdc output by setting the maximum count for the counter.\n\nOutput ports: Mdc, MdcEn, MdcEn_n.\nExplanation:\n- Mdc: The output clock signal generated by the module, which is a divided version of the input clock based on the Divider value. It toggles its state when the counter reaches zero.\n- MdcEn: An enable signal that is high when the Mdc output is on the falling edge, indicating an active edge for synchronization purposes.\n- MdcEn_n: An enable signal that is high when the Mdc output is on the rising edge, also used for synchronization but indicating the opposite edge compared to MdcEn."

It is used to control the toggling of the Mdc signal and the generation of the MdcEn and MdcEn_n signals.\n- CounterPreset: A wire deriving its value from the Divider after adjusting for minimum and shift operations. It sets the initial value from which the Counter starts counting down.\n- TempDivider: A wire that holds a modified version of the Divider input to ensure it never sets a divide factor less than 2.
