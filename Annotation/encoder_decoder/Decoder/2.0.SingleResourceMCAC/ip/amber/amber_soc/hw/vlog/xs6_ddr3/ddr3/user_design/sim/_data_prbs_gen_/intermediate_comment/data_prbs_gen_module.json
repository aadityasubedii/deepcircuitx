    "module": "The data_prbs_gen module generates a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) based on provided seed values and a reset mechanism. It leverages an always block triggered by a clock input to update the LFSR conditionally based on initialization and clock enable signals, with outputs assigned through another always block and a direct assignment statement for reliable PRBS output management."
