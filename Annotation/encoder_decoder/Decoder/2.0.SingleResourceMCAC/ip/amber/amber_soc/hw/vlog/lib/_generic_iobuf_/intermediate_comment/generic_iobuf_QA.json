It has an input `I`, an output `O`, and an inout pin `IO`. The state of the `IO` pin is controlled by another input `T`; if `T` is high (1), `IO` is set to a high impedance state (`z`), and if `T` is low (0), `IO` directly drives the value of input `I`. The output `O` mirrors the current state of the `IO` pin. This module is commonly used in designs where a pin can either act as an input or an output based on a control signal."
