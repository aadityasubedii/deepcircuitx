It supports features such as resetting and incrementing counters based on the state of frame reception (e.g., idle, preamble, SFD, data, drop states), adjusting byte counts for delay CRC, and ensuring correct frame lengths and inter-frame gaps. This module plays a critical role in ensuring data integrity and proper timing between received Ethernet frames."

It is triggered under conditions such as when data is valid during StateSFD and equals MRxDEqD, or during specific data states when the byte count equals the maximum frame size.\n- **IncrementByteCounter**: This signal controls when to increment the byte counter. It increments unless it's being reset, and during states where data is valid such as during the preamble, Start of Frame Delimiter, or idle state (when not transmitting). It also checks not to increment beyond maximum byte count and avoids increment during the enabled Delay CRC condition if the Delay CRC counter is non-zero.\n- **ResetIFGCounter**: Controls the reset of the Interframe Gap (IFG) counter. It resets the IFG counter when new frame detection starts (StateSFD) combined with valid data and equalized data conditions, or when the drop state is active.\n- **IncrementIFGCounter**: Manages the incrementing of the IFG counter. This occurs when the IFG counter is not being reset and during conditions like drop state, idle state, or during the preamble or Start of Frame Delimiter, as long as the IFGCounter hasn't reached 24.\n- **ByteCntMax**: A boolean signal that checks if the byte counter has reached its maximum count (all bits high).\n- **ByteCntDelayed**: Represents a delayed version of the byte count, incremented by four.
