    "spec": "Module name: eth_txcounters.\nModule specification: The 'eth_txcounters' module is integral to an Ethernet transmission system, primarily tasked with managing various counting operations during packet transmission. It features multiple input ports like MTxClk (module clock), Reset (resets the counters), various state signals (e.g., StatePreamble, StateIPG) that define the current stage of transmission, Start signals (e.g., StartDefer, StartIPG) that initiate counting, MinFL/MaxFL for frame size limits, and control signals like HugEn (enable huge frames) and ExDfrEn (manage excessive defer conditions). The output ports include ByteCnt (tracks bytes transmitted), NibCnt (tracks nibbles transmitted), and flags like ExcessiveDefer and MaxFrame which indicate specific conditions in the transmission. Internal signals such as ResetNibCnt and IncrementByteCnt are employed to manage the operational logic of counting based on incoming signals and conditions. The code is structured in blocks, each generally associated with detecting, managing, and resetting counts appropriately based on transitions in transmission state and control inputs. These include nibble count increments conditioned on active transmission states, byte count adjustments based on data phase and packet completion, and special counting for conditions like excessive defer and delayed CRC operations. This comprehensive setup allows the module to accurately track and manage data flow during Ethernet packet transmission, adapting dynamically to changing conditions and requirements.",

It compares the current nibble count (lower 14 bits) to a predefined threshold value (`16'h17b7`), which determines if the defer condition has been overly prolonged.\n- **ResetNibCnt**: This signal determines when to reset the nibble counter. It is set when specific conditions are met, such as entering a defer state with an excessive defer, the preamble state when the nibble count equals 15, the jam state when the nibble count equals 7, transitioning to the idle state, or starting new counts for defer, IPG, FCS, or jam states.\n- **IncrementNibCnt**: This signal controls when to increment the nibble counter. It is asserted when the module is in any state of IPG, preamble, different data phases, PAD, FCS, jam, backoff, or defer states (except during excessive defers), and transmission of a frame has started. \n- **ResetByteCnt**: This signal controls when the byte counter should be reset. It is asserted when specific conditions are met such as starting a backoff process, entering the idle state while a frame transmission has just begun, or when a packet completion signal is received.\n- **IncrementByteCnt**: This signal dictates when to increment the byte counter.

It features multiple input ports like MTxClk (module clock), Reset (resets the counters), various state signals (e.g., StatePreamble, StateIPG) that define the current stage of transmission, Start signals (e.g., StartDefer, StartIPG) that initiate counting, MinFL/MaxFL for frame size limits, and control signals like HugEn (enable huge frames) and ExDfrEn (manage excessive defer conditions). The output ports include ByteCnt (tracks bytes transmitted), NibCnt (tracks nibbles transmitted), and flags like ExcessiveDefer and MaxFrame which indicate specific conditions in the transmission. Internal signals such as ResetNibCnt and IncrementByteCnt are employed to manage the operational logic of counting based on incoming signals and conditions. The code is structured in blocks, each generally associated with detecting, managing, and resetting counts appropriately based on transitions in transmission state and control inputs. These include nibble count increments conditioned on active transmission states, byte count adjustments based on data phase and packet completion, and special counting for conditions like excessive defer and delayed CRC operations. This comprehensive setup allows the module to accurately track and manage data flow during Ethernet packet transmission, adapting dynamically to changing conditions and requirements."
