    "spec": "Module name: eth_spram_256x32. \nModule specification: The eth_spram_256x32 is a single-port RAM module designed for Verilog environments, specifically tailored for FPGA implementations. It features a memory size of 256 words, each 32 bits wide, and is operated by a rising-edge sensitive clock signal. Interface signals include `clk` (clock input), `rst` (reset input), `ce` (chip enable input), `we` (4-bit write enable input for byte-wise write operations), `oe` (output enable input), `addr` (8-bit address input), `di` (32-bit data input bus), and `do` (32-bit data output bus). The inputs facilitate reading from and writing to the RAM, while the outputs deliver data stored at specified addresses. Internally, the module uses a `write_enable` signal, which acts as a control for write operations, conditioned by chip enable and at least one active write enable bit. The module structure includes conditional compilation blocks catering to different FPGA families such as Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6 or a generic block for other types. These blocks instantiate specific single-port RAM components with configurations stated for byte enable operation, connecting the inputs and outputs through the instantiated SRAM block, which effectively handles data reads and writes as commanded by the inputs and internal `write_enable` logic. The clear, structured design ensures adaptability to various FPGA platforms while maintaining efficient data handling and storage operations.\n",

It interfaces with external logic via a clock signal (`clk`), a reset signal (`rst`), chip enable (`ce`), write enable bits (`we`), output enable (`oe`), a 8-bit address bus (`addr`), a 32-bit input data bus (`di`), and a 32-bit output data bus (`do`). The RAM allows byte-wise write operations indicated by the write enable bits, and the chip enable signal must be active for write operations. The module also incorporates conditionally compiled blocks for different FPGA families like Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6, as well as a generic option for other cases, which instantiate specific or generic SRAM components with byte enable functionality.

It is used to synchronize the operations of the RAM module such as reading and writing data.\n- `rst`: Reset signal input. This signal is used to reset the internal state of the RAM module or initialize it.\n- `ce`: Chip enable input. This signal must be active (usually high) for the RAM to respond to other control signals and perform read/write operations.\n- `we`: Write enable bits input. It is a 4-bit input where each bit corresponds to enabling the write operation for each byte of the 32-bit data bus. This allows byte-wise writing.\n- `oe`: Output enable input. It enables the output from the RAM module when active.\n- `addr`: Address bus input. It is an 8-bit input that specifies the address of the memory location to be accessed (read or write).\n- `di`: Data input bus. It is a 32-bit bus used to input data into the RAM module that needs to be written into the specified memory location.\n\nOutput ports: do.\nExplanation:\n- `do`: Data output bus.

The `write_enable` signal ensures that a write operation is only performed when the chip is enabled and at least one byte-enable bit is active.
