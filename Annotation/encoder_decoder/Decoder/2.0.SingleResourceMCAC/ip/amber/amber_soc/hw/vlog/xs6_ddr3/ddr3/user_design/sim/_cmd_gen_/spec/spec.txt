Module name: cmd_gen. Module specification: The cmd_gen module is a command generator for memory interfaces, designed to generate read, write, and refresh commands with various addressing modes (fixed, sequential, PRBS) and burst lengths. It supports different FPGA families (Spartan-6 and Virtex-6) and can be configured for different data widths and burst lengths. The module takes inputs such as clk_i (system clock), rst_i (reset), run_traffic_i (enable signal), and various configuration signals for address modes, data modes, and burst lengths. It outputs addr_o (generated address), instr_o (instruction), bl_o (burst length), and cmd_o_vld (command valid signal). Internally, it uses signals like addr_counts (address counter), prbs_addr (PRBS-generated address), and instr_out (output instruction) to manage
