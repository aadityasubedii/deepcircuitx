    "spec": "Module name: write_data_path. Module specification: The `write_data_path` module is designed for writing data to a memory interface, with capabilities to control various command validation, address information, and data flow management during write operations. It integrates a submodule `wr_data_gen` for generating data with specific patterns and configurations based on a PRBS (Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence) generator. The input ports include `clk_i` (clock input), `rst_i` (reset input), several command validation inputs (`cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_validB_i`, `cmd_validC_i`), a PRBS seed input (`prbs_fseed_i`), data mode selection (`data_mode_i`), fixed data input (`fixed_data_i`), memory address input (`addr_i`), burst length (`bl_i`), and data readiness signal (`data_rdy_i`). The output ports include `cmd_rdy_o` (command ready signal), `data_valid_o` (data valid signal), `last_word_wr_o` (indicates last word in write operation), data outputs (`data_o`), data mask (`data_mask_o`), and data write end signal (`data_wr_end_o`). Internally, the module uses a wire `data_valid` to manage the activation of `data_valid_o`, and a register `cmd_rdy` that holds the command ready state mapped to `cmd_rdy_o`. Major functional sections in the Verilog code include parameter definition for configurable settings, input/output declarations, assignment of internal signals and data validity computation, and instantiation of the `wr_data_gen` block which handles most operational logic including pattern generation and data control based on the input commands and configurations. This structured approach ensures effective data handling for memory write operations within specific operational settings and command sequences.",

Module specification: The `write_data_path` module is designed for writing data to a memory interface, with capabilities to control various command validation, address information, and data flow management during write operations. It integrates a submodule `wr_data_gen` for generating data with specific patterns and configurations based on a PRBS (Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence) generator. The input ports include `clk_i` (clock input), `rst_i` (reset input), several command validation inputs (`cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_validB_i`, `cmd_validC_i`), a PRBS seed input (`prbs_fseed_i`), data mode selection (`data_mode_i`), fixed data input (`fixed_data_i`), memory address input (`addr_i`), burst length (`bl_i`), and data readiness signal (`data_rdy_i`). The output ports include `cmd_rdy_o` (command ready signal), `data_valid_o` (data valid signal), `last_word_wr_o` (indicates last word in write operation), data outputs (`data_o`), data mask (`data_mask_o`), and data write end signal (`data_wr_end_o`). Internally, the module uses a wire `data_valid` to manage the activation of `data_valid_o`, and a register `cmd_rdy` that holds the command ready state mapped to `cmd_rdy_o`. Major functional sections in the Verilog code include parameter definition for configurable settings, input/output declarations, assignment of internal signals and data validity computation, and instantiation of the `wr_data_gen` block which handles most operational logic including pattern generation and data control based on the input commands and configurations. This structured approach ensures effective data handling for memory write operations within specific operational settings and command sequences."
