    "spec": "Module name: write_data_path.\nModule specification: The 'write_data_path' module is designed primarily for managing the data writing process in memory systems, adaptable through various parameterized settings to fit different hardware configurations. This module handles incoming commands and data for writing operations using inputs like a clock signal (`clk_i`), multiple reset signals (`rst_i`), command validity signals (`cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_validB_i`, `cmd_validC_i`), a seed for a pseudo-random binary sequence generator (`prbs_fseed_i`), data mode selection (`data_mode_i`), fixed data for constant patterns (`fixed_data_i`), memory address (`addr_i`), burst length (`bl_i`), and a data ready signal (`data_rdy_i`). The outputs include a command ready signal (`cmd_rdy_o`), data validity (`data_valid_o`), last word write (`last_word_wr_o`), the actual data to be written (`data_o`), a data mask, which is statically set to zero (`data_mask_o`), and a signal denoting the end of data writing (`data_wr_end_o`). Internally, the module uses two primary signals: `data_valid`, which is generated by the 'wr_data_gen' submodule to indicate if the outputted data is valid, and `cmd_rdy`, a register-based signal indicating the readiness of the module to receive new commands. The module instantiates a submodule 'wr_data_gen' that is crucial for generating the required data outputs based on input commands and specified data patterns. This submodule setup provides dynamic capabilities necessary for complex operations like writing to memory systems, tuned through parameters like data width, burst length, and data patterns under different conditions determined by input commands and system readiness.",
