Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module implements a soft calibration process for a memory controller block (MCB), performing input termination calibration, broadcast of termination values, and dynamic calibration of DQS signals. It uses a state machine to control the calibration process, adjusting P-term and N-term values, and DQS delays. The module has input ports for clocks (UI_CLK), reset (RST), PLL lock (PLL_LOCK), self-refresh control (SELFREFRESH_REQ, SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE), and various MCB signals. Output ports include calibration status (DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL), self-refresh control (SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ, SELFREFRESH_MODE), and numerous MCB control signals for calibration. Internal signals include state variables (STATE),
