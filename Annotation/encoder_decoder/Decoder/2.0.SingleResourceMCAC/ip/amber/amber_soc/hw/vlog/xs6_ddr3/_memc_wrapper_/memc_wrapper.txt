This module implements a memory controller wrapper, providing an interface between a system and external DDR3 memory. It supports multiple ports for command, read, and write operations, as well as AXI interfaces for higher-level integration. The module instantiates an mcb_ui_top component to handle memory operations, timing, and calibration. It manages clock signals, resets, and various memory interface signals, while also providing status information and supporting features like self-refresh mode and dynamic calibration.
