Module name: eth_top. Module specification: The eth_top module is the top-level module for an Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) implementation. It integrates various sub-modules to handle Ethernet frame transmission and reception, MAC control operations, MIIM (Management Interface) functionality, and Wishbone bus interfacing. The module has input ports for clocks, resets, Wishbone bus inputs, MAC transmit and receive signals, and MIIM data; output ports for Wishbone bus outputs, MAC transmit signals, and interrupt. Internal signals include control registers, status flags, and data flow signals. The module is composed of several key blocks: eth_registers for configuration and status registers, eth_rxethmac and eth_txethmac for receive and transmit operations, eth_maccontrol for flow control and pause frame handling, eth_miim for PHY management, eth_wishbone for DMA an
