    "module": "The `iodrp_controller` manages a Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) for FPGA-based memory operations, handling both read and write functions determined by control signals. It utilizes a combination of input data and control lines to efficiently manage DRP communication through internal registers and a finite state machine, directing data flow, managing operational states from idle to data transmission, and handling synchronous resets, all synchronized by a dedicated clock input."
