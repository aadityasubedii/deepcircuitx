    "module": "The eth_random module generates a 10-bit pseudo-random number based on a linear feedback shift register (LFSR), conditioned by the retry count (`RetryCnt`) which masks bits of the output. The module uses `MTxClk` for clocking, with asynchronous reset capability (`Reset`). Outputs are determined based on the latched random number's comparison to zero and `ByteCnt`, with latching triggered under specific conditions (`StateJam` and `StateJam_q`). This ensures dynamic, context-sensitive random number generation suitable for managing retry logic in network communications."
