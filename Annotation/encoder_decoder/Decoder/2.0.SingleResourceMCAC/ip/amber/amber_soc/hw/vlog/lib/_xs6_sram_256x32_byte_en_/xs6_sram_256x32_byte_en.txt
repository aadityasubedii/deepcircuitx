The xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en module implements a dual-port, byte-enabled 256x32 SRAM using a Block RAM (BRAM) that allows selective byte updating during write operations. Utilizing input signals for data, address, write control, and byte selection, the module couples these with internal logic to manage data access and modify specific bytes in memory based on the 'wea' control signal, derived from write enable and byte enable inputs. The RAMB8BWER primitive is exercised in Simple Dual Port (SDP) mode with read-first behavior to enforce memory integrity during read and write operations. Initial parameter checks ensure proper configuration setup.
