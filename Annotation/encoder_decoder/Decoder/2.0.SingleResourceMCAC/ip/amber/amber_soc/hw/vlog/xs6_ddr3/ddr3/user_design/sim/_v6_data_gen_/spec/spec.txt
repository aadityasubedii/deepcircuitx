Module name: v6_data_gen. Module specification: The v6_data_gen module is a configurable data generation unit designed for memory testing and simulation purposes. It supports various data patterns including PRBS (Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence), address-based patterns, walking 1's/0's patterns, and neighbor patterns. The module takes inputs such as clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), PRBS seed (prbs_fseed_i), data mode (data_mode_i), address (addr_i), and control signals (cmd_startA-E). It outputs generated data (data_o) based on the selected mode and input signals. Internally, the module uses signals like prbs_data, acounts, adata, hdata, ndata, w1data, and w0data to generate and manipulate different data patterns. The module is divided into several blocks, including
