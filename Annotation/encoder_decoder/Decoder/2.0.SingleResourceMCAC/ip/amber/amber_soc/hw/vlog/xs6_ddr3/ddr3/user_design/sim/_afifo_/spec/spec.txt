Module name: afifo. 
Module specification: The module `afifo` is an asynchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer designed to facilitate data transfer between different clock domains using `wr_clk` for write operations and `rd_clk` for read operations. It features input ports such as `wr_clk` (write clock), `rst` (reset), `wr_en` (write enable), `wr_data` (write data), `rd_en` (read enable), and `rd_clk` (read clock). The outputs include `rd_data` (read data), `full` (indicates the FIFO is full), `empty` (indicates the FIFO is empty), and `almost_full` (an early indicator that the FIFO is nearing full capacity). Internally, the module utilizes signals like memory array `mem` for data storage, `rd_gray` and `wr_gray` for current gray code values of read and write pointers, `rd_ptr` and `wr_ptr` to track read and write positions, and other synchronizing and pointer management signals like `rd_capture_ptr` and `wr_capture_ptr`. The code is sectioned into blocks handled by `generate` constructs for synchronization, and always blocks for managing read and write operations, pointer computations in gray code, and buffer flags adjustments based on the FIFOâ€™s state. This modular approach in design ensures robust data handling and synchronization across asynchronous clock domains, enhancing the reliability and performance of data transfers in multi-clock domain systems.
