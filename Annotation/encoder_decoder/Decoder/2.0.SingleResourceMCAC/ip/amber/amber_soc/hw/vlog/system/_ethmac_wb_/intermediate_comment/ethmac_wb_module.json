    "module": "The ethmac_wb module facilitates communication between a master and a slave device in an Ethernet MAC system using the Wishbone protocol, supporting variable data widths (32-bit or 128-bit) as determined by the WB_DWIDTH parameter. It implements signal interfaces for both reading and writing data, including address, data, selection, and control signals, with specialized handling for endianness conversion and data segmentation based on operational mode. Internal logic uses generate blocks to selectively configure the signal processing for either 32-bit or 128-bit width, ensuring protocol compliance and flexible interfacing depending on system configuration."
