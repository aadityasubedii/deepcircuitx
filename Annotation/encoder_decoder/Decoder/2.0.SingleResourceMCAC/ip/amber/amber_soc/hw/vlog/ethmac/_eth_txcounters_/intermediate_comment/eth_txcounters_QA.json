It handles nibble (half-byte) and byte counting during packet transmission stages such as preamble, inter-packet gap (IPG), data, padding (PAD), frame check sequence (FCS), jam signaling, backoff, and defer states. The module increments or resets these counters based on the state transitions and specific conditions met during the Ethernet packet's lifecycle. Also, it tracks excessive defer conditions, calculates minimum frame length conditions, handles delayed CRC operations, and determines maximum frame lengths without enabling huge frame support."

It compares the current nibble count (lower 14 bits) to a predefined threshold value (`16'h17b7`), which determines if the defer condition has been overly prolonged.\n- **ResetNibCnt**: This signal determines when to reset the nibble counter. It is set when specific conditions are met, such as entering a defer state with an excessive defer, the preamble state when the nibble count equals 15, the jam state when the nibble count equals 7, transitioning to the idle state, or starting new counts for defer, IPG, FCS, or jam states.\n- **IncrementNibCnt**: This signal controls when to increment the nibble counter. It is asserted when the module is in any state of IPG, preamble, different data phases, PAD, FCS, jam, backoff, or defer states (except during excessive defers), and transmission of a frame has started. \n- **ResetByteCnt**: This signal controls when the byte counter should be reset. It is asserted when specific conditions are met such as starting a backoff process, entering the idle state while a frame transmission has just begun, or when a packet completion signal is received.\n- **IncrementByteCnt**: This signal dictates when to increment the byte counter. It is asserted when the second bit of the StateData is high with byte count not being maximal, during state backoff when all bits of the nibble count are set, and during PAD or FCS states when the least significant bit of the nibble count is set, under the condition that the byte count has not reached its maximum.\n- **ByteCntMax**: This signal checks if the byte counter has reached its maximum capacity by evaluating if all bits of the byte counter are set, indicating an overflow or maximum state."
