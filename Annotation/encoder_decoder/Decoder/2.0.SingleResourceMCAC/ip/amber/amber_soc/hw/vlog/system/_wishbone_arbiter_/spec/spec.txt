Module name: wishbone_arbiter.  
Module specification:
The `wishbone_arbiter` is a Verilog module designed to handle arbitration between two masters and eight slaves in a Wishbone bus system, used primarily in embedded systems. This module manages and arbitrates access to a shared bus, ensuring simultaneous requests are handled according to a predefined set of rules, managing bus requests, and ensuring data integrity during transmissions. The inputs to the module include a clock signal (`i_wb_clk`), address, select, write enable, data, cycle, and strobe signals from two masters (`i_m0_*` and `i_m1_*`), and data, acknowledge, and error signals from eight slaves (`i_s0_*` to `i_s7_*`). The outputs include data, acknowledge, and error signals to the two masters (`o_m0_*` and `o_m1_*`), and address, select, write enable, data, cycle, and strobe signals to the eight slaves (`o_s0_*` to `o_s7_*`). Internally, the module utilizes registers (`m0_wb_hold_r`, `m1_wb_hold_r`, and `current_master_r`) and wires (`current_master`, `next_master`, `select_master`, `current_slave`, `master_adr`, `master_sel`, `master_we`, `master_wdat`, `master_cyc`, `master_stb`, `master_rdat`, `master_ack`, and `master_err`) to track the state and control the logic flow, deciding which master can access which slave at any time. The code is organized into blocks handling master selection based on ongoing transactions, master-to-slave signal routing, and slave feedback to the appropriate master. Overall, this module efficiently directs traffic on a Wishbone bus, handling concurrency and conflict resolution to maintain stable and reliable system operations.
