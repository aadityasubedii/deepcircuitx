This module implements a System-on-Chip (SoC) design integrating a processor core, memory controllers, and peripherals. It utilizes a Wishbone bus architecture with an arbiter to manage communication between components. The design incorporates clock generation, reset management, and interfaces for DDR3 memory, Ethernet, UART, and LEDs. The module orchestrates data flow between the processor, memory, and peripherals, supporting both 32-bit and 128-bit Wishbone data widths and configurable for different FPGA platforms.
