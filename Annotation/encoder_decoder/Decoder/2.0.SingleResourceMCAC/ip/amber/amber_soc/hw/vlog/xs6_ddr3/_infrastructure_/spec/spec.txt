Module name: infrastructure.
Module specification: The "infrastructure" module is a Verilog implementation for clock management and reset control in FPGA systems, primarily handling clock synchronization, generation, and reset functionalities. The module takes the differential inputs (`sys_clk_p` and `sys_clk_n`) or a single-ended input (`sys_clk`) along with a system reset input (`sys_rst_i`) and produces various clock frequencies and phases, and synchronized reset outputs. The output ports include `clk0` (primary clock output), `rst0` (reset synchronized to `clk0`), `async_rst` (an asynchronous reset), multiple frequency and phase shifted clocks (`sysclk_2x`, `sysclk_2x_180`), a memory controller block clock (`mcb_drp_clk`), phase shift clock enable outputs (`pll_ce_0`, `pll_ce_90`), and a `pll_lock` signifying PLL lock status. Internal signals like `clk_2x_0`, `clk_2x_180`, `clk0_bufg`, and `locked` serve purposes from holding PLL-generated varied phase or frequency clocks to indicating PLL lock status. The code is structured in several sections: differential or single-ended clock input setup via conditional generate blocks, PLL instantiation for frequency synthesis and clock outputs, synchronization mechanisms for PLL lock status, and finally, a series of buffer and phase adjustments to align and distribute generated clocks. Each block and signal is strategically implemented to ensure the module's stable and efficient operation in managing system clocks and resets suitable for intricate FPGA-based applications.
