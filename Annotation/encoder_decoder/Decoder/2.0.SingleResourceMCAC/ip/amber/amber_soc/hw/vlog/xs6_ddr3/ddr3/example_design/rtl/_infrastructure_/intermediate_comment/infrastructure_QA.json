It utilizes various configurable parameters to handle different types of input clocks (differential or single-ended) and generates multiple output clocks with specified frequencies, phases, and duty cycles by leveraging a PLL (Phase Locked Loop). The module also includes synchronization logic to handle reset conditions and ensures that the output clocks are stable and available only when the PLL is locked, thereby improving the reliability of the system's operation under various reset and power-up conditions."

The differential clock provides better noise immunity compared to single-ended clocks.\n- sys_clk: This is the single-ended clock input used by the module when the input clock type is configured as \"SINGLE_ENDED\". This configuration simplifies the clocking infrastructure but might be more susceptible to noise.\n- sys_rst_i: This is the system reset input, which is used to reset the internal logic and synchronize the PLL when asserted. The reset input can be configured as active high or active low based on the parameter C_RST_ACT_LOW.\n\nOutput ports: clk0, rst0, async_rst, sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, mcb_drp_clk, pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, pll_lock.\nExplanation:\n- clk0: A buffered output clock derived from the PLL, which can be utilized by other modules or components in the system.\n- rst0: Final reset output which is synchronized to the clk0 signal. This reset ensures that all associated logic is properly reset relative to the stable clk0.\n- async_rst: Asynchronous reset signal that combines the direct system reset input and the pll lock status to provide a quick reset mechanism when the PLL is not locked.\n- sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180: Double frequency clocks derived from the PLL with 0 and 180-degree phase shifts, respectively. Useful for high-speed operations or DDR interfacing needs.\n- mcb_drp_clk: A clock used potentially for memory controller block (MCB) or other clocking needs requiring precise control and locking mechanism, enabled only when PLL is locked.\n- pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90: Clock enable outputs with 0 and 90-degree phases respectively, which can be used to drive clock networks or as a strobe signal.\n- pll_lock: Indicates the lock status of the PLL. When high, it signifies that the PLL output clocks are stable and can be utilized reliably."
