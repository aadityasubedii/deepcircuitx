Module name: sp6_data_gen. Module specification: The sp6_data_gen module is designed to generate various data patterns for testing and simulation purposes in hardware environments. It supports multiple data generation modes including fixed, address-based, hammer, walking, and pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) patterns. The module takes inputs such as clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), data mode (data_mode_i), address (addr_i), and various control signals (cmd_start*) to configure and trigger data generation. The primary output is the generated data (data_o). Internally, the module uses signals like prbs_data, adata, hdata, ndata, and w1data to store different pattern types, and employs counters and shift registers for pattern generation. The module is adaptable to different data widths (32, 64, 128 bits) and number of DQ
