This module takes as input a 4-bit data segment and processes it when enabled. It features initialization and reset capabilities, where the CRC can either be initialized to a preset constant or reset depending on the signals provided. The generated CRC from the inputs is compared against a known good CRC value to ascertain data integrity, signaling an error if discrepancies are found.

This data is used in conjunction with previous CRC values to compute an updated CRC.\n- **Enable**: This control signal enables the computation of a new CRC value when asserted high. If low, the CRC computation is not updated.\n- **Initialize**: When asserted high, this signal initializes the CRC to a predefined value (`32'hffffffff`) just as the Reset, but without the necessity of a full reset pulse.\n\nOutput ports: Crc, CrcError.\nExplanation:\n- **Crc (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**: This 32-bit output provides the current computed CRC value based on the input data processed.\n- **CrcError**: This output signal is a flag indicating a CRC mismatch. If the computed CRC does not match the expected value (`32'hc704dd7b`), CrcError is asserted high, indicating an error in data transmission or processing."

Each bit of CrcNext is determined through a specific combination of XOR operations that involve bits from the `Data` input and prior `Crc` values; certain enable conditions control if those combinations take effect. This signal is crucial as it serves as the intermediate step in updating the `Crc` register upon the next clock cycle or based on specific conditions (like `Initialize` or `Reset`).
