Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: This module serves as a wrapper for a memory controller (MCB) interface, providing multiple ports (p0-p5) for command, write, and read operations to interface with external memory, as well as AXI interfaces (s0-s5) for higher-level system integration. It handles memory timing parameters, calibration, and supports various memory types, including DDR3. The module has numerous input ports for clocks, resets, and control signals, as well as ports for each of the six memory interface channels (p0-p5) and six AXI interfaces (s0-s5). Output ports include memory interface signals, calibration status, and status/data signals for each port. Internal signals are used for configuration, calibration, status reporting, and clock management. The code is structured into sections for parameter declarations, port declarations, internal signal declarations, and the instantiation of
