    "module": "The a23_coprocessor module manages coprocessor control functionalities relating to cache and fault handling within microprocessors, focusing on operations like enabling/disabling caching, flushing cache, defining cacheable regions, and managing fault statuses and addresses. It utilizes synchronized inputs to receive operation codes, register identities, and fault details, processes them, and modifies internal registers to store state and control information. Outputs provide feedback on operations and statuses, enabling effective system interactions and debugging via detailed message outputs during development phases."
