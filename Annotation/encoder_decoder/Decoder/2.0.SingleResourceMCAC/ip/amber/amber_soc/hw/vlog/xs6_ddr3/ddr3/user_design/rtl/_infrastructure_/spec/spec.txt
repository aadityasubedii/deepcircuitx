Module name: infrastructure. Module specification: The 'infrastructure' module is pivotal in clock management and reset control within a digital system. It accommodates differential or single-ended input clock signals through either the `sys_clk_p` and `sys_clk_n` or the `sys_clk` ports depending on the clock's nature. The module's essential functionality centers on using a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) to produce versatile output clocks different in frequencies and phases, alongside managing reset signals synchronized to the generated clocks. Output ports include `clk0`, a buffered primary system clock, `rst0` for synchronized system reset, `async_rst` for immediate component resets, among others like `sysclk_2x`, `sysclk_2x_180` for double frequency operations and phase-adjusted clocks. Internal signals like `clk_2x_0`, `sys_rst`, appear in various capacities, largely to manage PLL outputs and synchronize resets. Notably, the module includes blocks like clock buffers (`BUFG`, `BUFGCE`), which help stabilize and distribute clock signals; a PLL block (`PLL_ADV`) ensuring clock signal adaptations based on input properties and output requirements; and lastly, a `BUFPLL_MCB` for specific memory control and high-speed operations. This meticulously structured Verilog module effectively ensures that the system's performance and stability are maintained via controlled clocking mechanisms and reset synchronization.
