This module implements a configurable cache memory for the A23 ARM processor, managing data storage and retrieval. It utilizes a set-associative structure with customizable cache lines, words per line, and ways. The module handles read/write operations, cache fills, write-backs, and invalidations using a state machine. It incorporates tag and data RAMs for each way, hit detection logic, and a random replacement strategy. The design supports exclusive access operations and includes debugging features for monitoring cache activities, enhancing overall processor efficiency by reducing frequent accesses to slower main memory.
