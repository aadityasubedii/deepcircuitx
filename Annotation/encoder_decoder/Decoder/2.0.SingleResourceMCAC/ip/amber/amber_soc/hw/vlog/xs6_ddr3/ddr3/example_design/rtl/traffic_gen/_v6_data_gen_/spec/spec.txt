Module name: v6_data_gen. Module specification: The v6_data_gen module is a versatile data generation unit designed for memory testing and simulation purposes. It supports various data patterns including address-based, PRBS (pseudo-random binary sequence), walking 1/0, neighbor, and fixed data patterns. The module takes inputs such as clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), data mode selection (data_mode_i), command start signals (cmd_startA to cmd_startE), address inputs (m_addr_i, addr_i), and control signals (data_rdy_i, fifo_rdy_i). It outputs generated data (data_o) based on the selected mode and input parameters. Internally, the module uses signals like prbs_data, acounts, adata, hdata, ndata, w1data, and w0data to generate and manipulate
