It handles various phases of addressing and data transfer between memory cells and a controller. The module uses a finite state machine (FSM) to manage different states such as READY, DECIDE, ADDR_PHASE, DATA_PHASE, and various intermediary states to handle the complexity of reading from or writing to memory cells. The module supports alternate read operations, serialization of data for DRP operations, and manages the synchronization necessary for dynamic reconfiguration tasks using DRP-related signals. Additionally, it has provisions for handling bit expansions and multiplexing operations based on DRP configuration or memory data."
