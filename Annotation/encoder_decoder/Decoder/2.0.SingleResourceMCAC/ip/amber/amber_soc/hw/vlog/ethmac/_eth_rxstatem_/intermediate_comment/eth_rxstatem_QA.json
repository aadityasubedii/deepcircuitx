It utilizes a state machine architecture to transition between states, such as idle, preamble detection, start frame delimiter (SFD) detection, data reception, and handling frame dropping when specific conditions are met (like maximum frame size breaches or invalid frame gaps). The transitions are controlled by the positive edge of the `MRxClk` clock or a system reset. Output signals indicate the current state, allowing other parts of the system to respond to the state of the Ethernet packet reception appropriately."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: StartIdle, StartDrop, StartData0, StartData1, StartPreamble, StartSFD.\n\nExplanation:\n- StartIdle: This signal determines when the state machine should transition to the Idle state. It is asserted when MRxDV is false (indicating no data is currently being received) and any of the other states (StateDrop, StatePreamble, StateSFD, or any of the StateData states) are active, effectively resetting the state machine to await new data.\n- StartDrop: The StartDrop signal triggers the transition to the Drop state. It's asserted under several conditions: if transmitting is active while in the Idle state, if the state machine is in the SFD state but the IFG (Inter-Frame Gap) counter hasn't reached 24 and the MRxD line equals 0xD, or if the byte count has reached the maximum frame size while in the data reception states (StateData0).\n- StartData0: This signal is used to transition into the first data reception state, StateData0. It is asserted when the state machine is in the SFD state and MRxD equals 0xD with the IFGCounter at 24, or from StateData1 directly under certain conditions, facilitating the chunk-wise handling of the received data stream.\n- StartData1: This initiates the transition to the second data reception state, StateData1. It is asserted if the current state is StateData0 and the byte count has not yet reached the maximum allowable frame size, managing the flow of incoming data bytes distinctly.\n- StartPreamble: It controls the transition to the Preamble detection state, asserted when MRxDV is true, MRxDEq5 is false (indicating the beginning of the preamble), and the state machine is in the Idle state but not currently transmitting. This signal helps detect the start of a new incoming frame.\n- StartSFD: StartSFD triggers the transition to the StateSFD, where the state machine detects the Start Frame Delimiter (SFD), indicating the end of the preamble and the start of the actual data frame. It's asserted when MRxDV is true, MRxDEq5 is true, and the machine is either in the Idle state (with no ongoing transmission) or in the StatePreamble. \n\nThese internal signals are crucial for managing the state transitions accurately and efficiently within the Ethernet reception process handled by the `eth_rxstatem` module."
