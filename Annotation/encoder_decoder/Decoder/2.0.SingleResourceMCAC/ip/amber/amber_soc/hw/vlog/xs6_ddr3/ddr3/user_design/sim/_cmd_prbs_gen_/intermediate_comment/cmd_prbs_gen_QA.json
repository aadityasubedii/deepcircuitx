The module can configure different PRBS generation parameters such as width, seed initialization, and more, based on given parameter settings. It supports multiple configurations and operations based on the `PRBS_CMD` parameter which can change the behavior to generate address patterns or other specific patterns. The generated PRBS patterns are outputted through `prbs_o` which can change based on the specified configuration such as bit-width and instruction type. Different mechanisms for generating PRBS sequences are implemented based on `PRBS_WIDTH` and taps are logically arranged according to given parameters to ensure the desired pseudorandom characteristics are met. Additionally, the module can adapt its behavior according to the target FPGA family (`FAMILY` parameter), as shown with different configurations for \"SPARTAN6\"."

All state updates within the module occur on the rising edge of this clock.\n- `prbs_seed_init`: This input port is a control signal used to initialize the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) with the seed value provided via `prbs_seed_i`.\n- `clk_en`: This input port is a clock enable signal. It is used to control the operation of the LFSR; the LFSR updates its state only when this signal is high, allowing for controlled operation of the sequence generation.\n- `prbs_seed_i`: This input port provides the initial seed value for the PRBS generation. The seed is loaded into the LFSR when `prbs_seed_init` is asserted.\n\nOutput ports: prbs_o.\nExplanation: \n- `prbs_o`: This output port provides the pseudorandom binary sequence generated by the module.
