Module name: iodrp_mcb_controller. 

Module specification: The `iodrp_mcb_controller` is a Verilog module designed to manage memory and Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) interactions through a finite state machine (FSM). It processes inputs such as memory cell addresses, write data, control signals for read/write operations, command validation, broadcast usage, and DRP address, clock, and data lines. The outputs from the module include read data, a ready/busy status, DRP control signals like chip select, serial data input, and address lines, as well as memory control bus UI read signals. Internally, this module employs several registers (like `memcell_addr_reg` and `data_reg`) for storing the address and data temporarily. It also uses a shift register (`shift_through_reg`) and multiplexers to manage data flow during serial communication with DRP. Various control signals (`load_shift_n`, `addr_data_sel_n`, `bit_cnt`, etc.) govern the data transfer and synchronization between different phase transitions managed by the FSM. The states in the FSM guide the module through the cycles of reading and writing data, handling different gaps between address and data phases, and ensuring the system is ready for the next command. The module effectively decouples the DRP operations from direct memory interfacing, easing the integration of dynamic configuration transitions in systems involving reconfigurable logical architectures.
