Module name: eth_miim.
Module specification: The 'eth_miim' module is responsible for managing the Media Independent Interface (MII) operations with Ethernet PHY devices. It controls MDIO interface operations including read and write actions to PHY device registers. The module employs input ports such as Clk (clock input for timing synchronization), Reset (resets internal states), Divider (configures the frequency of Mdc), among others like CtrlData, Rgad, Fiad, WCtrlData, RStat, and ScanStat for various control and data handling operations. Correspondingly, output ports include Mdc (Management Data Clock), Mdo (Management Data Output), Busy (operation status indicator), and several others such as Nvalid and UpdateMIIRX_DATAReg for data validity and internal updates. Internal signals such as WCtrlData_q1 to WCtrlData_q3 and RStat_q1 to RStat_q3 enforce timing sequences for the control of write and read cycles, whereas signals like WriteOp and BitCounter enable monitoring of operation progression and cycles. Moreover, the Verilog module is divided into key sections like clock generation (handled by eth_clockgen), data shifting (managed by eth_shiftreg), and output controls (facilitated by eth_outputcontrol), each designated to handle specific tasks within MII management such as timing, data routing, and signal output control. This structured design facilitates efficient data transactions with PHY registers, thereby ensuring effective Ethernet communications management.
