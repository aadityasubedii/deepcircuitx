    "module": "The infrastructure module configures and manages clock signals for digital systems, utilizing PLLs to generate multiple stable output frequencies through differential or single-ended input clocks. It includes logic for clock synchronization, reset handling, and output clock generation with selectable phases and duty cycles, ensuring reliable operation across reset and power-up states by monitoring PLL lock status and conditionally activating output clocks."
