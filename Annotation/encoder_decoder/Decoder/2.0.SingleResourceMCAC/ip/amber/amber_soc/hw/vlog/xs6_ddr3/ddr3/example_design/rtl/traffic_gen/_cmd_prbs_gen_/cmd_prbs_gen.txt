The cmd_prbs_gen module generates pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) using a configurable linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) for various applications like address or instruction generation. It employs varying LFSR configurations dictated by PRBS_CMD and PRBS_WIDTH parameters, enabling conditional LFSR updates through enable signals and tap-specific XOR feedback to produce PRBS outputs tailored to specific system needs.
