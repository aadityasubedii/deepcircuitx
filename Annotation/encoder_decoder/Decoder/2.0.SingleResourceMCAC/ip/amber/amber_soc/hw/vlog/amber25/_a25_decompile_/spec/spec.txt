Module name: a25_decompile. Module specification: This module is a decompiler for an ARM processor (likely ARM7 architecture) that generates human-readable assembly code output for debugging and analysis purposes. It takes inputs related to instruction execution and processor state, including clock (i_clk), core stall (i_core_stall), instruction data (i_instruction), instruction validity (i_instruction_valid), undefined instruction flag (i_instruction_undefined), execution flag (i_instruction_execute), interrupt signals (i_interrupt, i_interrupt_state), instruction address (i_instruction_address), program counter select (i_pc_sel), and program counter write enable (i_pc_wen). The module doesn't have explicit output ports but writes decompiled instruction information to a file. Internally, it uses various signals for instruction decoding, such as immediate values (imm32, imm8), off
