Module name: wr_data_gen.

Module specification: The 'wr_data_gen' module is tailored for controlling data flow during memory write operations in FPGA designs, accommodating configurations specific to either SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6 FPGA families. This module functions by initiating and managing write sequences, ensuring synchronization with external commands and readiness signals. The input ports include 'clk_i' for clocking, 'rst_i' for reset, 'prbs_fseed_i' for initializing PRBS data patterns, 'data_mode_i' to define the data operation mode, various command validation signals ('cmd_valid_i', 'cmd_validB_i', 'cmd_validC_i'), 'fixed_data_i' for constant data values, 'addr_i' for target memory address, 'bl_i' for burst length, and 'data_rdy_i' indicating the readiness of a data path. Output ports comprise 'cmd_rdy_o' indicating readiness for new commands, 'last_word_o' signaling the end of data bursts, 'data_valid_o' indicating valid output data, 'data_o' which is the actual data output, and 'data_wr_end_o' signaling the end of a data write sequence. Internally, the module utilizes registers and counters such as 'cmd_rdy', 'cmd_start', 'data', 'user_burst_cnt', and 'fifo_not_full' to manage operations, signal readiness, and maintain proper data sequence counts. It leverages conditional hardware generation blocks ('generate' statements) to integrate specific data generation sub-modules based on the FPGA family, ensuring flexibility in data handling capabilities tailored to different hardware profiles. Overall, this module encapsulates control logic critical for efficient and error-free data writing in memory-intensive FPGA applications.
