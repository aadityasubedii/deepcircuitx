    "module": "The `iodrp_controller` module facilitates interfacing between memory cells and processing units, executing read and write operations controlled via a finite state machine (FSM). It efficiently manages these operations using synchronization signals, status outputs, and internal logic for data buffering, shifting, and state management, enabling structured and precise data handling in dynamic memory settings."
