Module name: a23_decompile. Module specification: The a23_decompile module is a decompiler for an ARM processor (likely ARM2/3 architecture) designed for debugging and analysis purposes. It takes various inputs related to instruction execution and interrupt handling, including clock (i_clk), fetch stall (i_fetch_stall), 32-bit instruction (i_instruction), instruction validity (i_instruction_valid), undefined instruction flag (i_instruction_undefined), execution flag (i_instruction_execute), 3-bit interrupt type (i_interrupt), interrupt state (i_interrupt_state), 32-bit instruction address (i_instruction_address), program counter select (i_pc_sel), and program counter write enable (i_pc_wen). The module doesn't have explicit output ports but writes disassembled instruction information to a file. Internally, it uses signals for decoding
