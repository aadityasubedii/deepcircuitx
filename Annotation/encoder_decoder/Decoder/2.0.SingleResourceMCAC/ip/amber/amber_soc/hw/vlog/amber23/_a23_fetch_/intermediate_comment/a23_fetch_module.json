    "module": "The 'a23_fetch' module facilitates data fetching for a processor by determining whether to access memory via cache or directly through the Wishbone bus, predicated on address validity, cachability, and system readiness. It integrates input handling, arbitration between cache and Wishbone paths with internal signal logic, and interfacing through dedicated blocks for cache (`a23_cache`) and Wishbone operations (`a23_wishbone`), managing stalls, data outputs, and ensuring synchronous operations with the system's clock."
