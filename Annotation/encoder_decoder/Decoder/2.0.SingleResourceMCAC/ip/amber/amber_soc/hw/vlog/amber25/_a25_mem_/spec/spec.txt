Module name: a25_mem. Module specification: The `a25_mem` module is designed for managing memory operations in a microprocessor, specifically handling reads, writes, and caching functions to optimize data flow. It interfaces with both a data cache and external memory. Input ports include clock (`i_clk`), reset (`i_reset`), stall signals (`i_fetch_stall`, `i_exec_stall`), data address (`i_daddress`, `i_daddress_nxt`), data write (`i_write_data`), control signals (`i_write_enable`, `i_exclusive`, `i_byte_enable`, `i_exec_load_rd`, `i_cache_enable`, `i_cache_flush`, `i_cacheable_area`), and memory data returns from a bus (`i_wb_uncached_rdata`, `i_wb_cached_rdata`, `i_wb_cached_ready`, `i_wb_uncached_ready`). Output ports handle memory stalling (`o_mem_stall`), reading data (`o_mem_read_data`, `o_mem_read_data_valid`), load destination (`o_mem_load_rd`), and external memory requests (`o_wb_cached_req`, `o_wb_uncached_req`, `o_wb_write`, `o_wb_byte_enable`, `o_wb_write_data`, `o_wb_address`). Internal signals such as `cache_read_data`, `address_cachable`, `sel_cache_p`, `uncached_data_access`, among others, control the cache decision-making and data fetching/writing operations ensuring effective memory management and response to cache and bus states. The module integrates a cache management sub-module (`a25_dcache`) for handling data caching and combines combinational and sequential logic to manage the overall memory operations, cache interactions, and synchronization of data flows with processor needs, also including handling of edge-case scenarios such as exclusive access operations and stall conditions.
