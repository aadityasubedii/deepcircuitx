It consists of four 2048x8-bit RAMB16BWER blocks, each handling one byte of the 32-bit data. The module supports read and write operations with byte-level write enables, allowing selective writing to individual bytes within a 32-bit word. The SRAM can be initialized with predefined values using the SRAM[0-3]_INIT_[0-63] parameters. The module has a synchronous interface with clock input, address input, write data input, byte enable input, write enable input, and read data output."
