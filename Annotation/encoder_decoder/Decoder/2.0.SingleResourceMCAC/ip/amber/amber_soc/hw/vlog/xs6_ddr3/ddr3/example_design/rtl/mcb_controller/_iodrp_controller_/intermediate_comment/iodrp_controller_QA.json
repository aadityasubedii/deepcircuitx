It controls the DRP protocols by setting addresses, sending or receiving data, and controlling the state of the DRP connections based on commands and the internal finite state machine (FSM). The FSM has states for deciding operation types, handling addresses, managing transitions between address and data phases, and capturing data during read operations. This is synchronized with a clock signal, and a synchronous reset is used for initializing or resetting system states. The module also handles conditions with broadcasting commands and distinguishes read-versus-write operations through FSM states, ensuring correct data flow and control signal stability during DRP operations."
