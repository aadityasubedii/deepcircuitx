Module name: eth_spram_256x32. 
Module specification: The eth_spram_256x32 is a single-port RAM module designed for Verilog environments, specifically tailored for FPGA implementations. It features a memory size of 256 words, each 32 bits wide, and is operated by a rising-edge sensitive clock signal. Interface signals include `clk` (clock input), `rst` (reset input), `ce` (chip enable input), `we` (4-bit write enable input for byte-wise write operations), `oe` (output enable input), `addr` (8-bit address input), `di` (32-bit data input bus), and `do` (32-bit data output bus). The inputs facilitate reading from and writing to the RAM, while the outputs deliver data stored at specified addresses. Internally, the module uses a `write_enable` signal, which acts as a control for write operations, conditioned by chip enable and at least one active write enable bit. The module structure includes conditional compilation blocks catering to different FPGA families such as Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6 or a generic block for other types. These blocks instantiate specific single-port RAM components with configurations stated for byte enable operation, connecting the inputs and outputs through the instantiated SRAM block, which effectively handles data reads and writes as commanded by the inputs and internal `write_enable` logic. The clear, structured design ensures adaptability to various FPGA platforms while maintaining efficient data handling and storage operations.
