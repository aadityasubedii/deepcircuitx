    "spec": "Module name: iodrp_controller. Module specification: The `iodrp_controller` is a Verilog module designed to manage a Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) interface, used predominantly in FPGA applications for memory manipulation through serial communication. This module operates on an 8-bit memory cell address input (`memcell_address`) and 8-bit data input (`write_data`), controlling read or write operations based on the `rd_not_write` signal. It validates commands via `cmd_valid` and signals its status through the `rdy_busy_n` output, indicating if it's ready or busy. Additional inputs include `use_broadcast` for enabling broadcasting, `sync_rst` for synchronous resetting, and `DRP_CLK` for clocking, with `DRP_SDO` used for serial data output capture.\n\nThe module outputs include `read_data` for storing read values, `DRP_CS` for chip select signaling, `DRP_SDI` as serial data input to the DRP, `DRP_ADD` for address latching, and `DRP_BKST` to control the broadcast status based on input conditions. Key internal signals include `memcell_addr_reg` and `data_reg` for storing address and data, `shift_through_reg` functioning as a shift register, `load_shift_n` and `addr_data_sel_n` controlling data loading and address-data selection, and various control flags and counters like `AddressPhase`, `bit_cnt`, and state management signals (`state`, `nextstate`). These elements are integral for the internal state machine that guides the operational phases of the module, such as deciding operation mode, address and data phase processing, and managing transitions between operational states. The code is structured around process blocks triggered by the positive edge of `DRP_CLK`, handling state transitions, data and address loading, signal broadcasting, and mode setting, efficiently facilitating the communication and control over the DRP interface.",

Module specification: The `iodrp_controller` is a Verilog module designed to manage a Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) interface, used predominantly in FPGA applications for memory manipulation through serial communication. This module operates on an 8-bit memory cell address input (`memcell_address`) and 8-bit data input (`write_data`), controlling read or write operations based on the `rd_not_write` signal. It validates commands via `cmd_valid` and signals its status through the `rdy_busy_n` output, indicating if it's ready or busy. Additional inputs include `use_broadcast` for enabling broadcasting, `sync_rst` for synchronous resetting, and `DRP_CLK` for clocking, with `DRP_SDO` used for serial data output capture.\n\nThe module outputs include `read_data` for storing read values, `DRP_CS` for chip select signaling, `DRP_SDI` as serial data input to the DRP, `DRP_ADD` for address latching, and `DRP_BKST` to control the broadcast status based on input conditions. Key internal signals include `memcell_addr_reg` and `data_reg` for storing address and data, `shift_through_reg` functioning as a shift register, `load_shift_n` and `addr_data_sel_n` controlling data loading and address-data selection, and various control flags and counters like `AddressPhase`, `bit_cnt`, and state management signals (`state`, `nextstate`). These elements are integral for the internal state machine that guides the operational phases of the module, such as deciding operation mode, address and data phase processing, and managing transitions between operational states. The code is structured around process blocks triggered by the positive edge of `DRP_CLK`, handling state transitions, data and address loading, signal broadcasting, and mode setting, efficiently facilitating the communication and control over the DRP interface."
