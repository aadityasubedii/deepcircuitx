Module name: a25_write_back. Module specification: The a25_write_back module is designed to handle the data write-back stage in a pipeline architecture, specifically for data read from memory and its subsequent write-back, conditional on the absence of a stall signal from memory. The module's input ports include i_clk (clock signal), i_reset (reset signal), i_mem_stall (stall signal which if active prevents the update of registers), i_mem_read_data (memory read data), i_mem_read_data_valid (validity status of memory read data), i_mem_load_rd (destination register ID where the data should be written), i_daddress (memory address from data read), and i_daddress_valid (validity of the data address which is unused in this module). Output ports include o_wb_read_data (buffered data to be written back), o_wb_read_data_valid (validity status of the buffered data), and o_wb_load_rd (destination register ID output for writing back data). Internal signals like mem_read_data_r, mem_read_data_valid_r, mem_load_rd_r, and daddress_r serve as intermediary storage: mem_read_data_r buffers the data, mem_read_data_valid_r indicates its validity, mem_load_rd_r stores the ID to which data should be written, and daddress_r provisions the data address buffering. The code principally comprises two always blocks driven by the positive edge of the clock: one block updates mem_read_data_r, mem_read_data_valid_r, and mem_load_rd_r when there is no memory stall; the other updates daddress_r similarly. This module ensures reliable transfer of data across stages of the pipeline without a stall, maintaining coherent data write-back operations.
