    "module": "The rd_data_gen module generates data for memory read operations in test environments, adaptable to FPGA families like SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6. It synchronizes operations with input signals for reset, data mode, command validity, and data readiness, managing internal states with signals like cmd_start and data_valid. Conditional generate blocks instantiate specific sub-modules for data handling based on the FPGA family, ensuring flexible and accurate simulation of memory reads."
