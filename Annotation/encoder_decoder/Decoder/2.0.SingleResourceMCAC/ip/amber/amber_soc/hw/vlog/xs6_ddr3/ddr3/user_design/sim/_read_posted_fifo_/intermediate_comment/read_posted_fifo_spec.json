    "spec": "Module name: read_posted_fifo. \nModule specification: The `read_posted_fifo` module serves as a FIFO buffer tailored for posted read operations in memory interfaces with configurable burst length (specified by `MEM_BURST_LEN`) and address width (specified by `ADDR_WIDTH`). It synchronizes incoming read commands and data, managing flow based on signal conditions like data and command readiness. Input ports include `clk_i` (clock input), `rst_i` (reset input), `cmd_valid_i`, `data_valid_i`, `addr_i`, `bl_i`, `user_bl_cnt_is_1`, `cmd_sent`, `bl_sent`, `cmd_en_i`, `gen_rdy_i`, and `rd_mdata_fifo_empty`. These handle various aspects of read operations like command validation, data validity, read address, burst length, command enabling, and FIFO metadata emptiness. Output ports include `cmd_rdy_o`, `gen_valid_o`, `gen_addr_o`, `gen_bl_o`, `rd_buff_avail_o`, and `rd_mdata_en`, which provide feedback on command readiness, output data validity, read address and burst output, buffer availability, and metadata read enabling. Internally, the module uses several signals such as `empty_r`, `rd_first_data`, `full`, `empty`, `wr_en`, `rd_en`, `data_valid_r`, and others to maintain and manage FIFO state, data flow, and read operational conditions. The code is structured around several always blocks handling tasks like buffer management based on the command and data readiness, count management for read data, and adjusting internal states and outputs based on the FIFO's operational needs. A FIFO is instantiated with adjustable depth and synchronized settings, handling the actual storage and retrieval of address and burst length data. The module adapplies different logic based on the type of FPGA family specified, accommodating the peculiar requirements such as different burst read operations and syncing mechanisms for different hardware configurations.",

                    "text": "Module name: read_posted_fifo. \nModule specification: The `read_posted_fifo` module serves as a FIFO buffer tailored for posted read operations in memory interfaces with configurable burst length (specified by `MEM_BURST_LEN`) and address width (specified by `ADDR_WIDTH`). It synchronizes incoming read commands and data, managing flow based on signal conditions like data and command readiness. Input ports include `clk_i` (clock input), `rst_i` (reset input), `cmd_valid_i`, `data_valid_i`, `addr_i`, `bl_i`, `user_bl_cnt_is_1`, `cmd_sent`, `bl_sent`, `cmd_en_i`, `gen_rdy_i`, and `rd_mdata_fifo_empty`. These handle various aspects of read operations like command validation, data validity, read address, burst length, command enabling, and FIFO metadata emptiness. Output ports include `cmd_rdy_o`, `gen_valid_o`, `gen_addr_o`, `gen_bl_o`, `rd_buff_avail_o`, and `rd_mdata_en`, which provide feedback on command readiness, output data validity, read address and burst output, buffer availability, and metadata read enabling. Internally, the module uses several signals such as `empty_r`, `rd_first_data`, `full`, `empty`, `wr_en`, `rd_en`, `data_valid_r`, and others to maintain and manage FIFO state, data flow, and read operational conditions. The code is structured around several always blocks handling tasks like buffer management based on the command and data readiness, count management for read data, and adjusting internal states and outputs based on the FIFO's operational needs. A FIFO is instantiated with adjustable depth and synchronized settings, handling the actual storage and retrieval of address and burst length data. The module adapplies different logic based on the type of FPGA family specified, accommodating the peculiar requirements such as different burst read operations and syncing mechanisms for different hardware configurations."
