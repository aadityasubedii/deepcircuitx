It uses two different clocks: `wr_clk` for the write operations and `rd_clk` for read operations, making it suitable for use between different clock domains. This module uses gray code counters for the read and write pointers to safely handle the read and write operations across asynchronous clock domains. The FIFO has parameters to adjust its data size (`DSIZE`), depth (`FIFO_DEPTH`), and address size (`ASIZE`). It provides outputs which indicate whether it\u2019s full, empty, or almost full to control the flow of data. The FIFO stores data entries in a memory array and manages read and write operations using pointers that are synchronized between the write and read clocks when `SYNC` is set to 1. The module handles resets, wrap-around of pointers, and maintains flag states based on the buffer's occupancy."
