    "module": "The `eth_txstatem` module manages the Ethernet transmission state machine, handling state transitions crucial for Ethernet frame transmissions in accordance with input conditions and clock signals. It processes various input signals to control transitions among multiple states such as Idle, IPG, Preamble, and Data, utilizing internal conditions and counters to determine state sequences. Output signals reflect the current state and initiate specific transmission actions, ensuring the module's operation is synchronized with the Ethernet standard requirements."
