This module decodes instructions for the ARM25 processor, generating control signals for various processor components. It implements a state machine to manage instruction execution, handling different instruction types including register operations, memory transfers, branches, and system operations. The module processes inputs such as fetched instructions and status bits, and produces outputs like immediate values, register selection signals, and ALU control signals. It supports conditional execution, immediate value calculation, and handles special cases like multiple register transfers and coprocessor operations. The decoder also manages interrupts, exceptions, and memory access, coordinating the processor's overall operation through its complex decoding logic and control flow management.
