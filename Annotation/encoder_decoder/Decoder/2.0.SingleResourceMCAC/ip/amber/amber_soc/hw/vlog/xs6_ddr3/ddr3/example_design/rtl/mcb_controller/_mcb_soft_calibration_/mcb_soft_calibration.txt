This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block, including input termination calibration, termination value broadcasting, and dynamic DQS signal calibration. It utilizes a state machine to control the calibration process, adjusting P-term and N-term values, and DQS delays. The module interfaces with IODRP controllers to read and write calibration values, and implements a reset sequence for the MCB. It handles self-refresh requests and adapts to variations in operating conditions by dynamically adjusting calibration parameters. The implementation includes multiple calibration stages, error checking, and iterative adjustment of DQS delays based on measured signal integrity.
