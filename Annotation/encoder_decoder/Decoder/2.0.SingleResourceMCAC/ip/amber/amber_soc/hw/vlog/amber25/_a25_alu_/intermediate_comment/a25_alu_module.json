    "module": "The `a25_alu` module serves as an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed to execute a variety of arithmetic and logical operations based on the control signals specified by the `i_function` input. It processes two main 32-bit inputs (`i_a_in`, `i_b_in`) and selectively performs operations such as addition, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, notations, and extensions controlled through internal logic gates and conditionally compiled blocks for FPGA optimizations. The results are outputted to `o_out` and condition flags to `o_flags` indicating zero, carry, and overflow states, making it adaptable for diverse computational needs in digital systems."
