It handles operations such as determining whether the address is cacheable, selecting data from cache or memory based on the address alignment, and handling stalls (delays) caused by various conditions like system readiness, cache operations, or wait states from read operations. The module communicates with the main memory and an internal cache system, managing requests and caching strategies to optimize instruction retrieval for execution."
