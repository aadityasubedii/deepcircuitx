    "module": "This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM memory device, modeling its timing and functionality. It implements key DDR3 features including bank activation, precharge, refresh, power-down modes, and self-refresh. The module uses input/output ports for control signals, addresses, and data, with internal signals tracking timing parameters and state variables. It processes commands, handles data input/output, performs timing checks, and manages memory read/write operations through pipeline stages and state machines. The implementation includes detailed timing checks, command decoding, and adherence to DDR3 specifications for accurate behavioral modeling."
