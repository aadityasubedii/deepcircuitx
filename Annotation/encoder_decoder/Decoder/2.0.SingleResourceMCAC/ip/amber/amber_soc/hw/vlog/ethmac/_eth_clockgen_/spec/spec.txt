Module name: eth_clockgen. Module specification: The eth_clockgen module is designed for generating a controlled Ethernet management data clock (Mdc) from an input clock (Clk) based on a specified divider value. The module features three input ports: Clk, a primary clock input; Reset, a synchronous reset that initializes the counter and the Mdc signal; and Divider, an 8-bit value determining the Mdc frequency by setting the counterâ€™s maximum count. The outputs include Mdc, the divided clock signal toggling based on Counter reaching zero; MdcEn, an enable signal active on the Mdc's falling edge for synchronization; and MdcEn_n, an active signal on the rising edge providing synchronization at opposite edge to MdcEn. Internally, the module uses key signals like Counter, which counts down from a preset value derived from Divider; CountEq0, a condition signaling when Counter reaches zero; CounterPreset, which establishes the initial count value; and TempDivider, ensuring the divider value maintains practical frequency range outputs. The Verilog implementation consists of mainly two procedural blocks responding to the positive edge of Clk and Reset for managing Counter and Mdc states respectively, along with several assignments establishing conditions and preset values. This design allows for robust management and toggling of Ethernet clock signals suitable for further synchronous operations within networking hardware contexts.
