    "module": "The 'iodrp_controller' module manages operations of I/O Dynamic Reconfigurable Ports (DRP) by handling addressing and data phases for memory read/write operations. It utilizes a blend of input and output signals for process control, synchronization, and data transmission facilitated by an internal state machine. Key internal registers store and manage transition data, while control signals and state transitions define operation sequences, ensuring correct interfacing in both single and broadcast modes."
