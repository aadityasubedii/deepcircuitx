Module name: a25_wishbone_buf.

Module specification: The a25_wishbone_buf module serves as a buffer manager for the Wishbone bus interface, handling both read and write requests. The core functionalities include managing a FIFO-like buffer for write operations, handling request acknowledgments, and managing read transaction completeness. The input ports include i_clk (clock signal), i_req (indicates a new request), i_write (distinguishes read/write operations), i_wdata (write data bus), i_be (byte enable for write operations), i_addr (address for read/write operations), i_accepted (signals acceptance of an output), i_rdata (data from a read operation), and i_rdata_valid (validity of read data). Output ports involve o_rdata (data output from read operations), o_ack (acknowledgment signal), o_valid (validity of output data), o_write (indicates a write operation), o_wdata (output data for write), o_be (byte enable for output data), and o_addr (address for output operations). Internal signals such as wbuf_used_r (tracks buffer usage), wbuf_*(arrays for storing data, address, byte enables, write flags), busy_reading_r (indicates an ongoing read), and ack_owed_r (manages acknowledgments) work together to control the flow and state of data within the module. The code blocks handle pushing and popping from the buffer, managing acknowledgments, updating internal state based on operations, and controlling the data passed to the output ports, ensuring the module operates accurately and efficiently in interfacing with the Wishbone bus.
