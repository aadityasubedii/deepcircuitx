Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: The memc_wrapper module serves as a comprehensive wrapper for a memory controller interface, designed to manage multiple ports (p0 to p5) with command, write, and read interfaces, as well as AXI interfaces (s0 to s5) for external device communication. It takes various input signals including clocks (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), PLL control signals (pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, pll_lock), reset (async_rst), and port-specific signals for command, write, and read operations. The module outputs memory interface signals (mcbx_dram_*), calibration status (calib_done), and port-specific status signals. Internally, it utilizes AXI interface signals (s0_axi_* to s5_axi_*) for
