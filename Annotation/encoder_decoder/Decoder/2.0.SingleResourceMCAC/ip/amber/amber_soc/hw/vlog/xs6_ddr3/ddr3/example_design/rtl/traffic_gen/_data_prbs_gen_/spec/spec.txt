Module name: data_prbs_gen. 
Module specification: The `data_prbs_gen` module is designed to generate pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) via a linear feedback shift register (LFSR). It is specifically tailored for data scrambling, pattern generation, and testing in communication systems. The inputs to the module include `clk_i` (the primary clock signal), `clk_en` (enables LFSR operations when active), `rst_i` (activates initialization of the shift register), `prbs_fseed_i` (a fixed seed value for initialization), `prbs_seed_init` (controls the seed loading into the LFSR), and `prbs_seed_i` (provides seed values for initializing or re-initializing the LFSR). The sole output `prbs_o` delivers the PRBS with a width configured by the PRBS_WIDTH parameter. Internally, the module uses `prbs` to hold the current LFSR state and `lfsr_q` as the core shift register where shifting and XOR operations occur. The primary code blocks include an `always` block responsive to the rising edge of `clk_i`, managing seed initialization and PRBS generation via conditional checks and bitwise operations, and another `always` block that updates the `prbs` buffer with the current LFSR state, destined for output through `prbs_o`. This module efficiently encapsulates PRBS generation with configurable parameters and conditional operations facilitating diverse application scenarios.
