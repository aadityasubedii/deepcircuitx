    "module": "The a25_core module implements a CPU core, likely based on ARM architecture, handling instruction processing from fetch to write-back stages. It achieves this through interconnected submodules: fetch (a25_fetch), decode (a25_decode), execute (a25_execute), memory (a25_mem), write-back (a25_write_back), Wishbone interface (a25_wishbone), and coprocessor (a25_coprocessor). These submodules work together to manage instruction flow, data processing, memory operations, and peripheral interactions, utilizing a Wishbone bus interface for external communications and supporting features like caching, interrupts, and coprocessor operations."
