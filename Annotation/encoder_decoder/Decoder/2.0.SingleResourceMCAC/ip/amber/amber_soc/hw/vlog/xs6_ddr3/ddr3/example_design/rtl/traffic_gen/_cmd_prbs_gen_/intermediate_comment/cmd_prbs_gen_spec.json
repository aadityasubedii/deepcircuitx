    "spec": "Module name: cmd_prbs_gen. \nModule specification: The cmd_prbs_gen module is a Verilog-based hardware design that generates pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) using linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs) for diverse applications including address, instruction, or burst length generation, dictated by the PRBS_CMD parameter. The module inputs consist of `clk_i`, a clock signal to synchronize operations; `prbs_seed_init`, a control signal for initializing the LFSR with a seed available at `prbs_seed_i`; `clk_en`, a clock enable signal; and `prbs_seed_i`, the seed value for PRBS. The module outputs the PRBS through `prbs_o`. Internally, it uses signals like `ZEROS`, a wire filled all with zeros; `prbs`, a register that holds the PRBS output; and `lfsr_q`, the main LFSR register. The module features several conditional generate blocks (`gen64_taps`, `gen32_taps`, `gen20_taps`) which handle different configurations of PRBS generation based on parameters such as width and command type, utilizing different feedback tap setups and initial conditions to manipulate the PRBS generation. This allows dynamic control over the LFSR's behavior and output sequence customization accordingly.",

The PRBS generation can be configured for different purposes such as address, instruction, or burst length generation, depending on the `PRBS_CMD` parameter. The module uses seed values (`prbs_seed_i`) to initialize the LFSR, and the sequence evolves with each clock cycle when enabled. Adjustable parameters like the address width, data width, and PRBS width allow customization to fit specific system requirements. Output is generated based on the PRBS sequence and controlled by additional parameters like seed width and masking positions for start and end addresses."

The module inputs consist of `clk_i`, a clock signal to synchronize operations; `prbs_seed_init`, a control signal for initializing the LFSR with a seed available at `prbs_seed_i`; `clk_en`, a clock enable signal; and `prbs_seed_i`, the seed value for PRBS. The module outputs the PRBS through `prbs_o`. Internally, it uses signals like `ZEROS`, a wire filled all with zeros; `prbs`, a register that holds the PRBS output; and `lfsr_q`, the main LFSR register. The module features several conditional generate blocks (`gen64_taps`, `gen32_taps`, `gen20_taps`) which handle different configurations of PRBS generation based on parameters such as width and command type, utilizing different feedback tap setups and initial conditions to manipulate the PRBS generation. This allows dynamic control over the LFSR's behavior and output sequence customization accordingly."
