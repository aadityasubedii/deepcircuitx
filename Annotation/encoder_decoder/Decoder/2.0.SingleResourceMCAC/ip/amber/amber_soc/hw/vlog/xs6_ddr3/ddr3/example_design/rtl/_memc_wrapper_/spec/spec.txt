Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: The memc_wrapper module is a memory controller interface wrapper that supports multiple memory ports (p0 through p5) and AXI interfaces (s0_axi through s5_axi). It manages various memory-related parameters and signals, including clock inputs (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90), reset (async_rst), and memory interface signals (mcbx_dram_*). The module handles command, write, and read operations for each port, with corresponding clocks, enable signals, data, and status indicators. Internal signals include AXI interface signals for slave ports 0-5 (sX_axi_*) and user output signals (uo_*) for calibration and refresh operations. The module instantiates an mcb_ui_top
