    "spec": "Module name: eth_rxaddrcheck. \nModule specification: The \"eth_rxaddrcheck\" module in Verilog is designed for validating Ethernet RX (Receive) addresses, determining whether to accept or reject data packets based on a set of defined criteria including unicast, multicast, and broadcast conditions. The module receives inputs such as the main system clock (MRxClk), reset signal (Reset), current byte of Rx data (RxData), broadcast indication (Broadcast), promiscuous and broadcast recognition modes (r_Pro, r_Bro), byte count equal flags (ByteCntEq2 to ByteCntEq7), hash values (HASH0, HASH1), CRC-related signals (CrcHash, CrcHashGood), and state settings (StateData, RxEndFrm, PassAll, ControlFrmAddressOK). It outputs signals indicating whether the packet should be aborted (RxAbort) or if there is an address mismatch (AddressMiss). Internal signals such as BroadcastOK, RxAddressInvalid, RxCheckEn, and others regulate intermediate operations such as enabling address checking, verifying CRC hash values, and determining final acceptance of packets based on address match scenarios. The code includes various always blocks that manage Multicast and Unicast packet validation, updating output signals based on byte-wise comparison of RxData against the MAC address, and handling special control and error conditions. Additionally, combinational logic is used to manage hash value extraction and comparison. This module incorporates careful synchronization and state management through explicit clock and reset condition checks in a series of procedural blocks, ensuring robust operation in various data reception scenarios.",
