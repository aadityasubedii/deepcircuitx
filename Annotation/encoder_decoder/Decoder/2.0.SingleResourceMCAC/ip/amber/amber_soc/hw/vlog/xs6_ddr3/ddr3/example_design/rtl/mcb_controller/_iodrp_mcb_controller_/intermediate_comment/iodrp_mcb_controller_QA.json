The module processes addresses and data for memory operations by alternately setting phases for address or data handling with shifting and expansion operations determined by conditions set in the code. It also manages internal states for these operations through a finite state machine, clearly handling timing, data accuracy during shifts, and DRP signal conditioning, which are critical for synchronizing with external memory operations. The module adjusts its behavior based on conditions like sync reset or command validity, ensuring functionality according to precise operational requirements."
