    "spec": "Module name: generic_sram_line_en. \nModule specification: The generic_sram_line_en is a highly versatile Verilog module designed to simulate the operations of a static random access memory (SRAM) with customizable data and address widths. Its functionalities include both read and write operations, driven by a clock input signal. The input ports include 'i_clk' (the clock signal for synchronization of read/write operations), 'i_write_data' (data to be written to the SRAM), 'i_write_enable' (a control signal that enables writing when high, and reading when low), and 'i_address' (specifies the SRAM address for both reading and writing operations). The sole output port, 'o_read_data', outputs the data read from the SRAM, delivering zeros when a read is attempted during a write operation enabled by 'i_write_enable'. Internally, the module utilizes a memory array 'mem', defined with a depth corresponding to 2 raised to the power of ADDRESS_WIDTH and a width equal to DATA_WIDTH. Additionally, the module contains a conditional generation block that initializes the memory array to zeros if the parameter INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO is set. Key operations are managed within an always block triggered by the positive edge of 'i_clk', where data writing or zero output (during concurrent read/write operations) and normal data retrieval occur as dictated by the state of 'i_write_enable'.",

It supports write and read operations. The SRAM memory array is declared with size based on the address width, allowing storage indexed by the address input. Data written to a specific address during a write operation (when 'i_write_enable' is high) is stored in the memory array at that address. During a read operation, if 'i_write_enable' is high, zero data (all bits zero) is output; otherwise, the content of the addressed memory location is output.

It is essential for the sequential logic used in the module, synchronizing changes in the memory array and the output data.\n- i_write_data: This port receives the data meant to be written into the memory.
