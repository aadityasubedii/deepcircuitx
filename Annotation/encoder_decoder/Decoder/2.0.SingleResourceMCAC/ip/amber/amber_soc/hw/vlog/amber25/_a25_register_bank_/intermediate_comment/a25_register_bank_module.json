    "module": "The a25_register_bank module manages the operations of the registers within a processor, handling read and write functionalities across different CPU modes such as User, IRQ, FIRQ, and Supervisor modes. It is designed with input ports for clock synchronization, stall detection, mode selection, and data handling, while output ports furnish necessary register values for further processing. Internally, the module utilizes conditional logic to control data paths and update register values based on mode flags and input conditions, ensuring the correct register banking and data output corresponding to various operational states of the processor. This design enables dynamic response to execution mode changes and effective management of data through multiple pipeline stages."
