It takes either differential or single-ended input clock signals and generates multiple output clocks with different frequencies and phases using a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) component. The module also manages system reset signals, ensuring that various parts of the system are synchronized to the generated clocks. It provides functionality such as clock buffering, phase adjustment, frequency multiplication and division, and reset synchronization to handle various operating conditions and maintain system stability and performance."
