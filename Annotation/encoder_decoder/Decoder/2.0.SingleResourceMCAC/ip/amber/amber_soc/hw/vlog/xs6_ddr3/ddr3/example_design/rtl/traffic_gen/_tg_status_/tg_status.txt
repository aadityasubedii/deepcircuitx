The "tg_status" module monitors and reports system error statuses by comparing expected and actual data, tracking memory buffer statuses, and managing error flags. It employs edge detection for error signals, updates error statuses based on data mismatches and buffer states upon detection, and maintains a persistent error indication until manually or automatically reset. This module is crucial for reliable error management in systems requiring strict data integrity and operational awareness.
