It supports multiple cache ways (2, 3, 4, or 8) and is designed to handle read and write operations, cache misses, and exclusive accesses. The module manages cache line filling, write-back operations, and cache coherency. It includes logic for selecting cache ways, handling cache hits and misses, and managing the cache state machine. The cache is designed to improve memory access performance by storing frequently accessed data closer to the processor."
