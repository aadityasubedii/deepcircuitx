Module name: wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge. 
Module specification: The "wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge" operates as a bridge interface between the Wishbone bus and a DDR3 memory controller, designed to facilitate read and write operations between these two. It supports dynamic data path width adaptation (32-bit or 128-bit) via parameter selection. The input ports include `i_clk` (system clock), `i_mem_ctrl` (memory control signal affecting address mapping), and Wishbone specific signals like `i_wb_adr`, `i_wb_sel`, `i_wb_we`, `i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_cyc`, `i_wb_stb` for addressing, data handling and operation signaling. Additionally, DDR3 status signals like `i_cmd_full`, `i_wr_full`, and `i_rd_empty` provide queue status information, and `i_rd_data` is used for input data from DDR3 memory. The output ports are directed back to Wishbone (`o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_ack`, `o_wb_err`) and to DDR3 (`o_cmd_en`, `o_cmd_instr`, `o_cmd_byte_addr`, `o_wr_en`, `o_wr_mask`, `o_wr_data`) for data handling, command processing, and error acknowledgments. Internal signals such as `write_request`, `write_request_r`, `read_request`, `read_request_r`, and various buffer registers (`write_buf_r`, `wb_sel_buf_r`, etc.) are utilized primarily for managing the timing and synchronization of data transfers and reads, queuing mechanisms when the controller is busy, and data multiplexing based on operation conditions. The code segments are strategically grouped into signal assignments, state machine controls, conditional data processing, and dynamic parameter-based block instantiation via a `generate` construct for flexible data width handling, signifying a meticulous design approach to address various operational scenarios in data communication between the Wishbone interface and DDR3 memory architecture.
