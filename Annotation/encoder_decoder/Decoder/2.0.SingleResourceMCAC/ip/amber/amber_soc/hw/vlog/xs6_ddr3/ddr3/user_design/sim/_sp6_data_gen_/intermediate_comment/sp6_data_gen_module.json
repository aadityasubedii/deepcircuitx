    "module": "This module generates various data patterns for hardware testing and simulation. It supports fixed, address-based, hammer, walking, and PRBS patterns, configurable via input signals. The module uses internal registers and combinational logic to generate patterns based on the selected mode, adapting to different data widths (32, 64, 128 bits). It employs counters, shift registers, and a PRBS generator to create complex patterns, triggered by control signals and synchronized with a clock input. The module outputs the generated data patterns for use in memory or data bus testing scenarios."
