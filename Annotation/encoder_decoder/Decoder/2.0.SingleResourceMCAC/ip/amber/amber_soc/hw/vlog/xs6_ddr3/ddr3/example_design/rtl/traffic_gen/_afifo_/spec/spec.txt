Module name: afifo. Module specification: The 'afifo' module is a synchronous or asynchronous FIFO (First In First Out) buffer, configurable via the SYNC parameter. It facilitates data storage and retrieval operations governed by two separate clock domains: `wr_clk` for writing and `rd_clk` for reading. The module accepts inputs like `wr_clk` (write clock), `rst` (reset), `wr_en` (write enable), `wr_data` (write data), `rd_en` (read enable), and `rd_clk` (read clock). It outputs `rd_data` (read data), along with status signals `full`, `empty`, and `almost_full` indicating the buffer state. Internally, it uses registers and wires like `mem` (data memory), `wr_ptr`/`rd_ptr` (write/read pointers), and `wr_gray`/`rd_gray` (write/read pointers in Gray code) to manage data and pointer states. The module is partitioned into blocks for different functionalities: managing read and write operations synchronized to respective clocks, computing buffer status (empty, full, almost_full), and handling the conversion between binary and Gray code for pointers to ensure reliable cross-clock domain operations. These sections work together to ensure smooth FIFO operations while minimizing errors across asynchronous clock domains.
