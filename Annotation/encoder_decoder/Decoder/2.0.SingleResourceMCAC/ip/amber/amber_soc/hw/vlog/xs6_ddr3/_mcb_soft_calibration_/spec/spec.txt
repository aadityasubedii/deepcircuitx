Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), handling input termination and dynamic DQS delay calibration. It uses a state machine to manage the calibration process, interfacing with IODRP controllers and the MCB. The module has inputs for clock (UI_CLK), reset (RST), PLL status (PLL_LOCK), self-refresh requests (SELFREFRESH_REQ, SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE), and various MCB and IODRP signals. Outputs include calibration status (DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL), self-refresh control (SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ, SELFREFRESH_MODE), and signals for controlling IODRP and MCB interfaces. Internal signals include state variables, termination values, counters, and flags
