    "module": "The `iodrp_mcb_controller` module handles communication with a memory cell, managing data reading and writing under DRP and DRAM protocols. It processes commands related to data handling based on input conditions, utilizing input ports for operation mode, command validity, memory addressing, and synchronization. Internally, the module uses registers to store and manipulate addresses and data, employs a finite state machine for state control, and sequences operations through tasks and always blocks to shift, expand, and direct data in line with DRP timing and protocol requirements, ensuring efficient coordination of memory operations."
