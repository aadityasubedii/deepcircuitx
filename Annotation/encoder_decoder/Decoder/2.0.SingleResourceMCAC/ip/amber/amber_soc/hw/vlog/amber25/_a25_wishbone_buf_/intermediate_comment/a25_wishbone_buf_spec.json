    "spec": "Module name: a25_wishbone_buf.\n\nModule specification: The a25_wishbone_buf module serves as a buffer manager for the Wishbone bus interface, handling both read and write requests. The core functionalities include managing a FIFO-like buffer for write operations, handling request acknowledgments, and managing read transaction completeness. The input ports include i_clk (clock signal), i_req (indicates a new request), i_write (distinguishes read/write operations), i_wdata (write data bus), i_be (byte enable for write operations), i_addr (address for read/write operations), i_accepted (signals acceptance of an output), i_rdata (data from a read operation), and i_rdata_valid (validity of read data). Output ports involve o_rdata (data output from read operations), o_ack (acknowledgment signal), o_valid (validity of output data), o_write (indicates a write operation), o_wdata (output data for write), o_be (byte enable for output data), and o_addr (address for output operations). Internal signals such as wbuf_used_r (tracks buffer usage), wbuf_*(arrays for storing data, address, byte enables, write flags), busy_reading_r (indicates an ongoing read), and ack_owed_r (manages acknowledgments) work together to control the flow and state of data within the module. The code blocks handle pushing and popping from the buffer, managing acknowledgments, updating internal state based on operations, and controlling the data passed to the output ports, ensuring the module operates accurately and efficiently in interfacing with the Wishbone bus.\n",

It features a small FIFO-like buffer for write operations and handles acknowledgment logic for write operations, allowing asynchronous data handling between requesting operations and the actual Wishbone bus transactions. The buffer handles a maximum of two entries, manages the data, address, byte enables, and write controls, and ensures proper sequencing and acknowledgment of requests and data handling.

This is the main clock signal used to synchronize the operations within the module.\n- `i_req`: Request input. Indicates when there is a new read or write request coming in.\n- `i_write`: Write control input. A logic high on this signal indicates that the current operation is a write; a low indicates a read.\n- `i_wdata`: Write data input. This bus carries the data to be written for write operations.\n- `i_be`: Byte enable input. This is used to select which bytes in the data bus are active during the write operation.\n- `i_addr`: Address input. Specifies the address for both read and write operations.\n- `i_accepted`: Accepted input. Indicates that the preceding output from this module has been accepted by the next stage in the system.\n- `i_rdata`: Read data input. This is the data received from a read operation on the Wishbone bus.\n- `i_rdata_valid`: Read data valid input. Indicates when the read data (`i_rdata`) is valid and available for use.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `o_rdata`: Output read data. This carries the data output following a read operation from the Wishbone interface.\n- `o_ack`: Acknowledge output. Signals that the current read or write request has been completed successfully.\n- `o_valid`: Valid output. Indicates that the data present on the outputs `o_rdata`, `o_wdata`, `o_addr`, and `o_be` is valid.\n- `o_write`: Write control output. Mirrors the input `i_write`, indicating whether the current operation passed to the Wishbone is a write.\n- `o_wdata`: Write data output. Sends data to the Wishbone interface for a write operation.\n- `o_be`: Output byte enable. Specifies which bytes in the `o_wdata` are valid for the write operation.\n- `o_addr`: Address output. Specifies the address for a read or write operation on the Wishbone bus.\n\nExplanation:\nThe module interfaces with both inputs and outputs to manage read and write requests over a Wishbone bus. The input signals control the operation's nature (read/write), specify the data and addressing, and communicate the status of external acceptance and data validity. The output signals provide data, status, and control information necessary for interfacing effectively with the Wishbone bus, indicating states like validity, acknowledgment, and other essential control flags for managing a FIFO-like buffer system within the module."

The core functionalities include managing a FIFO-like buffer for write operations, handling request acknowledgments, and managing read transaction completeness. The input ports include i_clk (clock signal), i_req (indicates a new request), i_write (distinguishes read/write operations), i_wdata (write data bus), i_be (byte enable for write operations), i_addr (address for read/write operations), i_accepted (signals acceptance of an output), i_rdata (data from a read operation), and i_rdata_valid (validity of read data). Output ports involve o_rdata (data output from read operations), o_ack (acknowledgment signal), o_valid (validity of output data), o_write (indicates a write operation), o_wdata (output data for write), o_be (byte enable for output data), and o_addr (address for output operations). Internal signals such as wbuf_used_r (tracks buffer usage), wbuf_*(arrays for storing data, address, byte enables, write flags), busy_reading_r (indicates an ongoing read), and ack_owed_r (manages acknowledgments) work together to control the flow and state of data within the module. The code blocks handle pushing and popping from the buffer, managing acknowledgments, updating internal state based on operations, and controlling the data passed to the output ports, ensuring the module operates accurately and efficiently in interfacing with the Wishbone bus.\n"
