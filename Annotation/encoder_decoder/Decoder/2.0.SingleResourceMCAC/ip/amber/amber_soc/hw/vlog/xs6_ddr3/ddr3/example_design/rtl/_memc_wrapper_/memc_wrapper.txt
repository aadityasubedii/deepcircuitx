This module serves as a wrapper for a memory controller interface, supporting multiple memory ports and AXI interfaces. It manages memory operations by handling clock inputs, reset signals, and memory interface signals. The module implements command, write, and read operations for each port, utilizing corresponding clocks, enable signals, data, and status indicators. It instantiates an mcb_ui_top module for core memory controller logic and provides a standardized interface between the memory controller and the rest of the system.
