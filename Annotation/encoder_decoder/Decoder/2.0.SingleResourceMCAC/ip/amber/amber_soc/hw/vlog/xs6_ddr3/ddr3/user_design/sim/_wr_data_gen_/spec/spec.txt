Module name: wr_data_gen.

Module specification: The `wr_data_gen` module is tailored for generating write data patterns crucial for memory controller systems, primarily for FPGA families such as SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6. It supports dynamic data operations like PRBS sequences or fixed data patterns by utilizing input configurations such as data width, address width, burst lengths, and more. The key inputs include `clk_i` (clock), `rst_i` (reset), and `cmd_valid_i` signals alongside data mode controls which dictate the operational mode of data generation. The outputs of the module consist of `cmd_rdy_o` (command ready signal), `data_valid_o` (data validity), and `data_o` (data output bus), which are essential for signaling the state of data and command readiness to other parts of the system. 

Internally, the module uses multiple control and state registers (`cmd_rdy`, `cmd_start`, `data_valid`, `user_burst_cnt`) to manage data flow and command execution. It also manipulates internal counters to monitor burst lengths and command initiation conditions. Two sub-modules (`sp6_data_gen` and `v6_data_gen`) are conditionally instantiated based on the FPGA family, which further specialize data generation processes in adapting to specific system architectures. The primary sections in the code handle state initialization, data generation, command readiness, and interfacing with these sub-modules based on the operational parameters set by input configurations. The `fifo_not_full` wire is critical for managing the flow control of data, ensuring that data transfers align with external memory or FIFO statuses.

Overall, the module plays a vital role in interfacing with memory controllers, enabling efficient data handling and flow control tailored for specific FPGA implementations, and is designed to respond dynamically to real-time changes in command or system states.
