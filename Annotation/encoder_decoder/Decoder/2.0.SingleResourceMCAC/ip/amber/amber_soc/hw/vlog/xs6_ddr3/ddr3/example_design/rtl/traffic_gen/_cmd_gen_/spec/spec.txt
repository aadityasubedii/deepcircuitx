Module name: cmd_gen. Module specification: The cmd_gen module is a command generator for memory controllers, designed to generate memory commands (read, write, refresh) with various address patterns (fixed, sequential, PRBS) and burst lengths. It supports different FPGA families (Spartan-6 and Virtex-6) and can be configured for different memory widths and burst lengths. The module takes inputs such as clk_i, rst_i, run_traffic_i, rd_buff_avail_i, and various configuration parameters (e.g., start_addr_i, end_addr_i, addr_mode_i, data_mode_i, instr_mode_i, bl_mode_i) to control its operation. It outputs addr_o, instr_o, bl_o, cmd_o_vld, and bram_rdy_o, which provide
