This functionality enables the debugging and analysis of the behavior of the design under simulation. The module checks for a compile-time flag `AMBER_DUMP_VCD` to enable its functionality. It initiates by displaying the dump range and setting up the dump file, then selectively dumps variables related to the simulation's various units like registers, caches, fetch, decode units etc. The dumping can be toggled on and off based on specific clock cycles or predefined conditions within the simulation environment. This is useful for focusing the trace on interesting points of the simulation without overwhelming the output with unnecessary data. Additionally, conditional compilation options like `AMBER_A25_CORE` allow for more specific configurations relevant to certain types of cores, showing the module's adaptability to different simulation environments."

Instead, it accesses global variables and uses system tasks for dumping state information, tailored for simulation and debugging purposes.\n\nInput ports: None. \nExplanation: Since `dumpvcd` does not have defined input ports, it relies on globally predefined conditions and flags to control its functionality, such as the `AMBER_DUMP_VCD` flag, the clock signals, and macros that specify conditions for dumping simulation data.\n\nOutput ports: None.\nExplanation: Similarly to input ports, `dumpvcd` has no output ports.
