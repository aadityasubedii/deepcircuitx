Module name: generic_sram_byte_en. Module specification: The "generic_sram_byte_en" Verilog module simulates a byte-addressable Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) that supports selective byte-write capability. It operates based on a clock signal provided through the `i_clk` input port. The module takes a `DATA_WIDTH`-bit wide data bus `i_write_data` for writing data to the memory, controlled by the `i_write_enable` signal; if high, a write operation is enabled, otherwise, a read operation occurs. The `i_address` input specifies the memory location for either reading or writing. `i_byte_enable` determines which bytes in the memory word are modified during a write operation. The output `o_read_data` outputs the memory content from the specified address on read operations. Internally, the module uses a memory array `mem` storing the SRAM data, and an integer `i` for looping through the data bytes during write operations. The code incorporates an 'always' block triggered on the rising edge of `i_clk` which checks the write enable status to either output the current memory data at `i_address` or modify specific bytes based on `i_byte_enable`. The nested loop within this block handles byte-wise conditional data writing, ensuring only specified bytes are updated as per the byte-enable signals. This module provides a flexible and efficient mechanism for handling SRAM operations with byte granularity.
