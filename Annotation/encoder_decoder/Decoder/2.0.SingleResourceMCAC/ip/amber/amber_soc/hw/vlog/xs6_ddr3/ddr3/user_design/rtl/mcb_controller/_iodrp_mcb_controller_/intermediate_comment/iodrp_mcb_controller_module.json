    "module": "The iodrp_mcb_controller module manages dynamic reconfiguration port (DRP) interfacing for memory cell operations, handling both read and write tasks based on incoming commands. It utilizes internal registers for data/address storage, a finite state machine (FSM) for controlling sequential operations influenced by signals like command validity and operation type, and implements shifting mechanisms for data transformation during transmission, ensuring synchronized and controlled interaction with the DRP system."
