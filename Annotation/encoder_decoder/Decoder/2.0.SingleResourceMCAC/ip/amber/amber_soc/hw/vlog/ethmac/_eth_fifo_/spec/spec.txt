Module name: eth_fifo.

Module specification: The `eth_fifo` module is a parameterizable, synchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer designed primarily for Ethernet data handling within FPGA platforms, notably the Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. The module operates with fundamental operations like data writing and reading, in addition to status indications like full, almost full, empty, and almost empty conditions. It accommodates various FIFO operations synchronized by the `clk` (clock) input along with an asynchronous `reset`. Inputs include `write` and `read` controls that manage data transactions provided the FIFO isn't full or empty, respectively, as well as a `clear` signal for FIFO reset under specific conditions, with `data_in` serving as the input data bus. Output indicators such as `data_out` for the FIFO's output data, `almost_full`, `full`, `almost_empty`, `empty`, and a `cnt` representing the count of items in the FIFO provide essential status and data outputs. The module employs internal signal arrays and register pointers: `fifo` for data storage, `data_out` for outputting data, `cnt` for keeping a count of the stored items, `read_pointer`, and `write_pointer` for managing read and write operations within the FIFO buffer. Operationally, the module diverges in implementation between generic FPGAs and Xilinx-specific distributed RAM setup, the latter using a specialized `xilinx_dist_ram` component for memory management. Blocks of sequential logic control read and write operations including pointer calculations and data transfer based on clock edges, effectively managing the FIFO's internal state and ensuring data integrity and timely access.
