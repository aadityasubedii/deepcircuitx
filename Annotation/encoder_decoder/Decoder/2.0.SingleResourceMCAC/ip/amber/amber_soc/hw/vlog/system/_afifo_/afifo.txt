The 'afifo' module implements an asynchronous FIFO buffer to facilitate secure data transfer between different clock domains using separate write and read clocks. It handles data writes when the FIFO is not full and reads when not empty, using Gray code for pointer management to ensure only one bit changes at a time, reducing synchronization errors across clock domains. The module employs internal registers for pointers and their delayed versions, alongside dedicated procedural blocks for processing on rising edges of write and read clocks.
