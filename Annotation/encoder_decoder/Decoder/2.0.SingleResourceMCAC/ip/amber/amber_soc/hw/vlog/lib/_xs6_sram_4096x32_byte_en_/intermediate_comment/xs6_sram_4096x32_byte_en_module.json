    "module": "This module implements a 4096x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality. It uses 8 RAMB16BWER primitives to create a 32-bit wide memory with 4096 addresses, divided into two banks. The module supports separate read and write ports, allowing simultaneous operations. It features byte-level write operations through the byte enable input and includes initialization parameters for each SRAM block. The design uses multiplexing to select between the two banks for read operations and manages write enables for individual bytes in each bank."
