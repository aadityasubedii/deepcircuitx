This module generates memory commands (read, write, refresh) with configurable addressing modes and burst lengths for memory interfaces. It supports different FPGA families and data widths, implementing address generation using sequential, fixed, and PRBS methods. The module manages command timing, handles buffer availability, and supports various instruction and burst length modes. It includes features for traffic generation patterns and can interface with external BRAM for command sequences. The implementation uses state machines, counters, and PRBS generators to create diverse command patterns while adhering to memory timing and buffer constraints.
