It handles both read and write requests. For write operations, it buffers data and command information when the command queue is full, and outputs the data and command when the queue is available. For read operations, it manages the read request signals and outputs data from the DDR3 based on the Wishbone address lines. The module supports dynamic switching between 32-bit and 128-bit data paths based on a parameter (WB_DWIDTH). Additionally, it ensures responses to the Wishbone bus requests by acknowledging read and write operations appropriately."
