Module name: a23_ram_register_bank. 
Module specification: The "a23_ram_register_bank" is a Verilog module designed to simulate a register bank for a processor, handling register operations such as loading, storing, and updating based on different operating modes and commands. It integrates multiple input and output ports: Input ports include `i_clk` (clock signal), `i_fetch_stall` (stall fetch operations), various mode signals like `i_mode_exec` and `i_mode_exec_nxt` (current and next execution modes), `i_user_mode_regs_load` (indicates if user mode registers are being loaded), and `i_rm_sel`, `i_rds_sel`, `i_rn_sel` (register selectors). Output ports consist of `o_rm`, `o_rs`, `o_rd`, `o_rn` (register outputs as selected by input selectors), and `o_pc` (Program Counter output). Internally, the module uses signals such as `mode_idec`, `mode_exec`, and `mode_rds` to determine register access conditions, and address signals like `rm_addr`, `rds_addr`, `rn_addr`, and `wr_addr` to specify which registers to read or write. Arrays `reg_ram_n`, `reg_ram_m`, `reg_ram_ds` represent different sets of registers storing state data. The module code is divided into sections handling assignments of modes, addresses, register outputs, and updates to the registers within a main always block triggered by the rising edge of `i_clk`, executing operations unless stalled by `i_fetch_stall`. This design addresses typical operations within a CPU's register management system, allowing interaction with key components like ALUs and memory controllers, crucial for executing arithmetic/logic operations and managing CPU state transitions effectively.
