Module name: eth_rxethmac.

Module specification: The `eth_rxethmac` module is designed to handle the reception of Ethernet frames for a MAC (Media Access Control) layer. It processes incoming data from the physical layer, verifies the integrity of Ethernet frames, manages frame boundaries, addresses, and errors such as CRC mismatches. The module includes input ports such as `MRxClk` (receive clock), `MRxDV` (data valid), `MRxD` (4-bit data from PHY), and `Reset` (reset signal), among others that help define operational parameters like frame length and address filtering needs. The output ports include `RxData` (processed data output), `RxValid` (validity of `RxData`), and `RxEndFrm` (marks the end of a frame), along with several signals for state indication and error detection like `CrcError` and `StateIdle`. Key internal signals like `MRxDEqD` and `CrcHash` assist with comparing incoming data against expected patterns and storing parts of the calculated CRC, respectively. The module encompasses several sub-modules such as `eth_rxstatem`, `eth_rxcounters`, and `eth_rxaddrcheck`, which respectively manage state transitions based on incoming data, count bytes and manage frame integrity, and validate receiving frame addresses against expected MAC and multicast addresses. The combination of these components and their interactions ensures accurate processing and error management for each Ethernet frame received.
