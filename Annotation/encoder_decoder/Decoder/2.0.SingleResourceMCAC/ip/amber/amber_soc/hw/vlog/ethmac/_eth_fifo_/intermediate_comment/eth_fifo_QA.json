It uses separate pointers for reading and writing to manage the data flow, adjusting based on the FIFO's current state and external command signals.

This register is updated every cycle where a read operation occurs and the FIFO is not empty.\n- `cnt` (Content counter): A counter that tracks the total number of data entries currently stored in the FIFO. It increases with every write operation that is not accompanied by a simultaneous read, and decreases with every read operation that is not accompanied by a simultaneous write.\n- `read_pointer` (FIFO read pointer): A pointer used to keep track of the position from which to read data next. It increments with each read operation, provided the FIFO is not empty, and wraps around when it reaches the end of the buffer.\n- `write_pointer` (FIFO write pointer): A pointer used to indicate where the next data entry should be written in the FIFO.
