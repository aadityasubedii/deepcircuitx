    "module": "This module serves as a top-level wrapper for a memory controller block (MCB) with user interface and AXI options. It integrates a raw MCB wrapper, AXI interfaces, and arbitration logic, supporting up to 6 configurable ports. The module manages clocks, translates addresses, and controls data flow between user/AXI interfaces and the memory controller. It implements clock management using BUFPLL_MCB, handles port-specific signals, and provides flexible interfacing through either native MCB or AXI protocols. The design includes calibration logic and supports various DDR memory types."
