    "module": "This module implements a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) interface with configurable baud rates and FIFO buffers. It handles serial data transmission and reception, supports interrupt generation, and flow control (CTS/RTS). The module interfaces with a Wishbone bus for control and data transfer, and includes separate transmit and receive state machines. It supports both FIFO-enabled and non-FIFO modes, with configurable parameters such as data bits and stop bits. The implementation includes clock-based bit timing, FIFO management, and register-based control and status reporting."
