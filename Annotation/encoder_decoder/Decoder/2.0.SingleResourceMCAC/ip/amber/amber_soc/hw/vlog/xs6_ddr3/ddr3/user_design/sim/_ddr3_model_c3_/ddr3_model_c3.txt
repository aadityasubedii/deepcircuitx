This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM device, modeling its functionality and timing characteristics. It implements key DDR3 features including initialization, mode register programming, refresh operations, read/write commands, and power-down modes. The module uses input ports for control signals and addresses, output ports for termination, and inout ports for data transfer. Internal signals manage timing parameters, mode register settings, bank status, and operation counters. The implementation includes tasks for command decoding, data handling, and timing checks, ensuring compliance with DDR3 specifications such as setup/hold times, burst operations, and DQS behavior.
