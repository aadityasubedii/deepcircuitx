    "module": "The eth_spram_256x32 module implements a single-port RAM with 256 words of 32 bits each, synchronized to a clock input for read and write operations. It is controlled by signals for chip enable, write enable, output enable, and an address bus, allowing byte-wise data manipulation. Conditional compilation supports different FPGA families with specific or generic SRAM block instantiations, managing byte-enabled read/write functionality efficiently."
