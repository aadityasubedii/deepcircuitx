This module implements a DDR3 memory controller interface, supporting multiple command, write, and read ports for DDR3 SDRAM. It instantiates a memory controller wrapper and infrastructure components, handling clock generation, reset signals, and memory-specific control signals. The module is highly parameterized, allowing configuration of memory timings, port settings, and calibration options. It interfaces with DDR3 memory through various input/output ports and internal signals, managing data transfer, address/control signaling, and status reporting for up to six ports.
