    "module": "This module implements a DDR3 memory controller interface for Xilinx FPGAs. It manages multiple read/write ports, handles clock and reset signals, and interfaces with external DDR3 SDRAM. The module uses an infrastructure block for clock/reset management and a memory controller wrapper to implement the DDR3 interface, including calibration, command processing, and data transfer through multiple ports (p0 to p5) with configurable parameters for timing, bus widths, and memory organization."
