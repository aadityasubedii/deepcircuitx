    "module": "The `a23_core` module serves as a CPU core, managing instruction cycles including fetch, decode, execute, and coprocessor interfacing primarily for ARM-like architectures. It uses the Wishbone bus protocol for memory interactions, handles interrupts through dedicated inputs, and contains internal logic blocks (fetch, decode, execute, coprocessor) that process instructions progressively, each performing specialized tasks to ensure efficient operation and communication within the system."
