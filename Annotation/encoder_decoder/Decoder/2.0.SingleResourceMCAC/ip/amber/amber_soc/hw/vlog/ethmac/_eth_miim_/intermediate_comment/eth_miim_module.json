    "module": "The 'eth_miim' module manages the Media Independent Interface operations with Ethernet PHY devices, handling MDIO interface operations such as read, write, and status monitoring. Implementation employs multiple input and output ports for data and control signals, internal registers for state and timing control, and sub-modules like clock generator, shift register, and output control to handle specific tasks such as clock management, data transmission, and signal output, ensuring efficient synchronization and data integrity in communication with PHY devices."
