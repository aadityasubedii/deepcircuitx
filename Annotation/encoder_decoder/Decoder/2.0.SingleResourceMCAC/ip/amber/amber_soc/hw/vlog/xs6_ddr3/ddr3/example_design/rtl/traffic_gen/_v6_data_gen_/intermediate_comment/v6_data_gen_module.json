    "module": "This module generates various data patterns for memory testing and simulation. It supports address-based, PRBS, walking 1/0, neighbor, and fixed data patterns. The module uses input parameters and control signals to determine the type of data pattern to generate and when to output data. It implements different data generation algorithms based on the selected mode, including PRBS generation, address-based calculations, and predefined pattern sequences. The module also includes logic for handling different memory burst lengths and data shuffling operations, making it suitable for testing various memory configurations and scenarios."
