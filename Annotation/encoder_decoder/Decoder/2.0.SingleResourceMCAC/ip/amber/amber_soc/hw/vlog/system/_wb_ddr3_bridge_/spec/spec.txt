Module name: wb_ddr3_bridge. 
Module specification: The 'wb_ddr3_bridge' module serves as an interface between a Wishbone bus and a DDR3 memory controller, designed primarily to manage read and write operations between these two systems. It includes a variety of input ports such as 'i_clk' (clock signal), 'i_wb_adr' (Wishbone address bus), 'i_wb_sel' (Wishbone byte select signals), 'i_wb_we' (Wishbone write enable signal), and others like 'i_wb_dat', 'i_wb_cyc', 'i_wb_stb', 'i_cmd_full', 'i_wr_full', 'i_rd_data', 'i_rd_empty', which manage data, addresses, write enables, and buffer statuses. The output ports, including 'o_wb_dat', 'o_wb_ack', 'o_wb_err', 'o_cmd_en', 'o_cmd_instr', 'o_cmd_byte_addr', 'o_wr_en', 'o_wr_mask', and 'o_wr_data', facilitate data output, acknowledgments, DDR3 command and data handling. Internal signals like 'start_write', 'start_read', 'start_write_d1', 'start_read_d1', 'start_read_hold', 'wb_adr_d1', 'ddr3_busy', 'read_ack', and 'read_ready', are used to control and synchronize the flow of data, assure timing correctness, and handle the DDR3 status signaling. The module's code is organized into blocks for handling DDR3 command setup, data writing, read operation synchronization, and debug displays. Each block is explicitly designed for specific tasks such as managing the DDR3 command execution, data transfer to and from DDR3, and debugging information during development phases. The clear delineation of input/output handling, internal signal management, and operational blocks establishes a robust framework for interfacing Wishbone and DDR3 components effectively.
