Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module performs soft calibration for a Memory Controller Block (MCB), handling initialization, termination calibration, and dynamic calibration of DQS signals. It uses input signals like UI_CLK (user interface clock), RST (reset), PLL_LOCK (PLL lock signal), and various MCB-related inputs to control the calibration process. Output signals include DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL (calibration completion), SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ (self-refresh request), and numerous MCB control signals. Internal signals such as STATE (current state of the calibration state machine), P_Term and N_Term (termination values), and DQS_DELAY (current DQS delay value) are used to manage the calibration process. The module is structured with several main blocks: a state machine controlling the overall calibration
