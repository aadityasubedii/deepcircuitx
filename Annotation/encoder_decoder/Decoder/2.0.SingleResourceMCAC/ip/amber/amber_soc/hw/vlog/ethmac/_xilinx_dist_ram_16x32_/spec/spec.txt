Module name: xilinx_dist_ram_16x32.
Module specification: The xilinx_dist_ram_16x32 module implements a distributed RAM with 16 address locations, each containing 32 bits, utilizing the Xilinx RAM16X1D primitives. The module includes input ports for the write enable (`we`), write clock (`wclk`), data input (`data_in`), read address (`read_address`), and write address (`write_address`). `we` controls whether data is written to the specified address during the write operation, `wclk` synchronizes data writing, `data_in` is a 32-bit bus carrying the data to be written, `read_address` is a 4-bit address for data read operations, and `write_address` is a 4-bit address for data write operations. The module outputs the read data through the `data_out` port, a 32-bit bus that outputs data stored at the address specified by `read_address`. Internally, the module uses signals `waddr` and `raddr` as mirrors of `write_address` and `read_address`, respectively, to specify addresses for read and write operations in the RAM16X1D instances. The module extensively utilizes instances of RAM16X1D for each bit of the 32-bit data buses, with separate instances handling the corresponding bit positions in `data_in` and `data_out`. Each RAM16X1D primitive is configured with address lines linked to either `waddr` for write operations or `raddr` for read operations, allowing simultaneous read and write activities to different addresses.
