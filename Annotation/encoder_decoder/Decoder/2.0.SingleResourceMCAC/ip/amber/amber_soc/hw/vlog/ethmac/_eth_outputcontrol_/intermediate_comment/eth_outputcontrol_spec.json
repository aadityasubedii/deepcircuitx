    "spec": "Module name: eth_outputcontrol. Module specification: The eth_outputcontrol module is designed for managing the output signals of an Ethernet MDIO interface, particularly during write operations. This module controls whether and how data is sent out through the MDIO interface based on a variety of inputs and internal logic. It accepts several input ports including Clk (a clock signal for synchronization), Reset (to initialize the internal state), InProgress (indicating an ongoing operation), ShiftedBit (current data bit to be sent), BitCounter (tracks the position in the data sequence), WriteOp (distinguishes write operations from others), NoPre (controls the usage of preamble), and MdcEn_n (an active-low enable signal for the management data clock). The module produces two outputs, Mdo (the actual data line for transmitting bits) and MdoEn (which enables or disables the Mdo signal). Internally, the module utilizes signals such as SerialEn to decide when serial transmission should be active, and MdoEn_2d, MdoEn_d, Mdo_2d, Mdo_d which are responsible for ensuring signal stability and proper timing through delaying the outputs. The Verilog code includes two primary always blocks: the first block handles the reset conditions and the serialization enable conditions for the output enable signal, MdoEn, while the second block manages output data timing and reset conditions for the Mdo signal, ensuring data coherence and synchronization with system clock and reset behavior.",

It essentially sets the criteria for when the data outputs (Mdo and MdoEn) should be active based on both the type of operation (read/write) and the progress of the bit transfer.\n- **MdoEn_2d, MdoEn_d**: These are delayed versions of the `MdoEn` signal, used to ensure stability and proper timing of the output enable signal (`MdoEn`). The delays help in synchronizing the output enable timing with the clock and the rest of the system, particularly important in high-speed digital designs to avoid glitches and ensure clean signal transitions.\n- **Mdo_2d, Mdo_d**: Similar to `MdoEn_2d` and `MdoEn_d`, these are delayed versions of the `Mdo` signal.
