Module name: xs6_sram_256x21_line_en.  
Module specification:  
The xs6_sram_256x21_line_en Verilog module serves as an interface for a dual-port RAM block leveraging Single Data Rate (SDR) operations, designed specifically for enabling both read and write functionalities. This module operates on a 21-bit wide data interface controlled via an 8-bit address signal. Input signals include `i_clk` for module clock synchronization, `i_write_data` supplying the data to be written into the RAM, `i_write_enable` as a control signal that dictates when the data is written (high) or read (low), and `i_address` specifying the read/write location in the RAM. The single output, `o_read_data`, outputs the read data from RAM, selectively aggregated and rearranged from internal signals `read_data_lo` and `read_data_hi`. These internal signals store the lower and upper portions of the data fetched from the RAM, respectively. The RAMB8BWER submodule configured within implicates the instantiation of the RAM device using parameters for data and address management and timings, adhering to a READ_FIRST write mode. Parameters `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDRESS_WIDTH` are verified at initialization to ensure correct module configuration.
