Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: This module serves as a top-level wrapper for a memory controller block (MCB) with user interface (UI) and AXI interface options. It integrates various components including a raw MCB wrapper, AXI interfaces, and arbitration logic. The module supports multiple ports (up to 6) that can be configured as either native MCB interfaces or AXI interfaces. It handles clock management, address translation, and data flow between the user/AXI interfaces and the memory controller. Input ports include clock and reset signals, port-specific control signals, calibration and UI signals, and AXI interface signals. Output ports include clock-related signals, port-specific status signals, memory interface signals, calibration and status outputs, and AXI interface output signals. Internal signals are used to connect the mcb_raw_wrapper instance with either the native MCB interface or the A
