    "module": "The `write_data_path` module manages memory write operations by interfacing with a memory data path, leveraging a variety of signal inputs like command validations and burst lengths for controlled data flow. It incorporates the `wr_data_gen` submodule for data generation based on patterns derived from inputs such as PRBS seeds and mode configurations, effectively computing outputs that coordinate the readiness and validity of data, including the sequence of write operations indicated by signals like `last_word_wr_o` and `data_wr_end_o`."
