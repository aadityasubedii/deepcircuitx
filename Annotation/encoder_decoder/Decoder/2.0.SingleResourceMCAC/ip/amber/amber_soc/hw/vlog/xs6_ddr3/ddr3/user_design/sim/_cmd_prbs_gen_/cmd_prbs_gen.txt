The `cmd_prbs_gen` module generates pseudorandom binary sequences using a configurable Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). It supports various PRBS configurations through parameters such as width and seed settings, adapting to different operational needs like address masking for specific FPGA families. Input ports manage clocking and initialization, while internal registers and conditions within `generate` blocks implement the sequence generation logic, allowing for flexible PRBS pattern production based on selected configurations.
