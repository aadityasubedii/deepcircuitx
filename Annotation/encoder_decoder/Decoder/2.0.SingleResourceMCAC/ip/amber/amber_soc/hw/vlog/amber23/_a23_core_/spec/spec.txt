Module name: a23_core. 
Module specification: The `a23_core` is a central processing unit module designed for handling instruction fetch, decode, execution, and interaction with a coprocessor in systems potentially based on ARM architecture. It synchronizes internal operations using the input clock signal `i_clk`. Interrupt handling is managed through `i_irq` for normal interrupts and `i_firq` for fast interrupts, while `i_system_rdy` indicates system readiness for operations. The module communicates with external memory or peripherals using the Wishbone bus protocol, supported by outputs like `o_wb_adr` for addressing, `o_wb_sel` for byte selection, `o_wb_we` for write enable, and `o_wb_dat` for data output, and inputs `i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_ack`, and `i_wb_err` for data input, transaction acknowledgment, and error signaling respectively. Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `execute_address` for holding current instruction address, `write_data` for data to be written during execution, and `status_bits_mode` for current processor status. The module is logically divided into smaller blocks including `a23_fetch` for fetching instructions, `a23_decode` for instruction decoding, `a23_execute` for executing instructions, and `a23_coprocessor` for managing coprocessor-related operations, each handling specific aspects of processor functionality. This structure emphasizes efficient instruction cycle management, effective interrupt handling, and flexible memory interactions, crucial for the operational integrity of the CPU core in a computing system.
