    "module": "The `afifo` module implements an asynchronous FIFO buffer to manage data across different clock domains using separate clocks for read and write operations. It uses Gray code counters for pointer tracking, ensuring data integrity during asynchronous transfers. The module features synchronization blocks and continuously manages internal states to handle FIFO conditions like full, empty, and almost full, using combinational and sequential logic efficiently within clocked processes."
