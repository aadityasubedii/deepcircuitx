Module name: eth_registers. Module specification: The eth_registers module implements an Ethernet controller's register file, managing various control and status registers for Ethernet operations. It handles reading and writing of registers for configuring parameters such as MAC addresses, interrupts, MII settings, packet lengths, and flow control. The module has input ports for data (DataIn), address (Address), read/write control (Rw), chip select (Cs), clocks (Clk, TxClk, RxClk), reset (Reset), and various control signals. Output ports include data out (DataOut), configuration settings (e.g., r_RecSmall, r_Pad, r_HugEn), and status flags. Internal signals are used for register selection, write operations, and synchronization between clock domains. The module is structured with multiple register blocks for different Ethernet parameters, interrupt handling logic, and clock domain crossing synchron
