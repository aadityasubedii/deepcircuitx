It supports both read and write operations as determined by the control signals. Depending on the data width parameters (`WB_DWIDTH`), which can be 32 or 128 bits, the module adapts its internal operation accordingly. Memory operations are performed based on address and data inputs received, with proper acknowledgment (`o_wb_ack`) and error handling (`o_wb_err`). The reactive behavior is clocked (`i_clk`), ensuring synchronous operation. The module uses a generated memory mask for enabling selective data writing and generates output data (`o_wb_dat`) based on the read operations. The module structure uses Generate statements to cater to different configurations, aiding in modular and scalable hardware design."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports: \n- `i_clk`: Clock input. Used to synchronize the operations of the memory interface.\n- `i_mem_ctrl`: Memory control signal. Directs how addresses should be modified before accessing memory.\n- `i_wb_adr`: Address input from the bus. Specifies the memory address for read or write operations.\n- `i_wb_sel`: Byte select signals. Used to specify active byte lanes for data bus utilization.\n- `i_wb_we`: Write enable signal. Determines whether the operation is a write (when high) or read (when low).\n- `i_wb_dat`: Data input from the bus. Contains data to be written to the memory during write operations.\n- `i_wb_cyc`: Cycle valid signal. Indicates if the bus cycle is valid.\n- `i_wb_stb`: Strobe signal. Shows that the bus transfer is active.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `o_wb_dat`: Data output to the bus. Contains data read from the memory during read operations.\n- `o_wb_ack`: Acknowledge signal. Indicates successful completion of the read/write operation to the bus.\n- `o_wb_err`: Error signal. Indicates any errors during memory transactions (this is set to zero, showing no error handling in the current implementation).\n\nExplanation:\nThis module interfaces with a bus to perform memory operations. The `i_clk` port ensures that all transactions are synchronized with the system clock. The control inputs like `i_mem_ctrl`, `i_wb_we`, `i_wb_cyc`, and `i_wb_stb` control the flow and type of the operation. The data and address inputs (`i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_adr`, `i_wb_sel`) specify what data should be accessed or stored and at which memory location. The outputs (`o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_ack`, and `o_wb_err`) inform the bus about the data accessed, the successful completion of the operation, and any possible errors, facilitating effective and reliable memory management."
