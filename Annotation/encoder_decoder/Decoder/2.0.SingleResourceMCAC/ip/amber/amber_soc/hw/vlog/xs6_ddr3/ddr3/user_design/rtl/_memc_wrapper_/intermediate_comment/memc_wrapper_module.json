    "module": "The memc_wrapper module serves as a comprehensive interface for a memory controller, managing multiple ports and AXI interfaces. It implements a flexible memory access system by instantiating an internal mcb_ui_top module, which handles core memory controller functionality. The wrapper manages clock inputs, memory address and data lines, calibration signals, and various memory-related parameters. It provides separate command, write, and read interfaces for multiple ports (p0 to p5), as well as AXI interfaces (s0 to s5) for external device communication, allowing for efficient and configurable memory operations in complex systems."
