Module name: eth_macstatus. 
Module specification: The 'eth_macstatus' module is a vital part of the Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) layer, primarily focused on monitoring, managing, and updating various status signals related to Ethernet frame transmission and reception. It deals with error detection for received frames, frame length validation, collision status, and latching necessary status outputs for further handling in the Ethernet MAC system. This module processes several input signals including frame reception and transmission status (`MRxDV`, `TxStartFrm`), byte counters (`RxByteCnt`), collision detection (`Collision`), and frame error indicators (`RxCrcError`, `MRxErr`). The outputs are critical flags like `ReceivedLengthOK`, `ReceivedPacketGood`, `LatchedCrcError`, providing status feedback about packet integrity and correctness. Internal signals such as `TakeSample` manage the sampling of status signals while `SetInvalidSymbol` detects invalid symbol conditions during reception. The code is structured into multiple procedural blocks (`always` blocks) managing the updating of these status and control signals based on logic conditions and state machine outputs. Functionally, these blocks handle tasks such as latching error conditions, updating collision and packet size status, and managing retry counters during transmission attempts. The module offers comprehensive monitoring and control over the data integrity and status needed for reliable Ethernet communication.
