It handles both input termination calibration and dynamic DQS (Data Strobe) delay calibration. The module goes through multiple states to calibrate the RZQ and ZIO terminations, set up DQS delays, and dynamically adjust these delays based on measurements. It interfaces with IODRP (I/O Device, Reconfigurable Port) controllers to configure various settings and uses a state machine to manage the calibration process. The module also handles self-refresh requests and can skip certain calibration steps based on parameter settings."
