The FIFO has parameters for data size (DSIZE), FIFO depth, and address size (ASIZE). It interfaces with read and write operations distinguished by separate clocks, i.e., `wr_clk` for writing and `rd_clk` for reading. The module supports operations such as write enable (`wr_en`) and read enable (`rd_en`). It handles the pointers for read and write operations using Gray code to prevent errors during transitions. The FIFO indicates its state via output signals such as `full`, `empty`, and `almost_full`, informing whether the FIFO is full, empty, or almost full respectively."

Explanation:\n- `wr_clk`: Write clock input for write operations, managing the timing of data writing into the FIFO.\n- `rst`: Reset input, used to initialize or reset the FIFO's state and pointers.\n- `wr_en`: Write enable input, allows data to be written to the FIFO when asserted (`1`).\n- `wr_data`: Write data input, the data bus through which data to be written into the FIFO is supplied. Its width is specified by the parameter `DSIZE`.\n- `rd_en`: Read enable input, allows data to be read from the FIFO when asserted (`1`).\n- `rd_clk`: Read clock input for read operations, managing the timing of data reading from the FIFO.\n\nOutput ports: `rd_data, full, empty, almost_full`. Explanation:\n- `rd_data`: Read data output, the data bus through which data is read from the FIFO. Its width matches `DSIZE`.\n- `full`: Output signal that indicates the FIFO is full. It asserts when there is no space left to write additional data.\n- `empty`: Output signal that indicates the FIFO is empty. It asserts when there are no data elements left in the FIFO to read.\n- `almost_full`: Output signal that indicates the FIFO is almost full.
