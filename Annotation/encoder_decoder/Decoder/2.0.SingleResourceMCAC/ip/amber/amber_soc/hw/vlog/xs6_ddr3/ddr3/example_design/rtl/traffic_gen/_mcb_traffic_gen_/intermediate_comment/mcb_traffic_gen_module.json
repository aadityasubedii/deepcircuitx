    "module": "This module generates and manages traffic for memory controller blocks (MCB) in FPGA designs, simulating read and write operations to test memory interfaces. It implements configurable command and data generation, address management, and error detection. The module uses separate command generation, flow control, and data path components for reads and writes. It supports various addressing modes, instruction types, burst lengths, and data patterns. The design includes FIFOs for data buffering, error checking mechanisms, and status reporting functionalities to comprehensively test and validate memory operations."
