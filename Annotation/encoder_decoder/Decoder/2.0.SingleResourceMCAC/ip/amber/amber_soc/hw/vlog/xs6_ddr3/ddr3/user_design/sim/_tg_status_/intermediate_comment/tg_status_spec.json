    "spec": "Module name: tg_status.\nModule specification: The tg_status module is a critical monitoring unit in a Verilog design, intended to observe, detect, and report discrepancies related to data handling in real-time operations. Its key functionalities include detecting and logging data errors when there's a mismatch between compared data (`cmp_data_i`) and read data (`rd_data_i`). The input ports include the clock (`clk_i`), reset (`rst_i`), manual error clearing (`manual_clear_error`), data error signal (`data_error_i`), comparison and read data, comparison address (`cmp_addr_i`), burst length (`cmp_bl_i`), and memory controller statuses (`mcb_cmd_full_i`, `mcb_wr_full_i`, `mcb_rd_empty_i`). Output ports encompass an error status register (`error_status`) that concatenates various error data, and an error flag (`error`). Internal signals such as `data_error_r`, a delay register to capture the transition of `data_error_i`, and `error_set`, a flag indicating the logged error state, ensure robust error detection and logging. The code structure includes initialization of internal states under reset conditions, error logging on detecting the initial error occurrence, and maintaining the error state until reset or manual clearance. This structured approach ensures accurate monitoring and facilitates downstream debugging and error handling.",

            "content": "Name of the module and its functionality is as follows: \nModule name: tg_status.\nExplanation: The tg_status module is designed as a monitoring unit that tracks and reports data errors during operation. Its primary function is to detect discrepancies between compared data and read data in real-time, and once a difference or error is observed when `data_error_i` goes high, it captures and logs specific data including the address (`cmp_addr_i`), burst length (`cmp_bl_i`), status of memory command queue (`mcb_cmd_full_i`), write full status (`mcb_wr_full_i`), and read empty status (`mcb_rd_empty_i`). An error flag (`error_set`) is also raised and maintained until a reset (`rst_i`) or manual clear (`manual_clear_error`) is triggered. The details of the error (data values, addresses, and conditions leading to the error) are stored in the `error_status` output for downstream use or debugging. The `error_status` is a larger concatenated register which also holds the comparison data (`cmp_data_i`) and the read data (`rd_data_i`). The error flag is output through the `error` signal. This module also utilizes a flip-flop `data_error_r` initialized asynchronously to manage the state and timing of incoming error signals reliably."

Explanation:\n- `clk_i`: Clock input. It is used to synchronize the internal operations of the module, including data capturing and status updates.\n- `rst_i`: Reset input. It is used to reset the module's internal registers, clearing any existing errors and statuses.\n- `manual_clear_error`: Manual error clear input. It allows for manual intervention to clear any reported errors without resetting the entire module.\n- `data_error_i`: Data error input. When driven high, it indicates that there is a discrepancy between the compared data and the read data, triggering the error logging mechanism.\n- `cmp_data_i`: Comparison data input. This is the data that is expected during operations and is compared against the read data from the memory.\n- `rd_data_i`: Read data input. This is the actual data read from the memory which is compared against the comparison data.\n- `cmp_addr_i`: Comparison address input. This is the memory address from which the comparison data is read, logged if an error is detected.\n- `cmp_bl_i`: Burst length input. Indicates the length of the data burst during operation, logged if an error is detected.\n- `mcb_cmd_full_i`: Memory command queue full status. Indicates whether the command queue of the memory controller is full.\n- `mcb_wr_full_i`: Write full status. Indicates whether the write buffer of the memory controller is full.\n- `mcb_rd_empty_i`: Read empty status. Indicates whether the read buffer of the memory controller is empty. \n\nOutput ports: `error_status`, `error`. Explanation:\n- `error_status`: Error status output. It is a large concatenated register that records comprehensive error-related data including the erroneous address, burst length, comparison data, read data, and various statuses associated with memory operations when an error is detected.\n- `error`: Error flag output. It is a signal that is set high when an error is detected and remains high until it is cleared by a reset or manual clear, indicating the presence of an error."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: `data_error_r`, `error_set`. \nExplanation:\n- `data_error_r`: This is a register used to store the previous state of the `data_error_i` signal. It acts as a delay element, allowing the module to detect a rising edge on the `data_error_i` input, which is crucial for identifying the transition point at which an error initially occurs. This is used in the module to log errors only on the transition from no error to error.\n- `error_set`: This signal is a register that serves as a flag to indicate whether an error has been detected and logged. Once set, it remains set until the module is reset or manually cleared through `manual_clear_error`. This ensures that once an error is recognized, it is properly flagged and reported until appropriate action is taken to address it. It directly drives the output `error`, representing the error presence state externally."
