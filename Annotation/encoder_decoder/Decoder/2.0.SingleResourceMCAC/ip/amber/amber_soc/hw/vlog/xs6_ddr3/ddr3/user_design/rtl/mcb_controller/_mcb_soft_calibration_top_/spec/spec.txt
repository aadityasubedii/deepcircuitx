Module name: mcb_soft_calibration_top. 

Module specification: The 'mcb_soft_calibration_top' module is designed for DDR memory calibration within a memory controller system. It efficiently integrates both software and hardware calibration mechanisms to optimize memory operations. It features input ports such as `UI_CLK` for the main system clock, `RST` for reset, `IOCLK` for IO delay adjustments, and `PLL_LOCK` for stability indicators, among others. Notably, it handles signals like `SELFREFRESH_REQ` and `SELFREFRESH_MCB_MODE` to manage self-refresh states for power efficiency. The output ports include `DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL`, which signals the completion of calibration processes, and `SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ`, which indicates a request for self-refresh mode in memory, among various control signals directly managing the memory controller buffer (MCB). Internal signals like `IODRP_ADD`, `IODRP_SDI`, and `IODRP_SDO` interface with the IO delay and phase detector for precise calibration adjustment. The primary instantiated blocks include `mcb_soft_calibration` handling the operands for MCB interaction and `IODRP2` for detailed control over IO delay using additional signals like `DOUT` and `TOUT` for output setup and tristate control. The module also contains regeneration statements for DDR types to manage specific calibration processes dependent on memory types and calibration configurations.
