This module implements an Ethernet controller's register file, managing various control and status registers for Ethernet operations. It handles reading and writing of registers for MAC addresses, interrupts, MII settings, packet lengths, and flow control. The module uses multiple register blocks for different Ethernet parameters, implements interrupt handling logic, and includes clock domain crossing synchronization. It processes input signals for data, address, and control, and outputs configuration settings and status flags. The module also manages interrupt generation and synchronization between different clock domains (TxClk, RxClk, and system Clk).
