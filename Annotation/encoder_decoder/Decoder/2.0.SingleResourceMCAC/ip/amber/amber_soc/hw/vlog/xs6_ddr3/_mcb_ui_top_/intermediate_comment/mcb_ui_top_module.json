    "module": "This module implements a Memory Controller Block (MCB) user interface top-level wrapper, supporting multiple ports and AXI interfaces for memory operations. It integrates clock management, core MCB functionality, and port-specific interfaces. The module uses a BUFPLL_MCB for clock signals, an mcb_raw_wrapper for MCB operations, and generates either native MCB or AXI-to-MCB bridges for each port based on configuration parameters. It handles memory read/write operations, arbitration, and supports various memory types and configurations, providing a flexible interface for memory control in FPGA designs."
