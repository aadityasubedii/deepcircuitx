The `interrupt_controller` module manages hardware interrupts by interfacing with a Wishbone bus, handling interrupts from devices like UARTs and an Ethernet MAC. It processes input signals to read/write interrupt-related registers and generates output signals indicating the presence of interrupts. The implementation includes register setups for enabling/disabling interrupts, logic to prioritize and aggregate interrupt signals, and bus transaction handling for data communication, all synchronized by the system clock. Debugging support is embedded for development, guided by compile-time flags.
