Module name: xs6_sram_4096x32_byte_en. Module specification: This module implements a 4096x32-bit SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) with byte-enable functionality using 8 RAMB16BWER (Xilinx Spartan-6 Block RAM) primitives. It supports 32-bit wide memory with 4096 addresses, divided into two banks (b0 and b1) to accommodate the full address range. The module has five input ports: i_clk (clock input), i_write_data (32-bit input data), i_write_enable (write enable signal), i_address (12-bit address input), and i_byte_enable (4-bit input for individual byte writes). It has one output port: o_read_data (32-bit output data). Internal signals include wea_b0 an
