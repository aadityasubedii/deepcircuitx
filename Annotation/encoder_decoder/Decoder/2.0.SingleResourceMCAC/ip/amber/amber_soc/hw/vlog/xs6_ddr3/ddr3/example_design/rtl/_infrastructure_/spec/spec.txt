Module name: infrastructure. Module specification: The "infrastructure" module is designed to manage and configure clock signals within a digital system, particularly using a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) to generate multiple output clocks with specific frequencies, phases, and duty cycles. It handles both differential (sys_clk_p, sys_clk_n) and single-ended (sys_clk) input clocks, providing better noise immunity or simpler infrastructure respectively. The module outputs include clk0 (buffered output clock), rst0 (synchronized reset signal), async_rst (combines system reset input and PLL lock status), several high-speed clock signals like sysclk_2x and sysclk_2x_180, mcb_drp_clk (for precise clocking needs), pll_ce_0 and pll_ce_90 (clock enables with phase shifts), and pll_lock (indicates PLL lock status). Internal signals such as clk_2x_0, clk_2x_180, clk0_bufg, and others facilitate the manipulation and buffering of the clock signals and synchronization logic. The Verilog code comprises multiple blocks including clock buffers, PLL configuration (PLL_ADV), clock generation decisions based on input type (differential or single-ended), and reset signal management, all aimed at ensuring stable and reliable clock outputs under various configurations and conditions.
