    "module": "This module implements a 2048x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA primitives. It employs four 2048x8-bit RAMB16BWER blocks to create a 32-bit wide memory, supporting read and write operations with byte-level granularity. The module features synchronous operation, initialized memory contents, and selective byte writing through individual write enable signals. It combines the outputs of the four RAMB16BWER blocks to form the 32-bit read data, allowing efficient storage and retrieval of data in a compact, FPGA-optimized design."
