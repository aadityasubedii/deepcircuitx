Module name: eth_transmitcontrol. Module specification: The "eth_transmitcontrol" module controls the Ethernet transmission of pause frames in response to network conditions. It operates synchronously with the input clock `MTxClk` and can be reset using the `TxReset`. Its primary inputs include signals like `TxUsedDataIn`, acknowledging data usage by the transmitter, and `TPauseRq`, a request for a pause due to, for example, buffer full conditions, along with several others controlling flow, interruption, and CRC handling processes. Its outputs control the starts (`TxCtrlStartFrm`) and ends (`TxCtrlEndFrm`) of control frames, indicate ongoing transmission statuses (`SendingCtrlFrm`), and manage transmission data paths (`CtrlMux`). The module uses internal registers like `ByteCnt` for byte counting within a frame and `DlyCrcCnt` for counting CRC delays, and others to manage control flow transitions and timing of the transmission process. The code structure features several always blocks primarily handling different transmission states (e.g., starting, ending control frames) and multiplexer operations for routing internal data based on current byte counts and detected conditions. This thorough and synchronously designed control system ensures efficient management of Ethernet frame transmission under varying network demands.
