It uses 8 RAMB16BWER (Xilinx Spartan-6 Block RAM) primitives to create a 32-bit wide memory with 4096 addresses. The module supports byte-level write operations through the byte enable input. It has separate read and write ports, allowing for simultaneous read and write operations. The memory is divided into two banks (b0 and b1) to accommodate the full address range. The module also includes initialization parameters for each SRAM block, allowing pre-loading of data into the memory."

They control which bytes are written in each bank based on the input write enable and address.\n\n2. data_out_b0, data_out_b1: Arrays of 4 32-bit signals each, representing the output data from the 8 RAMB16BWER blocks (4 for each bank).\n\n3. read_data_b0, read_data_b1: 32-bit signals that combine the outputs from the 4 RAMB16BWER blocks in each bank to form the full 32-bit data output.\n\n4. address_11_r: A 1-bit registered version of the 11th bit of the input address.
