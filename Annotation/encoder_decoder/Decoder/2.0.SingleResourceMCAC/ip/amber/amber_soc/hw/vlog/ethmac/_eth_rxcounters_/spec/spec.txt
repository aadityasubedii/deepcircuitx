Module name: eth_rxcounters. Module specification: The `eth_rxcounters` module is devoted to managing and tracking various data metrics and conditions pertinent to the receipt of Ethernet frames. Primarily, it handles byte counts and Interframe Gap (IFG) counting. It operates under a specific reception clock (`MRxClk`) and features input ports such as `Reset` (resets counters), `MRxDV` (data validity), state indicators (`StateIdle`, `StateSFD`, `StateData`, `StateDrop`, `StatePreamble`), data equalization control (`MRxDEqD`), and controls for delay in CRC calculations (`DlyCrcEn`). Its output ports include `IFGCounterEq24` (indicates IFG count of 24), delayed CRC count (`DlyCrcCnt`), various byte count comparisons (`ByteCntEq0` through `ByteCntEq7`, `ByteCntGreat2`, `ByteCntSmall7`), maximum frame comparisons (`ByteCntMaxFrame`), and the byte count output (`ByteCntOut`). The module uses internal signals such as `ResetByteCounter` and `IncrementByteCounter` to manage the resetting and incrementing of byte counts based on frame reception conditions, and `ResetIFGCounter` and `IncrementIFGCounter` to manage the IFG counter based on frame conditions. The integration of the byte and IFG counters allows for careful monitoring of frame size and timing, ensuring data integrity and the correct sequencing of Ethernet frames. The code defines multiple blocks: conditions setting for signals, byte counter management, delayed count calculations, and IFG counting, orchestrated to align with synchronized data reception and network standards.
