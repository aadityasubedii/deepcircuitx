This module generates memory commands (read, write, refresh) for memory controllers with configurable address patterns, burst lengths, and instruction types. It implements flexible command generation using multiple modes (fixed, sequential, PRBS) for addresses and instructions, supports different FPGA families and memory configurations, and manages buffer availability and refresh timing. The module uses PRBS generators, address counters, and mode-specific logic to create commands based on user-defined parameters, ensuring proper timing and sequencing for memory operations.
