This functionality is realized through processing and controlling various states during the transmission of Ethernet frames. The module takes inputs related to transmission, clock, and reset signals, and outputs the current state and signals that dictate transitions between states. States handled include Idle, IPG (Inter Packet Gap), Preamble, Data transmission, Padding (PAD), Frame Check Sequence (FCS), Collision handling (Jam), and strategies for collision resolution like BackOff and Defer. The module uses various internal rules and conditions to transition across these states, ensuring compliant Ethernet frame transmissions and handling errors or special transmission conditions like collisions or underruns."

Its value depends on the operational mode (full duplex or not) and current state, affecting decisions like when to leave the IPG (Inter Packet Gap) state. It effectively adjusts timing behavior based on operational conditions and internal state transitions, ensuring appropriate gap between packet transmissions under different configurations."
