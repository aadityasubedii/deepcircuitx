    "spec": "Module name: a25_write_back. Module specification: The a25_write_back module is designed to handle the data write-back stage in a pipeline architecture, specifically for data read from memory and its subsequent write-back, conditional on the absence of a stall signal from memory. The module's input ports include i_clk (clock signal), i_reset (reset signal), i_mem_stall (stall signal which if active prevents the update of registers), i_mem_read_data (memory read data), i_mem_read_data_valid (validity status of memory read data), i_mem_load_rd (destination register ID where the data should be written), i_daddress (memory address from data read), and i_daddress_valid (validity of the data address which is unused in this module). Output ports include o_wb_read_data (buffered data to be written back), o_wb_read_data_valid (validity status of the buffered data), and o_wb_load_rd (destination register ID output for writing back data). Internal signals like mem_read_data_r, mem_read_data_valid_r, mem_load_rd_r, and daddress_r serve as intermediary storage: mem_read_data_r buffers the data, mem_read_data_valid_r indicates its validity, mem_load_rd_r stores the ID to which data should be written, and daddress_r provisions the data address buffering. The code principally comprises two always blocks driven by the positive edge of the clock: one block updates mem_read_data_r, mem_read_data_valid_r, and mem_load_rd_r when there is no memory stall; the other updates daddress_r similarly. This module ensures reliable transfer of data across stages of the pipeline without a stall, maintaining coherent data write-back operations.",

The write-back occurs unless there is a stall signal active from the memory (i_mem_stall). Input signals include the clock (i_clk), reset signal (i_reset), stall signal (i_mem_stall), memory read data (i_mem_read_data), validity of the memory read data (i_mem_read_data_valid), and destination register ID for the load operation (i_mem_load_rd). The module outputs the buffered read data (o_wb_read_data), its validity status (o_wb_read_data_valid), and the destination register ID (o_wb_load_rd) for further processing or usage in the system. The process inside mainly consists of transferring input signals to output through intermediate registers, ensuring data integrity across clock cycles, especially when there\u2019s no stall. There is also a separate buffering for a data address (i_daddress), handled in a similar fashion without considering its validity signal (i_daddress_valid) within the provided code snippet."
