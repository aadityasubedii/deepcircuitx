The PRBS generation can be configured for different purposes such as address, instruction, or burst length generation, depending on the `PRBS_CMD` parameter. The module uses seed values (`prbs_seed_i`) to initialize the LFSR, and the sequence evolves with each clock cycle when enabled. Adjustable parameters like the address width, data width, and PRBS width allow customization to fit specific system requirements. Output is generated based on the PRBS sequence and controlled by additional parameters like seed width and masking positions for start and end addresses."

It is used to synchronize the internal operations of the module, including the update of the pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS).\n- `prbs_seed_init`: A control signal to initialize the linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) with a seed value. When this signal is high, it indicates that the LFSR should be (re)initialized with the seed provided at the `prbs_seed_i` input.\n- `clk_en`: Clock enable signal. It's used to control the updating of the LFSR; the LFSR updates only when this signal is high, allowing for conditional operation based on external requirements.\n- `prbs_seed_i`: The initial seed value for the pseudo-random binary sequence. This input is used to set the initial state of the LFSR when `prbs_seed_init` is asserted.\n\nOutput ports: `prbs_o`.\nExplanation:\n- `prbs_o`: This is the output port that delivers the generated pseudo-random binary sequence. The data width of this output is defined by the `SEED_WIDTH` parameter. The output reflects the current state of the pseudo-random sequence as evolved based on the LFSR's logic and configurations dictated by the various module parameters and control signals."
