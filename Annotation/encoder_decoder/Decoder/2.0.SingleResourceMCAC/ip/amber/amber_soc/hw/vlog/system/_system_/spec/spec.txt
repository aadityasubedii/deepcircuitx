Module name: system. Module specification: The system module is a top-level System-on-Chip (SoC) design that integrates various components including a processor core (A23 or A25), memory controllers (DDR3 and boot memory), and peripherals such as UART, Ethernet MAC, timers, and an interrupt controller. It handles clock generation, reset management, and interfaces with external pins for DDR3 memory, Ethernet PHY, UART, and LEDs. The module has input ports for board reset, clocks, UART, and Ethernet signals, and output ports for DDR3 memory control, UART, Ethernet, and LEDs. It uses internal signals for clock distribution, reset control, and interrupt management. The design is built around a Wishbone bus architecture, with a wishbone_arbiter managing communication between masters and slaves. Key components include the processor core, Ethernet controller
