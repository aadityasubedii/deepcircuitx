    "spec": "Module name: test_module. \nModule specification: The \"test_module\" is a Verilog hardware description tailored for control and monitoring within systems using the Wishbone bus protocol. This module is equipped with a variety of functions including interrupt timers (`firq_timer` and `irq_timer` for fast and regular interrupts, respectively), random number generation, and UART interface simulation, enhancing its versatility in managing multiple hardware interfacing tasks. It accepts several input ports: `i_clk` for clock synchronization, `i_wb_adr` for address referencing in read/write operations, `i_wb_sel` for active byte lane identification, `i_wb_we` that distinguishes between read and write cycles, `i_wb_dat` for inputting data on write cycles, and `i_wb_cyc` and `i_wb_stb` for indicating active bus cycles and valid data transfers, respectively. The outputs include `o_irq` and `o_firq` for interrupt signaling, `o_mem_ctrl` for memory control dynamics, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_ack`, and `o_wb_err` for data output, transfer acknowledgment, and error signaling respectively, alongside `o_led` and `o_phy_rst_n` for visual status indication and physical reset control. Internally, the module harbors several operational registers like `cycles_reg` for cycle count, `random_num` for random values among others, which facilitate the core functionalities including timers and random number operations. The module's logic is divided into several blocks, each triggered by the positive edge of the clock input (`i_clk`). These blocks handle specific tasks such as setting up read or write operations on the Wishbone bus, managing LED outputs, computing random numbers, updating timers, monitoring UART status, and controlling memory operations, thereby ensuring reactive and efficient hardware management according to real-time system demands and interactions.",

It includes functionality to handle interrupt timers (`firq_timer` and `irq_timer`), random number generation and various simulations of a UART interface. The module interfaces with different control and status registers via specific address mappings, allowing read and write operations. Additionally, it manipulates outputs such as an LED display and physical reset based on specific inputs and conditions. There are conditional blocks to adapt to different data widths (32-bit or 128-bit), and during each clock cycle, it updates timers, random numbers, and cycle counts depending on the bus transactions it monitors and executes."

It includes functionality to handle interrupt timers (`firq_timer` and `irq_timer`), random number generation and various simulations of a UART interface. The module interfaces with different control and status registers via specific address mappings, allowing read and write operations. Additionally, it manipulates outputs such as an LED display and physical reset based on specific inputs and conditions. There are conditional blocks to adapt to different data widths (32-bit or 128-bit), and during each clock cycle, it updates timers, random numbers, and cycle counts depending on the bus transactions it monitors and executes."

This module is equipped with a variety of functions including interrupt timers (`firq_timer` and `irq_timer` for fast and regular interrupts, respectively), random number generation, and UART interface simulation, enhancing its versatility in managing multiple hardware interfacing tasks. It accepts several input ports: `i_clk` for clock synchronization, `i_wb_adr` for address referencing in read/write operations, `i_wb_sel` for active byte lane identification, `i_wb_we` that distinguishes between read and write cycles, `i_wb_dat` for inputting data on write cycles, and `i_wb_cyc` and `i_wb_stb` for indicating active bus cycles and valid data transfers, respectively. The outputs include `o_irq` and `o_firq` for interrupt signaling, `o_mem_ctrl` for memory control dynamics, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_ack`, and `o_wb_err` for data output, transfer acknowledgment, and error signaling respectively, alongside `o_led` and `o_phy_rst_n` for visual status indication and physical reset control. Internally, the module harbors several operational registers like `cycles_reg` for cycle count, `random_num` for random values among others, which facilitate the core functionalities including timers and random number operations. The module's logic is divided into several blocks, each triggered by the positive edge of the clock input (`i_clk`). These blocks handle specific tasks such as setting up read or write operations on the Wishbone bus, managing LED outputs, computing random numbers, updating timers, monitoring UART status, and controlling memory operations, thereby ensuring reactive and efficient hardware management according to real-time system demands and interactions."
