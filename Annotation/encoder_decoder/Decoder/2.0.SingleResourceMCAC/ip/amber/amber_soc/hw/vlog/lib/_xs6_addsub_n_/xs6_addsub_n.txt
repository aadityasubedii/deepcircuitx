The `xs6_addsub_n` module performs addition or subtraction on two operands `i_a` and `i_b` based on control signals `i_cin` and `i_sub`. It employs the DSP48A1 block to execute arithmetic efficiently, utilizing signals `opmode`, `in_a`, and `in_b` to configure the DSP block's operation mode, extend input widths, and interface the main outputs `o_sum` and `o_co`. This achieves fast and flexible arithmetic operations suitable for varying bit widths.
