The `data_prbs_gen` module generates pseudorandom binary sequences using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR), intended for applications in communication systems such as data scrambling and testing. It operates through input signals that control the initialization and enablement of the LFSR, with internal shift logic and XOR operations dictated by clock edges and reset conditions to update the PRBS output, thereby ensuring flexible and efficient pattern generation.
