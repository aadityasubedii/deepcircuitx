The `a23_alu` module serves as an Arithmetic Logic Unit capable of performing various arithmetic and logical operations based on 32-bit input operands and a function code. It implements conditional operand handling (such as swapping and negation), supports multiple arithmetic operations contingent on FPGA types, and outputs both the result and status flags. Selection signals derived from the function code control the specific operation, including addition, bitwise functions, and data extensions, ensuring flexible adaptability for computational needs.
