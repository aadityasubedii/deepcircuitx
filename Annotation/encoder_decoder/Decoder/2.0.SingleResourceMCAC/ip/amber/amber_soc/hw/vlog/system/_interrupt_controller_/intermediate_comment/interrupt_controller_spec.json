    "spec": "Module name: interrupt_controller. Module specification: The `interrupt_controller` is a Verilog module designed to manage various hardware interrupts within a system, interfacing through a Wishbone bus. Inputs, including `i_clk` (the system clock), address (`i_wb_adr`), selection (`i_wb_sel`), data (`i_wb_dat`), and control signals (`i_wb_we`, `i_wb_cyc`, `i_wb_stb`) from the Wishbone master, are utilized to conduct read/write operations. Additional interrupt signals are received from peripherals such as UARTs and Ethernet MAC. The module produces outputs `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_ack`, `o_wb_err` for data transfer acknowledgments and error signaling, along with `o_irq` and `o_firq` for interrupt requests. Internally, the module uses registers like `irq0_enable_reg` and `firq0_enable_reg` for managing interrupt enable state, and signals like `irq_0` and `firq_0` to aggregate interrupts. The primary blocks within the code handle data alignment for different bus widths, register and interrupt management based on address-mapped read/write operations, data preparation for bus transactions, and interrupt signal generation. The code is structured with an initial declaration of ports and parameters, followed by signal and register definitions, assignments for managing read and write operations, and always blocks for updating data based on bus transactions and clock edges. Additionally, depending on the compile-time flag `AMBER_IC_DEBUG`, there are debugging messages that log register access events. This modular and annotated structure allows for effective management and scaling of interrupt handling operations in complex hardware systems.",

It interfaces with a Wishbone bus, handling data and address lines for read and write operations. The module can handle different types of interrupts, including those from UARTs, an Ethernet MAC, timers, and software-generated interrupts. It supports enable, disable, and status operations for both regular interrupts (IRQ) and fast interrupts (FIRQ). The controller determines active interrupts based on the enable registers and generates output signals `o_irq` and `o_firq` indicating the presence of an active interrupt, thus helping the system's processor to respond accordingly. The data paths and conditions for reading from and writing to specific registers are defined, along with handling different bus data widths. Debugging support and detailed bus interactions are embedded for development and testing purposes."

            "content": "Module name: interrupt_controller. Module specification: The `interrupt_controller` is a Verilog module designed to manage various hardware interrupts within a system, interfacing through a Wishbone bus. Inputs, including `i_clk` (the system clock), address (`i_wb_adr`), selection (`i_wb_sel`), data (`i_wb_dat`), and control signals (`i_wb_we`, `i_wb_cyc`, `i_wb_stb`) from the Wishbone master, are utilized to conduct read/write operations. Additional interrupt signals are received from peripherals such as UARTs and Ethernet MAC. The module produces outputs `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_ack`, `o_wb_err` for data transfer acknowledgments and error signaling, along with `o_irq` and `o_firq` for interrupt requests. Internally, the module uses registers like `irq0_enable_reg` and `firq0_enable_reg` for managing interrupt enable state, and signals like `irq_0` and `firq_0` to aggregate interrupts. The primary blocks within the code handle data alignment for different bus widths, register and interrupt management based on address-mapped read/write operations, data preparation for bus transactions, and interrupt signal generation. The code is structured with an initial declaration of ports and parameters, followed by signal and register definitions, assignments for managing read and write operations, and always blocks for updating data based on bus transactions and clock edges. Additionally, depending on the compile-time flag `AMBER_IC_DEBUG`, there are debugging messages that log register access events. This modular and annotated structure allows for effective management and scaling of interrupt handling operations in complex hardware systems."

It interfaces with a Wishbone bus, handling data and address lines for read and write operations. The module can handle different types of interrupts, including those from UARTs, an Ethernet MAC, timers, and software-generated interrupts. It supports enable, disable, and status operations for both regular interrupts (IRQ) and fast interrupts (FIRQ). The controller determines active interrupts based on the enable registers and generates output signals `o_irq` and `o_firq` indicating the presence of an active interrupt, thus helping the system's processor to respond accordingly. The data paths and conditions for reading from and writing to specific registers are defined, along with handling different bus data widths. Debugging support and detailed bus interactions are embedded for development and testing purposes."

                    "text": "Module name: interrupt_controller. Module specification: The `interrupt_controller` is a Verilog module designed to manage various hardware interrupts within a system, interfacing through a Wishbone bus. Inputs, including `i_clk` (the system clock), address (`i_wb_adr`), selection (`i_wb_sel`), data (`i_wb_dat`), and control signals (`i_wb_we`, `i_wb_cyc`, `i_wb_stb`) from the Wishbone master, are utilized to conduct read/write operations. Additional interrupt signals are received from peripherals such as UARTs and Ethernet MAC. The module produces outputs `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_ack`, `o_wb_err` for data transfer acknowledgments and error signaling, along with `o_irq` and `o_firq` for interrupt requests. Internally, the module uses registers like `irq0_enable_reg` and `firq0_enable_reg` for managing interrupt enable state, and signals like `irq_0` and `firq_0` to aggregate interrupts. The primary blocks within the code handle data alignment for different bus widths, register and interrupt management based on address-mapped read/write operations, data preparation for bus transactions, and interrupt signal generation. The code is structured with an initial declaration of ports and parameters, followed by signal and register definitions, assignments for managing read and write operations, and always blocks for updating data based on bus transactions and clock edges. Additionally, depending on the compile-time flag `AMBER_IC_DEBUG`, there are debugging messages that log register access events. This modular and annotated structure allows for effective management and scaling of interrupt handling operations in complex hardware systems."
