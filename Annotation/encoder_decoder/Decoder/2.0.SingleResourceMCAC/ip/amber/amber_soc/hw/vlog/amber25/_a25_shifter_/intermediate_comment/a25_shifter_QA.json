The operations include logical shift left (LSL), logical shift right (LSR), arithmetic shift right (ASR), and rotate right (ROR). The module can operate in either a full barrel or quick mode, determined by the FULL_BARREL parameter. It outputs a 32-bit shifted result along with a carry-out flag. The specific shifting behavior and the treatment of carry flags depend on the input parameters and the operation mode."

Depending on the shift amount and conditions, this signal is generated by selectively shifting i_in to the left and optionally inserting the carry or zeros at the rightmost bits.\n- lsr_out: This internal signal holds the result of the Logical Shift Right (LSR) operation. It performs shifting of i_in to the right based on the specified shift amount, with the ability to merge in the carry flag or leading zeros into the leftmost bits as determined by the operation specifics.\n- asr_out: Represents the result of the Arithmetic Shift Right (ASR) operation. ASR not only shifts the data to the right but also retains the sign of the data by filling the leftmost slots with the sign bit (MSB) of i_in, thus making it suitable for signed arithmetic operations.\n- ror_out: This holds the outcome of the Rotate Right (ROR) operation.
