The xilinx_dist_ram_16x32 module implements a 16x32 distributed RAM using Xilinx RAM16X1D primitives, enabling concurrent read and write operations to different memory addresses. It supports input operations with a write enable, write and read address selectors, and a data input bus, alongside a write clock. Each of the 32 data bits is handled by a separate RAM16X1D instance configured with address and data connections corresponding to its bit position, facilitating isolated bit-level manipulations.
