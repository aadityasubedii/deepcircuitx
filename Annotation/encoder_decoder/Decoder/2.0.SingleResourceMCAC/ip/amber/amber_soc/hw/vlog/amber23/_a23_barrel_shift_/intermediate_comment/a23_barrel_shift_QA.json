These operations include logical shift left (LSL), logical shift right (LSR), arithmetic shift right (ASR), and rotate right (ROR). The shift amount is specified by an 8-bit input, and the specific operation to be executed is determined by a 2-bit function code. The module outputs the 32-bit result of the shift operation and a carry-out flag which indicates the overflow or carry information based on the operation performed."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals: `lsl_out`, `lsr_out`, `asr_out`, `ror_out`.\nExplanation:\n- `lsl_out`: This internal signal holds the result of the logical shift left (LSL) operation. In an LSL operation, bits are shifted to the left, and the space on the right is filled with zeros. This signal concatenates results of various conditions involving the input bit width, carry-in value, and shift amounts.\n- `lsr_out`: This internal signal holds the result of the logical shift right (LSR) operation. In LSR, bits are shifted to the right, and the leftmost bits are filled with zeros. This signal is formed similar to `lsl_out` but in the opposite direction, handling various shift and boundary conditions.\n- `asr_out`: This internal wire holds the result of the arithmetic shift right (ASR) operation. ASR differs from LSR in that it preserves the sign of the input value by filling the leftmost bits with the most significant bit (MSB) of `i_in`, effectively replicating the sign bit. This helps in maintaining the number's sign in right shifts.\n- `ror_out`: This internal signal is used to hold the result of the rotate right (ROR) operation. ROR rotates the bits of `i_in` to the right, where the bits that fall off at the right end come back at the left end of the output. The rotation also considers the carry input under specific conditions and handles various rotating positions defined by `i_shift_amount`."
