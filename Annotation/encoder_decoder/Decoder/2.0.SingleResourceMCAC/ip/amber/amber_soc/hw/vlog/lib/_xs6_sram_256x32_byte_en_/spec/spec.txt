Module name: xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en. 

Module specification: The 'xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en' Verilog module encapsulates a dual-port Block RAM (BRAM) with a byte-enable feature for selective byte writing in a 256x32 memory array. It operates with a 32-bit data input (`i_write_data`) which can be written to a specified memory address (`i_address`) contingent on the byte enable signal (`i_byte_enable`). This setup allows specific bytes within the 32-bit word to be updated during write operations. The module is synchronous with a clock `i_clk` used for both reading and writing operations. Internally, the module utilizes several no connect signals (`nc31`, `nc32`, `nc33`, `nc22`) which are not used in any operations, alongside a `wea` signal. The `wea` signal determines which bytes are to be written based on the logic combination of `i_write_enable` and `i_byte_enable`. The memory is instantiated using the `RAMB8BWER` primitive configured for Simple Dual Port (SDP) mode with "read-first" operation on both ports. An initial block checks the parameter settings for `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDRESS_WIDTH` and issues warning messages if they are incorrectly configured. The output port `o_read_data` captures the data read from the specified memory address, providing output based on the read operations at the clock edge.
