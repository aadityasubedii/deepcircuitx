Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: This module is a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) that interfaces with various types of DDR memory (DDR, DDR2, DDR3, MDDR). It handles the input/output signals between the user interface and the memory, including address, data, and control signals. The module supports different port configurations and memory widths, and includes features like calibration, DQS (data strobe) management, and IOB (Input/Output Block) instantiation for proper signal timing and interfacing with the physical memory. Input ports include clock signals, control signals, command inputs, data inputs, and configuration inputs for up to six ports (p0-p5) of the memory controller. Output ports provide status information, data output, and control signals for the six ports, as well as the physical interface signals to the DDR memory. Key internal signals include clock-related signals
