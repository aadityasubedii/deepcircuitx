    "module": "The xs6_sram_256x128_byte_en module interfaces with an SRAM, facilitating 128-bit data read and byte-selective write operations controlled via a 16-bit enable vector. It features a clock-synchronized operation, utilizes per-byte write enable signals deriving from the general write-enable and byte-enable inputs, and employs four instantiated dual-port RAM blocks in Simple Dual Port (SDP) mode, ensuring robust and flexible memory management at the byte level. Initial checks for configuration parameters enhance setup validation and error handling."
