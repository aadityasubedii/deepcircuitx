Module name: tb_uart. 
Module specification: The 'tb_uart' module is designed as a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) testbench in Verilog, primarily used for simulating UART communication protocols. It handles the asynchronous transmission and receiving of serial data. The module has two input ports: `i_uart_cts_n`, a Clear to Send signal which is active low, used by the UART to determine if it can send data, and `i_uart_rxd`, which receives serial data from an external transmitter. The output ports include `o_uart_txd`, which transmits serial data to an external receiver, and `o_uart_rts_n`, which is a Ready to Send signal, active low, indicating the module's readiness to receive data. Internally, the module uses several signals such as `clk_uart` for the UART operation clock, `rx_bit_count` and `tx_bit_count` for managing bit timing during reception and transmission respectively, and `tx_fifo` which is a FIFO buffer for storing data bytes before transmission. The code defines initial conditions and clocks, UART configuration, and uses state machines for managing the reception and transmission processes. It also includes edge detection for start bits in reception and manages FIFO reads and writes, alongside conditions for loopback mode operation and transmission start based on external commands and buffer status.
