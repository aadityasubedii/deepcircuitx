    "module": "This module decompiles ARM processor instructions into human-readable assembly code for debugging and analysis. It processes input signals related to instruction execution and processor state, decodes various instruction types (e.g., REGOP, TRANS, BRANCH), and formats them into readable assembly syntax. The module uses internal signals for instruction decoding, implements tasks for different instruction types, and writes the decompiled instructions along with additional execution information (such as memory accesses and interrupts) to an output file. It also handles interrupt processing and program flow analysis, providing a comprehensive view of the processor's operation."
