Module name: a23_cache. Module specification: The a23_cache module implements a configurable cache memory for the A23 ARM processor architecture. It manages data storage and retrieval using a set-associative structure with configurable cache lines, words per line, and ways. The module handles read and write operations, cache fills during misses, write-back requests, and cache invalidation for exclusive access scenarios. Key inputs include clock, select, exclusive access, write data, address, and cache control signals, while outputs provide read data and stall signals. Internal signals manage cache state, way selection, data flow, and various cache operations. The module is organized into several blocks, including state machine control, tag and data RAM instantiations for each way, hit detection logic, way selection for replacement, and data read/write handling. It supports features such as random replacement strategy, exclusive access operations, and debug states for monitoring cache activities. The design aims to enhance
