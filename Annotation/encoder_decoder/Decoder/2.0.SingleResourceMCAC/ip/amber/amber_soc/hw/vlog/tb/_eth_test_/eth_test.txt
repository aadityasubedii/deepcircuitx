The 'eth_test' module facilitates Ethernet data communication, specifically handling packet transmission and reception, interfacing with Media Independent Interface for data management. It leverages input and output ports for data synchronization and status signaling, alongside internal memory for data storage and numerous FSMs for managing state transitions during data processing. The module uses meticulous state-driven logic to control the flow and integrity of data, ensuring robust handling, configuration, and error management of Ethernet packets through systematic state checks and transitions.
