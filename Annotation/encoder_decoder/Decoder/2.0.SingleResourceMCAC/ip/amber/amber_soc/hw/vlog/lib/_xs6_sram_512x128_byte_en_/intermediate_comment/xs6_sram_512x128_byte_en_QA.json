It consists of four 36-bit wide RAMB16BWER instances, each handling a 32-bit portion of the 128-bit data width. The module supports read and write operations with a 9-bit address input, 128-bit data input/output, and 16-bit byte enable for selective writing. The SRAM can be initialized with user-defined values through parameters. This design allows for efficient storage and retrieval of 128-bit wide data in 512 addressable locations, with the ability to selectively write individual bytes."
