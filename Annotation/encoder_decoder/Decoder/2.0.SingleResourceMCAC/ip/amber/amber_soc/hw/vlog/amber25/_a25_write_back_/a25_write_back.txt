The a25_write_back module manages the data write-back phase in a pipeline, specifically handling the transfer of read data from memory to output registers, conditional on the absence of a stall signal. It employs registers to buffer the memory read data, its validity, and the destination register ID, updating these registers on the rising edge of the clock unless a memory stall is indicated. Additional buffering for the read memory address is implemented similarly, although its validity is not utilized within this module.
