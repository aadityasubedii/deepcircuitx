Module name: iodrp_mcb_controller.  
Module specification: The `iodrp_mcb_controller` is a Verilog module designed for managing data communication with a memory cell via DRP (Dynamic Reconfiguration Port) and DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) protocols. It controls read and write operations based on inputs like memory cell address, command validity, and operation modes (read or write). The input ports include `memcell_address` and `write_data` for specifying the target memory cell and data respectively, `rd_not_write` to choose between read and write operations, `cmd_valid` to indicate a valid command, along with `drp_ioi_addr` for DRP addressing, and `sync_rst` and `DRP_CLK` for synchronization and timing. The output ports feature read data through `read_data`, readiness status via `rdy_busy_n`, and DRP-related signals like `DRP_CS`, `DRP_SDI`, and others for controlling DRP operations. Internal signals such as `memcell_addr_reg` and `data_reg` store address and data respectively, while `shift_through_reg` and `data_out_mux` are involved in data manipulation and routing. The module employs a finite state machine (FSM) highlighted by states such as READY, DECIDE, ADDR_PHASE, and DATA_PHASE, mainly handling transitions based on input commands and internal computations. Tasks and always blocks structure the logic to load, shift, expand, and direct data appropriately through DRP, integrating tightly with readiness signals and DRP protocol timing requirements to execute memory operations effectively.
