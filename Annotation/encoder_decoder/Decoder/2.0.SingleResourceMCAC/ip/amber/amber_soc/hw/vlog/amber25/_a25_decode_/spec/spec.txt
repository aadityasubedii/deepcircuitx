Module name: a25_decode. Module specification: This module is an instruction decoder for the ARM25 processor, responsible for decoding fetched instructions and generating control signals for other parts of the processor. It takes inputs such as clock, reset, fetched instruction, core stall, interrupt requests, abort signals, and status bits, and produces outputs including immediate values, register selection signals, ALU and barrel shifter control signals, memory access control signals, and various write enable signals. The module uses internal signals for instruction decoding, control flow management, and handling different instruction types. It implements a state machine to manage the execution of instructions, including special cases like multiple register transfers and coprocessor operations. The module is divided into sections for instruction decoding, control state management, interrupt handling, and signal generation for various processor components. It supports different instruction types such as register operations, memory transfers, branches, and system operations, and handles conditional execution, immediate value calculation, an
