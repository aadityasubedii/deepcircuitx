    "spec": "Module name: eth_txstatem. Module specification: The `eth_txstatem` module is a state machine designed to manage Ethernet transmission processes. Its primary function involves handling various states necessary for the transmission of Ethernet frames, based on input signals and clock transitions. The input ports include signals such as `MTxClk` (module's clock), `Reset` (asynchronous reset), `CarrierSense` (detects carrier presence), and `TxStartFrm` (indicates start of frame transmission), among others, each contributing to the decision-making within transmission states such as Idle, IPG (Inter Packet Gap), Preamble, etc. The output ports consist of state indicators (e.g., `StateIdle`, `StateIPG`) and signals to start specific actions like `StartFCS` (start Frame Check Sequence). Internal signals like `StartIdle` and `StartPAD` help in transitioning between states, influenced by conditions like completion of current tasks or specific counter values. The code is structured into always blocks that define state transitions and signal assignments, with conditions based on both current states and input signals, ensuring correct timing and sequence of Ethernet frame processing activities.\n",

This functionality is realized through processing and controlling various states during the transmission of Ethernet frames. The module takes inputs related to transmission, clock, and reset signals, and outputs the current state and signals that dictate transitions between states. States handled include Idle, IPG (Inter Packet Gap), Preamble, Data transmission, Padding (PAD), Frame Check Sequence (FCS), Collision handling (Jam), and strategies for collision resolution like BackOff and Defer. The module uses various internal rules and conditions to transition across these states, ensuring compliant Ethernet frame transmissions and handling errors or special transmission conditions like collisions or underruns."

Its primary function involves handling various states necessary for the transmission of Ethernet frames, based on input signals and clock transitions. The input ports include signals such as `MTxClk` (module's clock), `Reset` (asynchronous reset), `CarrierSense` (detects carrier presence), and `TxStartFrm` (indicates start of frame transmission), among others, each contributing to the decision-making within transmission states such as Idle, IPG (Inter Packet Gap), Preamble, etc. The output ports consist of state indicators (e.g., `StateIdle`, `StateIPG`) and signals to start specific actions like `StartFCS` (start Frame Check Sequence). Internal signals like `StartIdle` and `StartPAD` help in transitioning between states, influenced by conditions like completion of current tasks or specific counter values. The code is structured into always blocks that define state transitions and signal assignments, with conditions based on both current states and input signals, ensuring correct timing and sequence of Ethernet frame processing activities.\n"
