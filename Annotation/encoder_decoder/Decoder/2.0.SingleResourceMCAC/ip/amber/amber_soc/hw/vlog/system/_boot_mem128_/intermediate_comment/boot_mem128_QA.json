It supports both read and write operations, with debug configurations available for more detailed transaction controls and conditions. The module incorporates parameterized data and address widths to flexibly adapt to different system requirements. Memory handling in the module includes operations such as managing byte enable signals for data transactions, and generating appropriate handshake signals like acknowledgment (`o_wb_ack`) to confirm successful data read or write operations to the connected memory unit."

It is asserted when a strobe (`i_wb_stb`) is active, write enable (`i_wb_we`) is set, and no reads are currently initiated (`start_read_r` is low). This handles the control for starting write transactions on the bus.\n- `start_read`: Similar to `start_write`, this signal is used to initiate a read operation. It becomes active when there is a strobe signal (`i_wb_stb`) and the operation is not a write (`i_wb_we` is low and `start_read_r` is low). It controls the read access to the memory.\n- `read_data`: Holds the data fetched from the memory during read operations. It is connected from the memory module's output to the module's data output (`o_wb_dat`).\n- `write_data`: This signal passes the data from the input `i_wb_dat` to the memory for write operations. It simply relays the data to be written into the memory.\n- `byte_enable`: Derived from the byte selection signal (`i_wb_sel`), it is used in the memory sub-module to enable specific bytes of the data word during write operations.\n- `address`: Extracted from the `i_wb_adr` based on the defined memory address width (`MADDR_WIDTH`), this signal pinpoints the address in memory where data will be read from or written to.\n- `jitter_r`: A debug-specific signal that is used to create arbitrary jitter or variation during debug mode, affecting timing or control behaviors like start reading operations. This is used to test the robustness of the module under unusual or unexpected conditions.\n- `start_read_r`: A signal that latches or holds the state of a read operation across clock cycles, helping manage the state between consecutive operations. This latch aids in controlling and sequencing operations to ensure data integrity."
