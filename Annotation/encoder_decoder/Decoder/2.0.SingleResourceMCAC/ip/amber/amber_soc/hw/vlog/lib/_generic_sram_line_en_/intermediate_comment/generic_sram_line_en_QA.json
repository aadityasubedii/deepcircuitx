It supports write and read operations. The SRAM memory array is declared with size based on the address width, allowing storage indexed by the address input. Data written to a specific address during a write operation (when 'i_write_enable' is high) is stored in the memory array at that address. During a read operation, if 'i_write_enable' is high, zero data (all bits zero) is output; otherwise, the content of the addressed memory location is output. Additionally, there\u2019s an option to initialize the memory contents to zero when the module is instantiated."

It is essential for the sequential logic used in the module, synchronizing changes in the memory array and the output data.\n- i_write_data: This port receives the data meant to be written into the memory. It has a width defined by the parameter DATA_WIDTH and represents the actual data to be stored at the specified address when write is enabled.\n- i_write_enable: This input acts as a control signal to enable writing to the memory. When high, the data from i_write_data is written into the memory location specified by i_address. When low, the module performs a read operation.\n- i_address: This input specifies the memory address targeted for a read or write operation. Its width is determined by the ADDRESS_WIDTH parameter, allowing it to index the range of addresses supported by the memory array.\n\nOutput ports: o_read_data.\nExplanation:\n- o_read_data: This output port transmits the data read from the memory. It outputs the content stored at the address specified by i_address, except when i_write_enable is high during the read cycle; in such cases, it outputs zero (all bits low).

This array holds the actual data values written during write operations and retains them for read operations.
