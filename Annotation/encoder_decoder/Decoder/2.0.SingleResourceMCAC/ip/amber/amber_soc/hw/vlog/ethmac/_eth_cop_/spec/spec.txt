Module name: eth_cop. Module specification: The `eth_cop` module serves as a traffic controller on a WISHBONE bus, managing transactions between two master interfaces (Master 1 and Master 2) and two slave interfaces (Slave 1 and Slave 2). It utilizes input ports such as `wb_clk_i` (system clock) and `wb_rst_i` (system reset) for synchronization and reset functionalities. Input interfaces for the masters include address (`m1_wb_adr_i` and `m2_wb_adr_i`), data input (`m1_wb_dat_i` and `m2_wb_dat_i`), and control signals like write enable and strobe signals. Output ports to the masters communicate transaction status via acknowledgment and error signals and responsive data. Interface ports for the slaves handle directed transaction outputs including address and data routing, strobe, and cycle signals, and receive acknowledgments and error statuses from the slaves. Internal signals such as `m1_in_progress` and `m2_in_progress` track active transactions per master, while `m1_req` and `m2_req` detect valid requests based on master signals and address decoding. The synthesis of the Verilog code shows multiple always blocks handling sequential operation logic, bus activity monitoring, accurate request handling based on addresses, and error signal handling, ensuring efficient data communication and system integrity under various operation scenarios. These functional blocks robustly delineate the interaction dynamics between master requests and slave responses, coordinating asynchronous access and error management.
