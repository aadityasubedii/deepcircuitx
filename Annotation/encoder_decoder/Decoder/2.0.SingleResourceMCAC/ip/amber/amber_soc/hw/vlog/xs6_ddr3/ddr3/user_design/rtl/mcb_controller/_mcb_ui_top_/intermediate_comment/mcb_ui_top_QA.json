It integrates various components including a raw MCB wrapper, AXI interfaces, and arbitration logic. The module supports multiple ports (up to 6) that can be configured as either native MCB interfaces or AXI interfaces. It handles clock management, address translation, and data flow between the user/AXI interfaces and the memory controller. The module also includes calibration and initialization logic for the memory interface, supporting different types of DDR memory. Overall, it provides a flexible and configurable interface between user logic or AXI-based systems and external memory."
