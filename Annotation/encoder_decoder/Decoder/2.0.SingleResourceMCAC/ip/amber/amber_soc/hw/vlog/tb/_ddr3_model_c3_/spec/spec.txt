Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module represents a behavioral model of a DDR3 SDRAM memory device, simulating its timing and functionality. It includes input ports for control signals (rst_n, ck, ck_n, cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address inputs (ba, addr), data inputs/outputs (dq, dqs, dqs_n), and other control signals (dm_tdqs, odt). The output port tdqs_n is for termination data strobe. Internal signals track timing parameters, state variables, and pipeline stages for various operations. The module implements key DDR3 features such as bank activation, precharge, refresh, power-down modes, and self-refresh. It includes blocks for command decoding, data input/output handling, timing checks, and memory read/write operations.
