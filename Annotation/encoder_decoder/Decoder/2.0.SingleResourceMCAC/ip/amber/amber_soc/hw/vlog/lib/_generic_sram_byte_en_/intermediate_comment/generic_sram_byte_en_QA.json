It provides functionality for both reading from and writing to the memory. Upon a positive edge of the clock signal (`i_clk`), if the write enable signal (`i_write_enable`) is high, the module writes data selectively to the memory based on the byte enable signal (`i_byte_enable`). Each bit of the byte enable signal corresponds to each byte of the data \u2014 if the particular enable bit is high, the corresponding byte in the write data (`i_write_data`) is written to the memory at the specified address (`i_address`). If the write enable signal is not set, the module outputs the current data stored at the specified memory address to `o_read_data`. This is typical for memory elements where certain bytes can be selectively updated while others remain unchanged, making the memory usage more flexible and efficient in terms of data handling."

It is used for synchronization of read and write operations.\n- `i_write_data` is a data bus that carries the data to be written into memory. Its size is determined by the parameter `DATA_WIDTH`.\n- `i_write_enable` is a control signal that enables the write operation when it is high (1). If low (0), the module performs a read operation.\n- `i_address` specifies the memory address where the data is to be written or read. The width of this address bus is determined by the `ADDRESS_WIDTH` parameter.\n- `i_byte_enable` is a control bus that specifies which bytes in the memory word are enabled for writing. It allows selective writing to the memory. The size of this bus is `DATA_WIDTH/8`, signifying each bit controls one byte of the memory data word.\n\nOutput ports: o_read_data. \nExplanation: \n- `o_read_data` is the data output bus that provides the data read from the memory location specified by `i_address`. It provides the stored data if `i_write_enable` is low during a read operation. Its size is determined by the `DATA_WIDTH`."

This memory stores the data written to it and provides data for read operations depending on the addressed location (`i_address`).\n- `i` is an integer used as an index variable in the loop inside the always block where the write operation's logic is handled.
