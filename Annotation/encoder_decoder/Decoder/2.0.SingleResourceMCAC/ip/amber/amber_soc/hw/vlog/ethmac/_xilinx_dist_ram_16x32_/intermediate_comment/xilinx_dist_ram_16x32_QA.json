The module accepts 32-bit wide data inputs (`data_in`) and outputs (`data_out`), and uses 4-bit addresses for reading (`read_address`) and writing (`write_address`). It operates with write enable (`we`) and a write clock (`wclk`). Each bit of the 32-bit data is individually handled by a distinct RAM16X1D primitive, mapped directly to the corresponding bit position in input and output buses, allowing concurrent read and write operations to different addresses."

Each bit of `waddr` is connected to the respective address input (`A0` to `A3`) of each RAM16X1D primitive, allowing it to address the specific bit location within the memory for the write operation.\n- `raddr` (read address register): Similar to `waddr`, this 4-bit signal mirrors `read_address`. It is used to define the read address for retrieving data from each RAM16X1D instance. The bits of `raddr` connect to the read address inputs (`DPRA0` to `DPRA3`) of each RAM16X1D.
