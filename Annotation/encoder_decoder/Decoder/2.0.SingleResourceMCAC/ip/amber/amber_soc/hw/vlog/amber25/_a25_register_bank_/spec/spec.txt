Module name: a25_register_bank. Module specification: The a25_register_bank is a Verilog module designed to manage the register operations within a processor, specifically tailored for an ARM architecture with various CPU modes (User, IRQ, FIRQ, Supervisor). It handles read and write operations for general-purpose registers (r0 to r15) and specialized banked registers for separate CPU modes, enabling efficient data manipulation in response to interrupts and operating mode changes. The module has several input ports including i_clk (clock signal), i_core_stall and i_mem_stall (stalling signals), mode signals (i_mode_idec, i_mode_exec, i_mode_rds_exec), select signals for different registers (i_rm_sel, i_rs_sel, i_rn_sel), and flags (i_status_bits_flags, irq_mask, firq_mask). The output ports include o_rm, o_rs, o_rd, o_rn, and o_pc, which provide the data from the selected registers and the program counter. Internally, the module utilizes a variety of registers and wires like r0 to r15, r8_firq to r14_firq, and r13_svc to r14_svc and their corresponding outputs to manage data at different stages, influenced heavily by the current CPU mode flags (usr_exec, svc_exec, irq_exec, firq_exec). The code is organized into sections for signal assignment, conditional data path handling based on modes and stalls, and continuous assignment of output ports based on selector inputs. This structured approach ensures the module adapts dynamically to CPU mode changes and supports precise operational control over register data in a multithreaded pipeline environment.
