It primarily manages the serialization and deserialization (shifting in or out) of data based on specific inputs. It reacts to clock edges and reset conditions to load and shift data, supporting operations for reading or writing data relative to Ethernet MDIO transactions. The module processes bits based on byte selection and manipulates shift registers accordingly.

Its assertion allows operations to take place.\n- Mdi: Management Data Input, represents the serial data input to the shift register.\n- Fiad: PHY Address, used to specify the address of the PHY component in MDIO operations.\n- Rgad: Register Address, specifies the address of the register being accessed within the PHY.\n- CtrlData: Control Data, the data that is to be written into PHY register during write operations.\n- WriteOp: Write Operation signal, indicates whether the operation is a write (asserted) or read (deasserted).\n- ByteSelect: Selector for specific bytes in operations, determining the portion of data to handle.\n- LatchByte: Control signal to latch data bytes, used for managing which bytes of data are processed or retrieved.\n\nOutput ports: ShiftedBit, Prsd, LinkFail.\nExplanation: \n- ShiftedBit: Output bit from the shift register, represents the serial output after data has been shifted.\n- Prsd: Parsed Data, output register that holds the deserialized and processed data from the shift register.\n- LinkFail: Signal that indicates a failure in the link status, specifically related to register conditions after data handling."

It supports both piecewise data assembly from incoming bits and data output through successive shifts.\n- Prsd: A 16-bit register that holds the parsed or processed data after it has been shifted and assembled correctly.
