Module name: sim_tb_top. Module specification: This module is a testbench for a DDR3 memory controller simulation. It sets up parameters and generates clock and reset signals for the DDR3 interface. The module doesn't have explicit input or output ports, as it's a self-contained testbench. Key internal signals include c3_sys_clk (system clock), c3_sys_rst (system reset), c3_calib_done (calibration completion indicator), c3_error (error indicator), and various mcb3_dram_* signals for DDR3 interface. The testbench instantiates a DDR3 memory model, a memory controller design (ddr3), and a test module (memc_tb_top) to generate memory transactions. It includes sections for clock generation, reset logic, error checking, and simulation control. The module monitors for calibration completion and errors
