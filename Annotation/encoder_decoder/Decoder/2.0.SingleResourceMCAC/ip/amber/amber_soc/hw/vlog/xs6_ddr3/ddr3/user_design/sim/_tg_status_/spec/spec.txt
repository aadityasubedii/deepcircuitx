Module name: tg_status.
Module specification: The tg_status module is a critical monitoring unit in a Verilog design, intended to observe, detect, and report discrepancies related to data handling in real-time operations. Its key functionalities include detecting and logging data errors when there's a mismatch between compared data (`cmp_data_i`) and read data (`rd_data_i`). The input ports include the clock (`clk_i`), reset (`rst_i`), manual error clearing (`manual_clear_error`), data error signal (`data_error_i`), comparison and read data, comparison address (`cmp_addr_i`), burst length (`cmp_bl_i`), and memory controller statuses (`mcb_cmd_full_i`, `mcb_wr_full_i`, `mcb_rd_empty_i`). Output ports encompass an error status register (`error_status`) that concatenates various error data, and an error flag (`error`). Internal signals such as `data_error_r`, a delay register to capture the transition of `data_error_i`, and `error_set`, a flag indicating the logged error state, ensure robust error detection and logging. The code structure includes initialization of internal states under reset conditions, error logging on detecting the initial error occurrence, and maintaining the error state until reset or manual clearance. This structured approach ensures accurate monitoring and facilitates downstream debugging and error handling.
