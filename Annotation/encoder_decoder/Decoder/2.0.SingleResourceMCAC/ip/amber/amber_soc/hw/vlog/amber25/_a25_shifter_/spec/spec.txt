Module name: a25_shifter. 
Module specification: The 'a25_shifter' is a Verilog module designed to perform various bit-shifting operations on a 32-bit input value, adjusting the input based on the specified shift function and amount. It supports Logical Shift Left (LSL), Logical Shift Right (LSR), Arithmetic Shift Right (ASR), and Rotate Right (ROR), with functionality determined by a FULL_BARREL parameter enabling either a full barrel or a quick mode shift. The input ports include a 32-bit 'i_in' for the data to be shifted, an 'i_carry_in' flag affecting the shift results, a 8-bit 'i_shift_amount' specifying the shift positions, an 'i_shift_imm_zero' boolean for special shift behavior, and a 2-bit 'i_function' to select the shift operation type. The output ports are 'o_out' which outputs the shifted 32-bit result, and 'o_carry_out', which indicates the carry flag from the last shifted bit. Internally, the module uses signals 'lsl_out', 'lsr_out', 'asr_out', and 'ror_out' to hold intermediate results of corresponding shifting operations before routing to the output based on the shift function selected. The module is structured into conditional blocks controlled by the FULL_BARREL parameter to handle full and quick shift operations differently, optimizing the hardware for performance or resource utilization as required. Each block is equipped with conditional assignments that cater to different shift amounts and ensure the configuration-specific behavior of input and carry integration into the shifted output, ultimately providing a flexible and robust shifting mechanism suitable for various computational purposes.
