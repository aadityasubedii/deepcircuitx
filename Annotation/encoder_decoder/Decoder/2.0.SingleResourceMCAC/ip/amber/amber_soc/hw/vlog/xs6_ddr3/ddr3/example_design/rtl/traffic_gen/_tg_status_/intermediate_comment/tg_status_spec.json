Module specification: The \"tg_status\" module is specifically designed to monitor and report error statuses within a system by leveraging a variety of inputs reflecting different system states and error types. This includes signals like data mismatches, command queue statuses, and memory buffer states. **Input ports** include `clk_i` (system clock), `rst_i` (system reset), `manual_clear_error` (manual reset for error status), `data_error_i` (indicates a data error), `cmp_data_i` and `rd_data_i` (expected and actual data for comparison), `cmp_addr_i` (current data transaction address), `cmp_bl_i` (burst length of the transaction), and `mcb_cmd_full_i`, `mcb_wr_full_i`, `mcb_rd_empty_i` (indicating memory control block status). **Output ports** comprise `error_status` (a detailed error log including address, data, and buffer statuses), and `error` (indicates if an error has been detected and is active). **Internal signals** include `data_error_r` (captures the previous state of `data_error_i` for edge detection) and `error_set` (maintains the error flag status). Within the code, **behavioral blocks** handle the system response to reset and manual error clear actions, error detection based on data mismatches, setting error details into the `error_status` register upon error confirmation, and maintaining the error active signal via the `error_set` flag.

The module handles error detection and reporting, indicated by the \"error_status\" output. It logs specific error-related information such as command address, burst length, and data mismatches. The error indication is reset either manually or upon reset. This module is essential for systems requiring rigorous error tracking and management, especially in data-sensitive applications where exactness between 'cmp_data_i' and 'rd_data_i' is crucial.

It is used to detect the rising edge of a data error event. By comparing `data_error_i` and `data_error_r`, the module can identify the exact clock cycle when a data error initially occurs (i.e., works as edge detection by capturing the state of `data_error_i` in the previous clock cycle).\n\n- error_set: A signal to maintain the status of whether an error has been set or not. This flag plays a pivotal role in the reporting mechanism by controlling the 'error' output and ensuring that once an error condition is flagged, it remains stable and visible until manually cleared or system reset. It prevents re-triggering of the error for as long as the same error condition persists, helping in constraint handling in systems that require precise error management."
