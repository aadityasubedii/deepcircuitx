Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: This module is a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) interface, designed to work with various types of DDR memory (DDR, DDR2, DDR3, MDDR). It handles the interface between the user logic and the actual memory controller, managing signals for address, bank address, command, data, and other control lines. The module includes numerous input ports for clocks, control signals, commands, and data from up to six ports, as well as output ports for status signals, data, and memory interface signals. Internal signals are used for various purposes, including data strobing, I/O control, calibration, and interfacing with the memory controller and memory devices. The code is organized into several sections, including port declarations, parameter definitions, internal signal declarations, and generate blocks for different memory configurations. It implements IOB (Input/Output Block) logic for signal management, D
