    "module": "The a25_wishbone_buf module manages data buffering for a Wishbone interface, supporting asynchronous read and write operations. It implements a FIFO-like buffer for writes and ensures data and acknowledgment handling. Key functionalities include pushing to and popping from the buffer based on system signals, tracking buffer occupancy, and dynamically updating output signals based on internal status and input conditions, facilitating efficient data management and transaction sequencing on the Wishbone bus."
