Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: This module serves as a top-level interface for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) in a Xilinx FPGA design, supporting up to 6 ports with configurable interface modes including native and AXI. It handles memory command and data transactions, arbitration between ports, and supports various memory types like DDR3. The module has numerous input and output ports for clock signals, control signals, command inputs, write/read operations, calibration, user interface, and AXI interface signals for up to 6 ports. Key inputs include sysclk_2x, pll_lock, and sys_rst, while outputs cover memory interface signals like mcbx_dram_addr and status indicators. Internal signals (e.g., p0_arb_en_i, s0_axi_araddr_i) serve as intermediaries between external
