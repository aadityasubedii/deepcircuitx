    "module": "This module implements a complete Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) layer, supporting frame transmission, reception, flow control, and PHY management. It integrates sub-modules for transmit and receive operations, MAC control, MIIM interface, and Wishbone bus interfacing. The design incorporates configurable parameters, status registers, and DMA capabilities, handling tasks such as address filtering, CRC checking, collision detection, and pause frame processing. The module interfaces with external PHY devices and a host system through Wishbone bus, providing a versatile Ethernet communication solution."
