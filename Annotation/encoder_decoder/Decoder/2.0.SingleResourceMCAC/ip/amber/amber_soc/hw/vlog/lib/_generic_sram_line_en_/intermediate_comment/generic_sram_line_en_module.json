    "module": "The `generic_sram_line_en` module simulates a parametrizable SRAM supporting both read and write functionalities. It utilizes a clock signal (`i_clk`) for synchronization of operations, selectively writes data to an addressable memory array (`mem`) using `i_write_data` when write enable (`i_write_enable`) is active, and outputs data or zeros based on the status of `i_write_enable` during read operations. The memory can be optionally initialized to zero based on a parameter setting and operations are managed within a clocked always block to ensure timing accuracy."
