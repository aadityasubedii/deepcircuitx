It consists of 8 RAMB16BWER instances, each handling 32 bits of the 128-bit data width. The module supports read and write operations with a 10-bit address input, 128-bit data input/output, and 16-bit byte enable. It allows initialization of BRAM contents through parameters and uses a single clock input for synchronous operations. The design is optimized for a 1024-word deep memory with byte-level write control."
