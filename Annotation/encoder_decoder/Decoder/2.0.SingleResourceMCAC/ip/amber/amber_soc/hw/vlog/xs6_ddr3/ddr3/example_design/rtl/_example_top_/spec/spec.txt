Module name: example_top. Module specification: This module is a top-level design for a DDR3 memory controller interface, implementing a multi-port memory access system. It instantiates and connects a memory controller wrapper (memc3_wrapper_inst) and a testbench top module (memc3_tb_top_inst). The module has input ports for system clock (c3_sys_clk) and reset (c3_sys_rst_i), and output ports for various DDR3 memory interface signals (e.g., mcb3_dram_a, mcb3_dram_ba, mcb3_dram_ras_n). It also includes inout ports for bidirectional data and strobe signals. Internally, the module uses numerous signals for clock management, error handling, and data transfer control. The design supports up to six read/write ports (p0
