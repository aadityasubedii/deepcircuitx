The functionality revolves around reading and writing control registers related to cache settings and fault information, governed by incoming commands and data. The module efficiently handles cache enabling, flushing operations, and accesses to the fault status/address registers based on specific operations and codes directed at different internal registers. The coprocessor also gracefully manages system states in response to faults and operational stalls."
