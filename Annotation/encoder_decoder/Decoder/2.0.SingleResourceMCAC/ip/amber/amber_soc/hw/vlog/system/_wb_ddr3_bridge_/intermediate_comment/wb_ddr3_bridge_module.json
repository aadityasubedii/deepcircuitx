    "module": "The 'wb_ddr3_bridge' module interfaces the Wishbone bus with a DDR3 memory controller, coordinating read and write operations. It utilizes input signals to manage data flow and synchronization, processing operations based on clock signals and control logic. Outputs facilitate direct memory access and system responses. Internal mechanisms, such as signal delays and conditions, regulate the transaction timing, ensuring data integrity and responsiveness. The structured blocks in the code specifically handle DDR3 command setups, data buffering, read sequence controls, and operational status monitoring."
