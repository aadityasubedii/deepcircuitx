    "module": "The `main_mem` module interfaces with a system bus to facilitate memory read and write operations, adaptable to 32 or 128 bits data widths. It uses input signals for synchronization and control, alongside internal latches and masks for data management. Configurable via Generate statements, the module selectively compiles blocks to handle various operations and data widths efficiently, ensuring smooth and dynamic memory access within different system architectures."
