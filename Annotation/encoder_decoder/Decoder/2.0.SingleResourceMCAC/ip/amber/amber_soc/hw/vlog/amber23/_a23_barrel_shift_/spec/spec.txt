Module name: a23_barrel_shift. Module specification: The `a23_barrel_shift` module performs various bit-shift operations including logical shift left (LSL), logical shift right (LSR), arithmetic shift right (ASR), and rotate right (ROR) on a 32-bit input (`i_in`). These operations are controlled by a 2-bit signal (`i_function`) that specifies the type of shift, an 8-bit shift amount (`i_shift_amount`), a carry-in bit (`i_carry_in`), and a signal to override the shift amount to zero (`i_shift_imm_zero`). The module outputs the 32-bit shifted result (`o_out`) and a carry-out flag (`o_carry_out`). Internally, the module uses wires such as `lsl_out`, `lsr_out`, `asr_out`, and `ror_out` to hold the results of the respective shift operations before the final output is determined based on the `i_function` code. The code itself is structured into four primary blocks, each responsible for computing one of the shift types using conditional assignments that consider edge cases like the shift amount being zero or maximum. These results are then selectively passed to the output ports governed by the shift function specified.
