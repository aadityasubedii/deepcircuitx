    "module": "The 'afifo' module implements a configurable synchronous or asynchronous FIFO buffer suited for environments with separate read/write clock domains, using the SYNC parameter to toggle between modes. It leverages dual-port memory for data storage, manages data access through separate write and read pointers which operate in Gray code to minimize synchronization errors, and employs combinatorial and synchronous logic blocks to update operational statuses such as full, empty, and almost full, allowing effective cross-clock domain data handling and buffer status signaling."
