The `iodrp_mcb_controller` manages DRAM memory cell operations by executing read and write commands based on a given memory address and data stream, facilitated through Intel's Dynamic Reconfigurable Port (DRP) technology. It operates on a clock signal (`DRP_CLK`), transitioning between states managed by a finite state machine to handle the sequencing of address setup and data transfer phases, while internal registers store transient data and addresses during transactions. Output responses indicate the device's operational status, whether it is ready or busy, and provide necessary data outputs back to the system.
