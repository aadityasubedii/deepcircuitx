Module name: a23_decode. Module specification: The a23_decode module is responsible for decoding ARM instructions in an ARM processor. It takes inputs such as clock (i_clk), read data (i_read_data), fetch stall signals (i_fetch_stall), interrupt requests (i_irq, i_firq), abort signals (i_dabt, i_iabt, i_adex), execute address (i_execute_address), abort status (i_abt_status), execute status bits (i_execute_status_bits), and multiply done signal (i_multiply_done). The module generates numerous output signals including decoded instruction information, register selection signals, ALU and barrel shifter control signals, memory access control signals, status bits and mode control signals, coprocessor operation signals, and abort handling signals. Internally, it uses various signals to manage instruction decoding, execution control, and state
