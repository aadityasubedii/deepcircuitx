The parameters of the module allow for customization of the PRBS width and seed settings. This includes initial seed values and a specific mode of operation which, when not in \"EYE_TEST\" mode, initializes the LFSR with a user-defined seed adjusted by a fixed value and a feature seed ('prbs_fseed_i'). If in normal operation (and not seed initialization or reset), the module updates its internal LFSR state based on specific XOR feedback tap positions, producing a new PRBS output every time the 'clk_en' is enabled on the rising edge of 'clk_i'. The resulting PRBS output is made available at 'prbs_o'. This functionality is critical in applications requiring random data patterns, typically used in digital communication systems for testing and validation purposes."

It is used to synchronize the operation of the LFSR and the updating of the PRBS.\n- `clk_en`: Clock enable input. This signal allows the LFSR to update and shift its contents when high, effectively generating the next bit in the PRBS sequence only during enabled clock cycles.\n- `rst_i`: Reset input. It initializes the LFSR with a seed value when high, setting the system to a known state.\n- `prbs_fseed_i`: Feature seed input. A 32-bit wide input used to modify the initial seed (`prbs_seed_i`) by being added to it during the initialization of the LFSR.\n- `prbs_seed_init`: Seed initialization control input. When set high, it triggers the LFSR to initialize using `prbs_seed_i` combined with `prbs_fseed_i` and a specific offset.\n- `prbs_seed_i`: Initial seed input for the LFSR. It is added to `prbs_fseed_i` during the initialization phase to form the starting state of the LFSR.\n\nOutput ports: prbs_o.\nExplanation:\n- `prbs_o`: PRBS output. This is the output port through which the generated pseudo-random binary sequence is made available. It is the direct outcome of the internal LFSR operations, updating each time the LFSR shifts based on the feedback configuration and the enabled clock cycles."

Each cycle where the output updates, `prbs` captures the new PRBS from `lfsr_q`, which is then presented at the module's output.\n- `lfsr_q`: This is a shift register used as a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) for generating the pseudo-random binary sequence. It holds the state of the PRBS generator. On each enabled clock cycle (conditioned by the `clk_en` signal), it shifts its content and updates specific bits based on feedback from other bits in the register, according to polynomial taps, which in this case seems to include tapping from bits [32], [7], [6], [3], [2], [1].
