    "spec": "Module name: data_prbs_gen. \n\nModule specification: The `data_prbs_gen` module is essential for generating pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) used predominantly in digital communication systems for testing and validation purposes. This module enables customization through parameters such as PRBS width and seed settings allowing initial seed values and specific operational modes. Notably, it includes an \"EYE_TEST\" mode for specialized initializations. The input ports include `clk_i` (the primary clock signal synchronizing LFSR updates), `clk_en` (enables updating of the LFSR only on enabled clock cycles), `rst_i` (resets the LFSR to a specified seed value), `prbs_fseed_i` (provides an additional 32-bit seed modification), `prbs_seed_init` (controls LFSR initialization combining the primary and feature seed), and `prbs_seed_i` (the initial PRBS seed). A singular output, `prbs_o`, outputs the resulting PRBS from the module. Internally, the module leverages a shift register `lfsr_q` to maintain the state of the PRBS generator, and a register `prbs` to hold the current PRBS output which is a direct derivative excluding the highest bit used for feedback calculations. The code structure includes conditional initialization and update blocks for `lfsr_q` based on input signals and runtime conditions, directly affecting the PRBS output through continuous feedback from configured polynomial taps. This sophisticated feedback mechanism dynamically updates `lfsr_q` during each enabled clock cycle, ensuring the PRBS is efficiently generated per required specifications. This module ultimately acts as a robust PRBS generator suitable for intricate digital system testing scenarios.",

The parameters of the module allow for customization of the PRBS width and seed settings. This includes initial seed values and a specific mode of operation which, when not in \"EYE_TEST\" mode, initializes the LFSR with a user-defined seed adjusted by a fixed value and a feature seed ('prbs_fseed_i'). If in normal operation (and not seed initialization or reset), the module updates its internal LFSR state based on specific XOR feedback tap positions, producing a new PRBS output every time the 'clk_en' is enabled on the rising edge of 'clk_i'. The resulting PRBS output is made available at 'prbs_o'.

It is used to synchronize the operation of the LFSR and the updating of the PRBS.\n- `clk_en`: Clock enable input. This signal allows the LFSR to update and shift its contents when high, effectively generating the next bit in the PRBS sequence only during enabled clock cycles.\n- `rst_i`: Reset input. It initializes the LFSR with a seed value when high, setting the system to a known state.\n- `prbs_fseed_i`: Feature seed input. A 32-bit wide input used to modify the initial seed (`prbs_seed_i`) by being added to it during the initialization of the LFSR.\n- `prbs_seed_init`: Seed initialization control input. When set high, it triggers the LFSR to initialize using `prbs_seed_i` combined with `prbs_fseed_i` and a specific offset.\n- `prbs_seed_i`: Initial seed input for the LFSR.

It mirrors the content of `lfsr_q` excluding the highest bit used for feedback calculation. Each cycle where the output updates, `prbs` captures the new PRBS from `lfsr_q`, which is then presented at the module's output.\n- `lfsr_q`: This is a shift register used as a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) for generating the pseudo-random binary sequence. It holds the state of the PRBS generator. On each enabled clock cycle (conditioned by the `clk_en` signal), it shifts its content and updates specific bits based on feedback from other bits in the register, according to polynomial taps, which in this case seems to include tapping from bits [32], [7], [6], [3], [2], [1]. This continuous feedback and shifting mechanism generate the PRBS sequence which is part of standard testing and stress test methodologies in digital systems."
