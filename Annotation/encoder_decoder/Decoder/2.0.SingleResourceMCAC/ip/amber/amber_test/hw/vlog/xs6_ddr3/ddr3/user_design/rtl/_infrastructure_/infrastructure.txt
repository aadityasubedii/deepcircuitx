The infrastructure module manages clock signals for digital systems, handling differential or single-ended inputs and orchestrating synchronization through a PLL for stable output clocks and reset signals. It dynamically adjusts clocks with parameters like division and multiplication, uses buffers for clock stabilization, and incorporates shift registers for clean reset signal synchronization, ensuring precise and reliable system operations.
