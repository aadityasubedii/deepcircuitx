Module name: main_mem. 

Module specification: The `main_mem` module simulates main memory functionalities for systems using the Wishbone bus protocol. It's capable of handling data read and write operations with parameterizable data and selection widths. Key inputs include `i_clk` (system clock), `i_mem_ctrl` (memory control signal), `i_wb_adr` (Wishbone address input), `i_wb_sel` (byte select lines), `i_wb_we` (write enable), `i_wb_dat` (data input), `i_wb_cyc` (transaction cycle), and `i_wb_stb` (transaction strobe). The module outputs are `o_wb_dat` (data output), `o_wb_ack` (acknowledge signal), and `o_wb_err` (error status). Internal signals include `ram` (the memory storage), and signals like `start_write` and `start_read` which control the initiation of write and read operations, respectively, along with their respective delay signals. `masked_wdata`, `wr_en`, `wr_mask`, `wr_data`, and `addr_d1` orchestrate data manipulation and storage, addressing how data is written or read from the memory. Based on the configured data width (`WB_DWIDTH`), the module accommodates either 128-bit or 32-bit operations using either `wb_rdata128` or `wb_rdata32` with corresponding conditionally compiled generate blocks managing the operations relative to the data bus size. This setup ensures flexibility and configurability to adapt to different system requirements.
