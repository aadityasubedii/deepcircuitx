    "module": "The 'iodrp_controller' module interfaces with memory cells for read and write operations, controlled via a finite state machine (FSM) that reacts to an external clock and command inputs, effectuating state transitions that handle address setting, data transfer, and readiness signaling. It utilizes internal registers for data handling, serializes input data for memory operations, and employs a combination of selection and control signals to manage the phase transitions and output activations, ensuring synchronization and operational correctness."
