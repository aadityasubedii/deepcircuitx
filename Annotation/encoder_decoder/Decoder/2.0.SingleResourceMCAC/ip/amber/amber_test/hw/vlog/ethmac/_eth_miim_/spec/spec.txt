Module name: eth_miim. 
Module specification: The eth_miim module is responsible for managing Medium Independent Interface Management (MIIM) operations in Ethernet devices. Operates synchronously with a clock (Clk) signal and can be reset via the Reset signal. Input ports include Divider to set clock division for Management Data Clock (Mdc), NoPre to disable preamble, CtrlData as control data for PHY, Rgad and Fiad to address PHY registers and devices, Mdi for incoming management data, and signals to control read and write operations (WCtrlData, RStat, ScanStat). Output ports comprise Mdc, Mdo for outgoing management data, MdoEn as output enable signal, Busy to indicate operational status, Prsd for processed data, LinkFail and Nvalid for link integrity and data validity, and other control outputs for various states and updates in the module. Key internal signals include several flip-flops for debouncing control signals, managing operation timing, and holding intermediate states necessary for precise operation control. Different blocks in the code manage operations such as initiating and ending operations (using EndBusy, InProgress signals), data transfer and latching (using LatchByte, BitCounter), and synchronization and output (through attached sub-modules like clock generation and shift register). The architecture ensures robust coordination between data write/read operations, timing management, and PHY interface controls, crucial for reliable MIIM operations in Ethernet settings.
