It handles the reading and writing of registers based on the input control signals and mode of operation. The module reacts to mode changes (user, interrupt, fast interrupt, and supervisor modes) and selectively updates registers based on these modes. It also addresses stalls in fetching, instructions, and changes to program counters, managing the current state and next state appropriately. Different modes influence which specific register sets are active for read or write operations, taking into account exception handling and different operating contexts. The output signals reflect the current selected or modified registers and the program counter. This plays a crucial role in the dynamic operation of the CPU, handling variations in behavior and permissions based on runtime conditions and control inputs."
