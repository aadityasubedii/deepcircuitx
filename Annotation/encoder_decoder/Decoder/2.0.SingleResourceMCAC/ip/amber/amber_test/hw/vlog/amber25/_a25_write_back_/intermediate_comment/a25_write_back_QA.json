It also includes logic to latch the data address when not stalled. The inputs include various signals like clock, reset, control signals, and data from memory. The outputs provide the read data, its validity, and the address for the load-register to other stages of the pipeline. The module ensures that the data is only updated when not stalled and resets to a default state upon a reset signal. Additionally, it includes handling for test and scan modes for diagnostic purposes."
