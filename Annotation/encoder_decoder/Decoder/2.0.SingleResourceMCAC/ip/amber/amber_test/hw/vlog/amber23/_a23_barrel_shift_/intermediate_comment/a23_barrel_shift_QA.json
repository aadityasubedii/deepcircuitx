It can do logical left shift (LSL), logical right shift (LSR), arithmetic right shift (ASR), and rotate right (ROR). The type of operation is determined by the 'i_function' input. The shift amount is given by 'i_shift_amount', and there are also conditions where 'i_carry_in' can affect the output, or operations could conditionally depend on if an immediate shift amount is zero ('i_shift_imm_zero'). Each type of shift constructs the output differently, often conditioning on the shift amount to decide how bits are shifted or rotated. The output of the operation is placed in 'o_out', and the carry output from the shift is signaled through 'o_carry_out'."

Depending on the value of `i_shift_amount` and `i_shift_imm_zero`, it generates the shifted value along with a potential output carry bit. This shift involves moving bits towards the left and filling the resulting empty bits with zero.\n\n- `lsr_out`: This wire is responsible for the logical right shift (LSR) results. Similar to `lsl_out`, it gets conditioned on `i_shift_amount` and `i_shift_imm_zero`. This operation shifts bits towards the right and fills from the left with zero.\n\n- `asr_out`: This wire carries the result of the arithmetic right shift (ASR) operation. Unlike logical shifts, arithmetic shifts preserve the sign of the number (considered to be in the leftmost bit) while filling the vacated positions.\n\n- `ror_out`: This wire outputs the results for the rotate right (ROR) operation. In this case, bits shifted out on the right re-enter on the left, effectively rotating the whole bit pattern. The operations are also conditioned based on the `i_shift_amount` and, interestingly, the lower 5 bits of `i_shift_amount` determine the effective rotation as rotation over 32 bits results in the same number. \n\nThese internal signals each capture the result of their respective operations and feed into a multiplexer controlled by the `i_function` input, which decides the type of operation to be output based on these internal calculations."
