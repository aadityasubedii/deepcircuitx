    "module": "The 'mcb_soft_calibration_top' module manages calibration processes for DDR memory systems, focusing on synchronization, interface adjustments, and dynamic calibration to optimize memory interactions. It integrates a nested 'mcb_soft_calibration' sub-module for detailed calibration management and utilizes a range of input and output signals to control and monitor memory operations. Internal signals facilitate communication and control within these calibration processes, employing IODRP blocks for precise I/O pin data handling. Conditional blocks further tailor the module's behavior based on memory type and calibration requirements."
