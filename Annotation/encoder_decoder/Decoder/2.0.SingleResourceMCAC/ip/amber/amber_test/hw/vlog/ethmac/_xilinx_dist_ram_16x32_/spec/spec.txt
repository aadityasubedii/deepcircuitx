Module name: xilinx_dist_ram_16x32. Module specification: The xilinx_dist_ram_16x32 module implements a 16x32 dual-port distributed RAM optimized for Xilinx FPGAs, using a series of RAM16X1D primitives to handle its operations. It features multiple input ports: 'we' (write enable) which controls whether data is written to memory, 'wclk' (write clock) which synchronizes the write operations, 'data_in' a 32-bit wide bus that holds the new data to be written to memory, 'write_address' and 'read_address' both 4-bit addresses that specify the locations for writing and reading operations respectively. The module includes a single output port: 'data_out', a 32-bit wide bus which outputs data read from the specified memory address. Internally, it utilizes two signals 'waddr' and 'raddr' which directly map to 'write_address' and 'read_address' to simplify addressing in the individual RAM primitives. The Verilog code is structured into block instantiations of RAM16X1D, one block for each of the 32 bits of 'data_in', with each block connecting to corresponding bits in the 'data_out', controlled by common clock, write enable, and address signals. This arrangement allows for simultaneous independent read and write operations at separate addresses.
