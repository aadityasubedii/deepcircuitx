Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: This module is a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) interface, designed to handle the interface between user logic and DDR/DDR2/DDR3 memory. It supports a configurable number of data pins (4, 8, or 16) and various memory configurations. The module takes inputs such as clocks, resets, command signals, and data for multiple ports, and outputs memory interface signals, status flags, and read data. Key input ports include sysclk_2x, pll_ce_0, sys_rst, and various port-specific signals for commands, writes, and reads. Output ports include memory interface signals (e.g., mcbx_dram_addr, mcbx_dram_dq) and status signals for each port. Internal signals handle aspects such as clock management, data path control, and IOB instanti
