Module name: eth_maccontrol. 
Module specification: The `eth_maccontrol` module is designed for handling the Media Access Control (MAC) layer operations tailored to an Ethernet interface, focusing on managing Ethernet frame transmissions and receptions. The module operates with various input signals such as `MTxClk` and `MRxClk` for transmit and receive clock signals, `TxReset` and `RxReset` for resetting transmit and receive operations, and data handling signals like `TxDataIn` for input data to be transmitted and `RxData` for incoming data received. Moreover, control signals like `TPauseRq` manage flow control, and configuration signals such as `DlyCrcEn` enable delayed CRC operations. The output signals include `TxDataOut` for the data line transmitting Ethernet frame data and control signals like `TxDoneOut` indicating the completion of a data transmission. The module utilizes internal signals such as `TxUsedDataOutDetected` to detect active data output usage, and control signals like `MuxedDone` and `MuxedAbort` to manage the transmission state depending on conditions like frame completion or abortion. Within the module, different blocks handle specific tasks; `eth_receivecontrol` manages the reception of data frames and `eth_transmitcontrol` supervises frame transmission processes. These blocks utilize internal and external signals to coordinate tasks like pause frame detection, frame padding, and CRC operations in compliance with Ethernet standards, ensuring robust data communication over an Ethernet interface.
