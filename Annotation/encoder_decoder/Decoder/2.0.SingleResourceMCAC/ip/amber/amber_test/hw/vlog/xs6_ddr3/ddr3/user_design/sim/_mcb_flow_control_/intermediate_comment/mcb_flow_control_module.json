    "module": "The mcb_flow_control module manages memory access operations (read/write) for memory control blocks in FPGA systems, particularly suited for the SPARTAN6 family. It uses an internal finite state machine (FSM) to process commands and control data flow based on inputs like command type, memory address, and burst length. The module transitions through states such as READY, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT, and REFRESH_ST, determining the appropriate actions like command execution and data transfer readiness triggered by input and state conditions, ensuring efficient and robust memory operation management."
