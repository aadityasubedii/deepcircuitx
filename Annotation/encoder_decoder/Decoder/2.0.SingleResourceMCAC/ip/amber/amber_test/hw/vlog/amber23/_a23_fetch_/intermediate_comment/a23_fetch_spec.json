    "spec": "Module name: a23_fetch.\nModule specification: The a23_fetch module operates as a fetch unit in a system implementing caching capabilities and interacts with a Wishbone bus interface. It decides whether to fetch data from the cache or direct bus memory based on address cachability, cache status, and additional control flags. The input ports include `i_clk` (clock signal), `i_address` (memory address for reads), `i_address_valid` (validates the provided address), and various other controls like `i_write_data`, `i_priviledged`, `i_cache_enable`, and signals related to the Wishbone bus interactions such as `i_wb_dat` and `i_wb_ack`. The primary output ports are `o_read_data` (the fetched data), `o_fetch_stall` (fetch stall signal), and Wishbone-specific outputs like `o_wb_adr` and `o_wb_we`. Internal signals such as `cache_stall`, `wb_stall`, and `sel_cache` assist in managing the cache and bus operations logic, determining stalling and data source selection. The module consists of submodules: a23_cache and a23_wishbone, which handle the detailed cache operations and Wishbone bus interactions, respectively, driven by signals like `sel_cache` for cache interaction selection and `sel_wb` for bus interaction control.",

It decides whether to fetch data from the cache or direct bus memory based on address cachability, cache status, and additional control flags. The input ports include `i_clk` (clock signal), `i_address` (memory address for reads), `i_address_valid` (validates the provided address), and various other controls like `i_write_data`, `i_priviledged`, `i_cache_enable`, and signals related to the Wishbone bus interactions such as `i_wb_dat` and `i_wb_ack`. The primary output ports are `o_read_data` (the fetched data), `o_fetch_stall` (fetch stall signal), and Wishbone-specific outputs like `o_wb_adr` and `o_wb_we`. Internal signals such as `cache_stall`, `wb_stall`, and `sel_cache` assist in managing the cache and bus operations logic, determining stalling and data source selection. The module consists of submodules: a23_cache and a23_wishbone, which handle the detailed cache operations and Wishbone bus interactions, respectively, driven by signals like `sel_cache` for cache interaction selection and `sel_wb` for bus interaction control."
