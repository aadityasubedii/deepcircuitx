Module name: infrastructure. Module specification: The "infrastructure" module is designed to manage clock signals and synchronization for digital systems, handling both differential and single-ended clock inputs. It leverages a phase-locked loop (PLL) to generate various clock outputs and a reset signal, tailored for specific operational frequencies and reset behaviors. The input ports include `sys_clk_p` and `sys_clk_n` for differential clock signals, `sys_clk` for single-ended clock input, and `sys_rst_i` for the system reset. The output ports consist of `clk0` the main system clock, `rst0` a reset output synchronized to `clk0`, along with `async_rst`, `sysclk_2x`, `sysclk_2x_180`, `mcb_drp_clk`, `pll_ce_0`, `pll_ce_90`, and `pll_lock`, covering various clock phases and uses such as DRAM interfacing and serial data control. Internal signals like `clk_2x_0`, `clk_2x_180`, and `clk0_bufg` are used for intermediate clock buffering and feedback mechanisms, with `locked` and `sys_clk_ibufg` ensuring reliable and stable clock operation. The module contains blocks for handling different clock types using `IBUFGDS` for differential and `IBUFG` for single-ended inputs, configuring the PLL with parameters like clock division and multiplier settings, and managing reset synchronization with shift registers to prevent glitches. These elements ensure robust functionality tailored for reliable digital system operations requiring precise timings and synchronization.
