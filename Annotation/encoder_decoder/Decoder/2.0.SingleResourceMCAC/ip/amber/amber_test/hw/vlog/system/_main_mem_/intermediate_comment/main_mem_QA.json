It supports configurable data widths and provides selective data masking during writes. The module includes logic to handle read and write accesses, generate acknowledgments for completed bus transactions, and manage internal operations like address decoding and data buffering. These processes are controlled by various input signals such as write enable and address inputs and are synchronized with the system clock. Furthermore, the module uses parameterized data width and selection width to potentially adapt to different bus configurations."

Used to synchronize all operations within the module.\n  - `i_mem_ctrl`: Memory control signal indicating the mode of address manipulation, affecting how the address inputs are handled.\n  - `i_wb_adr`: Wishbone bus address input. Specifies the target address for data read or write operations.\n  - `i_wb_sel`: Wishbone bus select lines. Used to specify which byte lanes in the data bus are active during data transfers.\n  - `i_wb_we`: Wishbone bus write enable signal. Indicates if the current operation is a write (when high) or read (when low).\n  - `i_wb_dat`: Wishbone bus data input. Provides the data to be written into the memory during write operations.\n  - `i_wb_cyc`: Wishbone bus cycle signal. Indicates the start and duration of a bus transaction.\n  - `i_wb_stb`: Wishbone bus strobe signal. Indicates a valid data transfer or transaction is in progress on the bus.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_ack`, `o_wb_err`.\nExplanation:\n  - `o_wb_dat`: Wishbone bus data output. Holds the data read from the memory in response to a read operation.\n  - `o_wb_ack`: Wishbone bus acknowledge signal. Indicates the successful completion of a read or write operation.\n  - `o_wb_err`: Wishbone bus error signal. Provides an error status related to the bus operations, indicated as low (no error) in this module."

It is asserted when the Wishbone strobe (`i_wb_stb`) and write enable (`i_wb_we`) signals are active, and the module is not busy.\n- `start_read`: A control signal that initiates a read operation when active. It is asserted when the Wishbone strobe (`i_wb_stb`) is active, the write enable (`i_wb_we`) is inactive, and the module is not busy.\n- `start_read_d1`, `start_read_d2`: Delayed versions of the `start_read` signal. These are used for synchronizing and timing the read data availability relative to the bus clock.\n- `rd_data`: Holds the data read from memory (`ram`) based on the address provided. It serves as the source data in read operations.\n- `masked_wdata`: Represents the write data after applying byte-enable masking. This signal is used for conditional write operations based on the active byte lanes specified by `i_wb_sel`.\n- `wr_en`: A write enable signal for the memory that is latched from the `start_write` control signal during write operations.\n- `wr_mask`: A write mask derived from the byte selection (`i_wb_sel`) that determines which bytes of the data should be written to memory.\n- `wr_data`: The data intended for writing into the memory, which is derived directly from Wishbone data input (`i_wb_dat`).\n- `addr_d1`: Latched and possibly modified address derived from the Wishbone address input (`i_wb_adr`). This signal is manipulated based on the `i_mem_ctrl` input signal to control address mapping in the memory array.\n- `busy`: Indicates whether the module is currently processing a read or a write operation. It's used to prevent new operations from starting until the current one is completed.\n- `wb_rdata128`, `wb_rdata32`: Buffered outputs holding the read data to be sent back to the Wishbone bus. The specific register used depends on the configured data width (`WB_DWIDTH`). These registers act as the final data output buffers reformatted suitably for either 128-bit or 32-bit bus widths."
