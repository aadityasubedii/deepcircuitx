Module name: eth_test. 
Module specification: The "eth_test" module is designed to manage Ethernet communication, particularly focusing on the transmission and reception of Ethernet frames. The module interfaces with physical layer devices through an MDIO interface, and handles data using Ethernet protocols. It accepts inputs through ports such as `md_io` for bidirectional MDIO data, `mdc_i` as the clock for MDIO operations, `mtx_clk_i` for transmit operations, `mrxd_i` which is a 4-bit input representing received data, and `mrxdv_i` signaling the validity of received data. Outputs include `mtxd_o`, a 4-bit line for transmitting data, `mtxdv_o` signaling data validity, and `mtxerr_o` indicating transmission errors. Key internal signals include `mem`, an array storing packet data, `eth` for Ethernet header data, and `state_r`, among others, which help manage state machines for different operations like transmission, reception, and MDIO communication. The code features sections like initial setup, always blocks for transmission logic, reception handling, and MDIO management, each encapsulated to handle specific aspects of Ethernet frame processing and hardware interfacing. This structured design allows for effective management of Ethernet packet transmission and reception, interfacing with physical devices, and error handling in digital communication systems.
