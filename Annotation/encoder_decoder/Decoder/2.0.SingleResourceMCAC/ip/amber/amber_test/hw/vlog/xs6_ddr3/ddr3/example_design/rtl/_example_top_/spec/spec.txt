Module name: example_top. Module specification: This module is a top-level design for a DDR3 SDRAM memory controller interface. It instantiates a memory controller wrapper (memc3_wrapper_inst) and a testbench module (memc3_tb_top_inst) to manage memory operations and provide access through multiple ports. The module has input ports for system clock (c3_sys_clk) and reset (c3_sys_rst_i), output ports for calibration status (calib_done) and error signals (error), and various DDR3 SDRAM interface signals (mcb3_dram_*) for address, control, and data transfer. It also includes inout ports for the bidirectional data bus (mcb3_dram_dq) and data strobe signals (mcb3_dram_*dqs*). Internally, the module
