    "module": "The cmd_gen module generates memory commands for a memory interface, supporting various address, instruction, and burst length modes. It creates read/write commands with appropriate addresses, instructions, and burst lengths based on selected modes and input parameters. The module implements PRBS generators for address and instruction generation, handles refresh command timing, and manages read/write operation flow. It includes configurable parameters for different FPGA families, data widths, and burst lengths. The module uses a state machine to control command generation, incorporating input signals for mode selection, seed loading, and traffic control. It also manages read buffer availability and enforces timing constraints for proper memory access."
