Module name: eth_clockgen. 
Module specification: The `eth_clockgen` module is designed to generate a slower clock signal (Mdc) based on a division of an input clock signal (Clk). This division is dictated by an 8-bit `Divider` input, which specifies how often the Mdc signal toggles in relation to the Clk input. The essential input ports include `Clk`, which is the primary clock signal; `Reset`, which initializes the module's state; and `Divider`, which sets the frequency division factor. Output ports consist of `Mdc`, the derived clock output; `MdcEn`, an enable signal active when Mdc is low; and `MdcEn_n`, an enable signal active when Mdc is high. Internal signals such as `CountEq0` (indicates when the counter reaches zero), `Counter` (a decrementing counter), `CounterPreset` (the initial value of the counter based on Divider), and `TempDivider` (adjusted Divider ensuring logical operations), assist in the module's operation. The Verilog code is structured into several functional blocks: one block handles the condition and initialization of the `Counter`, another toggles the `Mdc` signal and manages its states, and additional assignments compute control and preset values for the counting mechanism, enabling efficient and synchronized clock signal generation.
