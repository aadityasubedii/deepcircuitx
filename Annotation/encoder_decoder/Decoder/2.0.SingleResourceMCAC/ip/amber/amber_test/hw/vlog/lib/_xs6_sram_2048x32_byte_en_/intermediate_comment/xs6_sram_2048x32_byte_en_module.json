    "module": "This module implements a 2048x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA primitives. It utilizes four RAMB16BWER blocks, each handling 8 bits of the 32-bit data width, to support read and write operations with byte-level granularity. The module combines write enable and byte enable signals to control individual byte writes within a 32-bit word, and uses a read-first write mode. It features configurable initial values for each SRAM block and provides an 11-bit addressable memory space."
