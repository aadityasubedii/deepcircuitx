Module name: a25_wishbone_buf. 

Module specification: The a25_wishbone_buf is a Verilog module designed to serve as a transaction buffer for the Wishbone bus interface. It handles and buffers read and write requests, managing data flow between the Wishbone master and slave. The module features input ports including a system clock (`clk`), reset (`reset`), test signals (`scan_enable`, `test_mode`), write-specific (`i_write`, `i_wdata`, `i_be`, `i_addr`), and read-specific inputs (`i_rdata`, `i_rdata_valid`). Output ports comprise data and control signals (`o_rdata`, `o_ack`, `o_valid`, `o_write`, `o_wdata`, `o_be`, `o_addr`) that communicate transaction statuses and data back to the bus. Internally, the module uses signals like `wbuf_used_r` to track buffer usage, `wbuf_*` arrays for data, address, and control buffering, `in_wreq` for internal write request detection, and flags (`busy_reading_r`, `wait_rdata_valid_r`, `ack_owed_r`) for managing state transitions and acknowledgments. The Verilog code is structured into blocks handling reset conditions, data buffering mechanics, pointer management, and output assignments. Each block is critical for ensuring the integrity of data transactions and maintaining buffer efficiency under different operating conditions, such as during resets, ordinary operation, or pending bus acknowledgments.
