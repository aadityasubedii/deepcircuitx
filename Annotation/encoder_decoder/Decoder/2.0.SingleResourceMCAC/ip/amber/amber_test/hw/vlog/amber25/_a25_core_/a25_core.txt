The a25_core module implements a processor core, handling instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory operations, and write-back stages. It achieves this through a modular design, incorporating sub-modules for each stage: fetch, decode, execute, memory, and write-back. The module interfaces with external memory and peripherals via a Wishbone bus, manages interrupts, and supports coprocessor operations. It utilizes pipelining and stall mechanisms to optimize performance, while maintaining precise control over CPU modes, status flags, and memory accesses. The design includes features for testing and debugging, such as scan chains and test modes.
