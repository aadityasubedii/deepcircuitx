It interfaces with various other components and sub-modules like memory, coprocessor, and I/O through the Wishbone bus interface. Specifically, it handles operations related to instruction processing, data handling, exception management, and interactions with coprocessor interfaces. Key operations include managing internal pipeline stalls, status flags, and transitions across different processor states. It supports integration with hardware-based debugging and test environments, indicated by its implementation of scan and test modes. Additionally, the module deals with interrupts, fault detection, and memory operations, ensuring the coherent and efficient execution of instructions."
