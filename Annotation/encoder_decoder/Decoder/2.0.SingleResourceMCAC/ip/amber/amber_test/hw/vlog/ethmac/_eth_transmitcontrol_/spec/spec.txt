Module name: eth_transmitcontrol. Module specification: The 'eth_transmitcontrol' module is dedicated to managing Ethernet transmission control, specifically focusing on generating control frames such as Ethernet pause frames influenced by network conditions. The input ports include various signals like MTxClk (the Ethernet transmit clock), TxReset (reset signal for initializing states), TxUsedDataIn (indicates data usage status at input), and several others related to transmission status and control requests, such as TPauseRq for pause requests and TxFlow to manage flow control. The output ports, such as TxCtrlStartFrm and TxCtrlEndFrm, manage the signaling for start and end of control frames, while others like ControlData send out frame data bytes formed by the module. Internally, the module uses signals like DlyCrcCnt for managing CRC calculation delays, ByteCnt for tracking byte positions in frames, and other related signals that support the logical decision making for frame timing and data handling. The Verilog code is structured into blocks handling reset conditions and ensuring appropriate initialization of outputs, decision-making for transmission conditions, maintaining counters for byte and CRC delay, and handling data for control frames based on byte count and specific MAC address and pause time values. Each block efficiently contributes to conditional operations, ensuring synchronized handling of Ethernet frames based on dynamic internal and input states.
