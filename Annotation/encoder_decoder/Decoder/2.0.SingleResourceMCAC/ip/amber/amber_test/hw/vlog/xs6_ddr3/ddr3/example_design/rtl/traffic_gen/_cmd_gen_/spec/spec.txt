Module name: cmd_gen. Module specification: The cmd_gen module generates commands for memory operations in a hardware design. It creates memory addresses, instructions (read/write/refresh), and burst lengths based on various input modes and parameters. The module takes inputs such as clk_i (clock), rst_i (reset), run_traffic_i (enable signal), rd_buff_avail_i (read buffer availability), start_addr_i and end_addr_i (address range), and various mode selection inputs. It outputs addr_o (generated address), instr_o (instruction), bl_o (burst length), and cmd_o_vld (command valid signal). Internally, it uses signals like prbs_addr (PRBS-generated address), seq_addr (sequential address), and instr_out (instruction before pipelining) to manage command generation. The module is divided into sections for address generation, instruction
