The FIFO uses dual pointers for read and write operations, encoded in Gray code to minimize synchronization errors across clock domains. It has input controls for write (`wr_en`, `wr_data`) and read (`rd_en`), and it outputs the status flags `full`, `empty`, and `almost_full` to signal the state of the FIFO buffer. The FIFO ensures data integrity during the handshaking of read and write operations from different clock domains, typically used in systems where producer and consumer operate asynchronously."
