It takes a 32-bit input (`i_in`), a 32-bit output (`o_out`), a carry input (`i_carry_in`), and a carry output (`o_carry_out`). The type of shift and its properties are dictated by input parameters such as the shift amount (`i_shift_amount`), whether the shift amount is zero (`i_shift_imm_zero`), and the function code (`i_function`) that specifies the operation type. The module handles various edge cases, including shifts greater than 31 bits and scenarios where different conditions affect the shifted output and carry. The operations are defined primarily using combinatorial logic with extensive use of conditions and masking to generate the correct results."
