    "module": "This module implements a UART interface with configurable baud rates, FIFO buffers, and interrupt generation. It handles serial data transmission and reception, supports Wishbone bus interface for register access, and includes flow control (CTS/RTS). The implementation features separate transmit and receive state machines, FIFO management for both directions, and configurable parameters for timing and data formatting. It also includes interrupt generation logic, error handling, and status reporting through various control and status registers."
