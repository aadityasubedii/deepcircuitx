It supports differential or single-ended input clock types and configures the PLL with several parameters like input clock period, output divides, and multipliers. The module outputs include multiple clock signals that might be phase-shifted and at different frequencies, as well as multiple reset signals. The resets and clocks are synchronized and potentially wait for the PLL to lock, indicating stable operations. Additionally, the module includes buffering and clock enabling based on the PLL lock status to ensure stable output signals."

In the configuration where the input clock type is \"DIFFERENTIAL\", these signals are used to feed the clock to the PLL.\n- sys_clk: This is the single-ended input clock signal used when the input clock type is set to \"SINGLE_ENDED\".

These are typically used for high-speed operations or interfacing with certain types of memory controllers.\n- mcb_drp_clk: Additional clock signal that is gated by the PLL lock status, ensuring that it is stable and active only when the PLL is locked.\n- pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90: Control signals for the phase alignment hardware, derived from the PLL outputs at different phases.\n- pll_lock: This signal indicates the lock status of the PLL, used as a status indicator that the output clocks are stable and the PLL is functioning correctly."
