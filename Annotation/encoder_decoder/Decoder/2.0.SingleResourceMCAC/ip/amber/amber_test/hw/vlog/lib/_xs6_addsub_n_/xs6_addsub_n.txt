The `xs6_addsub_n` module performs addition or subtraction on two operands, `i_a` and `i_b`, based on the control signal `i_sub`. Utilizing a DSP48A1 block, the module configures arithmetic operations using internal signals `opmode`, `in_a`, and `in_b` to match operand sizes and operation modes. The result and carry-out are output through `o_sum` and `o_co`, with signal connections and configurations ensuring correct execution of the specified arithmetic.
