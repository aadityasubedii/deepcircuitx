Module name: iodrp_mcb_controller. 

Module specification: The 'iodrp_mcb_controller' module manages memory cell data read and write operations for DRAM using a Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP). Its primary functionality includes handling DRP commands and maintaining a finite state machine (FSM) for managing different states of a memory operation. The module handles input ports such as `memcell_address` (an 8-bit memory cell address), `write_data` (8-bit data for write operations), `rd_not_write` (control flag for selecting memory operation), `cmd_valid` (command validity signal), `use_broadcast` (broadcast mode indicator), `drp_ioi_addr` (5-bit DRP addressing), `sync_rst` (synchronous reset), `DRP_CLK` (DRP clock), and `DRP_SDO` (serial data output from DRP). Output ports include `read_data` (read data from memory), `rdy_busy_n` (ready/busy status), `DRP_CS` (DRP chip select), `DRP_SDI` (serial data input to DRP), `DRP_ADD` (address phase indicator), `DRP_BKST` (broadcast strobe), and `MCB_UIREAD` (indicates if the DRP operation is a read). Internal signals like `memcell_addr_reg`, `data_reg`, `shift_through_reg`, `load_shift_n`, `addr_data_sel_n`, `bit_cnt`, `rd_not_write_reg`, `AddressPhase`, etc., support operations like data buffering, selecting data/address phase, bit counting, and shift operations. The code consists of FSM encoding for state transitions, data multiplexing for DRP address handling, task implementation for data expansion, and always blocks for state updates, signal assignments, and output management based on the state of operations and input conditions. Through its design, the module efficiently controls read/write processes to DRAM by interfacing with the DRP, ensuring seamless data handling and state management.
