This module implements a Memory Controller Block (MCB) wrapper for interfacing user logic with DDR/DDR2/DDR3 memory. It handles address mapping, data read/write operations, and IOB instantiations for external memory interfacing. The wrapper supports multiple ports, configurable data widths, and various memory types. It uses OSERDES2 and IODRP2_MCB primitives for I/O operations, implements DQS management and calibration logic, and provides parameterizable memory timings and addressing. The module also includes logic for self-refresh operations and supports different port configurations for flexible memory access.
