    "module": "This module implements a top-level embedded processor system with various peripherals. It integrates an Amber processor core, memory interfaces, communication interfaces (UART and Ethernet), timers, and interrupt controllers using a Wishbone bus architecture. The system manages clock and reset generation, processor core integration, memory control (including DDR3 interface), UART and Ethernet communication, interrupt handling, and peripheral control. It utilizes a modular design with separate components for each major function, interconnected through the Wishbone bus, allowing for flexible system configuration and expansion."
