    "spec": "Module name: xs6_sram_256x21_line_en. \nModule specification: The xs6_sram_256x21_line_en is a parameterized Verilog module designed to interface with a Xilinx RAMB8BWER dual-port RAM component. The module is intended for applications requiring single, dual-port RAM operations with selective read and write capabilities based on an enable signal. The module parameters include DATA_WIDTH and ADDRESS_WIDTH which specify the width of the data and the address respectively. This specific instance is configured for a data width of 21 bits and an address width of 8 bits.\n\nInput ports of this module include `i_clk` (the clock signal for synchronization), `i_write_data` (the data to be written to RAM), `i_write_enable` (a control signal to enable writing when high and reading when low), and `i_address` (the RAM address for data storage or retrieval). The sole output port, `o_read_data`, outputs the data read from the RAM, which is constructed from lower and upper parts of the RAM's data.\n\nInternally, the module uses two significant signals: `read_data_lo` and `read_data_hi`. These signals capture the lower and upper parts of the dual-port RAM data respectively, and are used to assemble the complete data output via concatenation operations within the module.\n\nThe Verilog code includes instantiation of the Xilinx RAMB8BWER component which handles the physical memory operations based on the input signals. The configuration settings for this component enable SDP mode (Simple Dual Port) with specific data widths for the RAM operations. Data manipulation for reads and writes includes split operations for input data using specific bit slices and combines portions for output data assembly.\n\nAdditionally, the module incorporates initial blocks to check and display warnings if the DATA_WIDTH or ADDRESS_WIDTH parameters do not match expected values, ensuring correct setup and operational integrity.",

The module is parameterized with data width and address width. It takes a clock signal, write data, write enable signal, and address as inputs, and outputs the read data. During write operations, the write data are broken into two parts and written to the RAM. During read operations, parts of the data read from the RAM are recombined and output. This setup allows selective enabling of writing or reading operations based on the `i_write_enable` signal. Additionally, initialization checks ensure the data width and address width parameters are set correctly."

The module parameters include DATA_WIDTH and ADDRESS_WIDTH which specify the width of the data and the address respectively. This specific instance is configured for a data width of 21 bits and an address width of 8 bits.\n\nInput ports of this module include `i_clk` (the clock signal for synchronization), `i_write_data` (the data to be written to RAM), `i_write_enable` (a control signal to enable writing when high and reading when low), and `i_address` (the RAM address for data storage or retrieval). The sole output port, `o_read_data`, outputs the data read from the RAM, which is constructed from lower and upper parts of the RAM's data.\n\nInternally, the module uses two significant signals: `read_data_lo` and `read_data_hi`. These signals capture the lower and upper parts of the dual-port RAM data respectively, and are used to assemble the complete data output via concatenation operations within the module.\n\nThe Verilog code includes instantiation of the Xilinx RAMB8BWER component which handles the physical memory operations based on the input signals. The configuration settings for this component enable SDP mode (Simple Dual Port) with specific data widths for the RAM operations. Data manipulation for reads and writes includes split operations for input data using specific bit slices and combines portions for output data assembly.\n\nAdditionally, the module incorporates initial blocks to check and display warnings if the DATA_WIDTH or ADDRESS_WIDTH parameters do not match expected values, ensuring correct setup and operational integrity."
