Module name: eth_receivecontrol.
Module specification: The `eth_receivecontrol` module is a critical part of Ethernet networking equipment, aimed at managing the control logic for receiving Ethernet frames. Inputs include various signals such as MTxClk and MRxClk for timing, TxReset and RxReset for resets, RxData carrying incoming data, and several control signals like RxValid, RxStartFrm, and RxEndFrm that help track the frame's reception status. It uses the MAC address for filtering and identifies specific packet types via DlyCrcEn, TxDoneIn, and others to manage flow and operational session resets or aborts. Outputs of the module, such as Pause, ReceivedPauseFrm, AddressOK, and SetPauseTimer, provide signaling to other parts of the system about current network conditions and the framesâ€™ statuses. Internal signals such as TypeLength and ReservedMulticast help in identifying packet types and necessary addresses, while byte count signals (like ByteCntEq0, ByteCntEq12) keep track of positions in the data stream. Slot timers and pause timers manage the timing and scheduling of the network traffic. Significant code blocks include initializations of timer and address comparison operations, frame type checking, clock-driven state management for incoming frames and the setup or teardown of linking protocol conditions. Overall, this module ensures the appropriate synchronization, validation, and control needed for robust Ethernet frame reception.
