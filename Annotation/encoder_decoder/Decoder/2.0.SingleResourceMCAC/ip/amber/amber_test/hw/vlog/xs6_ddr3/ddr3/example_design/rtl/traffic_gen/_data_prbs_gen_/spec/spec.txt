Module name: data_prbs_gen. 

Module specification: The `data_prbs_gen` module is essential for generating pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) used predominantly in digital communication systems for testing and validation purposes. This module enables customization through parameters such as PRBS width and seed settings allowing initial seed values and specific operational modes. Notably, it includes an "EYE_TEST" mode for specialized initializations. The input ports include `clk_i` (the primary clock signal synchronizing LFSR updates), `clk_en` (enables updating of the LFSR only on enabled clock cycles), `rst_i` (resets the LFSR to a specified seed value), `prbs_fseed_i` (provides an additional 32-bit seed modification), `prbs_seed_init` (controls LFSR initialization combining the primary and feature seed), and `prbs_seed_i` (the initial PRBS seed). A singular output, `prbs_o`, outputs the resulting PRBS from the module. Internally, the module leverages a shift register `lfsr_q` to maintain the state of the PRBS generator, and a register `prbs` to hold the current PRBS output which is a direct derivative excluding the highest bit used for feedback calculations. The code structure includes conditional initialization and update blocks for `lfsr_q` based on input signals and runtime conditions, directly affecting the PRBS output through continuous feedback from configured polynomial taps. This sophisticated feedback mechanism dynamically updates `lfsr_q` during each enabled clock cycle, ensuring the PRBS is efficiently generated per required specifications. This module ultimately acts as a robust PRBS generator suitable for intricate digital system testing scenarios.
