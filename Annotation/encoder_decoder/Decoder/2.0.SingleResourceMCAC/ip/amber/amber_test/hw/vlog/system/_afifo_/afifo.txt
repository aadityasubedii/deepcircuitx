The "afifo" module implements an asynchronous FIFO buffer that facilitates data transfer between different clock domains using Gray code synchronization. It manages data input with `i_push` and `i_pop` signals based on the `wr_clk` and `rd_clk` respectively, and it uses internal pointers and their delayed versions to handle synchronization and cross-domain data integrity checks. Data storage and retrieval are organized through a simple indexing method, and full or empty states of the FIFO are efficiently tracked and communicated via output signals.
