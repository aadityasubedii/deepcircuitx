    "module": "This module implements a 1024x128-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using 8 RAMB16BWER primitives on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. It provides a 128-bit wide data interface with 10-bit addressing and supports byte-level write operations through a 16-bit byte enable signal. The SRAM is divided into two banks of 512 locations each, selected by the most significant address bit. The module uses separate write enable signals for each bank and includes parameters for initializing the memory contents. It supports synchronous read and write operations with a single clock input."
