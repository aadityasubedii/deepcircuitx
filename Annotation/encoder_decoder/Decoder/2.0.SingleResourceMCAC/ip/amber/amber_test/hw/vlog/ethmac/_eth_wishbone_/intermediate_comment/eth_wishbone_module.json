    "module": "This module implements an Ethernet Wishbone interface for managing transmit and receive operations in an Ethernet controller. It handles communication between the Wishbone bus and Ethernet MAC layer by managing buffer descriptors, transferring data between memory and FIFOs, generating interrupts, and managing status for transmit and receive paths. The module synchronizes operations between different clock domains, implements packet transmission and reception logic, and handles error conditions. It uses separate transmit and receive state machines, FIFO buffers for data storage, and various control signals to coordinate data flow and timing between the Wishbone bus and Ethernet MAC."
