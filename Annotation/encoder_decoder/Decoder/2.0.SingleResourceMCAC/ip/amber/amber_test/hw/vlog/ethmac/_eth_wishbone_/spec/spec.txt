Module name: eth_wishbone. Module specification: This module implements an Ethernet Wishbone interface for handling transmit and receive operations in an Ethernet controller. It manages communication between the Wishbone bus and the Ethernet MAC layer, handling buffer descriptors, data transfer between memory and FIFOs, interrupt generation, and status management for both transmit and receive paths. The module has numerous input ports including clocks (WB_CLK_I, MTxClk, MRxClk), data inputs (WB_DAT_I, RxData), control signals (WB_WE_I, TxRetry, TxAbort), and status signals (InvalidSymbol, LatchedCrcError). Output ports include data outputs (WB_DAT_O, TxData), control signals (TxStartFrm, TxEndFrm), and interrupt signals (Tx
