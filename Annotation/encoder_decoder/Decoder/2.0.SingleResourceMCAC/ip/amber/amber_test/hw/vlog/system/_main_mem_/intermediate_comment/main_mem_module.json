    "module": "The `main_mem` module simulates main memory for systems using the Wishbone bus protocol, supporting parameterizable data widths and managing data read/write operations. It includes input/output ports for clock, data, control signals, and employs internal registers and conditional logic within a generate block, accommodating operations for different data widths (32 or 128-bits). Functionality extends to handling read and write sequences with byte-enabling, signal delays for synchronization, and efficient data storage and retrieval through address decoding and data masking."
