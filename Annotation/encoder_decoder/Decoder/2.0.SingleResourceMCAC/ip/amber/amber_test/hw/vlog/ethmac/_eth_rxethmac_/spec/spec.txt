Module name: eth_rxethmac.
Module specification: The `eth_rxethmac` module is crafted for Ethernet frame reception in the MAC layer, specifically designed to handle synchronization, validity checks, filtering, and state management of incoming Ethernet frames based on the Media Receive Clock (MRxClk) input. The input ports of the module include MRxClk, MRxDV (indicating valid data on MRxD), MRxD (4-bit Ethernet frame data), and numerous configuration signals like Reset, Transmitting, MaxFL (Maximum Frame Length), and various control flags for frame processing such as r_IFG, HugEn, DlyCrcEn, MAC (Media Access Control address), and others. Outputs from the module encompass RxData (received data byte), RxValid (validity of received byte), ByteCnt (count of received bytes), and frame boundary signals like RxStartFrm and RxEndFrm, along with indicators for state conditions like CrcError and StateIdle. Internally, the module uses signals such as Broadcast and Multicast for addressing checks, CrcHash for CRC value computations, and various state flags like RxValid_d (delayed RxValid) and StateDrop to manage the data flow within state machine blocks. The code integrates various blocks including `eth_rxstatem` for state management, `eth_rxcounters` for counting operations and frame boundary detection, and `eth_rxaddrcheck` for address checking and filtering operations. Each block contributes to the systematic processing and validation of incoming Ethernet frames, coordinating detailed checks and operational transitions necessary for conformant Ethernet reception and handling within the hardware design.
