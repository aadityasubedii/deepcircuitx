Module name: a23_fetch.
Module specification: The a23_fetch module operates as a fetch unit in a system implementing caching capabilities and interacts with a Wishbone bus interface. It decides whether to fetch data from the cache or direct bus memory based on address cachability, cache status, and additional control flags. The input ports include `i_clk` (clock signal), `i_address` (memory address for reads), `i_address_valid` (validates the provided address), and various other controls like `i_write_data`, `i_priviledged`, `i_cache_enable`, and signals related to the Wishbone bus interactions such as `i_wb_dat` and `i_wb_ack`. The primary output ports are `o_read_data` (the fetched data), `o_fetch_stall` (fetch stall signal), and Wishbone-specific outputs like `o_wb_adr` and `o_wb_we`. Internal signals such as `cache_stall`, `wb_stall`, and `sel_cache` assist in managing the cache and bus operations logic, determining stalling and data source selection. The module consists of submodules: a23_cache and a23_wishbone, which handle the detailed cache operations and Wishbone bus interactions, respectively, driven by signals like `sel_cache` for cache interaction selection and `sel_wb` for bus interaction control.
