The iodrp_controller module manages interfacing with a Dynamically Reconfigurable Port (DRP), facilitating communication for read and write operations based on control signals and input data. It employs an FSM to handle the sequencing of operations across different phases, utilizing registers to store and shift data, and internal control signals to manage state transitions and data flow, ensuring synchronized operations under the control of the DRP_CLK.
