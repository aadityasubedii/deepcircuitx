Module name: wr_data_gen.   
Module specification: The `wr_data_gen` module is designed to generate write data for memory interfaces, tailored for use with different FPGA families such as SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6. It operates based on a set of input commands and configurations to manage memory write operations effectively. The **input ports** include the `clk_i` for clock synchronization, `rst_i` as a reset signal, `prbs_fseed_i` for initializing pseudo-random data sequences, and various command signals like `cmd_valid_i` identifying the validity of incoming commands. It also takes `fixed_data_i`, `addr_i`, and `bl_i` for fixed data values, target memory addresses, and burst lengths respectively. The **outputs** include `cmd_rdy_o`, showing command readiness, `last_word_o` indicating the last word in a burst, `data_valid_o` signaling valid data output, `data_o` for the actual data output, and `data_wr_end_o` to indicate the end of a data-write process. **Internal signals** such as `cmd_rdy`, `cmd_start`, and `user_burst_cnt` manage readiness and signaling for data processing and command execution, while `burst_count_reached2` and `u_bcount_2` are used to handle burst-related conditions. **The Verilog code** is structured into always blocks that handle state changes and data management based on the clock input and reset conditions, and conditional generate blocks that instantiate different data generation units (`sp6_data_gen` and `v6_data_gen`) based on the FPGA family specified, allowing for flexible and condition-specific data handling during memory operations.
