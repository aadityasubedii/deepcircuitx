    "module": "The `eth_txethmac` module handles Ethernet MAC layer transmission, managing frame sending, collision handling, CRC calculation, and retry processes. It uses input signals to control transmission states, employing internal logic for state transitions, error handling, and output management. Key components include state machines for transmission stages, counters for byte and nibble management, and submodules for CRC and random backoff calculations, ensuring robust and efficient frame handling in diverse network scenarios."
