It operates with a division value provided by the user through the `Divider` input. The module ensures that the Mdc signal frequency is half of the frequency determined by the `Divider` value by counting and toggling Mdc every time the counter reaches zero. The counting operation is managed by incrementing or resetting a counter based on the divided value and there are additional outputs, `MdcEn` and `MdcEn_n`, which indicate enable signals that are active at specific states of the Mdc output for synchronization purposes.\n"

It drives the timing of toggling operations and counter updates.\n- Reset: A reset signal used to initialize or reset the module's internal state, ensuring consistent operation from a known state after being triggered.\n- Divider: An 8-bit input used to set the frequency division factor for generating the Mdc clock signal. The value on this input determines how often the Mdc signal toggles relative to the Clk input.\n\nOutput ports: Mdc, MdcEn, MdcEn_n.\nExplanation:\n- Mdc: The output clock signal derived from the Clk input based on the division factor set by the Divider input. This signal is essentially a slower frequency clock derived by dividing the Clk.\n- MdcEn: An output signal that indicates an enable state specifically when the Mdc output is in one state (typically low). This signal can be used for synchronization purposes to ensure operations align with a specific phase of Mdc.\n- MdcEn_n: An output signal complement to MdcEn, indicating an enable state specifically when the Mdc output is in the opposite state (typically high). This also aids in synchronization tasks, providing a distinct phase indication from MdcEn."

It counts down from a preset value to zero, and the rate at which it counts is determined by the Divider value which indirectly sets the frequency of the Mdc output.\n- CounterPreset: A wire signal containing the value from which the Counter should start counting down. This value is calculated based on the Divider input, adjusted and then halved to determine the rate at which the Counter counts down to zero.\n- TempDivider: A wire that holds a modified version of the Divider input.
