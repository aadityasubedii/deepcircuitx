It allows configuration of input clock types (differential or single-ended) and leverages a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) advanced block to generate multiple output clocks with specified divides, phases, and duty cycles. It also includes buffers and conditional elements, ensuring clocks are stable and synchronized across the system. Additionally, the module includes features to handle asynchronous and synchronous resets based on the PLL lock status to ensure robust operation in FPGA applications. This setup is crucial in bigger systems where multiple clock domains and reliable reset de-assertion mechanisms are necessary for stable operation."

They support high-speed clock input applications with reduced noise and crosstalk.\n- `sys_clk`: This is the single-ended clock input used when C_INPUT_CLK_TYPE is set to \"SINGLE_ENDED\". It's an alternative to differential inputs, typically used when system simplicity and cost are more critical than performance.\n- `sys_rst_i`: This is the system reset input, which can be either active-high or active-low based on the C_RST_ACT_LOW parameter.

They are typically used for high-speed operations or interfaces requiring a phase-shifted clock.\n- `mcb_drp_clk`: This output is a specially conditioned clock used for Memory Controller Blocks (MCB) and Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) operations, facilitated by the corresponding clock enable (CE) from the PLL lock status.\n- `pll_ce_0`, `pll_ce_90`: These outputs are control signals specifically useful for managing Clock Enable (CE) operations in serial deserialization; `pll_ce_0` is aligned with `sysclk_2x` and `pll_ce_90` is aligned with `sysclk_2x_180`.\n- `pll_lock`: This output indicates the lock status of the PLL, effectively signaling whether the PLL has successfully synchronized the provided input clock to the output clocks.
