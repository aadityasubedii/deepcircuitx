    "module": "This module serves as a wrapper for a memory controller interface, providing a standardized interface for multiple AXI and custom ports to connect to a memory controller core. It implements support for up to six ports (p0-p5) for command, write, and read operations, as well as six AXI interfaces (s0-s5) for advanced memory access. The module manages various memory-related parameters, clock signals, and control signals, interfacing with an internal mcb_ui_top module that contains the actual memory controller logic. It handles memory interface signals, calibration, and port-specific operations, supporting different types of DRAM and offering flexible configuration options through numerous parameters."
