The 'iodrp_mcb_controller' manages DRAM read and write operations via a Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP), accommodating varying operational configurations and memory addressing. It robustly handles communications with DRP using a finite state machine (FSM) to navigate between states, orchestrating the timing and selection of data or address phases, controlled via input triggers like `cmd_valid` and `DRP_CLK`. Internal signal operations, state transitions, data multiplexing, and directed data flow ensure reactive and stable DRP interfacing, maintaining a responsive and adaptable memory control environment.
