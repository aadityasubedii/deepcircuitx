Module name: eth_crc. 

Module specification: The 'eth_crc' module is designed to calculate the Ethernet cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for network communication data packets, aiding in error detection. It operates based on a clock signal (Clk) and includes inputs for reset (Reset), data input (Data), enable (Enable), and initialize (Initialize). The module outputs a 32-bit CRC value (Crc) and an error indicator flag (CrcError). The Reset port resets the CRC to 0xFFFFFFFF, while the Initialize port re-initializes the CRC value similarly without affecting other system operations. The Data input takes a 4-bit value used to compute the CRC. If Enable is high, it allows the computation, incorporating incoming data bit transitions following a specific polynomial logic, defined in internal signal assignments. The module includes a 32-bit internal signal (CrcNext) which holds intermediate CRC values calculated via combinatorial logic involving XOR operations between data and certain CRC bits conditional on the Enable signal. During the rising edge of the clock, the module updates the Crc register with CrcNext or re-initializes it based on the control flags (Reset or Initialize). Lastly, a comparison is carried out between the computed CRC and a fixed good CRC value (0xC704DD7B), setting the CrcError high on mismatch to indicate packet corruption.
