The eth_macstatus module monitors and manages Ethernet frame transmissions and receptions, ensuring data integrity and handling errors like CRC or collisions. It processes input signals concerning frame status, size, and errors to generate status outputs, controlled by internal logic that utilizes state machines for different phases of frame processing such as preamble detection and data reception, and systematic signal condition checks for error handling and frame validation.
