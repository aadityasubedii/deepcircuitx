Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: The memc_wrapper module is a memory controller wrapper designed to interface with external DDR3 memory. It supports multiple ports (up to 6) for read and write operations, providing a flexible interface for memory access. The module includes numerous input ports for clock signals, reset, and control inputs, as well as output ports for memory interface signals and status indicators. Key inputs include system clocks (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), PLL signals (pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, pll_lock), and command/data signals for each port (p0_cmd_clk, p0_cmd_en, p0_wr_clk, p0_rd_clk, etc.). Outputs include memory interface signals (mcbx_dram_addr, mcbx_dram_ba,
