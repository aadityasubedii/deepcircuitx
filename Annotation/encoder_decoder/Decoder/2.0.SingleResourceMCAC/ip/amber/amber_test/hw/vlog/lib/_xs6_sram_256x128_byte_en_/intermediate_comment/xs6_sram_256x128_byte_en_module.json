    "module": "The xs6_sram_256x128_byte_en module simulates a 256 x 128-bit byte-addressable SRAM, allowing selective byte writing through individual enable signals for each byte. It employs four RAMB8BWER modules configured in simple dual-port mode, controlled by `i_write_enable` combined with `i_byte_enable` to facilitate independent byte control within the 128-bit words. This setup enables precise data storage and retrieval at designated memory addresses, adjusting to dynamic data handling requirements in synthesizable digital designs."
