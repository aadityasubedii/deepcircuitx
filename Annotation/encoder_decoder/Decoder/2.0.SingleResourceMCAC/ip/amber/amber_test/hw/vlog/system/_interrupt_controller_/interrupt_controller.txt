The `interrupt_controller` module manages IRQs and FIRQs for various peripherals using interrupt registers and masks, interfaced through a Wishbone compliant bus. It handles interrupt signals, selectively processes them based on enabled configurations, and aggregates interrupts into combined output lines. Internally, the module utilizes control registers for enabling/disabling interrupts, decodes and filters incoming signals, and supports read/write operations via the Wishbone bus, allowing software to configure and monitor interrupt statuses dynamically.
