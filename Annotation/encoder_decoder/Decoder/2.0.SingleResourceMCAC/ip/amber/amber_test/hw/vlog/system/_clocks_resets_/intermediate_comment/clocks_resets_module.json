    "module": "The `clocks_resets` module manages clock generation and system resets in FPGA-based systems, particularly for Xilinx Spartan6 and Virtex6 architectures. It takes differential board clock signals and a DDR calibration completion signal to produce system clocks and reset outputs. Implementation involves differential signal buffering, PLL configuration for clock generation, reset synchronization, and conditions checks for DDR calibration and PLL locking. This ensures the stability and reliability of clock and reset signals crucial for system performance."
