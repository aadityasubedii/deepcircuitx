The `eth_txcounters` module manages byte and nibble counting during Ethernet frame transmission, tracking state changes and conditions to ensure compliance with frame specifications. It utilizes input signals to track the transmission state and control counters, updating outputs like byte and nibble counts, and flags indicating special conditions such as excessive deferral or maximum frame length. Internally, the module uses logical conditions and state-driven assignments to increment or reset counters based on the current state of the frame transmission, ensuring accurate data handling and error management.
