    "module": "The a25_fetch module is responsible for fetching instructions from a cache or memory based on address validity and cachability. It interfaces with memory and handles stalls, utilizing inputs like instruction addresses and cachability to decide whether to fetch directly from memory or cache. Outputs indicate stall status and fetched instructions. Internally, signals manage data flow and control, coordinating with the a25_icache module to optimize instruction fetching based on system states and cache interactions."
