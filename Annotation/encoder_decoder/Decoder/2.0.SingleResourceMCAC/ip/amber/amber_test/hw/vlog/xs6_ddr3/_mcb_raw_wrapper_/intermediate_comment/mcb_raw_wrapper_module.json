    "module": "This module implements a Memory Controller Block (MCB) wrapper for interfacing user logic with various DDR memory types. It manages address, data, and command processing through multiple configurable ports, utilizing IODRP2 components for delay adjustments and OSERDES2 for data serialization. The wrapper supports different memory configurations, handles calibration, and provides flexible I/O operations. It incorporates clock management, reset control, and status reporting, while allowing for dynamic adjustments and supporting various memory-specific features like differential DQS and ODT."
