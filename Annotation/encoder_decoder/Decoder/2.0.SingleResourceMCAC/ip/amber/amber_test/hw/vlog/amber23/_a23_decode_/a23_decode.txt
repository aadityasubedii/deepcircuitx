This module decodes ARM instructions and generates control signals for an ARM processor. It implements a state machine to handle instruction execution, memory operations, and interrupts. The module processes various instruction types, manages register selections, controls ALU and barrel shifter operations, handles memory accesses, and manages processor status bits. It also supports coprocessor operations and handles different interrupt and exception conditions. The decoder uses combinational logic to determine instruction types and generate appropriate control signals, while sequential logic manages the execution state and handles multi-cycle operations.
