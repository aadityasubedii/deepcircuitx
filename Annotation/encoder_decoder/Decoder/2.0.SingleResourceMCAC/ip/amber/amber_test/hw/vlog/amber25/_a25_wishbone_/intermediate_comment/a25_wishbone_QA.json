It handles requests from these ports, directs acknowledgments, addresses, and data as necessary, and ensures correct data handling based on the state of the bus and the validity of requests. The handling includes dealing with requests and write operations, response with the required data, and managing bus signals like address, select line, and data lines depending on the incoming port request and the state of the Wishbone bus acknowledgment."

The output ports facilitate communication back to the clients detailing operation statuses, and also manage how the module interfaces with the Wishbone bus to relay data, address and control information, ensuring coherent bus transactions."
