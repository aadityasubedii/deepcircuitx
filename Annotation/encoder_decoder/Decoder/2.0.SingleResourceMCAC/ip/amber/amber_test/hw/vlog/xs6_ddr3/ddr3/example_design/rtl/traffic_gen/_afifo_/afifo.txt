The afifo module is an asynchronous FIFO buffer facilitating data transfer across different clock domains with read and write operations independently clocked. It utilizes parameterized data width, FIFO depth, and address size, handling internal state via Gray code counters to safely manage asynchronous read/write pointers, avoiding data corruption. Operations are structured around memory storage arrays and pointer synchronization, supported by status flag updates for buffer states like full, empty, and almost full.
