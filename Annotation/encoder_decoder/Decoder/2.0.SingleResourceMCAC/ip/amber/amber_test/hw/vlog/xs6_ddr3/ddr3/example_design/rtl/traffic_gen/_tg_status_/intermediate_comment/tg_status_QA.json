When a data discrepancy occurs (detected by a change in `data_error_i` without prior errors already captured), the module records various data such as the comparing address, block length, status flags of command, write, and read buffers, and the actual data versus expected data values. It provides an output flag `error` indicating the presence of an error, and a detailed `error_status` bus that encapsulates the error information including specific data values and system conditions at the time of the error. The operation of capturing errors can be reset either through an external reset signal or a manual clear command."

It is used to synchronize the operations in the module.\n- `rst_i`: Reset input. When asserted, it resets the error recording mechanism.\n- `manual_clear_error`: Manual error clear input. It allows externally initiated reset of the error status.\n- `data_error_i`: Data error input. It indicates if there is an error in the data.\n- `cmp_data_i`: Compare data input. This is the expected data to be compared against received data.\n- `rd_data_i`: Read data input. This is the actual data received.\n- `cmp_addr_i`: Compare address input. The memory address related to the current data being compared.\n- `cmp_bl_i`: Compare block length input. The block length of the data being processed.\n- `mcb_cmd_full_i`: Memory command buffer full flag. Indicates if the command buffer is full.\n- `mcb_wr_full_i`: Memory write buffer full flag. Shows if the write buffer is full.\n- `mcb_rd_empty_i`: Memory read buffer empty flag. Shows if the read buffer is empty.\n\nExplanation: \nThese inputs receive various data and control signals necessary for monitoring the integrity and status of data. They are essential for detecting discrepancies, knowing where the discrepancies occurred, understanding the conditions of memory buffers, and deciding when an error needs to be flagged or reset.\n\nOutput ports: \n- `error_status`: Wide output bus containing detailed error information.\n- `error`: Error output flag. Indicates whether an error has been detected and recorded.\n\nExplanation: \n- `error_status` delivers a comprehensive view of the error conditions, including the exact address, data discrepancies, and buffer status when the error was captured. This is used for diagnostics and debugging purposes.\n- `error` is a simple binary flag that signals the occurrence of an error, useful for triggering further error handling mechanisms in a larger system."
