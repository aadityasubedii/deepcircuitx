Module name: a23_barrel_shift_fpga. 
Module specification: The a23_barrel_shift_fpga module executes bit-shifting operations including logical shift left (LSL), logical shift right (LSR), arithmetic shift right (ASR), and rotate right (ROR) on a 32-bit input signal. This module inputs comprise a 32-bit data input `i_in`, a carry bit `i_carry_in`, an 8-bit shift amount `i_shift_amount`, a boolean `i_shift_imm_zero` signifying if the shift amount is zero, and a 2-bit function code `i_function` dictating the operation type. Outputs consist of a 32-bit shifted/rotated result `o_out` and a carry output `o_carry_out`. Internal signals like `rot_prod`, `lsl_out`, `lsr_out`, `asr_out`, `ror_out`, various masks (`lsl_mask`, `lsr_mask`, `low_mask`), selectors (`lsl_selector`, `lsr_selector`, `low_selector`), and flags (`shift_nzero`, `shift_over`, `shift_32`, `asr_sign`, `direction`) manage intermediate values, carry conditions, and masking functions. The operations utilize combinatorial logic blocks for shift determination, carry propagation, and output assignment based on the function code, alongside bit manipulation functions like `wrap` and `bit_swap` for addressing and reordering bits, respectively. The module extensively uses conditional and procedural blocks to efficiently handle different types and cases of shifts and rotations, optimized for use in FPGA implementations.
