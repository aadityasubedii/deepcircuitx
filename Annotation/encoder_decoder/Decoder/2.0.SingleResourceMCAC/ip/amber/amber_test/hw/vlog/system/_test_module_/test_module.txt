The `test_module` serves as an interface to the Wishbone bus for handling interrupts, memory control, and data transmission in a test or utility hardware setting. It manages input and output operations through various registers and control signals, responding to bus commands under different configurations driven by internal state machines and synchronized to system clocks. The module supports dynamic interrupt generation, register-based state control, and byte-selective data handling, integrating UART for external communication and providing outputs like LEDs and reset signals for direct system interactions.
