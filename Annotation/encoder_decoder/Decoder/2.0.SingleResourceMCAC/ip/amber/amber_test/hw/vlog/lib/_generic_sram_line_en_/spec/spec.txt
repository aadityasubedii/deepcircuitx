Module name: generic_sram_line_en. Module specification: The `generic_sram_line_en` module is a Verilog implementation of a simple Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) with line enabling features, designed to handle data and address operations with parameters for data width, address width, and memory initialization. The major input ports include `reset` (for asynchronous reset operations), `clk` (clock input), `test_mode` and `scan_enable` (inputs typically for test modes), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (serial inputs for test data), `i_write_data` (data input for memory write operations), `i_write_enable` (control signal for enabling writes), and `i_address` (memory address input for data access). The output ports comprise `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` (serial outputs for test data) and `o_read_data` (output for data read from memory). Internally, the module utilizes a memory array `mem` which simulates the storage capacity of the SRAM, and an integer `i` used for indexing during memory initialization. The module operates in two main states: initialized state where the contents can be set to either all zeros or all ones depending on the `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO` parameter during reset; and normal operation where the memory reads or writes data based on `i_write_enable`. Data write occurs at the rising edge of `clk`, and only when `i_write_enable` is asserted, otherwise, data at `i_address` is read and held at `o_read_data`. Additionally, various storage and test control operations are managed at the positive edge of the clock or the positive edge of the reset. This specification encapsulates the purpose, operation, and structural design of the memory module.
