It handles different phases of the operation through a finite state machine (FSM), including deciding whether to read or write, sending addresses, managing data transfers, and handling different gaps between address and data phases. The module uses a clock signal (DRP_CLK) to synchronize its operations and uses several internal registers to store and manipulate data and addresses. Signals like 'rd_not_write' determine the mode of operation (read or write), and 'cmd_valid' acts as an initiation signal for processing. The FSM transitions through various states to complete the read or write operations, including phases like address setup, data transfer, and returning to a ready state upon completion."
