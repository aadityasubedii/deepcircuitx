Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: The memc_wrapper module is a configurable memory controller interface wrapper designed for external memory operations, supporting up to 6 ports (p0 to p5) and multiple AXI interfaces (s0 to s5). It handles various memory types (e.g., DDR/DDR2/DDR3) with flexible timing parameters and configurations. The module's input ports include clock signals (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), reset (async_rst), and command/data inputs for each port. Output ports provide memory interface signals, status indicators, and data outputs. Internal signals manage AXI transactions, user interface operations, and PLL-related functions. The code is structured into sections for parameter declarations, port definitions, internal signal declarations, and the instantiation of the mcb_ui_top submodule. This submodule implements the
