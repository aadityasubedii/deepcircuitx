Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: This module is a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) that interfaces with various types of DDR memory (DDR, DDR2, DDR3, LPDDR). It handles the low-level interactions between the MCB and the physical memory, including address and data management, command issuing, and I/O operations. The module supports different port configurations, data widths, and memory types. Key input ports include clock signals (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), command inputs (p0_cmd_clk, p0_cmd_en, p0_cmd_instr, p0_cmd_bl, p0_cmd_byte_addr), and data inputs (p0_wr_clk, p0_wr_en, p0_wr_mask, p0_wr_
