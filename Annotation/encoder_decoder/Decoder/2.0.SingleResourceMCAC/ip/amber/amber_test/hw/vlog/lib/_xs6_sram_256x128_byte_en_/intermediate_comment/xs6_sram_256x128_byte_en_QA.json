It uses four RAMB8BWER instances in a simple dual-port (SDP) configuration. The SRAM allows selective byte write operations controlled by `i_byte_enable` and `i_write_enable`. The module reads from and writes to the SRAM based on the provided address (`i_address`). The data read from the SRAM is output on `o_read_data`."

It is 128 bits wide, matching the data width of the SRAM.\n- `i_write_enable`: This signal enables the write operation. When set to 1, data can be written to the location specified by `i_address`; when 0, the module performs a read operation.\n- `i_address`: This is the address input, which specifies the location in the memory (SRAM) where data should be read from or written to. It supports 256 possible locations (8 bits).\n- `i_byte_enable`: This 16-bit input allows individual bytes within the 128-bit word to be selectively written. Each bit corresponds to one byte of the `i_write_data`.\n\n**Output ports:** `o_read_data`\n**Explanation:**\n- `o_read_data`: This output port provides the data read from the memory. It outputs the 128-bit data stored at the memory location specified by `i_address`."

The construction `{DATA_WIDTH/8{i_write_enable}} & i_byte_enable` expands the `i_write_enable` for each byte per the `DATA_WIDTH` and performs a bitwise AND with the `i_byte_enable`.
