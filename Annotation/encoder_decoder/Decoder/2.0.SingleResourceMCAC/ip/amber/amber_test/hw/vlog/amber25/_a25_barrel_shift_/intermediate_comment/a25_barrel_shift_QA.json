It supports optional functionalities like immediate zero shift (`i_shift_imm_zero`) and can operate under different functions specified by `i_function`. The shifter is designed to handle different conditions by employing two sub-modules (`u_a25_shifter_full` for full barrel shifter and `u_a25_shifter_quick` for a quick shifter variant) based on the efficiency needs. The logic controls which output (`full_out` or `quick_out`) to use through the control signal `use_quick_r`. Signal `o_stall` indicates an operational stall based on the shift amount and operational mode. The reset logic initializes internal registers and determines the mode of operation (i.e., quick or full mode). The outputs of the module are `o_out` for the shifted result and `o_carry_out` for the carry bit result."

It is used to pass the result to the primary output `o_out` when the quick shifting mode is considered applicable.\n- `quick_carry_out`: This is a single-bit internal wire signal that holds the carry output from the quick shifter (`u_a25_shifter_quick`). Similarly to `quick_out`, this signal feeds the primary carry out `o_carry_out` under certain conditions dictated by the operational mode.\n- `full_out`: This is a 32-bit internal wire signal from the full barrel shifter instance (`u_a25_shifter_full`). It provides the shifted result when a more comprehensive shifting operation is required.\n- `full_carry_out`: A single-bit internal wire signal from the full barrel shifter. This carries the output which might be involved in subsequent chained operations or affects flags in a processor environment.\n- `full_out_r`: A 32-bit internal register that stores the output result from `full_out` to maintain state between clock cycles, contributing to controlled data flow and synchronization.\n- `full_carry_out_r`: A single-bit internal register that holds the value of `full_carry_out`. This registered value is used to consistently drive the output `o_carry_out` under non-quick shift conditions.\n- `use_quick_r`: A register indicating whether the quick shifting operation should be used (`1'b1`) or not (`1'b0`). This decision affects the selection of outputs (`quick_out`/`quick_carry_out` vs. `full_out_r`/`full_carry_out_r`) and the stall condition (`o_stall`), essentially serving as a mode control based on the internal and external conditions."
