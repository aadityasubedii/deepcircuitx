The wb_ddr3_bridge module serves as an interface between a Wishbone bus and DDR3 memory, managing data transactions and command translation. It employs input and output signals to synchronize communication, with internal logic handling command generation, data alignment, and flow control based on the availability of DDR3 buffers. Detailed handling for Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGAs is included, ensuring data integrity and correct operation through adapted control signals and data paths.
