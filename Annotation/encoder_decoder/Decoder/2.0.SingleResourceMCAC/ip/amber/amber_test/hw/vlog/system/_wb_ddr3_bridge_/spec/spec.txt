Module name: wb_ddr3_bridge. Module specification: The wb_ddr3_bridge is a Verilog module designed to act as an interface between a Wishbone bus and a DDR3 memory. It handles the translation of Wishbone protocol read and write transactions into appropriate DDR3 memory commands. The input ports include `i_clk` (clock signal), `i_wb_adr` (Wishbone address), `i_wb_sel` (select lines for byte lanes), `i_wb_we` (write enable), `i_wb_dat` (input data for write operations), `i_wb_cyc` (signal indicating an active cycle), `i_wb_stb` (transaction strobe signal), `i_cmd_full` (indicating DDR3 command buffer fullness), `i_wr_full` (DDR3 write buffer status), and `i_rd_data` (data read from DDR3). The output ports include `o_wb_dat` (data output to Wishbone bus), `o_wb_ack` (transaction acknowledge), `o_wb_err` (error signal), `o_cmd_en` (indicates a command is ready for DDR3), `o_cmd_instr` (DDR3 command type), `o_cmd_byte_addr` (DDR3 byte address), `o_wr_en` (write enable for DDR3), `o_wr_mask` (byte lane mask for data writes), and `o_wr_data` (formatted data for DDR3 memory). Internal signals such as `start_write`, `start_read`, and their delayed versions manage the initiation and timing of read/write operations, while `ddr3_busy` indicates the availability of the DDR3 interface for new operations. The code is divided into blocks handling signal manipulation and delays (for ensuring data and operation alignment with clock cycles), DDR3 command setup, write data masking (including special conditions for specific FPGA types like XILINX_VIRTEX6_FPGA), data read management, and a debugging block (`LP_MEMIF_DEBUG`) for tracing memory operations under specific conditions. These blocks work together to synchronize and facilitate efficient data handling between the Wishbone protocol and DDR3 memory operations, ensuring data integrity and operational correctness.
