    "module": "This module implements Ethernet control and status registers for an Ethernet MAC, managing configuration settings and generating interrupts. It uses a bank of registers to store various parameters, handles read/write operations from an external bus, synchronizes signals across different clock domains (Tx, Rx, and system), and generates interrupt signals based on Ethernet events. The module includes logic for register selection, data storage, interrupt handling, and clock domain crossing synchronization, supporting features such as flow control, MAC address configuration, and MII management."
