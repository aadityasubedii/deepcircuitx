The eth_txstatem module manages the state transitions essential for Ethernet packet transmission, handling processes from initializing transmission to collision management and back-off strategies. It reads signals such as TxStartFrm, TxEndFrm, and Collision, and based on these, controls state-specific outputs like StateIdle, StatePreamble through a combination of combinatorial and sequential logic blocks. Internal decision-making is facilitated by signals like StartIdle and Rule1, determining transitions based on network conditions and protocol requirements.
