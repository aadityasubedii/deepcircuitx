This module simulates a DDR3 memory controller testbench. It instantiates a DDR3 memory model and controller, generates clock and reset signals, and sets up various interface signals. The testbench runs a simulation to verify the memory controller's functionality, including calibration and data transfer operations. It monitors error signals and calibration completion, reporting whether the test passed or failed. The module uses internal signals for clock, reset, memory interface, and control operations, without explicit input/output ports.
