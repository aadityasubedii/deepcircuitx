The `eth_cop` module manages data transactions between two masters and two slaves in a system using the WISHBONE bus standard. It synchronizes master requests to slave devices, ensures orderly data passages, and handles error assessments using internal states like transaction progress flags. The module routes specific WISHBONE signals such as address, data, and control signals between masters and slaves while monitoring transaction completions and errors to maintain data integrity and system stability.
