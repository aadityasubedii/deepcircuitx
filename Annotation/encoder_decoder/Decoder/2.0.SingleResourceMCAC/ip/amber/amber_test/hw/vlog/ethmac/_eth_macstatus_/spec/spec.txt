Module name: eth_macstatus.

Module specification: The "eth_macstatus" module is responsible for monitoring and managing the status of Ethernet frames during transmission and reception processes. It utilizes input signals like MRxClk (Receive clock), Reset (synchronous reset), RxCrcError (CRC error in received packet), among others, to modulate output signals including ReceivedLengthOK (packet length correctness), ReceiveEnd (end of packet reception), and ReceivedPacketGood (error-free packet reception). Key internal signals such as LatchedCrcError (stores CRC error status) and InvalidSymbol (detects invalid symbols during reception) play crucial roles in the operational integrity by managing errors and ensuring data correctness. The module is divided into various blocks handling specific tasks such as error detection, packet size validation, and collision handling. Through control logic structured around state machines and signal conditions (e.g., RxStateSFD for Start Frame Delimiter detection), the module efficiently handles Ethernet frame integrity, ensuring detailed error checking and managing the state control essential for network communication integrity.
