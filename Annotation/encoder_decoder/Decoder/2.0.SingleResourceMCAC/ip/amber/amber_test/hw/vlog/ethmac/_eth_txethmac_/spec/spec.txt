Module name: eth_txethmac.
Module specification: The `eth_txethmac` module is designed for handling the transmission functionalities of an Ethernet MAC layer. It manages key aspects such as frame transmission, collision detection, retry handling, CRC generation, and frame padding. The inputs include the Ethernet transmit clock (MTxClk), reset signal (Reset), frame start and end signals (TxStartFrm, TxEndFrm), underrun error indicator (TxUnderRun), data bus (TxData), carrier sense (CarrierSense), collision detection (Collision), padding (Pad), CRC enable (CrcEn), and various configuration signals such as full duplex mode (FullD), huge frame enable (HugEn), CRC delay enable (DlyCrcEn), minimum and maximum frame lengths (MinFL, MaxFL), inter-packet gap timings (IPGT, IPGR1, IPGR2), collision valid window (CollValid), maximum retry limit (MaxRet), backoff control (NoBckof), and excessive deferral enable (ExDfrEn). The outputs include the data bus (MTxD), transmission enable (MTxEn), error indicator (MTxErr), transmission completion signals (TxDone, TxRetry, TxAbort), data usage signal (TxUsedData), transmitter activity indicator (WillTransmit), collision reset signal (ResetCollision), retry count (RetryCnt), and other status and control signals (StartTxDone, StartTxAbort, MaxCollisionOccured, LateCollision, DeferIndication, StatePreamble, StateData).

Internally, the module uses signals like ColWindow for collision window status, StopExcessiveDeferOccured to monitor excessive deferral, and various state signals like StateDefer, StateIPG, StateIdle, StatePAD, StateFCS, among others to manage different states of the frame transmission process. Additionally, the counters and data handlers like NibCnt, ByteCnt handle the bytes and nibbles count, while signals like Crc manage the CRC values.

The Verilog code encapsulates various control structures and sequential logic blocks to define the operational states and transitions. Critical blocks include counter management for tracking states and nibble counts, control logic for initializing, managing collisions, retries, CRC calculation setup, and data path control using multiplexing and conditional assignments. It encompasses initialization routines and status update blocks triggered by clock edges or reset conditions to ensure reliable and sequential operation during the Ethernet frame transmission process. Submodules like `eth_txcounters`, `eth_txstatem`, `eth_crc`, and `eth_random` are instantiated for specific tasks related to counting metrics, state management, CRC computation, and random backoff calculations respectively. Each block collaborates to ensure that the module adheres to Ethernet standards and efficiently manages transmission over the network under various conditions determined by the input signals.
