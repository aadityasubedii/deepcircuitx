The `eth_clockgen` module generates a slower clock signal (Mdc) by dividing an input clock signal (Clk) based on the value of the `Divider` input. It utilizes an internal decrementing counter, initialized and preset based on `Divider`, to toggle Mdc at desired intervals. The module also provides synchronization signals, `MdcEn` and `MdcEn_n`, active during specific phases of Mdc, ensuring robust and synchronized output generation.
