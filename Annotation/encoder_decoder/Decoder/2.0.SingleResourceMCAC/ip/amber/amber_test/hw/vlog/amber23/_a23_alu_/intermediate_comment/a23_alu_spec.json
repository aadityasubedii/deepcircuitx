    "spec": "Module name: a23_alu.  \nModule specification: The `a23_alu` module is a Verilog-based Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) responsible for performing a variety of arithmetic and logical operations determined by the configuration of its inputs. It takes two 32-bit operands (`i_a_in`, `i_b_in`), a carry input from a barrel shifter (`i_barrel_shift_carry`), and a carry input from status bits (`i_status_bits_carry`), with a 9-bit `i_function` to select the specific operation. The outputs consist of a 32-bit result (`o_out`) and a 4-bit status flag (`o_flags`) to indicate negative, zero, carry, and overflow conditions. Internally, the module utilizes several signals like `a`, `b`, `b_not`, and various operation-specific outputs (`and_out`, `or_out`, `xor_out`, `fadder_out`, etc.). Control signals like `swap_sel` and `not_sel` manage operand selection and bitwise negation, while adder output and flag configurations are dynamically adjusted based on `i_function`. The module features conditional compilation for Xilinx FPGA optimizations and supports basic arithmetic, bitwise operations, sign and zero extension outputs. Ultimately, it manages the computation by determining the source and operation details dynamically, channeling them into the adder and control logic before final output determination. This design aims for configurability and broad operational functionality within digital logic environments.",

                    "text": "Module name: a23_alu.  \nModule specification: The `a23_alu` module is a Verilog-based Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) responsible for performing a variety of arithmetic and logical operations determined by the configuration of its inputs. It takes two 32-bit operands (`i_a_in`, `i_b_in`), a carry input from a barrel shifter (`i_barrel_shift_carry`), and a carry input from status bits (`i_status_bits_carry`), with a 9-bit `i_function` to select the specific operation. The outputs consist of a 32-bit result (`o_out`) and a 4-bit status flag (`o_flags`) to indicate negative, zero, carry, and overflow conditions. Internally, the module utilizes several signals like `a`, `b`, `b_not`, and various operation-specific outputs (`and_out`, `or_out`, `xor_out`, `fadder_out`, etc.). Control signals like `swap_sel` and `not_sel` manage operand selection and bitwise negation, while adder output and flag configurations are dynamically adjusted based on `i_function`. The module features conditional compilation for Xilinx FPGA optimizations and supports basic arithmetic, bitwise operations, sign and zero extension outputs. Ultimately, it manages the computation by determining the source and operation details dynamically, channeling them into the adder and control logic before final output determination. This design aims for configurability and broad operational functionality within digital logic environments."
