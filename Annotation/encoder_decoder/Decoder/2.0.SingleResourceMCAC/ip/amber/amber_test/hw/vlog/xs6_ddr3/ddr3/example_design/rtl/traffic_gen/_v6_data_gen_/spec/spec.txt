Module name: v6_data_gen. Module specification: This module is a data generator for memory interface testing, capable of producing various data patterns including PRBS, address-based, walking 1's/0's, neighbor, and fixed data patterns. It supports different data widths and burst lengths, and can generate data for various numbers of DQ pins. The module takes inputs such as clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), PRBS seed (prbs_fseed_i), data mode selection (data_mode_i), command start signals (cmd_startA/B/C/D/E), memory address (m_addr_i), fixed data input (fixed_data_i), and burst count (user_burst_cnt). The primary output is the generated data (data_o). Internally, the module uses signals like prbs_data, acounts, adata, hdata, ndata
