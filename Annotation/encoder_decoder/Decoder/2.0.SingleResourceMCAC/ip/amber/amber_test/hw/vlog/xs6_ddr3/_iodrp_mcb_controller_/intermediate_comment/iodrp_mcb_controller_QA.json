The module handles read and write operations directed to specific memory cells, differentiated by address. It operates based on a provided clock signal and responds to various inputs such as memory cell addresses, command validity, and a read or write directive. Operations are sequenced through a finite state machine which decides and executes steps like addressing, data transfer, and synchronization phases, while also providing output signals that indicate the system's readiness or busy state and manage the communication and control signaling to the DRP."
