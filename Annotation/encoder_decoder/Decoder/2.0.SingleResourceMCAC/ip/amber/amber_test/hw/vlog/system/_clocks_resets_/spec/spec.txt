Module name: clocks_resets. 
Module specification: The `clocks_resets` module, specifically designed for Xilinx FPGAs like Spartan6 and Virtex6, manages clock and reset functionalities within a digital system. It utilizes input ports `i_brd_rst` (system reset), `i_brd_clk_n` and `i_brd_clk_p` (differential board clock signals), and `i_ddr_calib_done` (DDR calibration completion signal) to produce output ports `o_sys_rst` (system reset output), `o_sys_clk` (system clock), and `o_clk_200` (200 MHz clock). Internally, the module employs signals such as `calib_done_33mhz` (synchronized DDR calibration completion), and `rst0` (internal combined reset signal), among others, to ensure accurate clock and reset operations. The configuration includes differential input buffering, PLL setup for clock generation derived from the board clock, synchronization of reset signals, and monitoring of DDR calibration and PLL lock status. Conditionally compiled sections target either Spartan6 or Virtex6, where components like `IBUFGDS`, `PLL_ADV` or `MMCM_ADV` are instantiated for FPGA-specific functionality. In non-Xilinx scenarios, behavioral simulation models handle clock operations including period measurements and fractional division of the clock. This adaptive and comprehensive handling of clocks and resets ensures reliable system performance in FPGA-based designs.
