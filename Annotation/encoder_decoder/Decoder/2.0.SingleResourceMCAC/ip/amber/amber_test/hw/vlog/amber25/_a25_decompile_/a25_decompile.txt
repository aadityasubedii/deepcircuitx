This module decompiles ARM-like processor instructions into human-readable format for debugging purposes. It decodes various instruction types, formats them with arguments, and writes the disassembled instructions to a file. The module processes input signals including clock, reset, and instruction data, tracking execution, handling interrupts, and reporting on jumps and memory accesses. It uses internal signals to decode instructions and generate formatted output, without explicit output ports. The implementation includes blocks for instruction decoding, execution tracking, interrupt handling, and output formatting, providing a detailed trace of the processor's execution flow.
