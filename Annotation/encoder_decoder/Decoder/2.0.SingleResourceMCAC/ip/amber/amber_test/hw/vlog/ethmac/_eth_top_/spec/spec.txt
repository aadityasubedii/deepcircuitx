Module name: eth_top. Module specification: The eth_top module is the top-level module for an Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) implementation. It integrates various sub-modules to handle Ethernet communication, including transmit and receive operations, MIIM (Management Interface) control, register management, and Wishbone bus interface. The module supports features such as flow control, address filtering, and collision detection. It has input ports for clocks, resets, Wishbone bus inputs, MII receive signals, and management interface inputs, while output ports include Wishbone bus outputs, MII transmit signals, management interface outputs, and an interrupt signal. Internal signals are used for controlling MIIM operations, transmit process, and status reporting. The module consists of several key blocks: eth_miim for MIIM management, eth_registers for configuration registers, eth_maccontrol for MAC control operations, eth_txethmac
