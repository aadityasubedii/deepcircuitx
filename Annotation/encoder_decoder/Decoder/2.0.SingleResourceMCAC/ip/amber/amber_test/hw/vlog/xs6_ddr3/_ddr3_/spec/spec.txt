Module name: ddr3. Module specification: The ddr3 module is a DDR3 memory controller interface that manages communication with DDR3 SDRAM. It instantiates infrastructure and memory controller wrapper components, defining parameters for memory timing, configuration, and port settings. The module provides multiple command, write, and read ports (p0 to p5) for interfacing with the DDR3 memory. Key input ports include mcb3_dram_dq (bidirectional data bus), c3_sys_clk (system clock), and c3_sys_rst_i (system reset), along with various command, write, and read signals for each port. Output ports include mcb3_dram_a (address bus), mcb3_dram_ba (bank address), and control signals like mcb3_dram_ras_n, mcb3_dram_cas_
