This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM memory device, modeling read/write operations, command decoding, and timing checks. It implements bank management, various operating modes, and DDR3 timing specifications using input/output ports for clock, control signals, address, and data. The module uses internal signals to track timing parameters, pipeline registers, and device states. It performs initialization, command execution, data handling, and extensive timing checks to verify proper DDR3 memory controller design and operation.
