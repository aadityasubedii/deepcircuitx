This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), including input termination, DQS delay, and dynamic calibration. It utilizes a state machine to control the calibration sequence, interfacing with IODRP controllers for RZQ and ZIO pins. The module calculates and adjusts termination values, sets initial DQS delays, and continuously monitors and adjusts DQS timing during operation. It handles self-refresh requests and implements temperature and voltage variation compensation. The calibration process is divided into initialization, input termination, and dynamic calibration phases, with separate routines for LDQS and UDQS signals.
