Module name: sim_tb_top. Module specification: This module is a testbench for a DDR3 memory controller simulation. It sets up parameters for the memory interface, instantiates a DDR3 memory model and a memory controller design. The module has no explicit input or output ports, as it generates all necessary signals internally. Key internal signals include c3_sys_clk (system clock), c3_sys_rst_i (reset signal), mcb3_dram_* (interface signals between controller and memory), c3_p0_cmd_*, c3_p0_wr_*, c3_p0_rd_* (command, write, and read interface signals), error and calib_done (for error reporting and calibration status). The testbench is structured with clock generation, reset logic, instantiation of the DDR3 controller (ddr3 module), memory model (
