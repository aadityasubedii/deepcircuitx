Module name: a23_decompile. Module specification: The a23_decompile module is a decompiler for an ARM-like processor, designed to decode and log executed instructions. It takes various input signals including clock (i_clk), instruction-related inputs (i_instruction, i_instruction_valid, i_instruction_undefined, i_instruction_execute), interrupt signals (i_interrupt, i_interrupt_state), and program counter control signals (i_pc_sel, i_pc_wen). The module doesn't have explicit output ports but writes decompiled instructions to a file specified by A23_DECOMPILE_FILE. Internally, it uses numerous signals for instruction decoding, such as imm32, reg_n, opcode, and condition. The module is structured into several blocks: instruction decoding, execution tracking, interrupt handling, and file writing. It decodes instructions, determines their type
