    "module": "The a23_ram_register_bank module manages register operations within ARM-based systems, facilitating read and write functionalities depending on execution modes signaled by control inputs. It utilizes various execution modes (`mode_exec`, `mode_idec`, `mode_rds`) and dedicated register banks (`reg_ram_n`, `reg_ram_m`, `reg_ram_ds`) to dynamically select and manipulate register addresses and outputs. Special handling of the R15 register and usage of status flags integrate seamlessly, allowing for tailored control and data flow throughout the microprocessor's operational contexts."
