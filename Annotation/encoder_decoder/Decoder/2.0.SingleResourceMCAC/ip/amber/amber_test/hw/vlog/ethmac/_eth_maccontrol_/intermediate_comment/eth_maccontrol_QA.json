This includes controlling and managing the transmission and reception of Ethernet frames. The module processes incoming and outgoing data, manages the flow control by monitoring pause frames, and performs error checking with CRC functionalities. It interfaces with both transmit and receive control sub-modules to ensure correct data handling and frame management in accordance with Ethernet standards. The module uses multiple inputs and outputs to achieve synchronization, error handling, frame padding and other MAC layer functions essential for Ethernet communication."

It is essential in managing signal outputs regarding the completed transmission state.\n- **MuxedAbort**: Similar to `MuxedDone`, this manages the abort condition of transmission to ensure correct signaling in `TxAbortOut`.\n- **Pause**: Represents whether a pause condition is active, which comes from control frames dictating flow control in the Ethernet protocol.\n- **TxCtrlStartFrm**: Indicates the start of a control frame being transmitted. This helps in managing the framing of control packets distinct from normal data frames.\n- **ControlData**: Holds the data pertinent to control frames. It is used when control frames are being constructed and transmitted.\n- **CtrlMux**: A multiplexer control signal that decides whether normal data or control data is being routed to the output.\n- **SendingCtrlFrm**: Signal indicating whether a control frame is currently being sent.
