    "spec": "Module name: xs6_addsub_n. Module specification: The `xs6_addsub_n` module is a Verilog design that performs either addition or subtraction on two input operands, `i_a` and `i_b`, based on the control signal `i_sub`. When `i_sub` is high, the module subtracts `i_b` from `i_a`; when low, it adds `i_a` to `i_b`. The module adheres to operand widths specified by the `WIDTH` parameter. It outputs the result of the operation through `o_sum` and a carry-over or borrow through `o_co`. The inputs include: `i_a` and `i_b`, which are operand inputs, `i_cin`, a carry-in input affecting the result, and `i_sub`, a control signal determining the operation mode. Outputs are `o_sum`, the result of the arithmetic operation, and `o_co`, the carry-out or borrow indicator. Internal signals such as `opmode` configure the operational mode of the DSP block, and `in_a`, `in_b` adjust operand widths to fit the DSP block's requirements. `out` captures the arithmetic results from the DSP block. The module incorporates a DSP48A1 block (named `u_dsp48`), configured for basic arithmetic operations with parameters set for various register usage and reset behaviors, focusing on performance and simplicity in arithmetic processing.",

The operation (addition or subtraction) is determined by the `i_sub` input signal. If `i_sub` is high, subtraction is performed; otherwise, addition is executed. Additionally, there is a carry input `i_cin` which is considered in the arithmetic operations. The results of the operation, the sum (or difference) and the carry output, are provided through `o_sum` and `o_co`, respectively.

When `i_sub` is high, the module subtracts `i_b` from `i_a`; when low, it adds `i_a` to `i_b`. The module adheres to operand widths specified by the `WIDTH` parameter. It outputs the result of the operation through `o_sum` and a carry-over or borrow through `o_co`. The inputs include: `i_a` and `i_b`, which are operand inputs, `i_cin`, a carry-in input affecting the result, and `i_sub`, a control signal determining the operation mode. Outputs are `o_sum`, the result of the arithmetic operation, and `o_co`, the carry-out or borrow indicator. Internal signals such as `opmode` configure the operational mode of the DSP block, and `in_a`, `in_b` adjust operand widths to fit the DSP block's requirements. `out` captures the arithmetic results from the DSP block. The module incorporates a DSP48A1 block (named `u_dsp48`), configured for basic arithmetic operations with parameters set for various register usage and reset behaviors, focusing on performance and simplicity in arithmetic processing."
