    "module": "The 'eth_outputcontrol' module manages Ethernet data output, controlling the transmission signals Mdo and MdoEn based on transmission status and mode. It incorporates input signals to manipulate output timing through a series of register delays (MdoEn_2d, Mdo_d, etc.) and logical conditions, ensuring adherence to Ethernet protocols synchronized to a clock signal."
