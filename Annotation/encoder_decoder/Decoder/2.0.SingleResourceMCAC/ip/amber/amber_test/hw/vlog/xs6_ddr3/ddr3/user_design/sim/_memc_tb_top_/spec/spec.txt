Module name: memc_tb_top. Module specification: This module serves as a testbench top-level for a memory controller, supporting up to 6 ports with configurable modes (read or write). It instantiates and connects multiple traffic generators (TGs) for different ports, manages port configurations, and handles command and data signals for read and write operations. The module features input ports for clock, reset, calibration status, VIO control signals, and various status signals from the memory controller for each port. Output ports include command and data signals to control the memory controller, as well as comparison data, error flags, and error status for each port. Internal signals are used to control and monitor the traffic generators for each port, including run traffic, address ranges, seeds, and mode settings. The module is structured with generate blocks for each port, instantiating init_mem_pattern_ctr and mcb_traffic_gen sub-modules to handle
