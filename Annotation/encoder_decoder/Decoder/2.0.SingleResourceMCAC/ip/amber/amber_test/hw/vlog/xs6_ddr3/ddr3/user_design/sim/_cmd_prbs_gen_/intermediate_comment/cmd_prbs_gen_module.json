    "module": "The cmd_prbs_gen module generates pseudorandom binary sequences using an LFSR method, suited for tasks like memory testing and simulation in hardware design. It operates on configurable parameters for sequence width and generation types, including 'ADDRESS', 'INSTR', or 'BLEN'. The module manages LFSR initialization, bit shifting, and conditional masking based on input signals and parameters, with different operational blocks for thorough sequence control based on the clock input."
