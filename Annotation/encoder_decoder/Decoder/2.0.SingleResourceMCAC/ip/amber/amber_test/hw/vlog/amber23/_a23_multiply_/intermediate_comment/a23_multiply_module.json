    "module": "The `a23_multiply` module performs serial multiplication of two 32-bit inputs with an optional accumulation feature, controlled by input flags. It operates across multiple clock cycles moderated by a counter, incrementally computing and optionally accumulating results in a register. Different FPGA-specific code blocks enable optimal arithmetic operations on distinct hardware platforms, efficiently delegating tasks like addition and subtraction to facilitate the multiplication process."
