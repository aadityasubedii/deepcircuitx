It utilizes four RAMB16BWER blocks, each handling 8 bits of the 32-bit data width. The module supports read and write operations with byte-level granularity, allowing individual byte writes within a 32-bit word. It has configurable initial values for each SRAM block and uses a read-first write mode. The memory is addressable up to 2048 locations (11-bit address), and includes clock, write enable, byte enable, and data input/output ports for interfacing with the memory."
