This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM device, implementing memory read/write operations, command decoding, and timing checks. It models the behavior of a DDR3 memory by processing input signals, managing internal states, and performing data transfers. The module uses a series of tasks and always blocks to handle command interpretation, data input/output, and timing violations. It implements features such as bank activation, read/write operations, refresh cycles, power-down modes, and self-refresh. The module also performs extensive timing checks to ensure compliance with DDR3 SDRAM specifications, including setup and hold times, command-to-command delays, and other timing parameters.
