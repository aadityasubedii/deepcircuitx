Module name: xs6_addsub_n. Module specification: The `xs6_addsub_n` module is a Verilog design that performs either addition or subtraction on two input operands, `i_a` and `i_b`, based on the control signal `i_sub`. When `i_sub` is high, the module subtracts `i_b` from `i_a`; when low, it adds `i_a` to `i_b`. The module adheres to operand widths specified by the `WIDTH` parameter. It outputs the result of the operation through `o_sum` and a carry-over or borrow through `o_co`. The inputs include: `i_a` and `i_b`, which are operand inputs, `i_cin`, a carry-in input affecting the result, and `i_sub`, a control signal determining the operation mode. Outputs are `o_sum`, the result of the arithmetic operation, and `o_co`, the carry-out or borrow indicator. Internal signals such as `opmode` configure the operational mode of the DSP block, and `in_a`, `in_b` adjust operand widths to fit the DSP block's requirements. `out` captures the arithmetic results from the DSP block. The module incorporates a DSP48A1 block (named `u_dsp48`), configured for basic arithmetic operations with parameters set for various register usage and reset behaviors, focusing on performance and simplicity in arithmetic processing.
