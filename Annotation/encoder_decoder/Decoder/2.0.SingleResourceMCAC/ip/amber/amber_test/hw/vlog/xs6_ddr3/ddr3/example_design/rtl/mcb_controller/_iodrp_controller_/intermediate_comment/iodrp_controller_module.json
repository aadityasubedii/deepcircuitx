    "module": "The 'iodrp_controller' manages DRP interface operations for memory read-write activities, clocked by DRP_CLK. It leverages input signals like address and data to execute commands and states managed by an FSM to transition through operation phases. Outputs include DRP interface signals and read data, aligned with operational readiness and DRP protocol requirements."
