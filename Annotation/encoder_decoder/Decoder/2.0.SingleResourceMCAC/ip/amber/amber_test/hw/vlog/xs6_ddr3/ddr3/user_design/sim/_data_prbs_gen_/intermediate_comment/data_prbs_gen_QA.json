It uses parameterizable width and seed settings, and can be initialized with either a fixed or dynamically provided seed. The PRBS generation can be enabled or disabled via the `clk_en` input, and can be reset or reinitialized through the `rst_i` and `prbs_seed_init` inputs respectively. It outputs the PRBS on `prbs_o`. The module supports an eye-test mode where the functionality can slightly differ, controlled by the `EYE_TEST` parameter."

This signal drives the timing of the PRBS generation and registers updating.\n- `clk_en`: The clock enable input. It is used to enable or disable the PRBS generation. When low, updates to the PRBS output are paused, saving power or pausing output generation.\n- `rst_i`: The reset input. This active-high signal resets the internal state of the module, reinitializing the LFSR with the provided seed values when activated.\n- `prbs_fseed_i`: The fixed seed input. This 32-bit value can be added to the dynamic seed for PRBS initialization, applicable when the module is not in eye-test mode.\n- `prbs_seed_init`: The seed initialization control input. When high, it triggers the reinitialization of the LFSR with the new seed values provided via `prbs_seed_i` and `prbs_fseed_i`.\n- `prbs_seed_i`: The dynamic seed input. This allows the seed for the LFSR to be dynamically provided during operation, offering flexibility in the sequence generation.\n\nOutput ports: prbs_o.\nExplanation:\n- `prbs_o`: The PRBS output. This output port presents the pseudo-random binary sequence generated by the module and it reflects the current state of the internal LFSR. Its width is defined by the `PRBS_WIDTH` parameter."

The data in this register represents the LFSR's state minus the most significant bit, which is pivotal in generating the next state of the sequence.\n- `lfsr_q`: This register represents the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) used to generate the PRBS. It holds the state of the LFSR, including the current bit values at each position within the register. The values in this register are shifted and combined based on XOR operations defined within the always block sensitive to the `clk_i` signal, and this register effectively drives the generation of the pseudo-random sequence.
