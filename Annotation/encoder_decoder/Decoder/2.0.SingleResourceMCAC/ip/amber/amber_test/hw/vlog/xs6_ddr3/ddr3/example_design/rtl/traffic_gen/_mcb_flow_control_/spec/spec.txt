Module name: mcb_flow_control.

Module specification: The `mcb_flow_control` module is primarily designed for managing the flow of commands in a memory control interface tailored to SPARTAN6 FPGA environments. It controls the readiness and execution of memory commands based on the current status of the system, effectively handling memory operations like read and write. The module comprises various input ports including `clk_i` (clock input), `rst_i` (reset signal), `cmd_valid_i` (indicates if the incoming command is valid), among others that facilitate command processing, data path management, and address handling. On the output side, the module features `cmd_rdy_o` (indicates readiness to accept a new command), `cmd_en_o` (enables command execution), and corresponding signals for data path validation and address outputs. Internally, the module utilizes signals like `cmd_fifo_rdy` (FIFO buffer status), `push_cmd` (triggers command processing), and `xfer_cmd` (transfers commands for execution), all of which assist in managing state transitions and command execution workflows. The Verilog implementation utilizes a state machine approach, represented by states such as READY, WRITE, READ, CMD_WAIT, and REFRESH_ST, dictating module behavior in response to combinations of input and system conditions. This systematic control structure ensures proper synchronization of memory operations, managing readiness, ongoing data transfers, and command execution with efficiency and responsiveness appropriate for high-performance memory systems.
