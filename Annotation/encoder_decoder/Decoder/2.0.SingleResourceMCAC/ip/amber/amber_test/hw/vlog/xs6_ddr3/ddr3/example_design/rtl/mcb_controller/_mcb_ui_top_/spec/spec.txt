Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: This module serves as a top-level wrapper for a memory controller block (MCB) interface, integrating a raw MCB wrapper, AXI interfaces, and arbitration logic. It supports up to 6 ports configurable as native MCB or AXI interfaces. The module handles clock management, address translation, and data routing between interfaces and the memory controller. Input ports include system clocks, reset, and control signals for each port, as well as AXI interface inputs. Output ports provide status signals, memory interface signals, and AXI interface outputs. Internal signals (denoted with '_i' suffix) manage communication between AXI/native ports and the MCB wrapper. The module consists of several main blocks: a BUFPLL_MCB for clock management, an mcb_raw_wrapper for core memory operations, and conditional instantiations of axi_mc
