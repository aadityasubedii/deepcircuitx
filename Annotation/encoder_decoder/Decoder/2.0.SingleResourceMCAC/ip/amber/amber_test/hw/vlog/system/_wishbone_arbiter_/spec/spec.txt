Module name: wishbone_arbiter. Module specification: The `wishbone_arbiter` is designed to manage access between multiple master devices and slave devices on a Wishbone bus interface, ensuring controlled communication and preventing data collisions. It dynamically arbitrates bus access using several input and output signals. The input ports include `i_wb_clk` for clock synchronization, `i_mx_wb_xxx` for data, address, select, write enable, bus cycle, and strobe inputs from two masters (m0 and m1), and `i_sx_wb_dat`, `i_sx_wb_ack`, `i_sx_wb_err` for data, acknowledgment, and error signals from eight slaves (s0 to s7). The output ports have similar naming conventions like `o_mx_wb_dat`, `o_mx_wb_ack`, `o_mx_wb_err` indicating data, acknowledgment, and error outputs to masters, and `o_sx_wb_adr`, `o_sx_wb_sel`, etc., handling address and data outputs to slaves. Internal signals such as `m0_wb_hold_r`, `m1_wb_hold_r` maintain the hold states of masters' requests, while `current_master`, `next_master`, and `select_master` manage the logic for selecting the active master based on inputs and hold registers. `master_adr`, `master_sel`, `master_we`, etc., are used to route specific control and data signals between the active master and selected slave. The Verilog code structure includes assignments for selecting the next master, handling bus requests, assigning the slave addressing based on the master's address (`current_slave`), and routing data, error, and acknowledge signals to appropriate output ports based on the arbitration logic. This module's complex functionality of managing multiple bus masters and slaves makes it essential for maintaining data integrity and order in system transactions on the Wishbone bus.
