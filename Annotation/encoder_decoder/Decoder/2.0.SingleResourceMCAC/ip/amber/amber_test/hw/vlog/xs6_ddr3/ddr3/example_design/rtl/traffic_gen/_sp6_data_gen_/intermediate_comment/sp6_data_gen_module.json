    "module": "The sp6_data_gen module generates various data patterns for memory testing and verification, supporting multiple data widths and pattern types. It implements fixed data, address-based, hammer, walking ones/zeros, and PRBS patterns using conditional logic and generate blocks. The module selects and outputs the appropriate pattern based on input signals and configuration parameters, utilizing internal registers and combinatorial logic to create and manipulate the data patterns. It incorporates a PRBS generator and employs different algorithms for each pattern type, adapting its behavior according to the specified data width and number of DQ pins."
