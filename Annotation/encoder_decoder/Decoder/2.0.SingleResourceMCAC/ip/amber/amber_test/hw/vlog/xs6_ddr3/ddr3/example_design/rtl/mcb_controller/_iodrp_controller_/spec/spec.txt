Module name: iodrp_controller. Module specification: The 'iodrp_controller' is a Verilog module designed to manage a Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) interface for conducting read and write operations on memory cells, governed by the DRP_CLK clock signal. The module receives input signals including an 8-bit 'memcell_address' for specifying the target memory cell, an 8-bit 'write_data' for data to be written, a 'rd_not_write' control signal to select read or write operations, a 'cmd_valid' signal indicating command validity, a 'use_broadcast' flag enabling multicast operations, and a 'sync_rst' for synchronous resetting. Output signals include an 8-bit 'read_data' where data read from memory is outputted, a 'rdy_busy_n' indicating the controller's readiness, a 'DRP_CS' for chip select, a 'DRP_SDI' serial data output, a 'DRP_ADD' indicating address phase, and a 'DRP_BKST' for broadcast strobe signaling. Internal signals such as 'memcell_addr_reg', 'data_reg', 'shift_through_reg', and 'bit_cnt' assist in storing addresses, data, managing shift register operations, and tracking bits during transmission, respectively. Additionally, the module employs a finite state machine (FSM) with states like 'READY', 'DECIDE', and 'DATA_PHASE' to control the sequence of operations from deciding the operation mode to handling address and data phase transitions. The Verilog code strategically initializes, transitions states, and outputs based on clock edges and input signals, ensuring robust data handling aligned with the DRP protocol.
