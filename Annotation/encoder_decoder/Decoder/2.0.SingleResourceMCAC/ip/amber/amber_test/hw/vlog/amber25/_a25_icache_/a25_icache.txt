The a25_icache module implements an instruction cache for the Amber 25 processor, improving execution speed by storing recently accessed instructions. It features configurable cache lines, words per line, and ways, using a state machine to manage cache operations. The module handles cache misses, fills, and flushes, employing a least recently used (LRU) or random replacement policy for cache line selection. It interacts with the processor core and memory system through various control signals, managing data transfers and providing hit/miss information to optimize instruction fetching.
