The `a25_register_bank` module manages multiple register sets in a CPU, accommodating various operation modes like User, Supervisor, IRQ, and FIRQ. It handles register selection and output based on inputs like mode signals, data inputs, and write-enable signals. Internally, the module uses mode-specific control signals and conditional write logic to update registers and provide the correct output registers for CPU execution stages, all synchronized to a clock signal and controlled with a reset input for initialization.
