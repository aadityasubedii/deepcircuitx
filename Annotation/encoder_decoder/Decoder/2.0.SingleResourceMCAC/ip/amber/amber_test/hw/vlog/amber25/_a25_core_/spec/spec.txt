Module name: a25_core. Module specification: The "a25_core" module encapsulates the central processing logic for a processor, primarily handling instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory operations, and write-back. Its key inputs include the 'clk' for timing, 'reset' for initialization, and various test and scanning inputs like 'scan_in0' through 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode' for operational testing and debugging purposes. Peripheral interaction is facilitated with interrupt inputs 'i_irq' and 'i_firq', a 'system_rdy' signal indicating readiness, and Wishbone bus signals for data transfers. Outputs include 'scan_out0' through 'scan_out4' for testing outputs, 'o_wb_adr', 'o_wb_sel', 'o_wb_we', 'o_wb_dat', 'o_wb_cyc', and 'o_wb_stb', managing the address, selection, and control of data transactions on the Wishbone bus.

Internally, the module utilizes a variety of signals like 'execute_iaddress' and 'execute_daddress' for managing instruction and data addresses, 'write_data', 'write_enable' for memory writing operations, and various control flags such as 'fetch_stall', 'mem_stall', to manage pipeline stalls and operational states. It employs detailed status control bits like 'status_bits_mode' and 'status_bits_irq_mask' to manage CPU modes and interrupt handling.

The Verilog code structurally comprises multiple sub-modules such as 'a25_fetch', 'a25_decode', 'a25_execute', 'a25_mem', 'a25_write_back', 'a25_wishbone', and 'a25_coprocessor', each dedicated to specific tasks. 'a25_fetch' handles instruction fetch logistics, 'a25_decode' decodes fetched instructions, 'a25_execute' manages the execution stage, 'a25_mem' takes care of memory operations, 'a25_write_back' deals with the write-back stage, 'a25_wishbone' interfaces with the Wishbone bus, and 'a25_coprocessor' interacts with any coprocessor present. This elaborate and modular approach efficiently orchestrates the complex operations within the processor's core, ensuring robust data handling, operational control, and external communication, mirroring a versatile yet tightly integrated processor core architecture.
