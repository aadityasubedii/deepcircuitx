The module uses varying PRBS configurations depending on parameters such as PRBS_CMD and PRBS_WIDTH. For example, different LFSR tap configurations are implemented for different widths (64, 32, 20 bits), which are contingent upon the `PRBS_CMD` parameter specifying the type of PRBS generation, such as \"ADDRESS\", \"INSTR\", or \"BLEN\". The initial seed and continuation of the sequence can be controlled via the input signals. It also includes parameterized masks and addresses to manipulate bits based on certain conditions, and the entire functionality is dependent on the clock input to progress the shift register values. This module essentially serves as a utility for generating addresses or other patterns in a pseudo-random manner, typically useful in memory testing and simulation scenarios in hardware design."

This is the primary clock signal on which the internal logic of the module operates. It is used to drive the LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) operations synchronously.\n- prbs_seed_init: Seed Initialization input port. A high signal on this port initializes the LFSR register with the seed value provided on prbs_seed_i at the rising edge of clk_i.\n- clk_en: Clock Enable input port. This is a control signal used to enable the operation of the LFSR. The LFSR updates its contents only when this signal is high, enabling controlled operation of the sequence generation.\n- prbs_seed_i: PRBS Seed Input port. This is the initial seed value for the LFSR when prbs_seed_init is high. It sets the starting point of the pseudorandom sequence.\n\nOutput ports: prbs_o.\nExplanation:\n- prbs_o: PRBS Output port. This outputs the generated pseudorandom binary sequence. It provides the result of LFSR operations, which are usable as pseudorandom patterns for further application in testing or simulation scenarios in various digital systems."
