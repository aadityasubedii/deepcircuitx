    "module": "The `wishbone_arbiter` module arbitrates access between multiple masters and slaves on a Wishbone bus, ensuring safe, collision-free communications. It uses input signals from masters to control transactions and outputs signals to slaves, selecting the active master based on current bus requests and predefined priorities. Internal registers hold the request states, while logic blocks route addresses, control, and data signals appropriately, managing acknowledgments and errors to maintain bus integrity and operational efficiency."
