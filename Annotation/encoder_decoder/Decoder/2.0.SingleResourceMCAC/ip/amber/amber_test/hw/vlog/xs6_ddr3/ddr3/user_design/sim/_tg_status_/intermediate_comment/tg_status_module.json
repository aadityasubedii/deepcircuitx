    "module": "The tg_status module monitors and reports the first occurrence of data mismatches between expected and received data within a system, retaining this error state until reset. It handles resets via a manual input or automatically upon system reset and indicates error detection using internal registers that safeguard against subsequent errors until cleared. The module assesses errors considering input data, associated addresses, burst lengths, and buffer statuses, integrating these details into a comprehensive error_status output, and providing a straightforward error signal for external use."
