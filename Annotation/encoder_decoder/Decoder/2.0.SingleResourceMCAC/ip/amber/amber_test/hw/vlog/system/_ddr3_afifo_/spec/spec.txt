Module name: ddr3_afifo. 
Module specification: The 'ddr3_afifo' is a Verilog module designed to handle data and command transfers between system clock and DDR clock domains using asynchronous FIFO structures. This module interfaces with DDR3 memory and manages command queuing, write operations, and data reads. It includes input ports such as `i_sys_clk` and `i_ddr_clk` for clocking, `i_cmd_en`, `i_cmd_instr`, and `i_cmd_byte_addr` for command queue operations, and `i_wr_en`, `i_wr_mask`, `i_wr_data`, and `i_wr_addr_32` for handling write operations. Additionally, it has DDR domain feedback inputs like `i_ddr_cmd_full`, `i_ddr_wr_full`, and `i_ddr_rd_data` to manage buffer statuses and data reads. The output ports include `o_cmd_full`, `o_wr_full`, `o_rd_data`, and `o_rd_valid` to indicate buffer states and data availability, and `o_ddr_cmd_en`, `o_ddr_cmd_instr`, `o_ddr_cmd_byte_addr`, `o_ddr_wr_en`, `o_ddr_wr_mask`, `o_ddr_wr_data`, and `o_ddr_wr_addr_32` to forward processed data and commands to the DDR domain. Internal control signals like `cmd_empty`, `wr_empty`, and `rd_empty` are utilized to manage data flow based on FIFO statuses. Three main blocks in the code correspond to the FIFO structures for commands (`u_afifo_cmd`), write operations (`u_afifo_wr`), and read data (`u_afifo_rd`), handling data and control signal transformations and transmission between different clock domains. This module ensures seamless data integrity and synchronization for systems interfacing with DDR3 memory.
