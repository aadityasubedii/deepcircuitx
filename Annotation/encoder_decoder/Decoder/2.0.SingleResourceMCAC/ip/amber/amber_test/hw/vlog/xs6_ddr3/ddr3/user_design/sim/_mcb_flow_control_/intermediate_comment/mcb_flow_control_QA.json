The FSM transitions through states based on various input signals such as readiness indications and command validity, and controls enabling signals for reading and writing operations. The module also prepares command outputs and addresses, manages burst lengths, and handles state transitions based on readiness and fullness of command queues, read/write data paths, and the system or memory states. This module thus serves as an interface controller between the system and memory blocks, facilitating effective memory address and data management for reads and writes."
