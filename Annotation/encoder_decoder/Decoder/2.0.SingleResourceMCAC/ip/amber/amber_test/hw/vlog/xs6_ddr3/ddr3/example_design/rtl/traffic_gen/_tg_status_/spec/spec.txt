Module name: tg_status. 
Module specification: The `tg_status` module is utilized to monitor and report data errors in a system. It captures deviations between expected and actual data alongside the conditions prevailing at the time of the error, such as memory buffer statuses and data addresses. The module handles inputs like the clock (`clk_i`), reset (`rst_i`), manual error clear (`manual_clear_error`), data error indication (`data_error_i`), compared data (`cmp_data_i`), received data (`rd_data_i`), data address (`cmp_addr_i`), block length (`cmp_bl_i`), and buffer full/empty flags (`mcb_cmd_full_i`, `mcb_wr_full_i`, `mcb_rd_empty_i`). The outputs comprise an `error` flag signaling if an error has been detected and an `error_status` output bus providing detailed error context. Internally, the module uses `data_error_r` to latch the data error signal and `error_set` as a flag to indicate if an error has been logged, preventing overwriting till a reset is issued. The code's main blocks include signal initialization and conditions for capturing and updating error details based on data inconsistencies and buffer states, managed under clock-driven logic. This setup ensures error states are captured only on the rising edge of `data_error_i`, conditional to no prior errors being recorded (`error_set` not being high), thus enabling efficient error management for debugging or corrective actions.
