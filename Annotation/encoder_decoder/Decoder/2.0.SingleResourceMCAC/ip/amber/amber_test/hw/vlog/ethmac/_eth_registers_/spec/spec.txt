Module name: eth_registers. Module specification: The eth_registers module implements Ethernet control and status registers for an Ethernet MAC. It handles reading and writing of various configuration registers that control the operation of the Ethernet interface, including parameters like inter-packet gap times, MAC address, flow control settings, and interrupt masks. The module has input ports for data (DataIn), address (Address), read/write control (Rw), chip select (Cs), clocks (Clk, TxClk, RxClk), reset (Reset), and various control signals. Output ports include data (DataOut), register values, and an interrupt signal (int_o). Internal signals are used for register selection, data storage, interrupt handling, and clock domain crossing synchronization. The module is divided into several sections: register definitions and write logic, register read logic, signal assignments for various Ethernet parameters, interrupt handling logic, and clock domain synchronization for
