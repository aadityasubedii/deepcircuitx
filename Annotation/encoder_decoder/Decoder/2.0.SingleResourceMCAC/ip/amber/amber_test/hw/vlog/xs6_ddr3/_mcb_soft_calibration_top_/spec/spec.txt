Module name: mcb_soft_calibration_top. Module specification: The mcb_soft_calibration_top module is designed for calibration processes in DDR memory controller blocks, focusing on both software-based and potential hardware-based calibration techniques. The module manages input termination, dynamic calibration, and other configurations related to DDR memory types. Key input ports include UI_CLK (User Interface Clock), RST (Reset), IOCLK (I/O Clock), PLL_LOCK (Phase-Locked Loop Lock indicator), and various signals related to memory operations, calibration requests, and data handling. Output ports comprise DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL (Calibration Completion Indicator), interface signals to Memory Controller block such as MCB_UIADD, MCB_UISDI, and readiness flags like MCB_UO_CAL_START. Essential internal signals such as IODRP_ADD, IODRP_SDI, and RZQ_IODRP_SDO facilitate handling specific I/O Delay and Read Path configurations; for example, RZQ_IODRP_CS is used for selecting RZQ calibration settings. The module incorporates sub-modules such as mcb_soft_calibration instantiated with relevant parameters affecting calibration processes. It also includes I/O buffer configurations and IODRP controls specified in generate blocks handling different memory types and calibration strategies, reflecting their conditional deployment. This comprehensive architecture ensures robust preparation for memory operation through detailed and adaptable calibration processes.
