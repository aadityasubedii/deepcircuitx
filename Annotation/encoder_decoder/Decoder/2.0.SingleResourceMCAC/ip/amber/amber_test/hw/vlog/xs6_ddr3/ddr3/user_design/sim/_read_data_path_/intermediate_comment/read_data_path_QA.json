It consists of several components including FIFOs for posting read commands and managing data, a data generator for read operations, and error detection mechanisms that verify data integrity by comparing expected data with received data, flagging errors when mismatches occur. This module is suitable for FPGA implementations, particularly targeting families like VIRTEX6 and SPARTAN6, and handles different memory burst lengths and data verification scenarios."
