The mcb_traffic_gen module generates and controls traffic for Memory Controller Block (MCB) operations. It implements configurable memory access patterns through command generation, flow control, and separate read/write data paths. The module uses input parameters to set operational modes, generates randomized or fixed commands and data, manages data flow between internal components and the MCB, and provides error detection and status monitoring capabilities. It supports various memory configurations and burst modes, making it suitable for testing and validating memory interface operations in FPGA designs.
