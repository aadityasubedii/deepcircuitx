    "module": "The `eth_rxethmac` module is designed for efficient handling and processing of Ethernet frames at the MAC layer, specifically focusing on synchronization, validation, and management of incoming data based on the MRxClk signal. It leverages a variety of input and output signals to perform tasks such as CRC checking, frame boundary detection, and address filtering. Internal signals and dedicated submodules like `eth_rxstatem`, `eth_rxcounters`, and `eth_rxaddrcheck` are utilized to manage state transitions, count bytes, validate data integrity, and ensure correct address recognition, enabling the module to support complex Ethernet MAC functionalities."
