The `afifo` module is an asynchronous FIFO designed for safe data transfer across different clock domains, using configurable depth and data width for flexibility. It employs Gray code pointers to reduce synchronization errors and contains control logic for managing FIFO state signals `full`, `empty`, and `almost_full`. Internal synchronization blocks and pointer management ensure reliable and consistent data handling between producer and consumer operations.
