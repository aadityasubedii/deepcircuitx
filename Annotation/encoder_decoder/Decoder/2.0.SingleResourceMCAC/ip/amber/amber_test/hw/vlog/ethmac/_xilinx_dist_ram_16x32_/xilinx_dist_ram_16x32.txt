The xilinx_dist_ram_16x32 module implements a 16x32 dual-port distributed RAM using Xilinx's RAM16X1D primitives, enabling concurrent read and write operations at distinct addresses. It integrates input ports for data, addressing, and control signals (write enable and clock) alongside a 32-bit output for read data. Internal signals directly map input addresses to the RAM blocks, each handling a specific bit of the data bus, ensuring efficient and synchronous data processing in FPGA environments.
