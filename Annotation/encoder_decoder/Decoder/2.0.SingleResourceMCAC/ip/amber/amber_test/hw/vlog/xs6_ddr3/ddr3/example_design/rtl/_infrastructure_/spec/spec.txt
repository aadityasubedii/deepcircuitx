Module name: infrastructure. Module specification: The `infrastructure` module is a versatile clock management component primarily used in FPGA designs for generating and managing multiple clock signals and reset conditions. It supports configurable input clock types, either differential (via `sys_clk_p` and `sys_clk_n`) for reduced noise and crosstalk, or single-ended (via `sys_clk`) for simpler, cost-effective applications. The module processes these clocks through a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to output various stabilized clock signals: `clk0` (primary system clock), `sysclk_2x` and `sysclk_2x_180` (frequency-doubled clocks with the latter being phase-shifted), and `mcb_drp_clk` (for Memory Controller Blocks and Dynamic Reconfiguration Port operations). Control signals `pll_ce_0` and `pll_ce_90` are aligned respectively with the double-speed clocks for serial deserialization tasks. It also outputs `pll_lock`, indicating the lock status of the PLL. Internal signals such as `clk_2x_0`, `clk_2x_180` for doubly fast clocks, and buffering signals `clk0_bufg_in` for primary clock stability play crucial roles. There are various configuration parameters, such as input frequency, clock divides, and multipliers that can be tailored based on system requirements. Key components of the code include differential and single-ended clock input handling, PLL configuration for various output clocks, buffer assignment for maintaining clock signal integrity, and complex reset synchronization mechanismsâ€”all ensuring robust and reliable operation of FPGA-based systems. This module is integral in managing different clock domains and ensuring that resets are consistently and safely asserted throughout the system.
