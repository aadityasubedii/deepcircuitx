Module name: xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en.
Module specification: The xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en is a Verilog module designed to simulate a byte-enabled SRAM of size 256x32, employing a `RAMB8BWER` memory block for reading and writing operations. It interfaces through input ports: `i_clk` (the clock signal synchronizing module operations), `i_write_data` (32-bit data to be written to memory), `i_write_enable` (enables data writing when high), `i_address` (an 8-bit address for data positioning), and `i_byte_enable` (4-bit mask allowing selective byte updating inside the data width). The sole output port, `o_read_data`, outputs the data read from the specified memory address. Internally, the module utilizes signals `nc31`, `nc32`, `nc33`, and `nc22` as unused, with `wea` (write enable array) deriving from the `i_write_enable` and `i_byte_enable` to form a 4-bit mask controlling which bytes are written to the memory. The RAMB8BWER is configured in the code block with parameters like data width and operation modes, and it handles the actual data storing and retrieval logic based on the inputs from the module's interface. Initial conditions verify that `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDRESS_WIDTH` parameters correctly set to 32 and 8, respectively, alerting any discrepancies. This organization ensures a robust design enabling selective data manipulation with byte-level granularity in a simulated SRAM environment.
