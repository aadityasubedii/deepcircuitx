    "spec": "Module name: tb_uart. Module specification: The tb_uart module is a Verilog testbench designed for simulating and verifying the functionality of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) interface. This module handles transmission and reception of serial data, respecting the UART control protocol, and includes mechanisms for loopback testing. It encompasses input ports including i_uart_cts_n (Clear To Send, active low, used to indicate readiness to accept data) and i_uart_rxd (Receive Data, the serial data input), and output ports namely o_uart_txd (Transmit Data, the serial data output) and o_uart_rts_n (Request To Send, active low, indicating readiness to receive data, always driven low here implying a constant readiness). Internally, the module uses signals like clk_uart (clock signal), rx_state (receiver state), tx_state (transmitter state), and several counters and buffers such as rx_bit_count and tx_fifo to handle data flow. The functional blocks include clock generation for UART timing, reset handling, data reception, and transmission handling logic, FIFO management for the transmit buffer, and status and control signal integration using external module flags. These blocks serve distinct roles like managing the UART protocol timing, synchronizing data reception/transmission, and FIFO buffer controls, collectively ensuring the testbench accurately models UART operations for system integration testing.",

Module specification: The tb_uart module is a Verilog testbench designed for simulating and verifying the functionality of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) interface. This module handles transmission and reception of serial data, respecting the UART control protocol, and includes mechanisms for loopback testing. It encompasses input ports including i_uart_cts_n (Clear To Send, active low, used to indicate readiness to accept data) and i_uart_rxd (Receive Data, the serial data input), and output ports namely o_uart_txd (Transmit Data, the serial data output) and o_uart_rts_n (Request To Send, active low, indicating readiness to receive data, always driven low here implying a constant readiness). Internally, the module uses signals like clk_uart (clock signal), rx_state (receiver state), tx_state (transmitter state), and several counters and buffers such as rx_bit_count and tx_fifo to handle data flow. The functional blocks include clock generation for UART timing, reset handling, data reception, and transmission handling logic, FIFO management for the transmit buffer, and status and control signal integration using external module flags. These blocks serve distinct roles like managing the UART protocol timing, synchronizing data reception/transmission, and FIFO buffer controls, collectively ensuring the testbench accurately models UART operations for system integration testing."
