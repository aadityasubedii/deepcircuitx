Module name: write_data_path

Module specification: The "write_data_path" module interfaces with a submodule "wr_data_gen" to handle data writing sequences in memory systems, tailored specifically for FPGA operations. This parameterizable module receives a variety of inputs, including clock (`clk_i`), reset (`rst_i`), command valid signals (`cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_validB_i`, `cmd_validC_i`), data readiness (`data_rdy_i`), and configuration details like PRBS seed (`prbs_fseed_i`), data mode (`data_mode_i`), and fixed data (`fixed_data_i`). It outputs signals indicating command readiness (`cmd_rdy_o`), data validity (`data_valid_o`), the last word write status (`last_word_wr_o`), the data to be written (`data_o`), a data mask (`data_mask_o`), and write operation completion (`data_wr_end_o`). Internally, the module uses two significant signals: `data_valid` (a wire to track the validity of data output from `wr_data_gen` based on internal and external conditions) and `cmd_rdy` (a register to store readiness state for new commands). The module encompasses a key sub-block, `wr_data_gen`, parameterized with details such as data width, burst length, and operational specifics pertinent to testing and memory operations. This submodule significantly contributes to generating data patterns, processing commands, and controlling data output, which collaborates with external readiness signals to ensure correct and synchronized data transfer to memory. The rest of the module logic ties these processes together, providing clear signal pathways and interfaces for robust memory operation management.
