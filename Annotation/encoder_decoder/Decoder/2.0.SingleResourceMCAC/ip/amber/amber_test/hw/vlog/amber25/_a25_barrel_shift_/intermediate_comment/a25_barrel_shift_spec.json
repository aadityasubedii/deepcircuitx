    "spec": "Module name: a25_barrel_shift.\nModule specification: The `a25_barrel_shift` module is a sophisticated Verilog design that incorporates a dual-mode barrel shifter for processing 32-bit input data (`i_in`). Its architecture is suitable to handle two types of shift operations: a full barrel shift and a quick shift, selectable based on operational needs. The module accepts several input signals including the clock (`clk`), reset (`reset`), test-related inputs (`scan_enable`, `test_mode`), the main data input (`i_in`), an accompanying carry input (`i_carry_in`), the shift amount (`i_shift_amount`), a zero-shifting enable signal (`i_shift_imm_zero`), and a function code (`i_function`). The outputs of the module are the shifted result (`o_out`), a carry out (`o_carry_out`), and an indication of operational stall (`o_stall`) due to large shift amounts or configuration limits. Internally, the module utilizes wire signals `quick_out` and `quick_carry_out` for results from the quick shifter, and `full_out` and `full_carry_out` from the full barrel shifter. Registered versions of the full shifter outputs (`full_out_r` and `full_carry_out_r`) ensure stable data between operations, driven by the `use_quick_r` register that selects the shifter mode based on the stall condition. Two instances of the `a25_shifter` are used, parameterized for full and quick operations, configuring data pathways and functionality dynamically. The logic control, set/reset operations within synchronous always blocks, and conditional assignments regulate the flow and transformation of data through the module, making it flexible yet robust for different operational scenarios.",

It supports optional functionalities like immediate zero shift (`i_shift_imm_zero`) and can operate under different functions specified by `i_function`. The shifter is designed to handle different conditions by employing two sub-modules (`u_a25_shifter_full` for full barrel shifter and `u_a25_shifter_quick` for a quick shifter variant) based on the efficiency needs. The logic controls which output (`full_out` or `quick_out`) to use through the control signal `use_quick_r`. Signal `o_stall` indicates an operational stall based on the shift amount and operational mode. The reset logic initializes internal registers and determines the mode of operation (i.e., quick or full mode). The outputs of the module are `o_out` for the shifted result and `o_carry_out` for the carry bit result."

It is used to pass the result to the primary output `o_out` when the quick shifting mode is considered applicable.\n- `quick_carry_out`: This is a single-bit internal wire signal that holds the carry output from the quick shifter (`u_a25_shifter_quick`).
