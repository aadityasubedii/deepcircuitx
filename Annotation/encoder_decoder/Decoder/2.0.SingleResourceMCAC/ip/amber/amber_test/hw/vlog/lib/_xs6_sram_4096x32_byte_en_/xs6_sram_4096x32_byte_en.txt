This module implements a 4096x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA block RAM resources. It utilizes 8 RAMB16BWER primitives, organized into two banks of 2048x32 bits each, to create the full 4096x32-bit memory. The module supports read and write operations with byte-level granularity, allowing individual byte writes within a 32-bit word. It uses the most significant address bit to select between the two banks and includes extensive initialization parameters for each RAMB16BWER primitive, enabling pre-loading of SRAM contents if desired.
