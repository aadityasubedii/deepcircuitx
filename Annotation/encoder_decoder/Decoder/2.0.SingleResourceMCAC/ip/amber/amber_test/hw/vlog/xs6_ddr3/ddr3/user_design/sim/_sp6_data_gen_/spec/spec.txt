Module name: sp6_data_gen. Module specification: The sp6_data_gen module is designed to generate various data patterns for memory interface testing and simulation. It takes inputs such as clk_i (clock), rst_i (reset), data_mode_i (pattern selection), addr_i (address input), and user_burst_cnt (burst count), among others. The primary output is data_o, which carries the generated data pattern. Internal signals include prbs_data (pseudo-random binary sequence), adata (address-based data), hdata (hammer pattern), ndata (XOR of hdata and w1data), and w1data (walking one/zero pattern). The module supports multiple data widths (32, 64, 128 bits) and various data patterns, including fixed constant, walking ones/zeros, hammer, address-based, and PRBS. It uses conditional generate blocks to adapt functionality
