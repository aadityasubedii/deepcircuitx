Module name: timer_module.  
Module specification: The `timer_module` is a Verilog hardware module designed for the efficient management of three distinct timers, employing a Wishbone bus interface for control. This module interacts via input ports such as `i_clk` (clock signal), `i_wb_adr` (Wishbone address bus), `i_wb_sel` (byte select lines), `i_wb_we` (write enable), `i_wb_dat` (data bus for write operations), `i_wb_cyc` (cycle valid signal), and `i_wb_stb` (strobe signal). The output ports include `o_wb_dat` (data bus for read operations), `o_wb_ack` (acknowledge signal), `o_wb_err` (error signal), and `o_timer_int` (interrupt outputs for the timers). Internal signals such as `wb_start_write`, `wb_start_read`, and `wb_start_read_d1` facilitate timing and control of read/write operations, with additional multiplexing based on bus width through `wb_rdata32` and `wb_wdata32`. The code structure is divided into blocks handling data path configuration (e.g., data width handling), operational logic for timer control and status reporting (e.g., load, countdown, interrupt), and debugging features aimed at system integration and testing. This architecture emphasizes modular timer management with real-time responsiveness and supportive debugging capabilities.
