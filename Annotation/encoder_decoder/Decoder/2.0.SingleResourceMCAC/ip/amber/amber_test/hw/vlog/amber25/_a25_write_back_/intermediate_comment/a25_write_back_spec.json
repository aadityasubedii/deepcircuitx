    "spec": "Module name: a25_write_back. \n\nModule specification: The 'a25_write_back' module is designed for use in a pipelined processor architecture, specifically handling the transition of data and control signals from the memory stage to the write-back stage. It latches the memory read data, the validity of this data, and the register address for data to be written back, ensuring these signals are preserved across clock cycles barring stalls. Input ports include 'clk' (clock signal to synchronize the operations), 'reset' (resets internal states), 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' (for diagnostic purposes), 'i_mem_stall' (indicates a stall in the memory stage), 'i_mem_read_data' (data read from memory), 'i_mem_read_data_valid' (validity of the read data), 'i_mem_load_rd' (destination register address for the read data), 'i_daddress', and 'i_daddress_valid' (providing and validating the data address from previous stages). The outputs are 'o_wb_read_data' (the data to be written back), 'o_wb_read_data_valid' (validity of this data), and 'o_wb_load_rd' (the register address where the data should be written). Internally, the module uses registers 'mem_read_data_r', 'mem_read_data_valid_r', 'mem_load_rd_r', and 'daddress_r' to store the aforementioned inputs across cycles efficiently. The Verilog code comprises two always blocks; one handles the latching of read data, its validity, and the load register address unless a memory stall occurs, and the other manages the address data, both conditioned by the clock and reset signals to ensure correct initialization and updating of states.\n",
