    "module": "This module implements a top-level interface for a memory controller block (MCB) supporting multiple ports and AXI interfaces. It manages memory operations by integrating clock management (BUFPLL_MCB), core memory controller functionality (mcb_raw_wrapper), and AXI interface handling (axi_mcb instances). The module supports various memory types and configurations, handling arbitration, command processing, read/write operations, and AXI protocol conversion. It utilizes numerous input/output ports and internal signals to route data, control, and status information between components, allowing for flexible memory access and control across up to 6 ports."
