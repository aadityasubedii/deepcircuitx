Module name: eth_spram_256x32. 

Module specification: The module 'eth_spram_256x32' is a synchronous RAM designed to handle 256 words each of 32 bits width, catering to conditional write and read operations targeted for different FPGA configurations like Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6, or a generic setting. It utilizes several input and output ports; input ports include 'clk' (clock signal), 'rst' (reset signal), 'ce' (chip enable), 'we' (4-bit wide write enable signal for byte-wise control), 'oe' (output enable for reads), 'addr' (8-bit address selector), and 'di' (32-bit data input). The single output port 'do' outputs 32-bit data corresponding to the read operations, although its logic is implicitly handled within the memory block and not directly tied to the 'oe' signal in this specific code snippet. The module uses an internal signal 'write_enable'—a combination of 'ce' and any active 'we' bits—to allow writes only when the module is active and at least one byte-enable bit is in operation. The code defines instantiate different RAM blocks based on predefined macros for FPGA compatibility, organizing them under conditional compilation flags, demonstrating a modular approach to adapting hardware specifics by including a generic fallback setting when no specific FPGA configuration is defined. Each RAM configuration respects the universal parameters of data width and address width, ensuring consistent interfacing regardless of the underlying hardware configuration.
