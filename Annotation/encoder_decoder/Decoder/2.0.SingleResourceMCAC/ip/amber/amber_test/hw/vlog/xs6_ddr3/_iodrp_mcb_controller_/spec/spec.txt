Module name: iodrp_mcb_controller.

Module specification: The "iodrp_mcb_controller" is a Verilog module designed to manage memory cell operations, focusing on reading and writing data to specific addresses, primarily in a DRAM context likely involving Intel's Dynamic Reconfigurable Port technology. The module operates based on the `DRP_CLK` clock signal and handles inputs such as `memcell_address` for specifying memory cell addresses, `write_data` for data to be written, `rd_not_write` to choose between reading and writing operations, and `cmd_valid` to confirm that commands are ready to be executed. Outputs include `read_data` which carries data read from the memory, and `rdy_busy_n` signalling whether the module is ready for new commands. Internal signals like `memcell_addr_reg` and `data_reg` hold values of address and data during operations. The state machine implemented manages the transition between various operational phases such as address and data phases. Key tasks and blocks in the code handle data shifting and expansion (`shift_n_expand`), state transitions based on current operational mode and commands, and data transfer involving specific DRP configurations. This module is critical for synchronizing data handling and control operations within memory-bound processes in digital systems.
