Module name: xs6_sram_4096x32_byte_en. Module specification: This module implements a 4096x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA block RAM resources. It consists of 8 RAMB16BWER primitives, each handling 8 bits of the 32-bit data width, organized into two banks of 2048x32 bits each. The module supports read and write operations with byte-level granularity, allowing individual byte writes within a 32-bit word. Input ports include i_clk (clock input), i_write_data (32-bit data input), i_write_enable (write control), i_address (12-bit address), and i_byte_enable (4-bit byte write control). The output port o_read_data provides the 32-bit
