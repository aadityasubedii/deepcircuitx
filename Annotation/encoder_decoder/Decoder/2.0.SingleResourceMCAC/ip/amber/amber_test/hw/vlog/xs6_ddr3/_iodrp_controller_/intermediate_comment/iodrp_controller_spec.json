    "spec": "Module name: iodrp_controller. \n\nModule specification: The 'iodrp_controller' is a Verilog module designed for interfacing with memory cells, handling both read and write operations via a finite state machine (FSM). This module operates on an 8-bit memory cell address (`memcell_address`) and data (`write_data`), with input controls including a read/write signal (`rd_not_write`), operation initiation (`cmd_valid`), broadcast control (`use_broadcast`), and a synchronous reset (`sync_rst`). The FSM synchronizes with the `DRP_CLK` clock signal and manipulates internal signal states through several registers such as `memcell_addr_reg`, `data_reg`, and `shift_through_reg` along with control flags like `load_shift_n` and `addr_data_sel_n`. The module features output ports like `read_data`, for outputting read memory data, and `rdy_busy_n` for module status. Additional outputs include `DRP_CS` for the chip select signal, `DRP_SDI` for serial data input, and `DRP_ADD` for the validity of the address phase; all contribute to the dynamic operation of the memory interface. The module's state transitions, managed by `state` and `nextstate`, range from setting up the memory address (`ADDR_PHASE`) to data transfer (`DATA_PHASE`) and handle the gaps between these operations (`ADDR_TO_DATA_GAP`). Outputs are controlled by serializing the selected data (`data_out_mux`) and preparing the module to return to a ready state (`ALMOST_READY`) after completing the current operation. Additionally, internal debug and state tracking are facilitated by the `state_ascii` string representation of the current FSM state. This comprehensive design ensures effective memory manipulation either for single or broadcast data operations depending on the module's inputs and internal state logic.",

This module operates on an 8-bit memory cell address (`memcell_address`) and data (`write_data`), with input controls including a read/write signal (`rd_not_write`), operation initiation (`cmd_valid`), broadcast control (`use_broadcast`), and a synchronous reset (`sync_rst`). The FSM synchronizes with the `DRP_CLK` clock signal and manipulates internal signal states through several registers such as `memcell_addr_reg`, `data_reg`, and `shift_through_reg` along with control flags like `load_shift_n` and `addr_data_sel_n`. The module features output ports like `read_data`, for outputting read memory data, and `rdy_busy_n` for module status. Additional outputs include `DRP_CS` for the chip select signal, `DRP_SDI` for serial data input, and `DRP_ADD` for the validity of the address phase; all contribute to the dynamic operation of the memory interface. The module's state transitions, managed by `state` and `nextstate`, range from setting up the memory address (`ADDR_PHASE`) to data transfer (`DATA_PHASE`) and handle the gaps between these operations (`ADDR_TO_DATA_GAP`). Outputs are controlled by serializing the selected data (`data_out_mux`) and preparing the module to return to a ready state (`ALMOST_READY`) after completing the current operation. Additionally, internal debug and state tracking are facilitated by the `state_ascii` string representation of the current FSM state. This comprehensive design ensures effective memory manipulation either for single or broadcast data operations depending on the module's inputs and internal state logic."
