Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module is a behavioral model of a DDR3 SDRAM (Double Data Rate 3 Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory) device. It simulates the functionality and timing characteristics of a DDR3 memory, including command decoding, address handling, data read/write operations, and various timing checks. The module has input ports for control signals (rst_n, ck, ck_n, cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address inputs (ba, addr), and data mask/data strobe signals (dm_tdqs). It also has inout ports for data (dq) and data strobe (dqs, dqs_n) signals, and an output port for termination data strobe (tdqs_n). Internally, the module uses numerous signals to track timing parameters
