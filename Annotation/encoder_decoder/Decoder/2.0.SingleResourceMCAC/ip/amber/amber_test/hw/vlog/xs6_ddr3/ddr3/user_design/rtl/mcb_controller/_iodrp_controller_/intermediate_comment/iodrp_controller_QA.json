The module takes in memory cell addresses and data to write, and based on the control commands (read or write), it manages the data flow to and from the DRP. It employs finite state machine (FSM) logic to sequence through various phases like address phase, deciding phase, data gap phases and data phase to correctly manage the read/write operations. The data exchange is facilitated by using shift registers and conditional decision making based on the state of the controller, achieving a synchronous design operating under a DRP_CLK signal. It also handles synchronization reset conditions. The busy/ready status is communicated via the 'rdy_busy_n' output to indicate to an external system when the controller is ready or busy."
