    "spec": "Module name: cmd_prbs_gen. \n\nModule specification: The cmd_prbs_gen module, coded in Verilog, is designed to generate pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) based approach. This module accepts clock input (clk_i), a seed initialization signal (prbs_seed_init), a clock enable signal (clk_en), and a seed value (prbs_seed_i) as its **input ports**. It produces a pseudorandom binary sequence (prbs_o) as its **output port**. The internal workings of the module utilize several **internal signals** including ZEROS, used as a zero-value supplier for conditional computation; prbs, a register containing the current state of the binary sequence; and lfsr_q, a register storing the LFSR\u2019s computed values. The Verilog code is structured into several **blocks** handling LFSR operations for different configurations ('ADDRESS' with 64-bit and 32-bit, and 'INSTR' or 'BLEN' configurations). Each block adapts the LFSR behavior based on the PRBS_CMD and PRBS_WIDTH parameters that determine the operational mode and width of the PRBS. Additionally, the module contains operations dependent on specific FPGA family parameters (e.g., SPARTAN6) affecting how sequences are masked and shifted before being output. The code is comprehensive in managing the initialization of the LFSR with seeds, updating the sequence state contingent on control signals, and ensuring the final output sequence adheres to set configurations and environmental conditions such as signal masks.",

The module uses varying PRBS configurations depending on parameters such as PRBS_CMD and PRBS_WIDTH. For example, different LFSR tap configurations are implemented for different widths (64, 32, 20 bits), which are contingent upon the `PRBS_CMD` parameter specifying the type of PRBS generation, such as \"ADDRESS\", \"INSTR\", or \"BLEN\". The initial seed and continuation of the sequence can be controlled via the input signals. It also includes parameterized masks and addresses to manipulate bits based on certain conditions, and the entire functionality is dependent on the clock input to progress the shift register values.

It is used to drive the LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) operations synchronously.\n- prbs_seed_init: Seed Initialization input port. A high signal on this port initializes the LFSR register with the seed value provided on prbs_seed_i at the rising edge of clk_i.\n- clk_en: Clock Enable input port. This is a control signal used to enable the operation of the LFSR. The LFSR updates its contents only when this signal is high, enabling controlled operation of the sequence generation.\n- prbs_seed_i: PRBS Seed Input port.

                    "text": "Module name: cmd_prbs_gen. \n\nModule specification: The cmd_prbs_gen module, coded in Verilog, is designed to generate pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) based approach. This module accepts clock input (clk_i), a seed initialization signal (prbs_seed_init), a clock enable signal (clk_en), and a seed value (prbs_seed_i) as its **input ports**. It produces a pseudorandom binary sequence (prbs_o) as its **output port**. The internal workings of the module utilize several **internal signals** including ZEROS, used as a zero-value supplier for conditional computation; prbs, a register containing the current state of the binary sequence; and lfsr_q, a register storing the LFSR\u2019s computed values. The Verilog code is structured into several **blocks** handling LFSR operations for different configurations ('ADDRESS' with 64-bit and 32-bit, and 'INSTR' or 'BLEN' configurations). Each block adapts the LFSR behavior based on the PRBS_CMD and PRBS_WIDTH parameters that determine the operational mode and width of the PRBS. Additionally, the module contains operations dependent on specific FPGA family parameters (e.g., SPARTAN6) affecting how sequences are masked and shifted before being output. The code is comprehensive in managing the initialization of the LFSR with seeds, updating the sequence state contingent on control signals, and ensuring the final output sequence adheres to set configurations and environmental conditions such as signal masks."
