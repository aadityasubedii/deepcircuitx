    "spec": "Module name: sim_tb_top. Module specification: The \"sim_tb_top\" module functions as the top-level simulation testbench primarily designed for testing DDR3 memory interface behaviors. It sets up the system clock and reset controls, manages DDR3 signal interactions, and verifies memory operations through calibration and testing protocols. Input ports include `c3_sys_clk` and `c3_sys_rst` for system clock and reset signals respectively, alongside multiple DDR3 signal lines like `mcb3_dram_dq` (data lines), `mcb3_dram_a` (address lines), and control lines including `mcb3_dram_ras_n`, `mcb3_dram_cas_n`, and `mcb3_dram_we_n`. Output ports feature `error` indicating operation errors, `calib_done` showing the completion state of calibration, and `rzq3` used for impedance calibration. Internal signals such as `c3_sys_clk_p` and `c3_sys_clk_n` provide phase-aligned and phase-inverted clock signals, respectively, ensuring the module's synchronization fidelity. The Verilog implementation includes procedural blocks for generating continuous clock signals, initializing system resets, interfacing with the example DDR3 model (`example_top`), and housing a DDR3 model instantiation varied by number of DQ pins. It further includes behavioral simulation aspects where it logs and handles the state of calibration and operational correctness, providing essential pass/fail feedback based on the simulation results, ensuring a robust testing environment prior to hardware deployment.",

It is used for differential clocking purposes, where some subsystems or components may require an inverted clock for proper operation or for balancing the signal integrity.\n- `mcb3_dram_ck`: This is an internal wire connected to the memory model representing the memory clock line. It is crucial for timing memory operations such as data read/write and command execution in synchronization with the system clock.\n- `mcb3_dram_ck_n`: Similar to `mcb3_dram_ck`, this signal is the negated version and forms part of the differential pair used in DDR memory systems to enhance signal integrity and reduce electromagnetic interference.\n- `c3_sys_rst_i`: An internal version of the reset signal that is conditionally inverted based on the parameter `C3_RST_ACT_LOW` to match the active state expected by downstream logic.

It toggles between high and low and is essential for timing and synchronization.\n- `c3_sys_rst`: System reset input, active low based on the parameter setting. It initializes or resets the system states or memory interface.\n- `mcb3_dram_dq`: Data lines for the DDR3 RAM, used for data transfer to and from the memory device.\n- `mcb3_dram_a`: Address lines for DDR3 RAM, it specifies the memory address that is to be accessed or written to.\n- `mcb3_dram_ba`: Bank address lines for DDR3 RAM, used to select the specific bank within the memory where operations will take place.\n- `mcb3_dram_ras_n`, `mcb3_dram_cas_n`, `mcb3_dram_we_n`: Control lines for command issuance (Row Address Strobe, Column Address Strobe, Write Enable) to DDR3 RAM. They control the type of operation performed.\n- `mcb3_dram_odt`: On-die termination control line, it enables the termination resistors inside the DDR3 RAM.\n- `mcb3_dram_cke`: Clock enable line for DDR3 RAM, used to manage the clock signals to the memory.\n- `mcb3_dram_ck`, `mcb3_dram_ck_n`: Differential clock inputs to DDR3 RAM, used to time data and command inputs.\n- `mcb3_dram_dqs`, `mcb3_dram_dqs_n`, `mcb3_dram_udqs`, `mcb3_dram_udqs_n`: Data strobe signals which are used alongside the data lines to capture data based on their edges.\n- `mcb3_dram_udm`, `mcb3_dram_dm`: Data mask lines for DDR3 RAM; used during write operations to mask certain bits.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `error`\n- `calib_done`\n- `rzq3`\n\nExplanation:\n- `error`: Outputs a high signal when there is an error detected during the memory operations or calibration.\n- `calib_done`: Indicates when the calibration process of the DDR3 RAM has finished, signaling a ready state for memory operations.\n- `rzq3`: Connected to a pull-down resistor externally, used for impedance setting or calibration on the DDR3 RAM."

It maintains the same phase as `c3_sys_clk` and is used to forward the clock signal to sub-modules accurately, ensuring synchronized operations throughout the module.\n- `c3_sys_clk_n`: This signal is the inverted version of `c3_sys_clk` and complements `c3_sys_clk_p`. It is used for differential clocking purposes, where some subsystems or components may require an inverted clock for proper operation or for balancing the signal integrity.\n- `mcb3_dram_ck`: This is an internal wire connected to the memory model representing the memory clock line. It is crucial for timing memory operations such as data read/write and command execution in synchronization with the system clock.\n- `mcb3_dram_ck_n`: Similar to `mcb3_dram_ck`, this signal is the negated version and forms part of the differential pair used in DDR memory systems to enhance signal integrity and reduce electromagnetic interference.\n- `c3_sys_rst_i`: An internal version of the reset signal that is conditionally inverted based on the parameter `C3_RST_ACT_LOW` to match the active state expected by downstream logic. This ensures proper reset behavior across varying configurations or standards specified by different memory models or design requirements."

Module specification: The \"sim_tb_top\" module functions as the top-level simulation testbench primarily designed for testing DDR3 memory interface behaviors. It sets up the system clock and reset controls, manages DDR3 signal interactions, and verifies memory operations through calibration and testing protocols. Input ports include `c3_sys_clk` and `c3_sys_rst` for system clock and reset signals respectively, alongside multiple DDR3 signal lines like `mcb3_dram_dq` (data lines), `mcb3_dram_a` (address lines), and control lines including `mcb3_dram_ras_n`, `mcb3_dram_cas_n`, and `mcb3_dram_we_n`. Output ports feature `error` indicating operation errors, `calib_done` showing the completion state of calibration, and `rzq3` used for impedance calibration. Internal signals such as `c3_sys_clk_p` and `c3_sys_clk_n` provide phase-aligned and phase-inverted clock signals, respectively, ensuring the module's synchronization fidelity. The Verilog implementation includes procedural blocks for generating continuous clock signals, initializing system resets, interfacing with the example DDR3 model (`example_top`), and housing a DDR3 model instantiation varied by number of DQ pins. It further includes behavioral simulation aspects where it logs and handles the state of calibration and operational correctness, providing essential pass/fail feedback based on the simulation results, ensuring a robust testing environment prior to hardware deployment."
