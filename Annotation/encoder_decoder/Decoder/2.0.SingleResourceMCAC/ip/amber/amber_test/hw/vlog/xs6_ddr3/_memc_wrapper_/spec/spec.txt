Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: The memc_wrapper module is a comprehensive memory controller interface wrapper designed to provide a standardized interface for connecting multiple AXI and custom ports to a memory controller core. It supports up to six ports (p0 to p5) for command, write, and read operations, as well as six AXI interfaces (s0 to s5) for advanced memory access. The module handles various memory-related parameters, clock signals, and control signals. Key input ports include system clocks (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), PLL signals (pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, pll_lock), reset (async_rst), and individual port signals for command, write, and read operations. Output ports consist of memory interface signals (mcbx_dram_*), calibration status (calib_done), and port
