Module name: eth_fifo. 
Module specification: The 'eth_fifo' module performs as a FIFO (First In, First Out) memory buffer specialized for Ethernet applications, ideal for managing data flow efficiently. It is designed to handle write and read operations based on the respective control signals, ensuring data integrity even under simultaneous access conditions. The input ports include a clock signal 'clk', a reset signal 'reset', write and read signals, a clear condition 'clear', and 'data_in' where the data to be stored is inputted. The respective output ports are 'data_out', which outputs data read from the FIFO, and the status indicators 'almost_full', 'full', 'almost_empty', and 'empty', also including 'cnt' which tracks the number of items in the FIFO. Internal signals such as 'fifo' act as the storage array, 'data_out', 'cnt', 'read_pointer', and 'write_pointer' help in managing the data flow and interfacing with FIFO operations. The module includes separate code blocks for various operations like pointer management, data read and write operations, and flag assignments, each distinguished within conditional gate operations syncing to the positive edge of the clock and the reset state. The code also differentially configures the FIFO for specific FPGA families like Xilinx Spartan-6, utilizing distributed RAM where applicable, showing flexibility and compatibility of the module across different hardware implementations.
