This module generates various data patterns for memory testing and simulation. It supports address-based, PRBS, walking 1's and 0's, and neighbor patterns, configurable via parameters. The module uses a state machine to control data generation based on input signals and configuration. It implements pattern generation logic for different data widths and burst lengths, adapting to various numbers of DQ pins. The module includes a PRBS generator for pseudo-random patterns and logic for handling different data modes, address increments, and eye testing configurations.
