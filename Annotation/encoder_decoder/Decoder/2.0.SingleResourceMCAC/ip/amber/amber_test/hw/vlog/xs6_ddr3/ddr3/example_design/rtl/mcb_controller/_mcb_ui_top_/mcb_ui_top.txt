This module implements a top-level wrapper for a memory controller block (MCB) interface, supporting up to 6 ports configurable as native MCB or AXI interfaces. It integrates a raw MCB wrapper, AXI interfaces, and arbitration logic to manage memory operations. The module uses a BUFPLL_MCB for clock management, an mcb_raw_wrapper for core memory operations, and conditional instantiations of axi_mcb modules for AXI-to-MCB conversion. It handles clock synchronization, address translation, data routing, and provides status signals for memory operations and AXI transactions.
