    "module": "The 'eth_crc' module computes the Ethernet cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for error detection in network data packets, crucial for reliable communication. It calculates a 32-bit CRC based on 4-bit input data, controlled by enable, reset, and initialize signals, using a bitwise XOR operation determined by the defined polynomial. The CRC is updated every clock cycle, and an error flag is raised if the CRC does not match the expected value, indicating possible data corruption."
