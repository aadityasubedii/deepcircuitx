    "module": "The 'iodrp_mcb_controller' module controls DRAM interface operations for reading and writing to memory cells, ensuring correct timing and data integrity. It utilizes input conditions like command validity and mode selection, alongside internal registers and a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage data flow across various phases of operation\u2014addressing, data transfer, and read/write control\u2014driven by a synchronous clock and reset signals, with specialized tasks for data handling and output signal conditioning."
