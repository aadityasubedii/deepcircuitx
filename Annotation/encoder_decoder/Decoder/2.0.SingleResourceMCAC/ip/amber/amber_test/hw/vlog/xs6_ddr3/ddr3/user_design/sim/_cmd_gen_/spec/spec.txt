Module name: cmd_gen. Module specification: The cmd_gen module generates memory commands for a memory interface. It supports various address modes (BRAM, fixed, PRBS, sequential), instruction modes, and burst length modes. The module creates memory read/write commands with appropriate addresses, instructions, and burst lengths based on the selected modes and input parameters. It handles timing for refresh commands and manages the flow of read/write operations to ensure proper memory access. Input ports include clk_i (clock), rst_i (reset), run_traffic_i (enables command generation), rd_buff_avail_i (read buffer availability), force_wrcmd_gen_i (forces write command generation), start_addr_i and end_addr_i (address range), cmd_seed_i and data_seed_i (PRBS seeds), load_seed_i (seed loading trigger), addr_mode_i, data_
