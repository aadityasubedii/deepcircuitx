It integrates various sub-modules to handle Ethernet communication, including transmit and receive operations, MIIM (Management Interface) control, register management, and Wishbone bus interface. The module supports features such as flow control, address filtering, and collision detection. It interfaces with external PHY through MII (Media Independent Interface) signals and provides a Wishbone interface for host communication. The module also includes status monitoring and interrupt generation capabilities."
