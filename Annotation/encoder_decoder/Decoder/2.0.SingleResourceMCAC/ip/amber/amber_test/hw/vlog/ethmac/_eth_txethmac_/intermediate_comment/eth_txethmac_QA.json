It manages the process of sending Ethernet frames. The module handles multiple aspects of frame transmission, such as detecting collisions, managing retries, calculating CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check), handling under-run situations, padding frames, and managing minimum and maximum frame lengths. It essentially controls the timing, state transitions, and actions necessary to transmit Ethernet frames correctly over the network. This involves generating the correct preamble, handling frame delimiters like Start Frame Delimiter (SFD), and ensuring proper backoff strategies are implemented in case of network collisions. The module operates based on various control signals and configurations, adjusting its behavior to match the specific requirements and current conditions of the Ethernet network environment.\n"
