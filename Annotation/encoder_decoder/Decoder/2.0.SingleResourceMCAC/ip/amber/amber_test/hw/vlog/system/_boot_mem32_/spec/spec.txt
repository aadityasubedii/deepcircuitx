Module name: boot_mem32. Module specification: The `boot_mem32` module is a memory interface designed to interact with memory components using the Wishbone protocol, providing memory read and write capabilities tailored for different FPGA platforms. It features parameterizable data width (`WB_DWIDTH`), select width (`WB_SWIDTH`), and address width (`MADDR_WIDTH`). Inputs include a clock signal `i_wb_clk`, an address bus `i_wb_adr`, a byte select `i_wb_sel`, a write enable `i_wb_we`, a data bus for input data `i_wb_dat`, a cycle valid signal `i_wb_cyc`, and a strobe signal `i_wb_stb`. Outputs are the data bus for output data `o_wb_dat`, an acknowledge signal `o_wb_ack`, and an error signal `o_wb_err`. Internal signals such as `start_write`, `start_read`, and `jitter_r` manage the logic for initiating read and write operations and introducing debug-specific jitter in operation timings. The module encapsulates sections for debug configurations (`AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG`), integration with specific memory models (`XILINX_FPGA` and alternatives), and conditionally compiled sections for custom parameter inclusions or specific FPGA configurations like `XILINX_SPARTAN6_FPGA`. Each of these blocks and directives allows the module to be flexible and adaptable, suitable for various usage scenarios and debug settings, bridging the architectural gap between software and hardware in FPGA-based systems.
