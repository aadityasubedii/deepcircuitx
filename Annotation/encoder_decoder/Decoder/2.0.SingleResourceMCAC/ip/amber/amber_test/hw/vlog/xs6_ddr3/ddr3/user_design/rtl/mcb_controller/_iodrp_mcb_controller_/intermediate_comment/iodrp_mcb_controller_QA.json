It handles the address and data phases of the operation based on input commands and DRP clock. The module supports conditional compilation configurations for alternate reading strategies and addresses errors or specific conditions using different address encodings. It operates asynchronously to the input signal edge, manages the state of the read/write operations through a finite state machine (FSM), and consistently updates outputs based on the current state and input conditions. Additionaly, it includes multiplexing logic for data output based on a configuration option, and efficiently handles shift operations and signal generation to interface with the DRP bus and memory control blocks.\n"
