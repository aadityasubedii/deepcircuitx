    "module": "This Verilog code defines the configuration parameters and settings for an Ethernet module, typically used in FPGA-based networking hardware. It sets up constants and default values for operational modes, addresses, memory mapping, and FIFO configurations required for Ethernet operations. These configurations ensure standardized device functionality and performance without specifying actual signal handling or operational logic, thus serving as a foundational setup for detailed module implementations elsewhere in the project."
