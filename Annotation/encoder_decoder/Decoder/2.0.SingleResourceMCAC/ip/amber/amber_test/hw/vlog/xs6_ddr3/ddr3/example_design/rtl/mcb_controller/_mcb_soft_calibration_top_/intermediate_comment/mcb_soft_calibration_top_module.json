    "module": "The mcb_soft_calibration_top module manages soft calibration for DDR-type memory controllers, enhancing signal integrity and timing through parametric flexibility and condition-based instantiation. It utilizes input and output ports for synchronization, control, and data handling, alongside internal signals for interfacing with IODRP, RZQ, and ZIO components. Calibration is facilitated via configurable parameters and dynamic condition checks within generate blocks and instantiated sub-modules, ensuring adaptable and optimized memory operations."
