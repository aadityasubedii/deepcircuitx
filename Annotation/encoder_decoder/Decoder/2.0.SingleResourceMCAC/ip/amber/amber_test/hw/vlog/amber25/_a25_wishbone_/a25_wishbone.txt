The `a25_wishbone` module arbitrates Wishbone bus access among three ports, handling their requests, acknowledgments, and data transactions. It utilizes a combination of input and output ports to receive requests and deliver data, control signals to manage bus transactions, and internal buffers to temporarily store transaction data. The module determines active transactions based on bus availability and handles data transfer through instantiated sub-modules for each port, ensuring coordinated read and write operations on the bus.
