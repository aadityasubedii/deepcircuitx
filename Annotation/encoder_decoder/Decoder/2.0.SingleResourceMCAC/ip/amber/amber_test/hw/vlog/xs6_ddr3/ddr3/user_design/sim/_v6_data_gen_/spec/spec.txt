Module name: v6_data_gen. Module specification: This module is a data generation unit for memory testing or simulation purposes. It generates various data patterns based on the DATA_PATTERN parameter, including address-based, PRBS, walking 1's and 0's, and neighbor patterns. The module supports different data widths and burst lengths, adapting to various numbers of DQ pins. Input ports include clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), PRBS seed (prbs_fseed_i), data mode (data_mode_i), data ready (data_rdy_i), command start signals (cmd_startA/B/C/D/E), memory address (m_addr_i), fixed data (fixed_data_i), address (addr_i), user burst count (user_burst_cnt), and FIFO ready (fifo_rdy_i). The sole output
