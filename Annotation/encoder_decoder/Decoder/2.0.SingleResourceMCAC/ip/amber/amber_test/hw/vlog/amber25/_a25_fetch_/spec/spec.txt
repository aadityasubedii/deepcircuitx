Module name: a25_fetch. 
Module specification: The a25_fetch module is a critical component in a processor, specifically designed for fetching instructions from memory or cache, based on the cachability and validity of the address. It handles inputs like the clock (`clk`), reset (`reset`), and various control and status signals (e.g., `scan_enable`, `test_mode`, `i_mem_stall`, `i_exec_stall`, `i_conflict`, and `i_system_rdy`). These inputs control the behaviors and responses of the module by synchronizing operations, determining the operational mode, and managing stalls and readiness status. The instruction address and its properties are given through `i_iaddress`, `i_iaddress_valid`, `i_iaddress_nxt`, and `i_cacheable_area`. Outputs from this module include `o_fetch_stall`, which indicates if there is a fetching stall, `o_fetch_instruction`, which provides the fetched instruction, and both `o_wb_req` and `o_wb_address` control memory operations in the case of cache misses. The internal signals such as `core_stall`, `cache_stall`, `sel_cache`, `uncached_instruction_read`, and others, manage the data flow and control within the module ensuring proper operation during cache hits or misses and fetching from the memory when required. This is accompanied by an instantiated cache module (`a25_icache`), which regulates interactions with the instruction cache. This setup ensures that the processor efficiently retrieves and executes instructions, maintaining optimized performance and responsiveness of the system.
