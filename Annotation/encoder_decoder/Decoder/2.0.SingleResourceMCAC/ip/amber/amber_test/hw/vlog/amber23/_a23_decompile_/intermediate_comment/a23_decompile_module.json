    "module": "This module decompiles and logs executed instructions for an ARM-like processor. It decodes incoming instructions, tracks execution, handles interrupts, and writes human-readable representations to a file. The module processes various input signals, including instruction data, execution status, and interrupt information. It uses internal signals for instruction decoding and maintains execution state. The implementation includes blocks for instruction decoding, execution tracking, interrupt handling, and file writing, providing detailed logs of the processor's execution flow for debugging and analysis purposes."
