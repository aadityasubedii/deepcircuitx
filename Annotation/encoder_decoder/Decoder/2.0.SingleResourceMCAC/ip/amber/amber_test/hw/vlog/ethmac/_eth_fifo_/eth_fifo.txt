The 'eth_fifo' module implements a FIFO buffer for Ethernet applications, managing data flow with synchronized read and write operations. It features input ports for data handling and control signals, and outputs both data and status indicatorsâ€”like 'full' and 'empty'. Internally, the module utilizes counters, pointers, and conditional logic to track and manage FIFO state, supporting different FPGA configurations, which optimize its memory usage and access efficiency.
