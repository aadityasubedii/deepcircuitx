    "spec": "Module name: a23_wishbone. Module specification: The `a23_wishbone` module interfaces with the Wishbone bus protocol, handling read and write transactions for embedded systems. It synchronizes these operations using the input clock signal `i_clk`. The input ports include `i_select` to initiate transactions, `i_write_data` for data to be written, `i_write_enable` to differentiate read and write actions, `i_byte_enable` which indicates the active bytes during data transfers, and `i_address` specifying the data's bus destination. Important inputs like `i_cache_req`, `i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_ack`, and `i_wb_err` manage cache requests, incoming data, transaction acknowledgments, and error signals respectively. Output ports feature `o_stall` to signal when the module is busy, `o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we` for address, byte select, and write-enable signals on the Wishbone bus, and `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_cyc`, `o_wb_stb` handling data output and transaction timing signals. Internal signals such as `wishbone_st` monitors transaction states, `core_read_request`, `core_write_request`, `cache_read_request`, and `cache_write_request` ascertain the type of request being processed. `start_access` signal initiates Wishbone bus access, with `servicing_cache` and `exclusive_access` managing cache interactions and exclusive transaction requirements. The code structure includes initialization of internal and output registers; decision-making logic to handle data transactions, manage bus wait-states, and control transaction sequences through a state machine; and separate always blocks for data setup, bus transaction control, and state transitions. This detailed architecture ensures efficient data handling and protocol adherence within the module.",

It manages read and write operations on the Wishbone bus based on input signals such as data requests, exclusive access requests, and addresses. The module handles different states of a request, including idle, burst transfers, and waiting for acknowledgments, ensuring correct timings and operations in a synchronous manner using an input clock. It also includes logic to handle stalls, data buffering, and byte enable signals for partial data writes and reads. This module effectively allows a core or cache to interface with external memory or peripherals using the standardized Wishbone protocol."

It synchronizes these operations using the input clock signal `i_clk`. The input ports include `i_select` to initiate transactions, `i_write_data` for data to be written, `i_write_enable` to differentiate read and write actions, `i_byte_enable` which indicates the active bytes during data transfers, and `i_address` specifying the data's bus destination. Important inputs like `i_cache_req`, `i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_ack`, and `i_wb_err` manage cache requests, incoming data, transaction acknowledgments, and error signals respectively. Output ports feature `o_stall` to signal when the module is busy, `o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we` for address, byte select, and write-enable signals on the Wishbone bus, and `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_cyc`, `o_wb_stb` handling data output and transaction timing signals. Internal signals such as `wishbone_st` monitors transaction states, `core_read_request`, `core_write_request`, `cache_read_request`, and `cache_write_request` ascertain the type of request being processed. `start_access` signal initiates Wishbone bus access, with `servicing_cache` and `exclusive_access` managing cache interactions and exclusive transaction requirements. The code structure includes initialization of internal and output registers; decision-making logic to handle data transactions, manage bus wait-states, and control transaction sequences through a state machine; and separate always blocks for data setup, bus transaction control, and state transitions. This detailed architecture ensures efficient data handling and protocol adherence within the module."

It manages read and write operations on the Wishbone bus based on input signals such as data requests, exclusive access requests, and addresses. The module handles different states of a request, including idle, burst transfers, and waiting for acknowledgments, ensuring correct timings and operations in a synchronous manner using an input clock. It also includes logic to handle stalls, data buffering, and byte enable signals for partial data writes and reads. This module effectively allows a core or cache to interface with external memory or peripherals using the standardized Wishbone protocol."

Module specification: The `a23_wishbone` module interfaces with the Wishbone bus protocol, handling read and write transactions for embedded systems. It synchronizes these operations using the input clock signal `i_clk`. The input ports include `i_select` to initiate transactions, `i_write_data` for data to be written, `i_write_enable` to differentiate read and write actions, `i_byte_enable` which indicates the active bytes during data transfers, and `i_address` specifying the data's bus destination. Important inputs like `i_cache_req`, `i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_ack`, and `i_wb_err` manage cache requests, incoming data, transaction acknowledgments, and error signals respectively. Output ports feature `o_stall` to signal when the module is busy, `o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we` for address, byte select, and write-enable signals on the Wishbone bus, and `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_cyc`, `o_wb_stb` handling data output and transaction timing signals. Internal signals such as `wishbone_st` monitors transaction states, `core_read_request`, `core_write_request`, `cache_read_request`, and `cache_write_request` ascertain the type of request being processed. `start_access` signal initiates Wishbone bus access, with `servicing_cache` and `exclusive_access` managing cache interactions and exclusive transaction requirements. The code structure includes initialization of internal and output registers; decision-making logic to handle data transactions, manage bus wait-states, and control transaction sequences through a state machine; and separate always blocks for data setup, bus transaction control, and state transitions. This detailed architecture ensures efficient data handling and protocol adherence within the module."
