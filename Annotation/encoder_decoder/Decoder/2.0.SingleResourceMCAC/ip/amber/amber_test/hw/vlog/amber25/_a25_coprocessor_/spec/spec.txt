Module name: a25_coprocessor. 
Module specification: The `a25_coprocessor` module is a control unit specifically designed to handle cache operations and fault management in conjunction with a core processor, operating synchronously with a clock signal. It manages input signals such as operational codes, register identifiers, and write data for coprocessor operation, along with fault status and address when faults occur. The module has input ports like `clk` (clock), `reset` (system reset), `scan_enable`, and `test_mode` for operational mode control, `i_core_stall` for pausing operations, opcode inputs (`i_copro_opcode1`, `i_copro_opcode2`), register specifiers (`i_copro_crn`, `i_copro_crm`, `i_copro_num`), and operation type (`i_copro_operation`). It also includes data inputs like `i_copro_write_data`, `i_fault`, `i_fault_status`, and `i_fault_address`. Output ports include `o_copro_read_data` for reading data from registers, and signals `o_cache_enable`, `o_cache_flush`, and `o_cacheable_area` for cache control. Internally, the module uses registers like `cache_control`, `cacheable_area`, `updateable_area`, `disruptive_area`, `fault_status`, `fault_address` to manage states and configurations, and a wire `copro15_reg1_write` to determine cache flushing. The Verilog code is structured into several always blocks and assigns to handle synchronous reset and clock operations, fault handling, cache and memory area management, and debug functionalities controlled by ifdef guards for optional detailed verbose output aiding in debug and testing scenarios. Each component and signal explicitly supports the efficient operational management and debugging of the coprocessor functionality intertwined with the core processing unit.
