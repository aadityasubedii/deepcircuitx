Module name: a25_decompile. Module specification: The a25_decompile module is a Verilog implementation of a decompiler for an ARM-like processor, designed to generate human-readable disassembly of instructions for debugging purposes. It takes various input signals related to instruction execution, including clock, reset, instruction data, and control signals. The module doesn't have explicit output ports; instead, it writes the decompiled instructions to a file. Internally, it uses signals such as imm32, reg_n, opcode, and itype to decode and process instructions. The module is structured into several blocks: instruction decoding, execution tracking, interrupt handling, and output formatting. It decodes different instruction types (e.g., REGOP, TRANS, BRANCH), formats them with their corresponding arguments, and writes the disassembled instructions to a file. The module also captures and reports on interrupts,
