Module name: a25_mem.
Module specification: The a25_mem module is designed to handle memory management in a system, interfacing with both the cache and main memory. It orchestrates read/write operations, deciding on whether to operate directly on the memory or utilize the cache based on the cachability of the address and other conditions. The input ports include `clk` and `reset` for maintaining synchronization and resetting states respectively, alongside data-specific ports like `i_daddress` for data addresses, `i_write_data` for data to be written, and control signals like `i_write_enable` for enabling write operations. Output ports such as `o_mem_stall` signal stalling during memory operations, and `o_mem_read_data` outputs the data read from memory. Internal signals such as `sel_cache` determine cache usage, `uncached_data_access` for direct memory access, and `mem_read_data_c` which holds the current data being read, facilitate the control of data flow and operational logic. The module includes a sub-module `a25_dcache` that deals with lower-level cache operations, and the main Verilog code incorporates registers for state retention across clock cycles, conditional operations based on stall detection, and data path selections based on operational states ensuring efficient and responsive memory management. Overall, this module effectively balances direct memory access and cached operations, adapts to stalling, and coordinates with cache strategies to optimize system performance.
