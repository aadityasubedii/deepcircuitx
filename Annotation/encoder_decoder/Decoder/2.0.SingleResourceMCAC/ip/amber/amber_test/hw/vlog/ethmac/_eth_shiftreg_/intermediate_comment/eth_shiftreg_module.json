    "module": "The eth_shiftreg module serves as a shift register optimized for Ethernet-related applications, particularly in managing MDIO protocols for PHY devices. It processes input data and controls based on clock signals, managing operations through signals like the data input (Mdi), address inputs (Fiad, Rgad), control data (CtrlData), and operation flags (WriteOp, ByteSelect, LatchByte). The internal logic uses conditional structures to shift or latch data into storage registers (ShiftReg, Prsd) and monitor link integrity (LinkFail). The module ensures serialized output of data through the ShiftedBit port and offers precise control over how data is handled within Ethernet configurations."
