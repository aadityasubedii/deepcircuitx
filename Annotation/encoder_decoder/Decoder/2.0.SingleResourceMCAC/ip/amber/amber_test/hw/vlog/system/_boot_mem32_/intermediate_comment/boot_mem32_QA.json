It has parameterizable data width, select width, and address width, and can be adapted for different configurations and FPGA platforms. The module uses flags and conditions to manage memory access, such as `start_write` and `start_read`, and integrates with optional jitter control for debugging purposes. It communicates with a memory component (either specific to Xilinx FPGA or a more generic version), passing through necessary signals for data operations. Additionally, it employs conditionally compiled sections for debugging and platform-specific configurations."

Used for timing all operations and state transitions inside the module.\n- `i_wb_adr`: Address bus input. Used to specify the memory address for the read or write operation.\n- `i_wb_sel`: Byte select input. Allows operations to be performed on selective bytes of the data bus.\n- `i_wb_we`: Write enable input. Indicates whether the current Wishbone cycle is a write operation.\n- `i_wb_dat`: Data bus input. Carries the data to be written to memory during write operations.\n- `i_wb_cyc`: Cycle valid input. Indicates that a valid Wishbone transfer is in progress.\n- `i_wb_stb`: Strobe input. Asserted for the duration of a valid data transfer or access.\n\nOutput ports: `o_wb_dat, o_wb_ack, o_wb_err`.\nExplanation:\n- `o_wb_dat`: Data bus output. Used to transfer data from memory to the master during read operations.\n- `o_wb_ack`: Acknowledge output. Indicates completion of a successful read or write operation.\n- `o_wb_err`: Error output. Indicates an error condition in the transaction. It is statically assigned to zero in the provided module, suggesting no error reporting implemented.\n"

It becomes active when: there's an active strobe signal (`i_wb_stb`), the write control signal is high (`i_wb_we`), and there's no pending read operation (`|start_read_r` not active). For debugging configurations (`AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG` defined), it also depends on the state of `jitter_r[0]`.\n\n- `start_read`: This signal is used to start a memory read operation. It is activated when there's an active strobe signal (`i_wb_stb`), and the write control signal (`i_wb_we`) is low and there's no active read-start signal (`start_read_r`).\n\n- `jitter_r`: This is a debug-specific register used for introducing a controlled jitter or variation in the read operations to test the robustness of the system under varying conditions. This register continuously cycles through a sequence defined by xor-ing several bits of itself.\n\n- `start_read_r`: This signal holds the state of `start_read` across clock cycles to manage the timing and lifecycle of read operations. In debug configurations, this behaves as a shift register extending the read initiation over multiple cycles, otherwise, it simply retains the read starting condition.\n\n- `read_data`: This is the data retrieved from the memory in response to a read operation. Controlled by the memory component interfacing logic.\n\n- `write_data`: This signal carries the data to be written into memory during a write operation. It is directly connected to the input data bus (`i_wb_dat`).\n\n- `byte_enable`: Derived from the byte select input (`i_wb_sel`), this signal controls which bytes of the data bus are active during a write operation, allowing partial updates of the data width.\n\n- `address`: The memory address signal derived from the address bus input (`i_wb_adr`). It's truncated or modified to fit the memory address width specified by `MADDR_WIDTH`. This modified address is used for accessing the actual memory location."
