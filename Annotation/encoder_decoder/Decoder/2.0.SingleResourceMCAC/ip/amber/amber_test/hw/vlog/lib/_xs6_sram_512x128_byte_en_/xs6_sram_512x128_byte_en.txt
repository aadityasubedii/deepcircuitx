This module implements a 512x128-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality for Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGAs. It uses four RAMB16BWER primitives to create a 128-bit wide memory with 512 addresses, supporting byte-level write operations through a 16-bit byte enable signal. The module includes input ports for clock, write data, write enable, address, and byte enable, with an output port for read data. It allows initialization of memory contents through parameters and generates internal write enable signals for each byte of the four RAMB16BWER primitives.
