Module name: data_prbs_gen.

Module specification: The `data_prbs_gen` module is designed to generate a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) employing Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) logic. This module supports a parameterizable PRBS and seed width and can be initialized with a fixed or dynamically provided seed. Utilizing input ports such as `clk_i` for the clock signal, `clk_en` for enabling or disabling PRBS generation, `rst_i` for reset, `prbs_fseed_i` for providing a fixed 32-bit initialization seed, `prbs_seed_init` for triggering seed reinitialization, and `prbs_seed_i` for a dynamic seed input, the module offers flexible control over the PRBS generation. The output is delivered via the `prbs_o` port, showing the pseudo-random sequence generated. Internally, the module uses two significant registers: `prbs`, which holds the current pseudo-random sequence outputted, and `lfsr_q`, which maintains the state of the LFSR used in PRBS generation. The Verilog code includes two primary always blocks: the first block handles the LFSR updating based on the clock signal, seed inputs, and reset signal, implementing specific feedback logic for sequence generation; the second block is responsible for assigning the current state of `lfsr_q` (minus its most significant bit) to `prbs`, which is then outputted. This comprehensive setup allows for robust control and generation of pseudo-random binary sequences, making it suitable for various applications requiring PRBS, such as testing and communication systems.
