    "spec": "Module name: main_mem. \n\nModule specification: The `main_mem` module simulates main memory functionalities for systems using the Wishbone bus protocol. It's capable of handling data read and write operations with parameterizable data and selection widths. Key inputs include `i_clk` (system clock), `i_mem_ctrl` (memory control signal), `i_wb_adr` (Wishbone address input), `i_wb_sel` (byte select lines), `i_wb_we` (write enable), `i_wb_dat` (data input), `i_wb_cyc` (transaction cycle), and `i_wb_stb` (transaction strobe). The module outputs are `o_wb_dat` (data output), `o_wb_ack` (acknowledge signal), and `o_wb_err` (error status). Internal signals include `ram` (the memory storage), and signals like `start_write` and `start_read` which control the initiation of write and read operations, respectively, along with their respective delay signals. `masked_wdata`, `wr_en`, `wr_mask`, `wr_data`, and `addr_d1` orchestrate data manipulation and storage, addressing how data is written or read from the memory. Based on the configured data width (`WB_DWIDTH`), the module accommodates either 128-bit or 32-bit operations using either `wb_rdata128` or `wb_rdata32` with corresponding conditionally compiled generate blocks managing the operations relative to the data bus size. This setup ensures flexibility and configurability to adapt to different system requirements.",

It's capable of handling data read and write operations with parameterizable data and selection widths. Key inputs include `i_clk` (system clock), `i_mem_ctrl` (memory control signal), `i_wb_adr` (Wishbone address input), `i_wb_sel` (byte select lines), `i_wb_we` (write enable), `i_wb_dat` (data input), `i_wb_cyc` (transaction cycle), and `i_wb_stb` (transaction strobe). The module outputs are `o_wb_dat` (data output), `o_wb_ack` (acknowledge signal), and `o_wb_err` (error status). Internal signals include `ram` (the memory storage), and signals like `start_write` and `start_read` which control the initiation of write and read operations, respectively, along with their respective delay signals. `masked_wdata`, `wr_en`, `wr_mask`, `wr_data`, and `addr_d1` orchestrate data manipulation and storage, addressing how data is written or read from the memory. Based on the configured data width (`WB_DWIDTH`), the module accommodates either 128-bit or 32-bit operations using either `wb_rdata128` or `wb_rdata32` with corresponding conditionally compiled generate blocks managing the operations relative to the data bus size. This setup ensures flexibility and configurability to adapt to different system requirements."
