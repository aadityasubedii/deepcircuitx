    "spec": "Module name: `generic_sram_byte_en`.\nModule specification: The `generic_sram_byte_en` is a parameterized SRAM module with byte enable features that supports selective byte updating during write operations, suitable for versatile memory interactions in digital systems. It operates based on a `DATA_WIDTH` for the size of data and an `ADDRESS_WIDTH` for memory addressing, storing data in the internal `mem` array. Input ports include `reset` and `clk` for handling memory initialization and data transactions on rising clock edges, `test_mode` and `scan_enable` with `scan_in0` through `scan_in4` for integrating into a scan chain testing structure, `i_write_data` for data to be written to memory, `i_write_enable` as a control signal governing writing actions, and `i_address` with `i_byte_enable` for specifying memory addresses and enabling specific byte updates respectively. Output ports feature `scan_out0` through `scan_out4` to propagate scan testing data and `o_read_data`, which either delivers stored data or zeros depending upon whether a write operation is active. Internal signals `i` and `j` serve as loop indices for byte-wise data manipulation during write operations and memory initialization on reset. The core functionality comprises an `always` block that manages data write conditions, memory initialization during reset, and ensuring output data reflects current memory state post-write operations, improving the module\u2019s operational integrity and flexibility in memory management.",

It uses a parameterized data and address width to define the memory space, and it supports conditional initialization of memory data to zero or one based on a parameter. The module handles written data through byte enable lines, allowing selective updating of bytes within data memory. On each positive clock edge, if the reset is active, it initializes output data and the memory either to zeros or it can be set based on a parameter. If there is no reset, it either provides output read data from memory or passes zeros if a write operation is designated. The module supports writing selective bytes to memory locations dictated by the byte enable signals, thus enhancing the flexibility of memory interaction."

The `scan_inN` ports are inputs used to potentially chain this module into a larger scan test structure.\n  - `i_write_data`: Input data that is potentially written to memory.\n  - `i_write_enable`: Control signal to enable writing the input data to memory.\n  - `i_address`: The memory address at which data writing or reading actions are targeted.\n  - `i_byte_enable`: Control signal that specifies which bytes in the `i_write_data` should be written to the memory.\n\nOutput ports:\n- scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4, o_read_data.\nExplanation:\n  - `scan_out0`, `scan_out1`, `scan_out2`, `scan_out3`, `scan_out4`: Output ports to output scan chain data when this module is used in a scan chain setup.\n  - `o_read_data`: Output port which either outputs data from memory if no active write operation occurs, or outputs zeros if a write operation is being performed.
