Module name: sim_tb_top. Module specification: The "sim_tb_top" module functions as the top-level simulation testbench primarily designed for testing DDR3 memory interface behaviors. It sets up the system clock and reset controls, manages DDR3 signal interactions, and verifies memory operations through calibration and testing protocols. Input ports include `c3_sys_clk` and `c3_sys_rst` for system clock and reset signals respectively, alongside multiple DDR3 signal lines like `mcb3_dram_dq` (data lines), `mcb3_dram_a` (address lines), and control lines including `mcb3_dram_ras_n`, `mcb3_dram_cas_n`, and `mcb3_dram_we_n`. Output ports feature `error` indicating operation errors, `calib_done` showing the completion state of calibration, and `rzq3` used for impedance calibration. Internal signals such as `c3_sys_clk_p` and `c3_sys_clk_n` provide phase-aligned and phase-inverted clock signals, respectively, ensuring the module's synchronization fidelity. The Verilog implementation includes procedural blocks for generating continuous clock signals, initializing system resets, interfacing with the example DDR3 model (`example_top`), and housing a DDR3 model instantiation varied by number of DQ pins. It further includes behavioral simulation aspects where it logs and handles the state of calibration and operational correctness, providing essential pass/fail feedback based on the simulation results, ensuring a robust testing environment prior to hardware deployment.
