This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM device, modeling its functionality and timing characteristics. It implements command decoding, address handling, data read/write operations, and timing checks. The module uses a state machine to track bank status, processes incoming commands, and manages internal operations such as refresh and power-down modes. It performs extensive timing violation checks to ensure compliance with DDR3 specifications. The module also simulates data transfer, including write leveling, and implements on-die termination. It uses pipelines to handle command and data timing, and includes debug features for monitoring and reporting errors.
