Module name: rd_data_gen.
Module specification: The `rd_data_gen` module is designed for generating read data in FPGA-based memory systems, supporting different families like SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6. This module receives synchronization and control inputs such as a clock signal (`clk_i`), reset controls (`rst_i`), PRBS feed seed (`prbs_fseed_i`), data mode (`data_mode_i`), and other controls related to data and command handling. It outputs signals indicating command readiness (`cmd_rdy_o`), the validity of the last word in a burst (`last_word_o`), whether the user burst count is one (`user_bl_cnt_is_1_o`), validity of data (`data_valid_o`), and data itself (`data_o`). The internal signals like `prbs_data`, `cmd_start`, and several data handling registers (`adata`, `hdata` etc.) manage data generation, stage data internally, and control module states, such as command readiness and data validity. The Verilog code includes conditional compilation blocks for SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6, each tailored to handle data operations specific to these FPGA families. Additional code sections manage command initiation, burst counting, and reset behaviors to maintain operational integrity and synchronization. This setup allows seamless transitioning of data states, command processing, and appropriate interfacing with external memory or processing modules.
