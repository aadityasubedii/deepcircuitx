Typically used in test modes for shifting data.\n- `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`: Serial input ports for test data, usually used in scan chains for Design for Test (DFT).\n- `i_write_data`: Data input for writing into the memory.\n- `i_write_enable`: Control input that enables the write operation to the memory when high.\n- `i_address`: Address input for accessing specific memory location.\n\nOutput ports: scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4, o_read_data. \n\nExplanation: \n- `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`: Serial output ports for test data, typically part of scan chains used in DFT.\n- `o_read_data`: Output port where the data read from memory is placed; its content depends on the address specified by `i_address` and whether writing is enabled or not."

It simulates the actual storage of the SRAM module. Each index of this array can store a bit-width defined by `DATA_WIDTH`, and the total entries are `2^ADDRESS_WIDTH`. It is used to hold the data which can be written to or read from, depending on the module's operations.\n- `i`: This is an integer variable used as an index for iterating through the memory array `mem` during the initialization process.
