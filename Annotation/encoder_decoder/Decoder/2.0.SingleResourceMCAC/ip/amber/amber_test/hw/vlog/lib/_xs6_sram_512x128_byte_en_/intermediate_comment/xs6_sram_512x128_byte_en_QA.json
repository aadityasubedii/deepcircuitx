It uses four RAMB16BWER primitives to create a 128-bit wide memory with 512 addresses. The module supports byte-level write operations through a 16-bit byte enable signal, allowing selective writing to specific bytes within each 128-bit word. The memory is initialized using parameters for each SRAM block, providing flexibility for pre-loading data. The module has inputs for clock, write data, write enable, address, and byte enable, and outputs the read data."
