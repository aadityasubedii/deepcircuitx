It utilizes a memory block (RAMB8BWER) to perform read and write operations. The input signals include a clock (i_clk), write data (i_write_data), write enable (i_write_enable), address (i_address), and byte enable (i_byte_enable). The output signal is the read data (o_read_data). The module also features parameter checks for data width and address width to ensure they are set to the correct predefined values. The memory write operation is conditioned by both the write enable and byte enable signals to allow selective writing to specific byte lanes within the 32-bit data width."
