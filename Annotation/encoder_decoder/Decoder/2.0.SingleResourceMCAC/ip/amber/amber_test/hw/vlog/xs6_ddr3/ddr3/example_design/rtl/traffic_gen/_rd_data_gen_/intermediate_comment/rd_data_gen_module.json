    "module": "The `rd_data_gen` module generates read data for FPGA-based memory and data processing applications, configurable for SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6 families. It processes input configurations like burst length and data width using a combination of internal signal management, pipelined signal processing, conditional logic specific to FPGA family, and integrational data generation blocks, ensuring synchronization and operational stability according to the dynamic input conditions and command validations."
