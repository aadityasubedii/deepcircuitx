The `eth_maccontrol` module handles MAC layer operations for an Ethernet interface, managing the transmission and reception of Ethernet frames. It leverages input signals for data processing and flow control alongside internal logic to ensure synchronization and error management. Specific sub-modules `eth_receivecontrol` and `eth_transmitcontrol` are integrated for detailed handling of incoming and outgoing data, utilizing internal signals and state machines to manage frame lifecycle, control frame emission, and to ensure compliance with Ethernet standards.
