Module name: eth_outputcontrol. Module specification: The 'eth_outputcontrol' module is crucial for managing Ethernet data transmission in terms of output control. Specifically, the module regulates the signals Mdo (data output) and MdoEn (enable signal for Mdo), based on the state of transmission activities. Input ports include Clk (clock signal for synchronization), Reset (to initialize internal states), InProgress (status of ongoing transmission), ShiftedBit (next bit to be transmitted), BitCounter (tracks the number of bits processed), WriteOp (defines operation mode), NoPre (controls preamble inclusion), and MdcEn_n (clock enable signal). The primary output ports are Mdo (transmits bits) and MdoEn (enables Mdo). Internally, the module utilizes several signals such as SerialEn (enables serial transmission) and register stages like MdoEn_2d, MdoEn_d (delay elements for MdoEn), Mdo_2d, and Mdo_d (delay elements for Mdo) to handle timing and logic requirements. The Verilog code is structured into two main blocks: the first is focused on the processing of enabling signals (MdoEn and its delays) triggered by clock and reset events, while the other handles the actual data output (Mdo) and its delays, abiding by Ethernet transmission protocols and timing requirements set by the module's logic and state registers.
