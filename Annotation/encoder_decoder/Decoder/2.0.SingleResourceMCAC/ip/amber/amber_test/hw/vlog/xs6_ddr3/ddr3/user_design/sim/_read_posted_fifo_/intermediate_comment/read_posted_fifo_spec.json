    "spec": "Module name: read_posted_fifo. \n\nModule specification: The `read_posted_fifo` module in Verilog is designed to manage read operations from a FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer, detailing synchronous data storage and retrieval based on clock signals. The module accommodates inputs like a clock (`clk_i`), reset (`rst_i`), command validity (`cmd_valid_i`), data validity (`data_valid_i`), address (`addr_i`), burst length (`bl_i`), and signals indicating the state of command and data handling (`user_bl_cnt_is_1`, `cmd_sent`, `bl_sent`, `cmd_en_i`, `gen_rdy_i`, `rd_mdata_fifo_empty`). Outputs include command readiness (`cmd_rdy_o`), data generation validity (`gen_valid_o`), generated address and burst length (`gen_addr_o`, `gen_bl_o`), buffer availability (`rd_buff_avail_o`), and metadata read enable signal (`rd_mdata_en`).\n\nInternally, the module utilizes registers and flags such as `empty_r`, `rd_first_data`, `full`, `empty`, `wr_en`, `rd_en`, `data_valid_r`, `user_bl_cnt_not_1`, `buf_avail_r`, `rd_data_received_counts`, `rd_data_counts_asked`, `dfifo_has_enough_room`, `wait_cnt`, `wait_done`, `dfifo_has_enough_room_d1` to manage FIFO states, data read/write operations, wait states, and to ensure data integrity and the availability of buffer space.\n\nThe module's code is structured into blocks handling initial conditions and defaults, command readiness checks, logic for calculating available buffer space, data and command processing logic, and FIFO interfacing (through an instantiated FIFO block managing data inputs and outputs). This enables the module to efficiently manage and signal data and command processing readiness, consider family and burst length specifics, and dynamically adjust its operation based on internal states and external inputs.",

The module accommodates inputs like a clock (`clk_i`), reset (`rst_i`), command validity (`cmd_valid_i`), data validity (`data_valid_i`), address (`addr_i`), burst length (`bl_i`), and signals indicating the state of command and data handling (`user_bl_cnt_is_1`, `cmd_sent`, `bl_sent`, `cmd_en_i`, `gen_rdy_i`, `rd_mdata_fifo_empty`). Outputs include command readiness (`cmd_rdy_o`), data generation validity (`gen_valid_o`), generated address and burst length (`gen_addr_o`, `gen_bl_o`), buffer availability (`rd_buff_avail_o`), and metadata read enable signal (`rd_mdata_en`).\n\nInternally, the module utilizes registers and flags such as `empty_r`, `rd_first_data`, `full`, `empty`, `wr_en`, `rd_en`, `data_valid_r`, `user_bl_cnt_not_1`, `buf_avail_r`, `rd_data_received_counts`, `rd_data_counts_asked`, `dfifo_has_enough_room`, `wait_cnt`, `wait_done`, `dfifo_has_enough_room_d1` to manage FIFO states, data read/write operations, wait states, and to ensure data integrity and the availability of buffer space.\n\nThe module's code is structured into blocks handling initial conditions and defaults, command readiness checks, logic for calculating available buffer space, data and command processing logic, and FIFO interfacing (through an instantiated FIFO block managing data inputs and outputs). This enables the module to efficiently manage and signal data and command processing readiness, consider family and burst length specifics, and dynamically adjust its operation based on internal states and external inputs."
