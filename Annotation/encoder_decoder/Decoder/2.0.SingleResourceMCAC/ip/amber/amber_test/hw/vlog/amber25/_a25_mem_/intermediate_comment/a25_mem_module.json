    "module": "The a25_mem module manages memory accesses within a system, deciding between direct memory access or cache-based interactions based on address cachability and operational states. It handles read/write operations with inputs like data address and control signals, utilizing internal logic and conditions such as stall detection and byte-level manipulations. Outputs reflect data status and memory operation results. Integration with an internal cache submodule (a25_dcache) and various internal signals streamline the memory access process, ensuring efficient and effective data management aligned with system needs."
