    "module": "This module serves as a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB), interfacing with various DDR memory types. It manages low-level interactions between the MCB and physical memory, handling address and data management, command issuing, and I/O operations. The module implements multiple port configurations, data widths, and memory types using a combination of input/output ports, internal signals, and sub-modules. It utilizes OSERDES2 and IODRP2_MCB blocks for data serialization/deserialization and I/O calibration, respectively. The wrapper also incorporates logic for timing parameter management, delay calibration, and signal integrity control, supporting different memory standards and configurations through parameterization."
