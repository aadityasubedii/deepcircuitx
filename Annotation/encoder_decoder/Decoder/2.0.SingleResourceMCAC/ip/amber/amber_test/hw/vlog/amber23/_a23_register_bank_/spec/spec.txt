Module name: a23_register_bank. 
Module specification: The 'a23_register_bank' is a Verilog module designed for managing a register bank in a processor system, handling the operation of registers based on control inputs and mode of operation. It supports reading, writing, and dynamic register selection during various CPU operation modes (user, supervisor, interrupt, and fast interrupt modes). The primary input ports include `i_clk` (clock signal), diverse mode selection signals (`i_mode_idec`, `i_mode_exec`, `i_mode_rds_exec`), register selection signals (`i_rm_sel`, `i_rds_sel`, `i_rn_sel`), write enable signals (`i_pc_wen`, `i_reg_bank_wen`), and `i_pc` & `i_reg` for program counter and general register data inputs. The module outputs the selected register values through `o_rm`, `o_rs`, `o_rd`, `o_rn`, and the program counter state via `o_pc`. Internal signals such as `usr_exec`, `svc_exec`, `irq_exec`, and `firq_exec` indicate active execution modes and are crucial in determining which sets of registers (`r13_*`, `r14_*`, `r8_firq` to `r14_firq`) are accessed or modified. The code is divided into blocks handling input assignments based on modes, register updates on positive clock edges without fetch stalls, and assigning output based on current modes and selections. Each section is critical in maintaining correct operational states for reads and writes to the register bank, ensuring the CPU correctly handles different functional and operational scenarios.
