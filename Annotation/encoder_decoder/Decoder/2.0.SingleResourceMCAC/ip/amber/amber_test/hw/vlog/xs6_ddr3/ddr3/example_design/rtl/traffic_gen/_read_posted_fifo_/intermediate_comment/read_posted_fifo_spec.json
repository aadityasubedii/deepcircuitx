    "spec": "Module name: read_posted_fifo.\nModule specification: The \"read_posted_fifo\" module is designed for FPGA architectures, specifically optimized for the Spartan-6 family, managing read transactions buffered in a FIFO system. It coordinates the handling and synchronization of commands and data operations for FPGA-based applications, leveraging internal logic and state controls to ensure data consistency and efficient FIFO management under various operational conditions. Key input ports include `clk_i` (clock input to drive the module's operations synchronously), `rst_i` (synchronous reset to initiate module's internal states), and `cmd_valid_i`, `data_valid_i` (indicate validity of command and new data respectively), along with `addr_i` and `bl_i` (specifying target address and burst length for read operations). The module outputs include `cmd_rdy_o` (signaling readiness to accept new commands), `gen_valid_o` (indicates the validity of output data), and `gen_addr_o` and `gen_bl_o` which provide the address and burst length for ongoing transactions. Critical internal signals are `empty_r` and `full` (indicating the state of the FIFO), `wr_en`, `rd_en` (control read/write operations), and `wait_done` (ensures certain operations only proceed after specific conditions). The code structure includes an asynchronous FIFO block for data buffering and several procedural blocks that calculate buffer availability, manage read/write enable processes, and handle signals related to data transactions, ensuring operations such as waiting, data consistency, and edge-triggered events are efficiently managed.\n",

It coordinates the handling and synchronization of commands and data operations for FPGA-based applications, leveraging internal logic and state controls to ensure data consistency and efficient FIFO management under various operational conditions. Key input ports include `clk_i` (clock input to drive the module's operations synchronously), `rst_i` (synchronous reset to initiate module's internal states), and `cmd_valid_i`, `data_valid_i` (indicate validity of command and new data respectively), along with `addr_i` and `bl_i` (specifying target address and burst length for read operations). The module outputs include `cmd_rdy_o` (signaling readiness to accept new commands), `gen_valid_o` (indicates the validity of output data), and `gen_addr_o` and `gen_bl_o` which provide the address and burst length for ongoing transactions. Critical internal signals are `empty_r` and `full` (indicating the state of the FIFO), `wr_en`, `rd_en` (control read/write operations), and `wait_done` (ensures certain operations only proceed after specific conditions). The code structure includes an asynchronous FIFO block for data buffering and several procedural blocks that calculate buffer availability, manage read/write enable processes, and handle signals related to data transactions, ensuring operations such as waiting, data consistency, and edge-triggered events are efficiently managed.\n"
