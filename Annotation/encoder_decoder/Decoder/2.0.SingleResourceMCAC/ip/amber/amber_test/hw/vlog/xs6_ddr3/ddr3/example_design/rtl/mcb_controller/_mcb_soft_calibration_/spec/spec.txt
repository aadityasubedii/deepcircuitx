Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), implementing input termination calibration, DQS delay calibration, and dynamic calibration during operation. It takes inputs such as UI_CLK (main clock), RST (reset), PLL_LOCK (PLL lock signal), and various MCB-related signals. Outputs include DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL (calibration completion signal), SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ (self-refresh request), and numerous MCB control signals. Internal signals like STATE (current state of calibration state machine), P_Term and N_Term (termination values), and DQS_DELAY (DQS delay value) are used to manage the calibration process. The module consists of several main blocks: a state machine controlling the calibration sequence, IODRP controllers
