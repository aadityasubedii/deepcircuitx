    "module": "This module implements a wrapper for a memory controller, supporting up to 6 ports for read/write operations with external DDR3 memory. It interfaces with various clock domains, handles command and data signals for each port, and manages memory interface signals. The wrapper utilizes a mcb_ui_top sub-module to handle the core memory controller functionality, including calibration, arbitration, and AXI interface support. It provides flexible configuration options through parameters and supports both native port interfaces and AXI interfaces for memory access."
