    "module": "The 'eth_spram_256x32' module implements a synchronous RAM with 256x32-bit storage, supporting conditional byte-wise write and read operations. It employs input controls like chip enable and write enable, alongside an internal mechanism 'write_enable' for determining write conditions. Different RAM blocks are instantiated based on the target FPGA type via conditional compilation, ensuring adaptability to hardware variations while maintaining a uniform interface for memory operations."
