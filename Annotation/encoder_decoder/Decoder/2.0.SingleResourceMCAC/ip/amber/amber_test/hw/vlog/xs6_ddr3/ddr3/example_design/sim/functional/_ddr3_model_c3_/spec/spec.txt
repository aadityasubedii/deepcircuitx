Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module is a behavioral model of a DDR3 SDRAM (Double Data Rate 3 Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory) device. It simulates the functionality and timing characteristics of a DDR3 memory, including command decoding, address handling, data read/write operations, and various timing checks. The module has input ports for control signals (rst_n, ck, ck_n, cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address and bank selection (ba, addr), data mask (dm_tdqs), and data I/O (dq, dqs, dqs_n), as well as on-die termination control (odt). Output ports include data (dq), data strobe (dqs, dqs_n), and termination data strobe (tdqs
