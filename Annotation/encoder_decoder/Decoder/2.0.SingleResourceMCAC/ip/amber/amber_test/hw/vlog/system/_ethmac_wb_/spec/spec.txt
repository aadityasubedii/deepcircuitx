Module name: ethmac_wb. Module specification: The 'ethmac_wb' module is a Verilog component designed for Ethernet MAC interfacing with a Wishbone bus in both master and slave modes, catering to variable data and control setups. It manages bus transactions efficiently by settings such as data widths and byte select lines, adjusting the interfacing for different modes of operation according to the parameters WB_DWIDTH and WB_SWIDTH. Notably, the input ports include i_m_wb_*, handling incoming control and data from the MAC as a master, and i_s_wb_*, handling inputs as a slave from external Wishbone bus masters. Output ports mimic this division into master and slave prefixed with o_m_wb_* and o_s_wb_*, respectively, managing data and control signal returns to the bus. Internally, WB_DWIDTH and WB_SWIDTH parameters regulate data and select line widths, crucial for aligning with the system's bus architecture. The module employs generate-if blocks to adjust internal pathways and signal assignments between 32-bit and 128-bit operations, exemplified by splitting data based on address alignment to ensure correct data and byte selection for each mode. Commenting and logical separation into master and slave functional blocks further clarify operational roles, enhancing maintainability and scalability of the module in different system configurations.
