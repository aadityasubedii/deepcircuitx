It performs several calibration steps including:\n\n1. Input termination calibration using RZQ and ZIO pins\n2. DQS (Data Strobe) delay calibration\n3. Dynamic calibration during operation\n\nThe module goes through various states to adjust termination values, set initial DQS delays, and continuously monitor and adjust DQS timing during operation. It interfaces with IODRP (I/O Device Reconfiguration Port) controllers to make these adjustments. The calibration process aims to optimize the timing and signal integrity for memory operations, adapting to temperature and voltage variations over time."
