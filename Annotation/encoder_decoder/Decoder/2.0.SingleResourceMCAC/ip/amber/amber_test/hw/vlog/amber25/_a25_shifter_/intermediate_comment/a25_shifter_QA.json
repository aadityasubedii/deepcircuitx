It handles logical left shift (LSL), logical right shift (LSR), arithmetic right shift (ASR), and rotate right (ROR) based on the function specified by the 'i_function' input. The shifting behavior can operate with different conditions governed by parameters and input flags, such as 'FULL_BARREL' to determine the operation mode and 'i_shift_imm_zero' to control shift outcomes directly. The module outputs the shifting result and also provides an output carry flag 'o_carry_out'.\n"

It captures the result of shifting `i_in` to the left by the number of positions specified in `i_shift_amount`, adjusting the LSBs accordingly based on other conditions like `i_carry_in` and `i_shift_imm_zero`.\n- `lsr_out`: This signal holds the result of the Logical Shift Right (LSR) operation. It performs the right shift on `i_in`, moving bits towards the LSB and inserting zeros or the output of `i_carry_in` at the MSB depending on `i_shift_amount` and other conditional inputs.\n- `asr_out`: This wire carries the output of the Arithmetic Shift Right (ASR) operation. Unlike LSR, ASR propagates the original MSB (sign bit) of `i_in` across shifted positions when the bit positions are vacated, reflecting the signed nature of the shift for two's complement numbers.\n- `ror_out`: Representing the result of the Rotate Right (ROR) operation, this wire rotates the bits of `i_in` rightward, wrapping around the bits that shift past the LSB back to the MSB, influenced by `i_shift_imm_zero` and `i_shift_amount` to determine the exact rotation behavior."
