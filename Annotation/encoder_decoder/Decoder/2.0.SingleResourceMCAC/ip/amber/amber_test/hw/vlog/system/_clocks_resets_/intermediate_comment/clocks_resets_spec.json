    "spec": "Module name: clocks_resets. \nModule specification: The `clocks_resets` module, specifically designed for Xilinx FPGAs like Spartan6 and Virtex6, manages clock and reset functionalities within a digital system. It utilizes input ports `i_brd_rst` (system reset), `i_brd_clk_n` and `i_brd_clk_p` (differential board clock signals), and `i_ddr_calib_done` (DDR calibration completion signal) to produce output ports `o_sys_rst` (system reset output), `o_sys_clk` (system clock), and `o_clk_200` (200 MHz clock). Internally, the module employs signals such as `calib_done_33mhz` (synchronized DDR calibration completion), and `rst0` (internal combined reset signal), among others, to ensure accurate clock and reset operations. The configuration includes differential input buffering, PLL setup for clock generation derived from the board clock, synchronization of reset signals, and monitoring of DDR calibration and PLL lock status. Conditionally compiled sections target either Spartan6 or Virtex6, where components like `IBUFGDS`, `PLL_ADV` or `MMCM_ADV` are instantiated for FPGA-specific functionality. In non-Xilinx scenarios, behavioral simulation models handle clock operations including period measurements and fractional division of the clock. This adaptive and comprehensive handling of clocks and resets ensures reliable system performance in FPGA-based designs.",

It generates system clocks and reset signals based on the input board-specific clocks (i_brd_clk_p and i_brd_clk_n) and a calibration complete signal (i_ddr_calib_done). The module includes differential signal buffering, PLL configuration for clock generation, synchronization mechanisms for reset signals, and ensures the system clock and reset are correctly derived and stabilized according to the calibration and PLL lock status. This setup is critical for maintaining reliable operation in FPGA-based designs, where precise clock management and reset synchronization are essential for correct functional behavior and performance."

It is a critical signal that initializes the system into a known state upon power-up or when manual or programmed conditions for reset occur.\n- `i_brd_clk_n` and `i_brd_clk_p`: These inputs are the differential clock signals from the board. They provide the primary clock source to the module. Usage of differential signals helps in reducing noise and improving the integrity of the clock signal at higher frequencies.\n- `i_ddr_calib_done`: This input indicates whether the calibration of DDR (Double Data Rate memory) has completed. It is used to ensure that the system operates based on stable and accurate memory operations post calibration.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `o_sys_rst`\n- `o_sys_clk`\n- `o_clk_200`\n\nExplanation:\n- `o_sys_rst`: This is the system reset output. It propagates the reset condition to other parts of the system either when the main board reset is asserted or when the DDR calibration is not completed, ensuring all parts of the system are synchronized in terms of reset.\n- `o_sys_clk`: This output is the system clock, derived from the onboard PLL module that conditions the input board clock to suit system requirements. This clock is used to drive the synchronous operations within the FPGA and possibly other connected subsystems.\n- `o_clk_200`: This output likely represents a specific clock output, possibly running at 200 MHz, derived and buffered from the input differential clock directly. It provides a high-speed clock to certain parts of the system that require faster clock rates compared to the base system clock."

It is used to ensure that the reset conditions take into account the complete calibration of DDR memory.\n- `rst0`: Represents the primary internal reset signal that combines board reset and the negation of the calibration done status. It is used to derive the final system reset signal.\n- `pll_locked`: Indicates whether the PLL (Phase Locked Loop) used for generating system clocks has successfully locked to its input frequency. It's crucial for the stability and reliability of the output clocks.\n- `clkfbout_clkfbin`: Connects the feedback output of a PLL to its feedback input, forming a critical part of the PLL's feedback loop.\n- `rst0_sync_r`: This register array is used to synchronize the `rst0` signal to the system clock to avoid metastability issues.\n- `ddr_calib_done_sync_r`: Similar to `rst0_sync_r`, this register array is used for synchronizing the DDR calibration done signal to the system clock.\n- `rst_tmp`: A temporary reset signal that factors in the board reset and the PLL lock status. It's used in generating the synchronized `rst0` signal.\n- `pll_clk`: The output clock from the PLL which is used as the system clock after buffering.\n- `brd_clk_ibufg`: The buffered version of the input board clock, which is further utilized by the PLL for generating various system clocks.\n- `brd_temp`: Used in non-Xilinx FPGA environments to measure the period of the board clock by capturing the time between edges. Helps in simulating clock behavior in testbenches.\n- `pll_clk_beh`: In non-Xilinx configurations, this is a behavioral representation of the PLL clock used for simulations.\n- `sys_clk_beh`: The system clock in non-Xilinx FPGA models, derived behaviorally from `pll_clk_beh` based on division ratios.\n- `pll_div_count`: A counter used in non-Xilinx FPGA scenarios to divide the 'pll_clk_beh' to generate the `sys_clk_beh` based on the defined clock divider settings."

It utilizes input ports `i_brd_rst` (system reset), `i_brd_clk_n` and `i_brd_clk_p` (differential board clock signals), and `i_ddr_calib_done` (DDR calibration completion signal) to produce output ports `o_sys_rst` (system reset output), `o_sys_clk` (system clock), and `o_clk_200` (200 MHz clock). Internally, the module employs signals such as `calib_done_33mhz` (synchronized DDR calibration completion), and `rst0` (internal combined reset signal), among others, to ensure accurate clock and reset operations. The configuration includes differential input buffering, PLL setup for clock generation derived from the board clock, synchronization of reset signals, and monitoring of DDR calibration and PLL lock status. Conditionally compiled sections target either Spartan6 or Virtex6, where components like `IBUFGDS`, `PLL_ADV` or `MMCM_ADV` are instantiated for FPGA-specific functionality. In non-Xilinx scenarios, behavioral simulation models handle clock operations including period measurements and fractional division of the clock. This adaptive and comprehensive handling of clocks and resets ensures reliable system performance in FPGA-based designs."

It generates system clocks and reset signals based on the input board-specific clocks (i_brd_clk_p and i_brd_clk_n) and a calibration complete signal (i_ddr_calib_done). The module includes differential signal buffering, PLL configuration for clock generation, synchronization mechanisms for reset signals, and ensures the system clock and reset are correctly derived and stabilized according to the calibration and PLL lock status.

It is a critical signal that initializes the system into a known state upon power-up or when manual or programmed conditions for reset occur.\n- `i_brd_clk_n` and `i_brd_clk_p`: These inputs are the differential clock signals from the board. They provide the primary clock source to the module. Usage of differential signals helps in reducing noise and improving the integrity of the clock signal at higher frequencies.\n- `i_ddr_calib_done`: This input indicates whether the calibration of DDR (Double Data Rate memory) has completed. It is used to ensure that the system operates based on stable and accurate memory operations post calibration.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `o_sys_rst`\n- `o_sys_clk`\n- `o_clk_200`\n\nExplanation:\n- `o_sys_rst`: This is the system reset output. It propagates the reset condition to other parts of the system either when the main board reset is asserted or when the DDR calibration is not completed, ensuring all parts of the system are synchronized in terms of reset.\n- `o_sys_clk`: This output is the system clock, derived from the onboard PLL module that conditions the input board clock to suit system requirements. This clock is used to drive the synchronous operations within the FPGA and possibly other connected subsystems.\n- `o_clk_200`: This output likely represents a specific clock output, possibly running at 200 MHz, derived and buffered from the input differential clock directly. It provides a high-speed clock to certain parts of the system that require faster clock rates compared to the base system clock."

It is used to ensure that the reset conditions take into account the complete calibration of DDR memory.\n- `rst0`: Represents the primary internal reset signal that combines board reset and the negation of the calibration done status. It is used to derive the final system reset signal.\n- `pll_locked`: Indicates whether the PLL (Phase Locked Loop) used for generating system clocks has successfully locked to its input frequency. It's crucial for the stability and reliability of the output clocks.\n- `clkfbout_clkfbin`: Connects the feedback output of a PLL to its feedback input, forming a critical part of the PLL's feedback loop.\n- `rst0_sync_r`: This register array is used to synchronize the `rst0` signal to the system clock to avoid metastability issues.\n- `ddr_calib_done_sync_r`: Similar to `rst0_sync_r`, this register array is used for synchronizing the DDR calibration done signal to the system clock.\n- `rst_tmp`: A temporary reset signal that factors in the board reset and the PLL lock status. It's used in generating the synchronized `rst0` signal.\n- `pll_clk`: The output clock from the PLL which is used as the system clock after buffering.\n- `brd_clk_ibufg`: The buffered version of the input board clock, which is further utilized by the PLL for generating various system clocks.\n- `brd_temp`: Used in non-Xilinx FPGA environments to measure the period of the board clock by capturing the time between edges. Helps in simulating clock behavior in testbenches.\n- `pll_clk_beh`: In non-Xilinx configurations, this is a behavioral representation of the PLL clock used for simulations.\n- `sys_clk_beh`: The system clock in non-Xilinx FPGA models, derived behaviorally from `pll_clk_beh` based on division ratios.\n- `pll_div_count`: A counter used in non-Xilinx FPGA scenarios to divide the 'pll_clk_beh' to generate the `sys_clk_beh` based on the defined clock divider settings."

It utilizes input ports `i_brd_rst` (system reset), `i_brd_clk_n` and `i_brd_clk_p` (differential board clock signals), and `i_ddr_calib_done` (DDR calibration completion signal) to produce output ports `o_sys_rst` (system reset output), `o_sys_clk` (system clock), and `o_clk_200` (200 MHz clock). Internally, the module employs signals such as `calib_done_33mhz` (synchronized DDR calibration completion), and `rst0` (internal combined reset signal), among others, to ensure accurate clock and reset operations. The configuration includes differential input buffering, PLL setup for clock generation derived from the board clock, synchronization of reset signals, and monitoring of DDR calibration and PLL lock status. Conditionally compiled sections target either Spartan6 or Virtex6, where components like `IBUFGDS`, `PLL_ADV` or `MMCM_ADV` are instantiated for FPGA-specific functionality. In non-Xilinx scenarios, behavioral simulation models handle clock operations including period measurements and fractional division of the clock. This adaptive and comprehensive handling of clocks and resets ensures reliable system performance in FPGA-based designs."
