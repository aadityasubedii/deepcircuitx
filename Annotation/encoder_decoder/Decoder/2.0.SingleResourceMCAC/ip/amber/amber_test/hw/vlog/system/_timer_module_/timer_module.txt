The `timer_module` manages three independent timers interfacing through the Wishbone protocol, providing distinct control over each timer through register-based operations. Each timer can be configured, started, stopped, and reset individually, with output interrupts generated upon timers reaching zero. Module operations are synchronized at the clock edge, with reads and writes processed through internal registers and control signaling that accommodate variable data widths and handle timer-specific commands efficiently.
