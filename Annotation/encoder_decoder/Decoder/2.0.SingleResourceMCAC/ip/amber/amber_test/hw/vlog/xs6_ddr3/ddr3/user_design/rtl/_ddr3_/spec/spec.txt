Module name: ddr3. Module specification: This module implements a DDR3 SDRAM memory controller interface for an FPGA design. It manages communication between the FPGA and DDR3 memory, providing multiple command, write, and read ports (p0 to p5) for flexible memory access. The module's input ports include clock signals (c3_sys_clk), reset (c3_sys_rst_i), and various command, write, and read control signals for each port. Output ports consist of DDR3 memory control signals (mcb3_dram_*), status indicators (c3_calib_done), and data/status signals for each port. Internal signals handle clock management, reset control, and additional memory port interfaces. The module instantiates two main components: an infrastructure block for clock generation and a memory controller wrapper (memc_wrapper) that implements the core DDR3
