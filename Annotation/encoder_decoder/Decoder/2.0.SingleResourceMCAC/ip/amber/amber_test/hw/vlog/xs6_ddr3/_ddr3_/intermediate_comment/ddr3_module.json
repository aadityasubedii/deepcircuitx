    "module": "This module implements a DDR3 memory controller interface, managing communication with DDR3 SDRAM. It instantiates infrastructure and memory controller wrapper components, configures memory timing and port settings, and provides multiple command, write, and read ports (p0 to p5). The module handles memory initialization, calibration, and data transfer operations between user logic and the physical DDR3 memory device, supporting various memory configurations and operating parameters."
