Module name: a25_execute. Module specification: The a25_execute module is a crucial component of an ARM processor core, responsible for the execution stage of the instruction pipeline. It handles arithmetic and logical operations, address calculations, register updates, and status flag management. The module interfaces with other core components through numerous input and output ports, including clock and reset signals, stall indicators, data inputs from write-back and coprocessor stages, and various control signals for operation selection and execution flow. Key outputs include address signals for instruction and data memory, write data, and updated status flags. Internally, the module utilizes a variety of signals for intermediate calculations, temporary storage, and control flow management. These include ALU inputs and outputs, barrel shifter signals, register bank interfaces, and status bit manipulations. The module is organized into several functional blocks, including an ALU, a barrel shifter, a multiplier, and a register bank, each handling specific aspects of
