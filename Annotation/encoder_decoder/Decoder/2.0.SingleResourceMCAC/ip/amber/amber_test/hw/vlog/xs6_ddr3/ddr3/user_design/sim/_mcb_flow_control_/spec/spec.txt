Module name: mcb_flow_control.

Module specification: The mcb_flow_control module is designed to manage the command and data flow for memory control block operations in FPGA applications, particularly suited for the SPARTAN6 family. This module effectively handles memory access operations like read and write through an internal finite state machine (FSM), which transitions between states based on commands and data handling status. The input ports include clk_i (clock input), rst_i (reset input), cmd_valid_i (indicates if the incoming command is valid), cmd_i (specifies the command type), addr_i and bl_i (memory address and burst length for operations), and various other status and readiness signals that guide the FSM's operation. The output ports reflect the state of commands and data readiness, actual command direction, memory addresses, and burst lengths for both read and write operations. Internal signals such as cmd_fifo_rdy, push_cmd, xfer_cmd, and several valid and ready signals aid in determining operation states, transitions, and command executions within the FSM. The source code is clearly segmented into different sections for initializing and setting output signals, managing state transitions based on system readiness and command execution, and handling specific actions in various operational states such as READY, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT, and REFRESH_ST. Each section ensures robust and efficient processing of memory read and write operations, aligning with the overall goal of the module to facilitate interfacing between system commands and memory block operations.
