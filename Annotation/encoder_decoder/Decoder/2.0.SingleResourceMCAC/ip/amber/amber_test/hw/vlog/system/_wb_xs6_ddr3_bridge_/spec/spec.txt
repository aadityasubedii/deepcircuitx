Module name: wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge.

Module specification: The `wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge` is a Verilog module designed to facilitate data communication between a Wishbone bus interface and a DDR3 memory controller. It translates read and write requests from the Wishbone bus into appropriate DDR3 memory commands, handling data width conversions and buffering strategies. The module accepts `i_clk` for clocking, `i_mem_ctrl` for memory control, as well as Wishbone related inputs such as `i_wb_adr`, `i_wb_sel`, `i_wb_we`, `i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_cyc`, and `i_wb_stb`. The outputs include `o_wb_dat` for sending read data back to the Wishbone, `o_wb_ack` for acknowledging transactions, and `o_wb_err` for error signaling. DDR3 memory operations are controlled via `o_cmd_en`, `o_cmd_instr`, `o_cmd_byte_addr`, `o_wr_en`, `o_wr_mask`, and `o_wr_data`. Internal signals such as `write_request`, `read_request` and various registers and buffers (`read_request_r`, `write_buf_r`, `wb_adr_r`, etc.) manage data flow, synchronization, and buffering between read, write, and command phases. The module consists of several blocks including command generation, data write and read handling, buffering mechanisms to handle full conditions, and conditional generation for different data widths. This design ensures the efficient management of memory operations complying with the asynchronous nature of Wishbone requests and the synchronous demands of DDR3 memory.
