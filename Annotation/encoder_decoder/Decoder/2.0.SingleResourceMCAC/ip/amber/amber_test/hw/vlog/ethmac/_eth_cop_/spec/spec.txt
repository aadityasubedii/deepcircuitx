Module name: eth_cop. Module specification: The 'eth_cop' is a controller module designed for data transaction management using the WISHBONE bus standard, orchestrating interactions between two master interfaces (Master 1 and Master 2) and two slave interfaces (Slave 1 and Slave 2). It manages data routing, error signaling, and transaction acknowledgment based on requests and response activities captured through various input and output ports. Input ports include clock (`wb_clk_i`) and reset (`wb_rst_i`) signals for synchronization and initialization, address (`m1_wb_adr_i`, `m2_wb_adr_i`), data (`m1_wb_dat_i`, `m2_wb_dat_i`), select (`m1_wb_sel_i`, `m2_wb_sel_i`), cycle (`m1_wb_cyc_i`, `m2_wb_cyc_i`), strobe (`m1_wb_stb_i`, `m2_wb_stb_i`), write-enable (`m1_wb_we_i`, `m2_wb_we_i`) signals from both masters, and acknowledge (`s1_wb_ack_i`, `s2_wb_ack_i`), error (`s1_wb_err_i`, `s2_wb_err_i`), and data (`s1_wb_dat_i`, `s2_wb_dat_i`) input signals from slaves. Output ports comprise data (`m1_wb_dat_o`, `m2_wb_dat_o`), acknowledgment (`m1_wb_ack_o`, `m2_wb_ack_o`), and error (`m1_wb_err_o`, `m2_wb_err_o`) signals to masters, and address (`s1_wb_adr_o`, `s2_wb_adr_o`), select (`s1_wb_sel_o`, `s2_wb_sel_o`), write-enable (`s1_wb_we_o`, `s2_wb_we_o`), cycle (`s1_wb_cyc_o`, `s2_wb_cyc_o`), strobe (`s1_wb_stb_o`, `s2_wb_stb_o`), and data (`s1_wb_dat_o`, `s2_wb_dat_o`) outputs to slaves. Internal signals such as `m1_in_progress` and `m2_in_progress` track transaction states for both masters, while routing control to slaves is handled via various registers like `s1_wb_adr_o` and `s2_wb_adr_o`. The module is segmented into multiple procedural blocks handling reset conditions, transaction initiation and progress for each master, completion checks, error handling, and displays for extended WISHBONE activity or errors. This structured approach ensures reliable data handling and error management within a digital system interfacing through a WISHBONE bus.
