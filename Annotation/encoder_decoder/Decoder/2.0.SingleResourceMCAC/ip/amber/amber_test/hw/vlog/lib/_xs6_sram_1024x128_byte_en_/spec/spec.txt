Module name: xs6_sram_1024x128_byte_en. Module specification: This module implements a 1024x128-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using 8 RAMB16BWER primitives on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. It provides a 128-bit wide data interface with 10-bit addressing, allowing for 1024 memory locations. The module has five input ports: i_clk (clock input), i_write_data (128-bit input data), i_write_enable (write enable signal), i_address (10-bit address input), and i_byte_enable (16-bit byte enable signal). It has one output port: o_read_data (128-bit output data). Internal signals include wea_b0 and wea_b1 (write enable signals for each bank), rea
