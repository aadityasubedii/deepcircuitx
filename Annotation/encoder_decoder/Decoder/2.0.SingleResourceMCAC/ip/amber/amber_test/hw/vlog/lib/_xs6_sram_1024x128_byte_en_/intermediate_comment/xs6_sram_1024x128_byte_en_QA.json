It provides a 128-bit wide data interface with 10-bit addressing, allowing for 1024 memory locations. The module supports byte-level write operations through a 16-bit byte enable signal. It also includes parameters for initializing the memory contents. The SRAM is divided into two banks, each containing 512 locations, selected by the most significant address bit."
