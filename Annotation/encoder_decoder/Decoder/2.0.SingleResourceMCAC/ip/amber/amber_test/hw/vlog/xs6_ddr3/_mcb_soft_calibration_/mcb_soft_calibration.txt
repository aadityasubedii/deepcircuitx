This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), including initialization, impedance matching, and dynamic DQS calibration. It uses a state machine to control the calibration process, adjusting termination values and DQS delays based on measurements from I/O devices. The module communicates with IODRP controllers and the MCB, managing self-refresh operations and responding to various input signals. It iteratively refines calibration settings to optimize memory interface timing and signal integrity, ensuring reliable operation across different operating conditions.
