This module performs soft calibration for a Memory Controller Block (MCB), optimizing memory interface timing and performance. It implements a state machine to handle initialization, impedance matching, and dynamic calibration of DQS delays. The module adjusts termination values, broadcasts settings to IODRPs, and performs dynamic calibration by incrementally adjusting DQS delays based on measured values. It also manages self-refresh requests and supports different memory types. The calibration process involves multiple stages, including setting initial values, performing input termination calibration, and executing dynamic calibration loops to fine-tune DQS delays for optimal performance.
