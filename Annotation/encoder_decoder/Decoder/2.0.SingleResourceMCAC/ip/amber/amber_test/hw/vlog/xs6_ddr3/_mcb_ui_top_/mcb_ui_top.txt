This module implements a top-level interface for a memory controller block (MCB) supporting multiple ports and AXI interfaces. It integrates a raw MCB wrapper, AXI interfaces, and synchronization logic to handle memory access requests from different ports. The module arbitrates between ports, interfaces with external memory, and supports both native MCB and AXI interfaces. It manages clock signals, reset, arbitration, command interfaces, and data transfer for up to 6 ports. The implementation includes configurable AXI-to-MCB bridges, clock management, and internal signal routing to facilitate flexible memory access in various system configurations.
