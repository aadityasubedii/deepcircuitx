Module name: a25_icache. Module specification: The a25_icache module is an instruction cache for the Amber 25 processor, designed to store recently accessed instructions and improve execution speed. It features configurable cache lines, words per line, and ways. The module uses input signals like clk, reset, i_core_stall, i_select, i_address, i_address_nxt, i_cache_enable, i_cache_flush, i_wb_read_data, and i_wb_ready to manage cache operations. Output signals include o_stall, o_read_data, and o_wb_req. Internally, it utilizes signals such as c_state, source_sel, init_count, tag_rdata_way, data_rdata_way, select_way, and valid_bits_r to control cache states and data management. The module is organized into
