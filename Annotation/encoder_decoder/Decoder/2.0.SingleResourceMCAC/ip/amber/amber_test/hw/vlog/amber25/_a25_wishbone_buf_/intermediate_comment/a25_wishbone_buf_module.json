    "module": "The a25_wishbone_buf module acts as a buffering intermediary for Wishbone bus transactions, managing and queuing both read and write requests to streamline bus interactions. It effectively buffers data, addressing, and control signals through dual entry arrays and utilizes internal state machines and pointers to control the flow and acknowledgment of data between the bus and the module, adhering to Wishbone protocol requirements."
