    "module": "The `generic_sram_line_en` module implements a simple SRAM with data and address operations, parameterized for width and initialization. It handles data writes and reads controlled by `i_write_enable` on rising `clk`. On reset, memory can initialize to zeros or ones based on `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO`. In normal operation, data at `i_address` is written or read based on `i_write_enable`, with additional I/O ports for test modes and scan chains."
