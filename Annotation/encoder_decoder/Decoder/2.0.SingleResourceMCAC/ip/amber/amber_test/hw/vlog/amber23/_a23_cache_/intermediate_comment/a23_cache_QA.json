It features parameterizable cache dimensions and supports multiple cache ways, allowing for set-associative configurations. The module uses state machines to manage cache states and operations, like initialization, cache line filling, invalidation, or direct access, employing algorithms to handle cache hits, misses, and write operations. The cache's operation is clock-driven, and it is equipped to interact with a wishbone-compliant bus system for external data fetching and writing."
