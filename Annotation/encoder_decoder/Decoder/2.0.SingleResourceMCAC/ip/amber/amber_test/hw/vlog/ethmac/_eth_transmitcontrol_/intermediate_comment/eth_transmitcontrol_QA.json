It primarily makes decisions related to starting or ending control frames based on input signals and internal conditions, managing the control frame data including MAC (Media Access Control) address and pause time value. The functional blocks include generating control signals for frame boundaries, selecting whether to send control or data frames, and constructing the control data frames based on the byte count and specific conditions like the delay required for CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check). The module effectively controls the transmission, ensuring handling based on reset conditions, frame start indications, or end signals."
