This module implements an Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) layer, providing a complete interface between the physical layer and upper network layers. It integrates transmit and receive engines, MIIM management, flow control, address filtering, and collision detection. The module uses a Wishbone interface for host communication, MII interface for PHY connection, and incorporates various sub-modules for specific functions such as MAC control, MIIM operations, register management, and status monitoring. It supports features like pause frames, programmable inter-frame gap, and backoff algorithm for efficient Ethernet communication.
