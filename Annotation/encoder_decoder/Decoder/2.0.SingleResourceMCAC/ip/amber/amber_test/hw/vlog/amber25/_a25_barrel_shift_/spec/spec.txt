Module name: a25_barrel_shift.
Module specification: The `a25_barrel_shift` module is a sophisticated Verilog design that incorporates a dual-mode barrel shifter for processing 32-bit input data (`i_in`). Its architecture is suitable to handle two types of shift operations: a full barrel shift and a quick shift, selectable based on operational needs. The module accepts several input signals including the clock (`clk`), reset (`reset`), test-related inputs (`scan_enable`, `test_mode`), the main data input (`i_in`), an accompanying carry input (`i_carry_in`), the shift amount (`i_shift_amount`), a zero-shifting enable signal (`i_shift_imm_zero`), and a function code (`i_function`). The outputs of the module are the shifted result (`o_out`), a carry out (`o_carry_out`), and an indication of operational stall (`o_stall`) due to large shift amounts or configuration limits. Internally, the module utilizes wire signals `quick_out` and `quick_carry_out` for results from the quick shifter, and `full_out` and `full_carry_out` from the full barrel shifter. Registered versions of the full shifter outputs (`full_out_r` and `full_carry_out_r`) ensure stable data between operations, driven by the `use_quick_r` register that selects the shifter mode based on the stall condition. Two instances of the `a25_shifter` are used, parameterized for full and quick operations, configuring data pathways and functionality dynamically. The logic control, set/reset operations within synchronous always blocks, and conditional assignments regulate the flow and transformation of data through the module, making it flexible yet robust for different operational scenarios.
