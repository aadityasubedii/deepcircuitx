The `wr_data_gen` module generates write data for memory interfaces, supporting different FPGA families and configurations, and handles write operations based on input commands and data patterns. It implements functionality through a series of always blocks that manage command readiness, data validity, and output conditions, synchronized by a clock input. Conditional generate blocks instantiate specific data generation units based on the FPGA family, seamlessly integrating various data handling and command processing tasks into the memory write operation.
