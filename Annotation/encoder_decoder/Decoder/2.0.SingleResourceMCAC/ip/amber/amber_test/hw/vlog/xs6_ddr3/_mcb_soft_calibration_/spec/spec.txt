Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), handling initialization, impedance matching, and dynamic calibration of DQS signals. It takes inputs like UI_CLK (clock), RST (reset), PLL_LOCK (PLL status), SELFREFRESH_REQ (self-refresh request), and various I/O signals. Outputs include DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL (calibration completion status), SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ (self-refresh request to MCB), and various control signals for I/O and MCB operations. Internal signals like P_Term, N_Term (termination values), STATE (calibration state machine), and DQS_DELAY (DQS delay value) are used to manage the calibration process. The module consists of several blocks: initialization, impedance matching
