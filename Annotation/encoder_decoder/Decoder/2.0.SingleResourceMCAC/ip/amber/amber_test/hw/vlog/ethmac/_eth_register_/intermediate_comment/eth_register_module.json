    "module": "The 'eth_register' module functions as an 8-bit register with asynchronous and synchronous reset options, designed to latch input data upon write signal activation at clock edges. It manages module operations through an 'always' block that prioritizes asynchronous reset over synchronous reset and data writing, adjusting the output 'DataOut' based on signal conditions, and utilizing non-blocking assignments for accurate sequence timing."
