The `a25_coprocessor` module manages cache control and fault handling operations interfacing with a main processor, facilitating features like cache enablement, flushing, and defining cacheable areas. It processes inputs related to operational codes, coprocessor commands, and fault signals to update internal state registers like cache control and fault status, utilizing synchronous clock-driven logic blocks for data handling and condition checks, alongside debug functionalities for tracing internal operations during simulations.
