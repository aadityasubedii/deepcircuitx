Module name: infrastructure. Module specification: The 'infrastructure' module is designed to generate various clock and reset signals required in a digital system, utilizing a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL). The module supports either differential or single-ended input clock types, managed by parameters and generated through configurations like input clock period, output divides, and multipliers. Input ports include sys_clk_p, sys_clk_n, and sys_clk for differential and single-ended clock inputs, respectively, and sys_rst_i for the system reset. The main output ports are clk0 (main clock output), rst0 (synchronized reset signal), async_rst (asynchronous reset signal), and several other clock outputs like sysclk_2x and sysclk_2x_180 for specific frequency needs, along with control and status signals like pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, and pll_lock indicating the PLL lock status. Internal signals such as clk_2x_0, clk_2x_180, and clk0_bufg are associated with clock management, including buffering for stability and synchronization, while others like sys_rst and powerup_pll_locked manage system resets conditioned on various statuses. The module incorporates several key blocks including clock buffers (BUFG and BUFGCE), PLL_ADV for advanced PLL configuration, and BUFPLL_MCB for additional clock management and output control, aimed at ensuring reliable clock distribution and system reset functionalities across different operative conditions.
