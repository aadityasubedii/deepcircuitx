Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: This module serves as a top-level interface for a memory controller block (MCB) with support for multiple ports and AXI interfaces. It integrates various components including a raw MCB wrapper, AXI interfaces, and synchronization logic. The module handles memory access requests from different ports, arbitrates between them, and interfaces with external memory. It supports both native MCB interfaces and up to six AXI interfaces, allowing for flexible integration in different system configurations. Input ports include clock signals, reset, arbitration enables, command interfaces, write and read interfaces for up to 6 ports, calibration and control signals, and AXI interface signals. Output ports provide status signals, memory interface signals, and AXI interface responses. Internal signals facilitate connections between different components, including masked versions of AXI addresses and internal connections for memory controller ports. The module contains several main sections: clock management
