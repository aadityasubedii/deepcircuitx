It supports parameterized data width (`DSIZE`), FIFO depth (`FIFO_DEPTH`), and address size (`ASIZE`). It manages buffer states like full, empty, and almost full based on the read and write pointers, facilitating seamless data handling and synchronization between the different domains while preventing data corruption."
