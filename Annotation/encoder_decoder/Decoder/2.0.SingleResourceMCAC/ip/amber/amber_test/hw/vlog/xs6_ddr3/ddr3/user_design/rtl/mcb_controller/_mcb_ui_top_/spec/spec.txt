Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: This module serves as a top-level interface for a memory controller block (MCB) with support for multiple ports and AXI interfaces. It manages memory operations, including arbitration, command handling, read/write operations, and AXI protocol conversion. The module has numerous input and output ports, including clock signals, reset signals, arbitration enables, command signals, write/read signals, calibration signals, user interface signals, and AXI interface signals for up to 6 ports. Internal signals are used for routing data, control, and status information between different components. The module consists of several main blocks: a BUFPLL_MCB for clock management, a mcb_raw_wrapper for core memory controller functionality, and multiple instances of axi_mcb for AXI interface handling. It supports various memory types and configurations, with parameters for customizing port configurations, arbitration
