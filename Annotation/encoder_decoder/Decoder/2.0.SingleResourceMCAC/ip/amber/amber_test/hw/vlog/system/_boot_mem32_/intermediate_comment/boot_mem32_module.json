    "module": "The boot_mem32 module interfaces with memory using the Wishbone protocol, handling read and write operations for FPGA platforms. It utilizes parameterizable widths for data, selection, and address, alongside internal signals like start_write and start_read, controlled through input ports for selective activation. Debug configurations and conditional compilation tailor its functionality and integration with various memory models and FPGA-specific parameters, efficiently managing operations and platform compatibility."
