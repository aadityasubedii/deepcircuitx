    "module": "The `boot_mem128` module interfaces with a memory controller using the Wishbone bus protocol to manage read and write operations to memory. It features parameterizable data and address widths and includes configuration options for FPGA-specific deployments and debugging capabilities. Inputs handle addressing, data input, and control signals, while outputs provide data, acknowledgments, and error indications. Internal signals manage operational flow and synchronize transactions, with special debug provisions for altering behavior under test conditions, including memory instantiations adapted for Xilinx or generic platforms."
