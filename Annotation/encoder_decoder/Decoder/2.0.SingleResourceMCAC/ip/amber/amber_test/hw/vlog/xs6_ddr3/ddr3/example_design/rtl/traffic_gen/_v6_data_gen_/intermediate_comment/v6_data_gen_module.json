    "module": "This module generates data patterns for memory interface testing. It supports various patterns including PRBS, address-based, walking 1's/0's, neighbor, and fixed data. The module uses a configurable design to accommodate different data widths, burst lengths, and DQ pin counts. It implements pattern generation logic based on selected mode and memory configuration parameters. The module utilizes internal counters, shift registers, and combinational logic to create the desired patterns. A PRBS generator is included for pseudo-random sequence generation. The module responds to control inputs and memory address to produce appropriate data outputs for testing various memory scenarios."
