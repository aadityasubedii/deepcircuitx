Module name: eth_rxcounters. Module specification: The "eth_rxcounters" is a Verilog module tailored for tracking various facets of Ethernet packet reception through counting and managing byte and Interframe Gap (IFG) metrics, alongside accommodating delays for cyclic redundancy check (CRC). The module is driven by the input ports: MRxClk (module's clock), Reset (resets counters), MRxDV (indicates valid data), various state signals (StateIdle, StateSFD, StateData, StateDrop, StatePreamble), MRxDEqD (equality of decoded data), DlyCrcEn (enables CRC delay), Transmitting (indicates ongoing transmission), MaxFL (maximum frame length), r_IFG (resets IFG counter), and HugEn (enables handling of jumbo frames). The output signals include various byte count comparisons (ByteCntEq0 - ByteCntEq7, ByteCntGreat2, ByteCntSmall7), ByteCntMaxFrame (matches the maximum frame), ByteCntOut (current byte count adjusted for CRC delay), IFGCounterEq24 (flags IFG count of 24), and a 4-bit delayed CRC count (DlyCrcCnt). Internally, the module utilizes signals such as ResetByteCounter, IncrementByteCounter, ResetIFGCounter, and IncrementIFGCounter to manage the conditions under which the counters are reset or incremented. The code is segmented into sections that handle the byte counter logic, IFG counter logic, and CRC delay management, employing procedural blocks that respond to the clock and reset conditions to manipulate the counters based on the logic derived from the input signals and internal conditions like maximum frame length detection and counter comparisons for precise management of packet timing and state transitions.
