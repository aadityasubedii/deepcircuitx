It monitors input interrupt signals from various sources, such as UARTs, Ethernet MAC, and timers. The module provides functionality to enable or disable interrupts through software control, differentiate between urgent (fast interrupt request, FIRQ) and standard interrupts (IRQ), and aggregate the interrupt status which can be accessed through a bus interface. Based on these interrupt statuses and enabled masks, it generates output signals that indicate if there is any pending interrupt (IRQ or FIRQ). This module interfaces with a Wishbone compliant bus for register access, allowing software to read status or configure the module."
