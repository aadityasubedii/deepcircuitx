Module name: cmd_prbs_gen. 

Module specification: The cmd_prbs_gen module, coded in Verilog, is designed to generate pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) based approach. This module accepts clock input (clk_i), a seed initialization signal (prbs_seed_init), a clock enable signal (clk_en), and a seed value (prbs_seed_i) as its **input ports**. It produces a pseudorandom binary sequence (prbs_o) as its **output port**. The internal workings of the module utilize several **internal signals** including ZEROS, used as a zero-value supplier for conditional computation; prbs, a register containing the current state of the binary sequence; and lfsr_q, a register storing the LFSRâ€™s computed values. The Verilog code is structured into several **blocks** handling LFSR operations for different configurations ('ADDRESS' with 64-bit and 32-bit, and 'INSTR' or 'BLEN' configurations). Each block adapts the LFSR behavior based on the PRBS_CMD and PRBS_WIDTH parameters that determine the operational mode and width of the PRBS. Additionally, the module contains operations dependent on specific FPGA family parameters (e.g., SPARTAN6) affecting how sequences are masked and shifted before being output. The code is comprehensive in managing the initialization of the LFSR with seeds, updating the sequence state contingent on control signals, and ensuring the final output sequence adheres to set configurations and environmental conditions such as signal masks.
