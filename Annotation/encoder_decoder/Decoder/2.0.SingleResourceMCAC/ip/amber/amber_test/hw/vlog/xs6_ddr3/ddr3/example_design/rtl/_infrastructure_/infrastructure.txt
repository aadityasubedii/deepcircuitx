The `infrastructure` module manages clock generation and reset synchronization for FPGA applications, accommodating both differential and single-ended clock inputs. It utilizes a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to output various clock signals tailored for different system needs, including primary and doubled frequency clocks with phase options, alongside generating control and lock status signals for reliable operation. The functionality is achieved through configurable input handling, robust PLL configurations for diverse outputs, and careful clock and reset management across multiple domains, ensuring system stability and flexibility.
