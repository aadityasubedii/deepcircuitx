Module name: afifo. 
Module specification: The `afifo` module is an asynchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) memory buffer designed to facilitate data transfers across different clock domains, specifically catering to producer and consumer operations that function asynchronously. It utilizes configurable parameters like depth and data width, ensuring flexibility in storage capacity and data size. The module includes input ports such as `wr_clk` (write clock), `rst` (reset), `wr_en` (write enable), `wr_data` (data to write), `rd_en` (read enable), and `rd_clk` (read clock). Output ports comprise `rd_data` (data read from FIFO), `full` (signals when FIFO is full), `empty` (signals when FIFO is empty), and `almost_full` (signals when FIFO is almost full). 

The module uses various internal signals such as `mem` for the FIFO storage, `rd_gray_nxt` and `wr_gray_nxt` for the next state of the Gray code pointers, `rd_gray` and `wr_gray` for current state Gray code pointers, and `rd_capture_ptr` and `wr_capture_ptr` for synchronization. Additional signals include `buf_avail` (indicates buffer space available for writing) and `buf_filled` (shows buffer space used).

Key blocks within the module include memory initialization for FIFO storage management, synchronization mechanisms (`RDSYNC` and `WRSYNC`) for managing read and write operations across clock domains, pointer management for read and write operations ensuring minimal synchronization errors, and control logic to manage FIFO status signals such as `full`, `empty`, and `almost_full`. The module ensures robust data handling through careful management of data reads/writes and employs Gray coding to mitigate issues arising from clock domain crossing.
