It generates system clocks and reset signals based on the input board-specific clocks (i_brd_clk_p and i_brd_clk_n) and a calibration complete signal (i_ddr_calib_done). The module includes differential signal buffering, PLL configuration for clock generation, synchronization mechanisms for reset signals, and ensures the system clock and reset are correctly derived and stabilized according to the calibration and PLL lock status. This setup is critical for maintaining reliable operation in FPGA-based designs, where precise clock management and reset synchronization are essential for correct functional behavior and performance."

It is a critical signal that initializes the system into a known state upon power-up or when manual or programmed conditions for reset occur.\n- `i_brd_clk_n` and `i_brd_clk_p`: These inputs are the differential clock signals from the board. They provide the primary clock source to the module. Usage of differential signals helps in reducing noise and improving the integrity of the clock signal at higher frequencies.\n- `i_ddr_calib_done`: This input indicates whether the calibration of DDR (Double Data Rate memory) has completed. It is used to ensure that the system operates based on stable and accurate memory operations post calibration.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `o_sys_rst`\n- `o_sys_clk`\n- `o_clk_200`\n\nExplanation:\n- `o_sys_rst`: This is the system reset output. It propagates the reset condition to other parts of the system either when the main board reset is asserted or when the DDR calibration is not completed, ensuring all parts of the system are synchronized in terms of reset.\n- `o_sys_clk`: This output is the system clock, derived from the onboard PLL module that conditions the input board clock to suit system requirements. This clock is used to drive the synchronous operations within the FPGA and possibly other connected subsystems.\n- `o_clk_200`: This output likely represents a specific clock output, possibly running at 200 MHz, derived and buffered from the input differential clock directly. It provides a high-speed clock to certain parts of the system that require faster clock rates compared to the base system clock."
