Module name: a25_shifter.
Module specification: The 'a25_shifter' module implements various bit-shifting operations on a 32-bit input data. These operations include logical left shift (LSL), logical right shift (LSR), arithmetic right shift (ASR), and rotate right (ROR), which are determined by a 2-bit input `i_function`. The module accepts the input `i_in` for the data to be shifted, a carry-in bit `i_carry_in`, an 8-bit shift amount `i_shift_amount`, a boolean `i_shift_imm_zero` that affects shift behavior, and outputs the shifted data `o_out` and a carry-out flag `o_carry_out`. Internally, the module utilizes signals `lsl_out`, `lsr_out`, `asr_out`, and `ror_out` to hold the results of respective shift operations. These signals are computed in the `generate` blocks which conditionally compile different shift mechanisms based on the `FULL_BARREL` parameter that enables full or quick barrel shifting functionality. Each type of shift function (`LSL`, `LSR`, `ASR`, and `ROR`) is processed in dedicated subsections within these blocks, implementing the specific shifting mechanism by appropriately manipulating the bit positions of `i_in` based on `i_shift_amount` and handling carry operations. The final output, including the shifted result and the carry out flag, is selected and assigned based on `i_function`.
