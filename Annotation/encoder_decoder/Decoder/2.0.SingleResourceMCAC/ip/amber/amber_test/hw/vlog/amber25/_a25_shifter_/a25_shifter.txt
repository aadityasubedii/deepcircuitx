The 'a25_shifter' module performs bit-shifting operations (logical/arithmetical shifts and rotations) on a 32-bit input based on the type of shift specified by the control signals. It supports four functions: logical left shift, logical right shift, arithmetic right shift, and rotate right, which are implemented via conditional generation blocks that adapt the shift mechanism to either a full or quick barrel shift style, governed by the `FULL_BARREL` parameter. The shifting logic adjusts bit position dynamically using the shift amount and carries flags, with outputs for the shifted data and a carry-out signal.
