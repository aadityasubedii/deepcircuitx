The `a25_alu` module performs arithmetic and logical operations on two 32-bit inputs, controlled by a 9-bit function selector, producing a 32-bit result and status flags. It features internal signals for data manipulation (input swapping, bitwise NOT operations), multiple operation results (AND, OR, XOR, etc.), and flexible output selection based on operation type. FPGA-optimized blocks accommodate specific hardware capabilities for enhanced performance.
