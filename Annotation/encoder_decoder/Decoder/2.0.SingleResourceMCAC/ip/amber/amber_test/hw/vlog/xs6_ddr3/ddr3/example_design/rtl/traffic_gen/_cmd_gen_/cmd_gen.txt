This module generates commands for memory operations, creating addresses, instructions, and burst lengths based on various modes and parameters. It implements address generation using BRAM, fixed, PRBS, or sequential methods, and supports different instruction types and burst length configurations. The module manages traffic control, read/write buffer availability, and timing for command generation. It utilizes pipelining for output and adapts its behavior based on the FPGA family (Spartan-6 or Virtex-6) and port mode. The implementation includes PRBS generators, address counters, and logic for handling refresh commands and forced write operations.
