The generation method and pattern length can be adjusted based on the parameters such as `PRBS_CMD` and `PRBS_WIDTH`. The module utilizes Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) tailored for different configurations to output a PRBS sequence. This output can be masked and modulated by address parameters, making it adaptable for testing and simulation purposes in different digital systems or integrated circuits."
