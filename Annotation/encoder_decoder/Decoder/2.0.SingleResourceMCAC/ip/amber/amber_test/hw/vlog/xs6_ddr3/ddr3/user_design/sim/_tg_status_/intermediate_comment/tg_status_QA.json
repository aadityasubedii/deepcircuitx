It captures error details when discrepancies between expected data (`cmp_data_i`) and received data (`rd_data_i`) occur, flagging the first instance of such an error and ignoring subsequent errors until it is reset either manually or through a system reset. The module uses several inputs to determine and report the status of the error, including address (`cmp_addr_i`), burst length (`cmp_bl_i`), and flags indicating the full or empty status of command, write, and read buffers. The `error_status` output packs all this error-related data, and an additional `error` output indicates the presence of an error condition."
