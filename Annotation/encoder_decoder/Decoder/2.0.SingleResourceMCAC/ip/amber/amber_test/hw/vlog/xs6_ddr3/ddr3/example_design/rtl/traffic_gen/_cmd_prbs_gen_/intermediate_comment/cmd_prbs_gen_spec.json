    "spec": "Module name: cmd_prbs_gen. \n\nModule specification: The 'cmd_prbs_gen' module is a configurable pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) generator designed primarily for testing and simulation in digital systems. It takes as inputs a clock signal (`clk_i`), a seed initialization signal (`prbs_seed_init`), a clock enable signal (`clk_en`), and a seed value (`prbs_seed_i`). The output (`prbs_o`) is the generated PRBS, which is dependent on the configuration of the module. Internally, the module uses `ZEROS`, a wire of zeros used in certain conditional outputs; `prbs`, a register holding the final PRBS output; and `lfsr_q`, a shift register implementing the linear feedback shift register (LFSR) responsible for generating the PRBS. Several blocks of the code are conditionally compiled based on parameters like `PRBS_CMD` and `PRBS_WIDTH`, which determine the specific PRBS generation scheme, including special configurations for 32-bit and 64-bit widths, modifying the bit manipulation according to device family specifics or other parameters. The code features generate blocks dedicated to handling different configurations (like address-based or instruction length-based PRBS) and modifying output generation based on the family of the FPGA and width parameters.",

It takes as inputs a clock signal (`clk_i`), a seed initialization signal (`prbs_seed_init`), a clock enable signal (`clk_en`), and a seed value (`prbs_seed_i`). The output (`prbs_o`) is the generated PRBS, which is dependent on the configuration of the module. Internally, the module uses `ZEROS`, a wire of zeros used in certain conditional outputs; `prbs`, a register holding the final PRBS output; and `lfsr_q`, a shift register implementing the linear feedback shift register (LFSR) responsible for generating the PRBS. Several blocks of the code are conditionally compiled based on parameters like `PRBS_CMD` and `PRBS_WIDTH`, which determine the specific PRBS generation scheme, including special configurations for 32-bit and 64-bit widths, modifying the bit manipulation according to device family specifics or other parameters. The code features generate blocks dedicated to handling different configurations (like address-based or instruction length-based PRBS) and modifying output generation based on the family of the FPGA and width parameters."
