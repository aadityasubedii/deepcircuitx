This module operates under the synchronization of the `MRxClk` clock input and includes several input ports such as `Reset`, `MRxDV`, `ByteCntEq0`, `ByteCntGreat2`, `MRxDEq5`, `Transmitting`, `MRxDEqD`, `IFGCounterEq24`, and `ByteCntMaxFrame`, which influence state transitions related to idle state detection, frame preamble handling, start of frame delimiter detection, data reception management, and frame dropping under error conditions. The output ports include `StateData` (a 2-bit signal comprising `StateData0` and `StateData1`), `StateIdle`, `StateDrop`, `StatePreamble`, and `StateSFD`, which indicate the current state of the frame processing. Internal signals such as `StartIdle`, `StartDrop`, `StartData0`, `StartData1`, `StartPreamble`, and `StartSFD` play pivotal roles in determining the conditions under which the machine transitions between states, optimizing the frame reception process. The Verilog code is organized into sections including signal assignment for internal state-transition triggers and a sequential `always` block that manages state transitions based on these triggers, all prefixed by the clock and reset conditions, ensuring accurate frame handling and robust error management in varying network conditions.",

It is asserted when MRxDV is low and if the current state is either StateDrop, StatePreamble, StateSFD, or any of the StateData states.\n- **StartDrop:** Dictates the transition to the Drop state under conditions where a frame needs to be discarded. This can occur when there's transmission during Idle, if there's a non-validation of IFG during the SFD state, or if a maximum frame size is reached during the data states.\n- **StartData0:** This signal is used to transition to the first data state (StateData0). It is asserted when MRxDV is high, indicating valid data, and the conditions of coming from an SFD state with MRxDEqD and IFGCounterEq24 being true or moving from the second data state (StateData1) are met.\n- **StartData1:** Controls the transition to the second data state (StateData1) directly from the first data state (StateData0). It is asserted when MRxDV remains high and the maximum frame size hasn't been reached.\n- **StartPreamble:** Initiates the transition to the Preamble state when MRxDV is high, MRxDEq5 is low, indicating the byte is not equal to 0x05, and the machine is either in the Idle state not transmitting.\n- **StartSFD:** Facilitates entry into the StateSFD when MRxDV is high and MRxDEq5 is true, marking detection of the Start Frame Delimiter, either typically from the Idle state (when not transmitting) or from the Preamble state."
