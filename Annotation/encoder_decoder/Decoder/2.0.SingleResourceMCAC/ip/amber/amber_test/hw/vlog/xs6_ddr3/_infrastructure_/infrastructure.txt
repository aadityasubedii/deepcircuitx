The 'infrastructure' module generates necessary clock and reset signals for a digital system using a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL), configurable for either differential or single-ended clock inputs. It manages multiple output clocks, synchronized and asynchronous reset signals with conditions based on PLL lock status. The module employs PLL_ADV for precise clock management, BUFG and BUFGCE for signal buffering, and BUFPLL_MCB for fine-tuned control over output clocks and reset functionalities, ensuring robust operation and stability across various system states.
