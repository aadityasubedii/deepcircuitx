The operation (addition or subtraction) is determined by the `i_sub` input signal. If `i_sub` is high, subtraction is performed; otherwise, addition is executed. Additionally, there is a carry input `i_cin` which is considered in the arithmetic operations. The results of the operation, the sum (or difference) and the carry output, are provided through `o_sum` and `o_co`, respectively. The underlying arithmetic processing is handled by the DSP48A1 block, which is instantiated as `u_dsp48` in the design."
