Each timer can be individually loaded, controlled, and monitored through specific registers that are accessible via the bus. The timers have functionalities such as load value and control, which include starting, stopping, and setting the speed of countdown through prescaler options. The module responds to read and write requests over the bus, updating internal timer values accordingly, and can signal interrupts when timers count down to zero. The output of each timer's current value, control settings, and interrupt status form part of the interface with the rest of the system, ensuring synchronization and proper sequence management in real-time operations. The module also includes debugging features to monitor the status and data flow throughout the module operation."
