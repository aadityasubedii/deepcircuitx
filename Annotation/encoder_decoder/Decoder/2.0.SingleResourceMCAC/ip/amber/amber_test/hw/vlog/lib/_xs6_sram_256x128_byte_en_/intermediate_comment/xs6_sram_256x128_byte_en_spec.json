It utilizes four instances of RAMB8BWER configured in a simple dual-port (SDP) mode. The input ports include `i_clk` (clock to synchronize operations), `i_write_data` (128-bit data to be written to the SRAM), `i_write_enable` (activates write operations when high), `i_address` (an 8-bit address selecting one of 256 memory locations), and `i_byte_enable` (16-bit signal for selective byte writing within a 128-bit word). The sole output port, `o_read_data`, outputs the 128-bit data retrieved from the specified address. The internal signal `byte_write_enable` is generated by combining `i_write_enable` with `i_byte_enable` to independently control the write enable status for each byte in the data word. The code has a generate block that iterates four times to instantiate four RAM blocks, setting their data width, addressing, and operational modes, along with byte write enables for partial data manipulation. An initial block checks for the correctness of the parameter settings, addressing any discrepancies with warnings. This comprehensive yet compact module is essential for applications demanding configurable data access and manipulation at the byte level in digital system memories.",

It is 128 bits wide, matching the data width of the SRAM.\n- `i_write_enable`: This signal enables the write operation.
