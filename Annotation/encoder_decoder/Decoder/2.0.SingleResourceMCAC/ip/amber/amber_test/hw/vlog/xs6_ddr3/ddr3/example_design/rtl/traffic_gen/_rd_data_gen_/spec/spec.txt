Module name: rd_data_gen.
Module specification: The `rd_data_gen` module is designed to generate read data for memory or data processing applications, particularly for FPGA designs with configurable settings for burst length and data width tailored to either SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6 families. The module includes several input ports: `clk_i` (clock signal), `rst_i` (reset signal), `prbs_fseed_i` (seed for pseudo-random data sequencing), `data_mode_i`, `cmd_valid_i`, `fixed_data_i`, `addr_i`, `bl_i` (burst length), and `data_rdy_i` (data ready signal). Output ports include `cmd_rdy_o` (command ready signal), `last_word_o`, `user_bl_cnt_is_1_o`, `data_valid_o`, and `data_o` (output data). Internal signals such as `cmd_start`, `cmd_rdy`, and `user_burst_cnt` manage command initiation, readiness, and burst count tracking, respectively. The code is divided into sections handling signal pipelining, command processing, counter management, and conditional operations specific to the FPGA family in use, integrating specialized data generation blocks for SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6, controlled by conditional generation structures in the code.
