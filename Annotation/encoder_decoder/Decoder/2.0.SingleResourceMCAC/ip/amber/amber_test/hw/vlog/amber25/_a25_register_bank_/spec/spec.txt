Module name: `a25_register_bank`.

Module specification: The `a25_register_bank` module is integral to a processor, serving as the managing entity for various register sets including general-purpose registers and special-purpose registers across differing CPU modes such as User, Supervisor, IRQ, and FIRQ. The module operates under inputs including clock (`clk`), reset (`reset`), mode signals from different stages (`i_mode_idec`, `i_mode_exec`), selection signals for register output (`i_rm_sel`, `i_rs_sel`, `i_rn_sel`), write enable signals (`i_pc_wen`, `i_reg_bank_wen`), and data inputs for registers (`i_pc`, `i_reg`, `i_wb_read_data`). Outputs from the module (`o_rm`, `o_rs`, `o_rd`, `o_rn`, `o_pc`) provide the values from selected registers crucial for execution stages in the CPU. Internally, the module uses mode-determining signals (`usr_exec`, `svc_exec`, `irq_exec`, `firq_exec`, `usr_idec`, `svc_idec`, `irq_idec`, `firq_idec`), write-enable conditionals (`read_data_wen`, `reg_bank_wen_c`, `pc_wen_c`, `pc_dmem_wen`), and output wiring for all registers which vary based on mode and external conditions. The code is structured into sections managing mode definitions, register write logic under various conditions, and output assignments based on current mode and selection, all synchronized by the `clk` input and controlled for initialization and reset conditions with a `reset` signal, ensuring robust and adaptable register management within the CPU architecture.
