Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: This module serves as a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) interface, handling the interface between user logic and memory devices (DDR, DDR2, or DDR3). It manages address and data operations, command processing, and I/O functions, supporting various memory configurations and pin counts. The module's input ports include clock signals (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), control signals (pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, pll_lock, sys_rst), and multiple port-specific signals for commands, data, and control. Output ports provide status information, memory interface signals, and data read from memory. Internal signals handle clock management, reset control, and various interface operations. The module incorporates IODRP2 components for delay adjustments, OSERDES2 for data serialization, an
