The cmd_prbs_gen module generates pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) for digital systems testing based on input seed values. It employs a configurable Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) which updates its state in response to the input clock and enables signals. Different PRBS patterns are produced through parameter-driven conditional code blocks that adapt LFSR feedback connections according to command (`PRBS_CMD`) and width (`PRBS_WIDTH`) settings, accommodating multiple application scenarios and FPGA families.
