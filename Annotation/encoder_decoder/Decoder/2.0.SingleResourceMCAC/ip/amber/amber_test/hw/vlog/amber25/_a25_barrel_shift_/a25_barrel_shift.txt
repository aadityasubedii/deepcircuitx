The `a25_barrel_shift` module implements a versatile barrel shifter capable of logical or arithmetic shifts on a 32-bit input, controlled via settings for shift amount and type. It leverages two internal configurations: a full barrel shifter for comprehensive needs and a quicker, simpler variant for less complex operations, chosen dynamically based on shift conditions. These modes are managed through internal multiplexing of results and stall detection, using signals and registers to ensure accurate and prompt output delivery under varying conditions.
