    "module": "The `data_prbs_gen` module generates a Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). It initializes with either a fixed or dynamic seed, controlled through several input ports for enhancements like clock enable and reset. The PRBS generation logic involves shifting and XOR operations on the internal LFSR state `lfsr_q`, updating it based on the clock inputs and seed values, with the resulting pseudo-random sequence outputted through `prbs_o`."
