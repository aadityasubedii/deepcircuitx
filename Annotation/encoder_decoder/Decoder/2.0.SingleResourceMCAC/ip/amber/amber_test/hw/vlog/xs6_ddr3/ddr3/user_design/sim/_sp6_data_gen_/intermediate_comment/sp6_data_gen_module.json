    "module": "This module generates diverse data patterns for memory interface testing and simulation. It supports multiple data widths and patterns, including fixed constant, walking ones/zeros, hammer, address-based, and PRBS. The module uses conditional generate blocks to adapt functionality based on data width and selected pattern. It processes input controls and parameters to produce the desired output data pattern, utilizing internal registers and combinational logic for pattern generation and manipulation."
