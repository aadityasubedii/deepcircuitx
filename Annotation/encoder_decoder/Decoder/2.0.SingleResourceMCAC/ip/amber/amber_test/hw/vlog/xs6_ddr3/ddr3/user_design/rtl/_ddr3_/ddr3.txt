This module implements a DDR3 SDRAM memory controller interface for FPGA designs. It manages communication between the FPGA and DDR3 memory by instantiating an infrastructure block for clock generation and a memory controller wrapper. The module provides multiple command, write, and read ports (p0 to p5) for flexible memory access, handles clock management, reset control, and various memory-specific signals required for DDR3 operation. It supports configuration of timing, port settings, and calibration parameters through module parameters.
