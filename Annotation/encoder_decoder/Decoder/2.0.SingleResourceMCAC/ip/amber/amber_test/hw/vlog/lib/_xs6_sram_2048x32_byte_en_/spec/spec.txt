Module name: xs6_sram_2048x32_byte_en. Module specification: This module implements a 2048x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA primitives. It utilizes four RAMB16BWER blocks, each handling 8 bits of the 32-bit data width. The module has input ports for clock (i_clk), write data (i_write_data), write enable (i_write_enable), address (i_address), and byte enable (i_byte_enable), and an output port for read data (o_read_data). Internal signals include wea, which combines write enable and byte enable signals, and data_out, which stores output data from each RAMB16BWER block. The module supports read and write operations with byte-level granularity, allowing individual
