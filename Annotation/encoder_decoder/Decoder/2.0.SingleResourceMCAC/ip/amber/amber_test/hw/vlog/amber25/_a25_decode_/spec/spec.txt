Module name: a25_decode. Module specification: This module is responsible for decoding ARM instructions in an ARM25 processor implementation. It takes inputs such as clock, reset, fetched instruction, core status, and interrupt signals, and generates control signals for other parts of the processor. The module handles different instruction types, manages the processor's control state, and handles interrupts and exceptions. Key input ports include clk, reset, i_fetch_instruction, i_core_stall, i_irq, i_firq, and i_execute_status_bits. Output ports include o_imm32, o_condition, o_decode_daccess, o_rm_sel, o_alu_function, o_reg_bank_wen, and o_copro_operation. Internal signals are used for instruction decoding, control state management, register selection, ALU control, and interrupt handling. The module is structured into
