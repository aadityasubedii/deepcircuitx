It accepts input data 'i_data' and outputs data 'o_data' while operating with two clocks, 'wr_clk' for writing and 'rd_clk' for reading. It supports operations to push data into the FIFO (i_push) and pop data out of the FIFO (i_pop). It also flags when the FIFO is full (o_full) and when it is empty (o_empty) to manage flow control. The FIFO uses Gray code conversion to ensure consistent data pointers in different clock domains, enhancing reliable data transfer without the need for a common clock or complex synchronization mechanisms."
