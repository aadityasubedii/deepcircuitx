Each bit of the 32-bit 'data_in' input can be written into the distributed RAM at a specific address defined by 'write_address', using the write clock 'wclk' and write enable 'we'. Similarly, data stored at addresses given by 'read_address' can be read out at the 32-bit 'data_out' output. Each RAM16X1D primitive handles a single bit of the input/output data, making up a total of 32 such primitives to handle the 32 bits. This allows simultaneous read and write operations at different addresses."

If 'we' is high, data is written to the RAM at the address specified by 'write_address'.\n- 'wclk' (write clock): This is the clock signal used for writing operations. It synchronizes the data writing to the RAM.\n- 'data_in' (data input): This is a 32-bit input port where each bit represents the data to be written into each corresponding single-bit RAM cell.\n- 'write_address': This is a 4-bit input that specifies the address in the RAM where 'data_in' should be written.\n- 'read_address': This is a 4-bit input that specifies the address from which data should be read, which appears at the 'data_out'.\n\nOutput ports: [data_out].\nExplanation: \n- 'data_out' (data output): This is a 32-bit output port that consists of data read from the RAM. The data comes from the address specified by 'read_address', allowing the user to read stored data from specified RAM locations.

Each of its 4 bits (waddr[0], waddr[1], waddr[2], waddr[3]) is connected to the corresponding address input of each RAM16X1D primitive used in the module.\n- 'raddr' (read address): Similar to 'waddr', 'raddr' is an internal signal that stems from the 'read_address' input.
