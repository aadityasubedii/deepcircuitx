    "spec": "Module name: afifo. Module specification: The afifo module is an asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer designed to facilitate data transfers between two different clock domains, using separate clocks for read (`rd_clk`) and write (`wr_clk`) operations. It supports parameterized data width (`DSIZE`), FIFO depth (`FIFO_DEPTH`), and address size (`ASIZE`). The input ports include `wr_clk` (write clock), `rst` (reset), `wr_en` (write enable), `wr_data` (write data), `rd_en` (read enable), and `rd_clk` (read clock). The output ports are `rd_data` (read data), `full` (indicates FIFO is full), `empty` (indicates FIFO is empty), and `almost_full` (early warning that FIFO is nearing full capacity). Key internal signals include `mem` (the memory buffer), pointer and address calculation related signals like `wr_ptr`, `rd_ptr`, `wr_addr`, `rd_addr`, and Gray code counters `wr_gray`, `rd_gray` for managing asynchronous read/write operations to avoid data corruption. The Verilog code implements blocks to handle pointer synchronization (`RDSYNC`, `WRSYNC`), pointer increment, memory read/write operations, and status flag updates, ensuring stable and reliable FIFO operation across differing clock domains.",

The output ports are `rd_data` (read data), `full` (indicates FIFO is full), `empty` (indicates FIFO is empty), and `almost_full` (early warning that FIFO is nearing full capacity). Key internal signals include `mem` (the memory buffer), pointer and address calculation related signals like `wr_ptr`, `rd_ptr`, `wr_addr`, `rd_addr`, and Gray code counters `wr_gray`, `rd_gray` for managing asynchronous read/write operations to avoid data corruption. The Verilog code implements blocks to handle pointer synchronization (`RDSYNC`, `WRSYNC`), pointer increment, memory read/write operations, and status flag updates, ensuring stable and reliable FIFO operation across differing clock domains."
