Module name: mcb_traffic_gen. Module specification: The 'mcb_traffic_gen' module is a traffic generator for memory controller blocks, specifically designed to facilitate the testing of memory operations in FPGA systems. It operates synchronized to a `clk_i` clock signal and can be reset through the `rst_i` signal. Key inputs include `run_traffic_i` to control traffic generation start/stop, `start_addr_i` and `end_addr_i` for defining memory operation address boundaries, and various seed and mode settings to configure operation characteristics. The module outputs signals such as `mcb_cmd_en_o`, which enables new commands to the memory controller, and `mcb_wr_en_o`, controlling write operations, among others detailing command instructions, addresses, and burst lengths. Internally, the module uses signals like `cmd2flow_cmd` and `wr_addr` to manage command flow control and data addressing respectively. It's organized into several sections handling specific tasks: command generation (`cmd_gen`), command flow control (`mcb_flow_control`), write and read data paths (`write_data_path`, `read_data_path`), and status handling (`tg_status`). This structure supports the generation of varied data and command patterns, thus enabling comprehensive testing of memory subsystems in different configurations and conditions.
