    "spec": "Module name: eth_clockgen. \nModule specification: The `eth_clockgen` module is designed to generate a slower clock signal (Mdc) based on a division of an input clock signal (Clk). This division is dictated by an 8-bit `Divider` input, which specifies how often the Mdc signal toggles in relation to the Clk input. The essential input ports include `Clk`, which is the primary clock signal; `Reset`, which initializes the module's state; and `Divider`, which sets the frequency division factor. Output ports consist of `Mdc`, the derived clock output; `MdcEn`, an enable signal active when Mdc is low; and `MdcEn_n`, an enable signal active when Mdc is high. Internal signals such as `CountEq0` (indicates when the counter reaches zero), `Counter` (a decrementing counter), `CounterPreset` (the initial value of the counter based on Divider), and `TempDivider` (adjusted Divider ensuring logical operations), assist in the module's operation. The Verilog code is structured into several functional blocks: one block handles the condition and initialization of the `Counter`, another toggles the `Mdc` signal and manages its states, and additional assignments compute control and preset values for the counting mechanism, enabling efficient and synchronized clock signal generation.",

It operates with a division value provided by the user through the `Divider` input. The module ensures that the Mdc signal frequency is half of the frequency determined by the `Divider` value by counting and toggling Mdc every time the counter reaches zero. The counting operation is managed by incrementing or resetting a counter based on the divided value and there are additional outputs, `MdcEn` and `MdcEn_n`, which indicate enable signals that are active at specific states of the Mdc output for synchronization purposes.\n"

This signal is essentially a slower frequency clock derived by dividing the Clk.\n- MdcEn: An output signal that indicates an enable state specifically when the Mdc output is in one state (typically low). This signal can be used for synchronization purposes to ensure operations align with a specific phase of Mdc.\n- MdcEn_n: An output signal complement to MdcEn, indicating an enable state specifically when the Mdc output is in the opposite state (typically high).

It informs the system when to toggle the Mdc output and reset the counter value based on the division settings.\n- Counter: An 8-bit register that operates as the main counting mechanism. It counts down from a preset value to zero, and the rate at which it counts is determined by the Divider value which indirectly sets the frequency of the Mdc output.\n- CounterPreset: A wire signal containing the value from which the Counter should start counting down. This value is calculated based on the Divider input, adjusted and then halved to determine the rate at which the Counter counts down to zero.\n- TempDivider: A wire that holds a modified version of the Divider input. If the Divider value is less than 2, it's set to 2; otherwise, it takes the actual Divider value. This ensures that the division factor is always logical for generating the Mdc clock signal properly."
