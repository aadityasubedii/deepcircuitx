    "spec": "Module name: eth_rxaddrcheck. \n\nModule specification: The `eth_rxaddrcheck` module is responsible for verifying the destination addresses of incoming Ethernet frames to decide if they should be accepted based on unicast, multicast, and broadcast address checks using a CRC hash technique. This module is equipped with input ports such as `MRxClk` (main clock for synchronization), `Reset` (reset signal), `RxData` (incoming data byte), various control signals (`Broadcast`, `r_Bro`, `r_Pro`, `PassAll`, `ControlFrmAddressOK`), byte count flags (`ByteCntEq2` to `ByteCntEq7`), hash tables (`HASH0`, `HASH1`), and `CrcHash` related signals (`CrcHash`, `CrcHashGood`). It also accepts state and frame end signals (`StateData`, `RxEndFrm`), `Multicast`, and the device's `MAC` address. The output ports include `RxAbort` (signal to abort the frame reception) and `AddressMiss` (flag for address mismatch).\n\nThe module employs several internal signals such as `BroadcastOK`, `RxAddressInvalid`, `RxCheckEn`, `HashBit`, `IntHash`, `ByteHash`, `MulticastOK`, and `UnicastOK` to facilitate various checks including unicast, multicast, and broadcast validations based on configurable settings and incoming frame properties. \n\nThe Verilog code includes distinct always blocks and combinatorial logic to handle various functionalities:\n1. Reset conditions and updating the output signals `RxAbort` and `AddressMiss` based on byte count checks and address validation results.\n2. Conditions to update flags `MulticastOK` and `UnicastOK` based on comparisons between the received data and stored addresses, or hash calculations.\n3. Derivation of internal hash values (`HashBit`, `IntHash`, `ByteHash`) for verifying multicast addresses using supplied hash tables.\n\nThis structured approach ensures the module reacts appropriately to incoming frames, either accepting them or signaling an abort based on the configured criteria and the nature of the received frames.",

This module is equipped with input ports such as `MRxClk` (main clock for synchronization), `Reset` (reset signal), `RxData` (incoming data byte), various control signals (`Broadcast`, `r_Bro`, `r_Pro`, `PassAll`, `ControlFrmAddressOK`), byte count flags (`ByteCntEq2` to `ByteCntEq7`), hash tables (`HASH0`, `HASH1`), and `CrcHash` related signals (`CrcHash`, `CrcHashGood`). It also accepts state and frame end signals (`StateData`, `RxEndFrm`), `Multicast`, and the device's `MAC` address. The output ports include `RxAbort` (signal to abort the frame reception) and `AddressMiss` (flag for address mismatch).\n\nThe module employs several internal signals such as `BroadcastOK`, `RxAddressInvalid`, `RxCheckEn`, `HashBit`, `IntHash`, `ByteHash`, `MulticastOK`, and `UnicastOK` to facilitate various checks including unicast, multicast, and broadcast validations based on configurable settings and incoming frame properties. \n\nThe Verilog code includes distinct always blocks and combinatorial logic to handle various functionalities:\n1. Reset conditions and updating the output signals `RxAbort` and `AddressMiss` based on byte count checks and address validation results.\n2. Conditions to update flags `MulticastOK` and `UnicastOK` based on comparisons between the received data and stored addresses, or hash calculations.\n3. Derivation of internal hash values (`HashBit`, `IntHash`, `ByteHash`) for verifying multicast addresses using supplied hash tables.\n\nThis structured approach ensures the module reacts appropriately to incoming frames, either accepting them or signaling an abort based on the configured criteria and the nature of the received frames."
