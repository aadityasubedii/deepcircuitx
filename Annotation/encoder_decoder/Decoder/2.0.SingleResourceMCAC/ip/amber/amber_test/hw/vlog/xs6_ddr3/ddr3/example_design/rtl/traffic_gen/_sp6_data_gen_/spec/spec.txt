Module name: sp6_data_gen. Module specification: The sp6_data_gen module is designed to generate various data patterns for memory testing and verification purposes. It supports multiple data widths (32, 64, and 128 bits) and can produce different patterns including fixed data, address-based, hammer, walking ones/zeros, and pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS). The module takes inputs such as clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), data mode (data_mode_i), command starts (cmd_startA to cmd_startE), and configuration parameters like address (addr_i) and burst count (user_burst_cnt). It outputs the generated data pattern (data_o) based on the selected mode and configuration. Internally, it uses registers like adata, hdata, ndata, and w1data to store different pattern types, and employs generate blocks to handle various data wi
