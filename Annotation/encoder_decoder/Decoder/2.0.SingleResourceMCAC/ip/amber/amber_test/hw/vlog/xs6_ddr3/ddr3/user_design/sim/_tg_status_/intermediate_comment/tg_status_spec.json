Module specification: The tg_status module is designed to monitor and report error statuses related to data mismatches within a system, specifically between expected data (cmp_data_i) and received data (rd_data_i). It flags the first occurrence of an error and maintains this status until reset either manually or automatically. The module operates with several input ports: clk_i (clock signal), rst_i (reset signal), manual_clear_error (manual reset input), data_error_i (indicates a data-related error), cmp_data_i and rd_data_i (representing expected and received data, respectively), cmp_addr_i (data comparison address), cmp_bl_i (data burst length), mcb_cmd_full_i, mcb_wr_full_i, mcb_rd_empty_i (which indicate full or empty states of command, write, and read buffers). The outputs are error_status (a register holding error details including error address, burst length, buffer statuses, and data comparisons) and error (a flag indicating the occurrence of an error). Internally, the module uses two significant signals: data_error_r (stores the prior state of data_error_i to detect signal transitions) and error_set (indicates whether an error has been detected and retained). The Verilog implementation consists of sequential logic blocks triggered by the rising edge of the clock; these blocks manage error detection, status registration, and resets based on specified conditions.",
