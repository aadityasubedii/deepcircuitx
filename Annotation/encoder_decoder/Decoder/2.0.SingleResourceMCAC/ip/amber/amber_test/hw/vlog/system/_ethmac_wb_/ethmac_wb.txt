The 'ethmac_wb' module interfaces an Ethernet MAC with a Wishbone bus, accommodating dual-role functionality as both master and slave. It utilizes parameters WB_DWIDTH and WB_SWIDTH to handle variable data and select line widths, adapting the data path through conditional generate blocks that cater to 32-bit and 128-bit setups. The module efficiently manages address-based byte selection and endianess adjustments, supporting robust data alignment and transmission integrity in diverse system configurations.
