It handles different states such as ready, read, write, command wait, and refresh, using input signals like command validity and types, address, burst length, and memory controller buffer statuses. The module ensures that commands are prepared and transferred only when the system and memory controller are ready, managing state transitions based on command and data ready signals, and handles the full conditions of command buffers to maintain efficient data flow and command processing."
