Module name: wr_data_gen.

Module specification: The 'wr_data_gen' module is tailored for creating write data patterns for memory interfaces. It operates differently depending on the technology family (SPARTAN6 or VIRTEX6) specified by the parameter `FAMILY`. The module manages readiness signals for memory write commands and the flow of data, ensuring synchronization and timing in high-speed environments. It accepts inputs such as a clock signal (`clk_i`), reset signal (`rst_i`), PRBS feed seed (`prbs_fseed_i`), data mode (`data_mode_i`), command validity signals (`cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_validB_i`, `cmd_validC_i`), fixed data (`fixed_data_i`), address (`addr_i`), burst length (`bl_i`), and a data ready signal (`data_rdy_i`). It outputs the command ready signal (`cmd_rdy_o`), an indicator if the current word is the last (`last_word_o`), a data valid signal (`data_valid_o`), the data itself (`data_o`), and an end of data write signal (`data_wr_end_o`). Internal signals such as data registers (`data`), command readiness flags (`cmd_rdy` series), command start flags (`cmd_start` series), user burst count (`user_burst_cnt`), and several flags and counters manage state and control flow within the module. The code is divided into sections handling command initiation, burst count management, data generation based on the family type, and readiness signal management. Conditional generation blocks instantiate specific data generation submodules (`sp6_data_gen` or `v6_data_gen`) depending on the technology family, which handle the bulk of data pattern generation and output.
