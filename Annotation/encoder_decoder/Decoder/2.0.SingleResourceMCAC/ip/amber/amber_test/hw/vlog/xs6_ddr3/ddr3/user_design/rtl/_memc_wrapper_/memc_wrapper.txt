This module implements a configurable memory controller wrapper for interfacing with external memory (DDR/DDR2/DDR3). It supports up to 6 ports and multiple AXI interfaces, handling memory timing, calibration, and various configurations. The wrapper instantiates an mcb_ui_top submodule that manages the core memory controller functionality, including command processing, data read/write operations, and AXI transactions. It provides flexible memory access through different interfaces and protocols, making it suitable for complex systems requiring high-performance memory operations.
