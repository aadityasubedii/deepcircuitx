    "module": "The `tg_status` module monitors and logs data errors in a system by comparing expected and received data values and tracking system state at the time of error occurrence. It leverages clock-driven logic to manage signal registration, and error flagging based on input conditions, utilizing internal flags to prevent overwriting of existing errors until reset. The module outputs comprehensive error details enabling effective debugging and system management."
