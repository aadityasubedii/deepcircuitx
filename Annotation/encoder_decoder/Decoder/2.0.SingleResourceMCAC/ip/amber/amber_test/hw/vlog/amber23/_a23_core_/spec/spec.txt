Module name: a23_core. 
Module specification: The a23_core module is an integral component of a processor core that manages the operations involved in executing instructions including fetching, decoding, and handling various exceptions and interrupts. The inputs to this module include a clock signal (i_clk) for synchronization, standard and fast interrupt requests (i_irq, i_firq) to handle different priority operations, and signals from the Wishbone bus (i_wb_dat, i_wb_ack, i_wb_err) indicating data, acknowledgment, and errors, respectively. Also, i_system_rdy indicates the readiness of the connected systems. Outputs include the address (o_wb_adr), selected bytes (o_wb_sel), data direction (o_wb_we), data (o_wb_dat), transaction signals (o_wb_cyc, o_wb_stb) to interact with the Wishbone bus. Internally, signals such as execute_address, write_data, and read_data, alongside control flags for cache operations, privilege mode, and processing status among others, handle the core's operational states and data flow. Several sub-modules (a23_fetch, a23_decode, a23_execute, a23_coprocessor) are interconnected to implement these functionalities, handling specific tasks like fetching instructions, decoding them, executing them, and managing coprocessor interactions. These sub-modules ensure the module processes and responds appropriately to internal and external control flows, allowing successful operation within a larger CPU architecture.
