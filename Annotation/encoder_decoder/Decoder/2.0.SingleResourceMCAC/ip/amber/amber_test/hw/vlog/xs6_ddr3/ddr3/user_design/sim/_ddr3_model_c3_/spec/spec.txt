Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module represents a behavioral model of a DDR3 SDRAM memory device. It simulates the timing and functionality of DDR3 memory operations, including read and write operations, command decoding, and various timing checks. The module has input ports for clock, control signals, address, and data, as well as inout ports for bidirectional data and data strobe signals. Key internal signals include timing parameters, pipeline registers, and state variables for tracking bank status, power modes, and initialization progress. The code is organized into several main blocks: initialization and reset logic, command decoding and execution, data input/output handling, and timing checks. It implements features such as different operating modes, bank management, and adherence to DDR3 timing specifications. The module also includes error checking for timing violations and illegal commands, making it useful for verifying DDR3 memory controller designs
