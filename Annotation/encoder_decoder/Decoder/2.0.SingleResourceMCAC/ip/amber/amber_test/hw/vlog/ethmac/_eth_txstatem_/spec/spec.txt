Module name: eth_txstatem. 
Module specification: The "eth_txstatem" is a Verilog module designed as a state machine for managing Ethernet transmission processes. This module operates under the Ethernet Management Transmit Clock (MTxClk) and features a variety of inputs like Reset, ExcessiveDefer, CarrierSense, and numerous control flags such as TxStartFrm, TxEndFrm, and Collision, which guide the state machine through various transmission states such as IDLE, IPG, and Preamble among others. The outputs of the module include StateIdle, StateIPG, StatePreamble, and other state indicators that signal the current status of the transmitter. Internal signals such as StartIdle, StartPAD, and Rule1 are crucial for determining transitions between states based on conditions like nibble counts met or the presence of collisions. The code is structured into blocks primarily handling signal assignments, and sequential logic through always blocks, overseeing state transitions and internal rule management conditioned on input signals and current states to ensure correct operations as per Ethernet standards.
