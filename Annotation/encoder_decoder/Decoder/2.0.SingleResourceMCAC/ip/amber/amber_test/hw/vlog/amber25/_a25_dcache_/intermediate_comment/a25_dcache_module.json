    "module": "This module implements a configurable data cache for a processor, supporting multiple ways (2, 3, 4, or 8) with a write-back policy. It handles read and write operations, cache hits and misses, and exclusive accesses. The cache uses a finite state machine to manage operations, including initialization, idle state, fill, and write-back. It interfaces with the processor core and external memory, using tag and data memories for each way. The module employs a least-recently-used (LRU) replacement policy and includes logic for cache line filling, invalidation, and replacement. It also features debug capabilities and supports different FPGA implementations."
