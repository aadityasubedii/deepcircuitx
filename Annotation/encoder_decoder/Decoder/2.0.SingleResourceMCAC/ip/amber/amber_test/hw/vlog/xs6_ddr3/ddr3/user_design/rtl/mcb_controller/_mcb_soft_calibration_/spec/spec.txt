Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), handling initialization, impedance matching, and dynamic calibration of DQS delays. It operates through a state machine, adjusting various parameters to optimize memory interface timing and performance. Key inputs include UI_CLK (clock), RST (reset), PLL_LOCK (PLL lock signal), and SELFREFRESH_REQ (self-refresh request). Important outputs are DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL (calibration completion indicator), SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ (MCB self-refresh request), and various MCB control signals. Internal signals include P_Term and N_Term (termination values), STATE (current state of the calibration state machine), and DQS_DELAY (DQS delay value). The module is divided into several sections: initialization, term
