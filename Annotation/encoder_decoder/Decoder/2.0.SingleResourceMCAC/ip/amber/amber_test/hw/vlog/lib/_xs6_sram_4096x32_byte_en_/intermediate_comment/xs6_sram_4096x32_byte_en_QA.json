It consists of 8 RAMB16BWER primitives, each handling 8 bits of the 32-bit data width. The module supports read and write operations with byte-level granularity, allowing individual byte writes within a 32-bit word. The SRAM is organized into two banks of 2048x32 bits each, selected by the most significant address bit. The module includes extensive initialization parameters for each RAMB16BWER primitive, allowing pre-loading of SRAM contents if desired."
