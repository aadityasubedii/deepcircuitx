Its primary function is to store recently accessed instruction data to speed up execution by reducing the number of times the processor needs to fetch data from main memory. It features parametrizable cache lines, words per line, and ways, supporting multiple cache configurations. The module handles cache operations such as fetching data on cache misses, writing new data into the cache, managing cache flushing, and deciding which cache way to write new data into (based on least recently used or other strategies). It also includes handling signals for stall conditions when the cache is busy, and supporting test and debugging modes."
