Module name: uart. Module specification: This module implements a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) interface with configurable baud rates, FIFO buffers, and interrupt generation. It handles both transmitting (TXD) and receiving (RXD) data serially, supporting Wishbone bus interface for register access and configuration. The module has input ports for clock (i_clk), Wishbone bus signals (i_wb_*), UART inputs (i_uart_cts_n, i_uart_rxd), and output ports for Wishbone responses (o_wb_*), UART outputs (o_uart_int, o_uart_txd, o_uart_rts_n). Internal signals include FIFO buffers, state machines for transmit and receive operations, and various control registers. The code is organized into sections for FIFO management, transm
