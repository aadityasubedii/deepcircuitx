Module name: eth_txcounters.
Module specification: The `eth_txcounters` module is designed for managing counters and flags related to the transmission process in an Ethernet setting, particularly focusing on detailed counting of bytes and nibbles during different transmission states. The module employs various input ports such as `MTxClk` (the main synchronization clock), `Reset` (resets counters), state indicators (`StatePreamble`, `StateIPG`, etc.), state initiators (`StartDefer`, `StartIPG`, etc.), frame length limits (`MinFL`, `MaxFL`), and several enable signals (`HugEn`, `ExDfrEn`, `DlyCrcEn`). Its outputs include counters like `ByteCnt`, `NibCnt`, and several flags signaling conditions like `ExcessiveDefer`, `MaxFrame`, and others that relate to specific nibble counts and CRC calculation delays. Internal signals such as `IncrementNibCnt`, `ResetNibCnt`, `IncrementByteCnt`, and `ExcessiveDeferCnt` help manage counting and detection processes based on transmission state and frame properties. The Verilog code is structured into blocks handling the incrementing and resetting of nibble and byte counters, determining specific count conditions, and managing delayed CRC processes. Each block utilizes conditional logic based on input states and transitions to correctly update outputs reflective of current transmission conditions and constraints.
