Module name: iodrp_mcb_controller. Module specification: The 'iodrp_mcb_controller' is a Verilog module designed to handle the interface control for DRAM memory cells in read and write operations with additional control operations. This module features input ports like 'memcell_address' and 'write_data' for addressing and data handling, 'rd_not_write' for selecting operation mode, 'cmd_valid' for command validity, alongside several DRAM-specific signals (e.g., 'drp_ioi_addr', 'sync_rst', 'DRP_CLK') and output signals (e.g., 'read_data', 'rdy_busy_n', 'DRP_CS', 'DRP_SDI').  Internally, it uses registers like 'memcell_addr_reg' and 'data_reg' to store current memory cell address and data. There are also signals like 'bit_cnt' and 'state' for managing operation counts and states within a Finite State Machine (FSM). Key sections of the code include initial state setting, data handling mechanisms through tasks like 'shift_n_expand', and multiple always blocks for managing state transitions, data shifting, and output control based on the synchronous clock and reset conditions. The FSM is crucial for directing the flow through various operational phases such as 'ADDR_PHASE' and 'DATA_PHASE', coordinating timing and data exchange with DRAM.
