Module name: system. Module specification: The system module is a top-level design for an embedded processor system with various peripherals. It integrates an Amber processor core (either A23 or A25), memory interfaces (boot and main memory), communication interfaces (UART and Ethernet), timers, and interrupt controllers. The module uses a Wishbone bus architecture for inter-component communication. Input ports include board-level reset and clock signals, test and scan inputs, UART inputs, and Ethernet MAC interface inputs. Output ports consist of UART outputs, DDR3 memory control signals, Ethernet MAC outputs, and LED indicators. Inout ports are used for DDR3 memory data and Ethernet management data. Key internal signals include system clock and reset, DDR3 memory controller interface signals, Wishbone bus signals for masters and slaves, and various interrupt signals. The module is divided into several blocks: clock and reset generation,
