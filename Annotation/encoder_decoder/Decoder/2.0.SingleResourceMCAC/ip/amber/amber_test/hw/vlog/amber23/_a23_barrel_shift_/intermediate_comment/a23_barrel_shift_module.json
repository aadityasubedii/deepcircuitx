    "module": "The a23_barrel_shift module performs logical and arithmetic shifting operations on a 32-bit input based on specified parameters. Controlled by the 2-bit i_function input, it supports logical left shift (LSL), logical right shift (LSR), arithmetic right shift (ASR), and rotate right (ROR). The shift amount is defined by an 8-bit input, i_shift_amount, while the 1-bit i_shift_imm_zero can modify operations under specific conditions. Internal wires for each shift type prepare shifted outputs, which are then selected and output through multiplexing based on the shift mode provided."
