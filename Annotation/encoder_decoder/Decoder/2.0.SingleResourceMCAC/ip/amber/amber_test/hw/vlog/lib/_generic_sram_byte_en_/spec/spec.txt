Module name: `generic_sram_byte_en`.
Module specification: The `generic_sram_byte_en` is a parameterized SRAM module with byte enable features that supports selective byte updating during write operations, suitable for versatile memory interactions in digital systems. It operates based on a `DATA_WIDTH` for the size of data and an `ADDRESS_WIDTH` for memory addressing, storing data in the internal `mem` array. Input ports include `reset` and `clk` for handling memory initialization and data transactions on rising clock edges, `test_mode` and `scan_enable` with `scan_in0` through `scan_in4` for integrating into a scan chain testing structure, `i_write_data` for data to be written to memory, `i_write_enable` as a control signal governing writing actions, and `i_address` with `i_byte_enable` for specifying memory addresses and enabling specific byte updates respectively. Output ports feature `scan_out0` through `scan_out4` to propagate scan testing data and `o_read_data`, which either delivers stored data or zeros depending upon whether a write operation is active. Internal signals `i` and `j` serve as loop indices for byte-wise data manipulation during write operations and memory initialization on reset. The core functionality comprises an `always` block that manages data write conditions, memory initialization during reset, and ensuring output data reflects current memory state post-write operations, improving the moduleâ€™s operational integrity and flexibility in memory management.
