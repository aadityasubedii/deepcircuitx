Module name: generic_iobuf.
Module specification: The 'generic_iobuf' module is designed to manage a bidirectional IO pin with control over its input and output behavior via a control signal. The module features two input ports: 'I' and 'T'. 'I' serves as the digital input that is driven to the 'IO' pin when 'T' is low. 'T' is a control signal; when high, it sets the 'IO' pin to a high impedance state (Z-state), effectively making the pin act as an input or disconnecting it, and when low, the 'IO' pin outputs the value from 'I'. The outputs of the module are 'O' and 'IO'. 'O' mirrors the current state of the 'IO' pin, providing visibility into the pin's mode and value, while 'IO' is the bidirectional pin that can either output the value of 'I' or enter a high impedance state as dictated by 'T'. Internally, there are no signals used; the module operates purely through the direct connections and assignments between the ports. Two main blocks of code define the module's operation: the assignment of 'O' to mirror the state of 'IO', and the conditional assignment of 'IO' based on the control signal 'T', switching between an output driven by 'I' and a high impedance state.
