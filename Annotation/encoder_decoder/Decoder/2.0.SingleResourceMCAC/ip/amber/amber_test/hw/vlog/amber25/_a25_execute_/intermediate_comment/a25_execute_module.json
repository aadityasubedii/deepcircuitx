    "module": "The a25_execute module implements the execution stage of an ARM processor pipeline, performing arithmetic and logical operations, address calculations, and register updates. It utilizes an ALU, barrel shifter, multiplier, and register bank to process instructions based on various control signals. The module manages data flow between different pipeline stages, handles conditional execution, updates processor status flags, and generates memory addresses for instruction and data access. It also supports different operating modes and handles interrupts by managing appropriate status bits and vector addresses."
