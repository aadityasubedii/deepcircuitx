It supports functionality to read or write data to specific coprocessor registers based on different operations indicated by the input signals. The module processes data dependent on specific opcodes, control registers (crn), and operations and maintains registers for cache control, cacheable areas, updateable areas, fault status, and fault address. Debugger statements integrated into the code also suggest its utility in development or testing phases to trace and display the values of internal states and operations. The module reacts to faults by capturing fault status and address, and facilitates enabling or controlling cache operations, flushing cache, and defining cacheable areas."
