    "module": "The a25_decode module decodes ARM instructions and generates control signals for an ARM25 processor. It implements instruction decoding logic, handles different instruction types, manages processor control states, and processes interrupts and exceptions. The module uses a state machine to control execution flow, decodes instructions based on their type, and generates appropriate control signals for ALU operations, register selection, memory access, and coprocessor interactions. It also handles conditional execution, addressing modes, and status flag updates, ensuring proper instruction execution and processor state management."
