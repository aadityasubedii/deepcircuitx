It interfaces through input ports: `i_clk` (the clock signal synchronizing module operations), `i_write_data` (32-bit data to be written to memory), `i_write_enable` (enables data writing when high), `i_address` (an 8-bit address for data positioning), and `i_byte_enable` (4-bit mask allowing selective byte updating inside the data width). The sole output port, `o_read_data`, outputs the data read from the specified memory address. Internally, the module utilizes signals `nc31`, `nc32`, `nc33`, and `nc22` as unused, with `wea` (write enable array) deriving from the `i_write_enable` and `i_byte_enable` to form a 4-bit mask controlling which bytes are written to the memory. The RAMB8BWER is configured in the code block with parameters like data width and operation modes, and it handles the actual data storing and retrieval logic based on the inputs from the module's interface. Initial conditions verify that `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDRESS_WIDTH` parameters correctly set to 32 and 8, respectively, alerting any discrepancies. This organization ensures a robust design enabling selective data manipulation with byte-level granularity in a simulated SRAM environment.",

The input signals include a clock (i_clk), write data (i_write_data), write enable (i_write_enable), address (i_address), and byte enable (i_byte_enable). The output signal is the read data (o_read_data). The module also features parameter checks for data width and address width to ensure they are set to the correct predefined values. The memory write operation is conditioned by both the write enable and byte enable signals to allow selective writing to specific byte lanes within the 32-bit data width."
