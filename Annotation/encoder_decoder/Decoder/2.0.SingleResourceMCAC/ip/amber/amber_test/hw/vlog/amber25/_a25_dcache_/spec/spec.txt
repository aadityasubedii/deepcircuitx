Module name: a25_dcache. Module specification: This module implements a configurable data cache for a processor, supporting multiple ways (2, 3, 4, or 8) with a write-back policy. It handles read and write operations, cache hits and misses, and exclusive accesses. The module interfaces with the processor core and external memory through input ports (clk, reset, i_request, i_exclusive, i_write_data, i_write_enable, i_address, i_byte_enable, i_cache_enable, i_cache_flush, i_wb_cached_rdata, i_wb_cached_ready) and output ports (o_read_data, o_stall, o_wb_cached_req). Internal signals manage cache state (c_state), way selection (select_way, next_way), data and tag memory access (tag_rdata_way,
