The "test" module is designed to test the "wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge" module using scan-based test methodologies, ensuring its functionality and integrity. This module configures and initializes the internal and input signals, sets scan chains, controls testing modes, and optionally annotates timing simulations using SDF for precise environmental setup, simulated via an initial block that initializes all conditions and ends the simulation.
