It inputs include 'reset', 'clk' (clock), 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' (for feeding test data), 'scan_enable' (activates scan test mode), and 'test_mode' (configures the bridge's behavior for testing). The outputs are 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4', which are used to output the results of the scan tests, encapsulating the internal state of the bridge for verification or diagnostics. The internal signals mirror these inputs and outputs facilitating the control and operation of the bridge during tests. Internally, the module initializes signals to known states (low) and optionally annotates timing simulation through SDF (Standard Delay Format) if compiled with `SDFSCAN` defined. The initial block sets the timing format, performs optional SDF annotation, initializes all inputs and control signals to low, and then terminates simulation with `$finish`. This setup ensures that all functional and time parameters are correctly initialized for a controlled test environment.",
