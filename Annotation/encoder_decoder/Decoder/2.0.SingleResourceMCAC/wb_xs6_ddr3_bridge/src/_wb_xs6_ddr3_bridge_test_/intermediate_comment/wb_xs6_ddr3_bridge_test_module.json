    "module": "The 'test' module serves to simulate and test the 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge' module, specifically its interactions with DDR3 memory via a Wishbone interface. It implements this by initializing various inputs like the clock, reset, scan chains, and mode signals, and connects these to the 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge'. Outputs associated with scan chains allow observation of internal states under different test conditions. The module also supports SDF annotations for accurate timing simulations when the `SDFSCAN` flag is defined, providing a comprehensive environment to validate and debug the DDR3 interface behavior."
