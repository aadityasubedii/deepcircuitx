    "spec": "Module name: test.\nModule specification: The 'test' module is designed to facilitate the testing and simulation of the 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge' module, which is responsible for managing DDR3 memory interactions via a Wishbone interface. The module inputs include a clock signal (`clk`), a reset signal (`reset`), five scan chain inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`), a scan enable signal (`scan_enable`), and a test mode signal (`test_mode`). These inputs help in synchronizing operations, resetting to initial conditions, testing internal states through scan chains, enabling scan mode, and specifying operational modes respectively. The outputs from the module are five scan chain outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`), which mirror the results of the internal scan chain propagation of the interfaced 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge'. Internally, the module wires up these scan outputs directly from the 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge', and these are used as observability points for verifying internal behavior, especially within test or debug modes.\n\nThe code is organized into initial block settings where input signals are initialized and the simulation environment is set up, including the application of SDF (Standard Delay Format) for timing check conditional upon the `SDFSCAN` flag. This setup contributes to a structured simulation environment for thorough testing and diagnosis of the DDR3 interface module under different configurations and operational states. The inclusion of detailed timing annotations for scan test modes and appropriate initialization of all control signals ensures a robust framework for simulating and debugging the module within expected functional scenarios.",
