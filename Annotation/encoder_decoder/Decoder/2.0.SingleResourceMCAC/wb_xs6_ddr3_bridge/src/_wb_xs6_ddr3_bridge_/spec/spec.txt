Module name: wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge. Module specification: The "wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge" module acts as a bridge interface between the Wishbone bus protocol and DDR3 memory, effectively managing data transfer, control, and address translation adjustments. It handles the input ports `i_clk` (the main clock signal), `i_mem_ctrl` (memory control toggle affecting address mapping), `i_wb_adr`, `i_wb_sel`, and `i_wb_we` (Wishbone address, select, and write enable signals), `i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_cyc`, and `i_wb_stb` (Wishbone data, cycle valid, and strobe signals), `i_cmd_full`, `i_wr_full` (indicators from DDR3 for command queue and write buffer statuses), `i_rd_data` (DDR3 read data), and `i_rd_empty` (read buffer status). Its outputs include `o_wb_dat` (Wishbone data output), `o_wb_ack`, `o_wb_err` (Wishbone acknowledge and error signals), `o_cmd_en`, `o_cmd_instr`, `o_cmd_byte_addr` (DDR3 command controls), `o_wr_en`, `o_wr_mask`, and `o_wr_data` (DDR3 write controls). Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `write_request`, `read_request`, `write_request_r`, `read_request_r`, and their respective registers to control data flow and request registration. Additionally, buffers for Wishbone signals (`wb_sel_buf_r`, `wb_dat_buf_r`, `wb_adr_buf_r`) manage interim data during busy DDR3 states. The module's logic is divided mainly into sections that handle DDR3 command queue management, data writing to DDR3 based on command saturation; data buffering when commands can't be immediately executed; data routing from buffers on command availability; DDR3 read and write data alignments based on the bus width parameters; and read/write acknowledgments back to the Wishbone bus. This comprehensive design ensures efficient interfacing and data handling between the varying protocols of Wishbone and DDR3 systems.
