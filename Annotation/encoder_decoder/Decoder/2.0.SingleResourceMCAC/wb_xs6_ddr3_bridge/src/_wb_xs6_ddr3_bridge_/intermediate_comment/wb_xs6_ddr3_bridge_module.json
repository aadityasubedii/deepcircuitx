    "module": "The wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge module acts as an interface between the Wishbone bus protocol and DDR3 memory, managing read and write operations through data, control, and address handling. It processes input signals from the Wishbone bus and DDR3 feedback, generating appropriate control signals and handling data transfer and buffering. The module uses conditional checks and register assignments within clock-triggered blocks to manage data flow, address translation, and buffering, ensuring efficient synchronization between the differing protocols of the Wishbone bus and DDR3 memory."
