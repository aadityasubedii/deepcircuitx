This Verilog directive sets the simulation time unit and precision both to 1 nanosecond, ensuring that all timing in simulations is measured with consistent resolution. This setting is crucial for achieving accurate simulation results and does not pertain to a specific moduleâ€™s functionality but applies generally across the simulation environment where it is declared.
