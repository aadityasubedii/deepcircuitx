    "module": "The 'test_module' interfaces with the Wishbone bus protocol to facilitate read and write operations while adapting to testing and diagnostics functionalities. It employs input and output ports for communication and control signals such as clock, reset, data, and address lines. Internally, the module uses registers and timers to manage data transactions and status monitoring. Logical blocks within the module handle synchronization of bus signals, error handling, interrupt generation, and UART operations, ensuring robust interfacing and system diagnostics in compliance with bus standards."
