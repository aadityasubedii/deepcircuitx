Module name: test_module. 
Module specification: The 'test_module' is a Verilog module that interfaces with the Wishbone bus protocol and is designed for handling data transactions from the bus with additional functionalities for testing and diagnostics. The module operates with input ports including a clock signal (`clk`), asynchronous reset (`reset`), multiple scan chain inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`), and Wishbone bus signals such as address (`i_wb_adr`), data input (`i_wb_dat`), and control signals (`i_wb_we`, `i_wb_cyc`, `i_wb_stb`). Output ports include scan chain outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`), Wishbone data output (`o_wb_dat`), acknowledge signal (`o_wb_ack`), and error signal (`o_wb_err`), among others. Internal signals like timers (`firq_timer`, `irq_timer`), various control and status registers (`tb_uart_control_reg`, `sim_ctrl_reg`, `cycles_reg`), and data handling wires (`wb_wdata32`, `wb_rdata32`) are pivotal for module operations and status monitoring. The module comprises several procedural blocks managing clock-sensitive resets, read and write operations synchronized with the bus cycle, handling UART communications, and generating interrupts or errors based on specific conditions. These elements collectively enable the module to effectively manage data transfers, control mechanisms, and diagnostic functionalities in a synchronized manner with external systems and test environments.
