The 'test' module serves as a testbench for verifying the 'test_module', focusing on scan and test mode functionalities. It initializes control signals like clock, reset, scan inputs, and modes, and interfaces with the 'test_module' through specified inputs and outputs. The initial block sets up the environment, applying SDF annotations under the SDFSCAN condition, and concludes the simulation with a `$finish` command after initializing all signals.
