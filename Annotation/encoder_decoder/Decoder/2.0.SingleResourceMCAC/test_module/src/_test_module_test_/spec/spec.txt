Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is a testbench designed to verify the functionality of the 'test_module', primarily used for examining the operation under various scan and test configurations. It interfaces with 'test_module' via multiple input and output ports. Input ports include `clk` (clock signal driving module timing), `reset` (signal to initialize or clear module state), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (used to inject scan test vectors), `scan_enable` (activates the scan test mode), and `test_mode` (toggles the module into a test mode). Output ports comprise `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, which output data from 'test_module' after processing the test inputs, useful for observing its internal state or responses. Internally, the module utilizes signals declared as either wire or reg types to connect and manage state control through the 'test_module'. Noteworthy sections in the code include the instantiation of 'test_module', simulation setup within an 'initial' block where test conditions are defined and the module behavior is initialized, and conditionally, the use of SDF annotations for timing simulations controlled by the `SDFSCAN` compiler directive. This setup culminates in a simulation premature conclusion with a `$finish` command after all signal initializations.
