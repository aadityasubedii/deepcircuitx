    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: The 'test' module is designed to simulate and test the functionality of an embedded 'test_module' in a test environment. It manages system-level inputs such as clock (clk), reset, scan input ports (scan_in0 to scan_in4), scan enable, and test mode signals, essential for validating the 'test_module' under various conditions including specialized scan-based testing (`ifdef SDFSCAN`). The input ports include clk, reset, and scan_in0 to scan_in4, each serving a specific purpose from clocking to inputting test data. The scan_enable and test_mode are additional input ports that activate scan operations and specific test features within the 'test_module'. Correspondingly, output ports scan_out0 to scan_out4 are used to monitor the outcomes from the scan tests. Internally, these signals facilitate synchronization, state resetting, test data injection, and mode selections within 'test_module', as well as result observation. The Verilog code mainly consists of an instantiating block for the 'test_module' linking these ports and signals to their respective outputs, and an initial block which initializes all inputs, optionally annotates timing data for scan tests through `$sdf_annotate` if scan testing is enabled, and concludes the simulation with `$finish`. This layout ensures comprehensive testing, covering initialization, operational verifications, and graceful termination of simulation.",
