    "module": "The 'test' module sets up a simulation environment for the 'test_module', initializing and managing input signals like clk, reset, scan inputs, scan enable, and test mode, critical for functional verification under various conditions, including scan-based testing. It interfaces with the 'test_module' by mapping these inputs to corresponding outputs through instantiation and initializes signal states, optionally loading timing data for accurate gate-level simulation, finishing with a simulation termination command."
