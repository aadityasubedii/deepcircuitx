    "module": "The ADDB module performs conditional arithmetic on inputs DQ and SE, outputting the result to SR based on their most significant bits (MSB). It checks the MSB of DQ and SE to decide if DQ should be inverted and SE incremented; these processed values are then summed and output through SR. This module integrates logic for scan testing and resets functionality, adequately handling root computations and output generation within a single clock cycle."
