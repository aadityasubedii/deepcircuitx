Module name: ADDB. Module specification: The ADDB module performs conditional arithmetic operations on two inputs, DQ (16-bit) and SE (15-bit), based on their most significant bits (MSB). It is equipped with a set of inputs for reset, clk (clock signal), five scan_in (scan_in0 to scan_in4) and corresponding outputs scan_out (scan_out0 to scan_out4) used for scan testing, scan_enable for enabling test mode, and test_mode to activate module's test functionality. The internal signals, including DQS and SES, store the MSB of DQ and SE respectively, driving the conditional logic of whether to pass the input directly or modify it. DQI is the processed output of DQ, which either passes through or is inverted and reduced based on DQS. Similarly, SEI stores the transformed output of SE which either passes through or is incremented by a constant dependent on SES. The sum of these processed values, DQI and SEI, is delivered to the output SR (16-bit), which represents the conditional arithmetic resultant. The code clearly delineates the modules and handling of signals, with specific wire assignments controlling the arithmetic transformations and resulting computations before summing them in the SR output.
