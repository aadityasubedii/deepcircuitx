    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The \"test\" module functions predominantly as a testbench designed to set up and test the ADDB sub-module. It incorporates both input and output ports integral to running tests: input ports include `clk` (clock signal timing module operations), `reset` (initializing ADDB to known state), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (loading test patterns into the ADDB), `scan_enable` (enable/disable scan mode), and `test_mode` (toggling between normal and test operations). The output ports, `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, reflect the ADDB's response to tests conducted through its scan paths. Internal signals mirror the inputs and facilitate internal operations and connectivity to the ADDB sub-module. The module is structured with an initial block that, upon execution, formats simulation time display, optionally annotates timing information if `SDFSCAN` is defined, sets initial states for all inputs, and concludes the simulation. Additionally, an instance of the ADDB sub-module (`top`) is declared and wired to utilize these signals, encapsulating the integration and testing setup within this testbench module.",
