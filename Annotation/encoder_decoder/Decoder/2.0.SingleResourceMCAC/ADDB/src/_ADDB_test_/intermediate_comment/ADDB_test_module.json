    "module": "The \"test\" module acts as a testbench for the ADDB sub-module, setting initial conditions and controlling test inputs via a series of scan chains. It handles simulation timing, optional SDF annotation for detailed scan testing, toggles between normal and diagnostic modes, and directs outcomes through output scan signals. An initial block sets up simulation environment, default signal states, and concludes with the end of the simulation, with all connections and activities linked explicitly to the ADDB instance within the module."
