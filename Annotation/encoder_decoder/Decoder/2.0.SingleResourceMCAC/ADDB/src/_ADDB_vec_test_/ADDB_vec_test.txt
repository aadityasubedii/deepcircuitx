The 'test' module simulates an ADPCM system for audio compression testing by coordinating input signals and configurations through the 'ADDB' submodule. It leverages input ports for control and data signals, and internal arrays to set parameters like companding laws and operation types. Through iterative simulations driven by clock signals, it checks the accuracy of outputs against expected results, handling various scenarios and logging any discrepancies.
