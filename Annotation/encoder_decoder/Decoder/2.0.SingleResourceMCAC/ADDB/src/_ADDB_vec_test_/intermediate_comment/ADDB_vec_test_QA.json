The test module uses the `ADDB` submodule to process inputs like differential quantization (`DQ`) and step size (`SE`) under various configurations of encoding or decoding types, operation types, transmission rates, and laws specific to ITU standards for ADPCM systems. Its primary functionality involves extensive testing of these parameters through clock-driven simulations, verifying if the submodule's output (`SR`) matches expected results (`SRs`) loaded from external files for various scenarios. Multiple nested for-loops are employed to iteratively test all combinations of the parameters, indicating the complexity and thoroughness of the testing procedure. The test includes a setup for conditional inclusion of additional modules or actions (like reading SDF, annotating SDF using `$sdf_annotate`, or stopping simulations under error conditions) based on compile-time flags. Upon failure, it logs detailed error messages and optionally stops the simulation. Finally, it prints \"TEST COMPLETE\" indicating the end of the simulation."
