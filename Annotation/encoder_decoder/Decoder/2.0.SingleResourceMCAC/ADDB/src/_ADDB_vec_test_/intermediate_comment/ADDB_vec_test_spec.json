Module specification: The \"test\" module is designed to simulate the behavior and testing of an ADPCM (Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation) system, crucial for audio compression and decompression. It manages its operations through a primary submodule 'ADDB', used for processing input signals of differential quantization (`DQ`) and step size (`SE`) under varied configurations. These configurations are specified through input ports including `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` for scan-based testing, `scan_enable` for activation of scan modes, `test_mode` for special test operations, `reset` for initializing system states, and `clk` for driving the clock-dependent simulation activities. Output ports include `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` which mirror the scan inputs displaying the test results, and `SR` which is the outcome of the `ADDB` submodule's processing. Internal signals such as arrays `rates`, `laws`, `operations`, `types`, and `models` govern the parameters of the ADPCM system like rates, companding laws, operation types, and module operation modes, respectively. The code is methodically segmented into initialization of parameter values, configuration and running of various test scenarios including reading vector sizes and expected results from files, and dynamically testing with these parameters while logging any discrepancies between expected and actual outputs. A final segment includes comprehensive checks across additional conditions, culminating in a message indicating the end of the test sequence.",

                    "text": "Module name: test. Module specification: The \"test\" module is designed to simulate the behavior and testing of an ADPCM (Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation) system, crucial for audio compression and decompression. It manages its operations through a primary submodule 'ADDB', used for processing input signals of differential quantization (`DQ`) and step size (`SE`) under varied configurations. These configurations are specified through input ports including `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` for scan-based testing, `scan_enable` for activation of scan modes, `test_mode` for special test operations, `reset` for initializing system states, and `clk` for driving the clock-dependent simulation activities. Output ports include `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` which mirror the scan inputs displaying the test results, and `SR` which is the outcome of the `ADDB` submodule's processing. Internal signals such as arrays `rates`, `laws`, `operations`, `types`, and `models` govern the parameters of the ADPCM system like rates, companding laws, operation types, and module operation modes, respectively. The code is methodically segmented into initialization of parameter values, configuration and running of various test scenarios including reading vector sizes and expected results from files, and dynamically testing with these parameters while logging any discrepancies between expected and actual outputs. A final segment includes comprehensive checks across additional conditions, culminating in a message indicating the end of the test sequence."
