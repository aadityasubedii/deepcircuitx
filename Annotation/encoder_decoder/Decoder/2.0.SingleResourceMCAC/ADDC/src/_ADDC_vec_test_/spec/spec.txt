Module name: test.  
Module specification: The 'test' module simulates an ADPCM (Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation) system testing environment, focusing on verifying different encoding and decoding operations, types, rates, and laws applicable to ADPCM models. This module is equipped with input ports such as clk (clock), reset, scan_in0 to scan_in4 (used for scan chain operations), scan_enable (activates scanning), test_mode, DQ (Differential Quantization signal), and SEZ (Adaptive predictor signal). It outputs scan_out0 to scan_out4 for shifting out test data, PK0 (Polarity of Quantizer Output 0), and SIGPK (Signal Passed Key) which are crucial in validating the encoding and decoding processes. Internally, the module uses PK0_EXP and SIGPK_EXP to store expected results for outputs PK0 and SIGPK, respectively, and flags errors with PK0_ERROR and SIGPK_ERROR when discrepancies occur. The code is structured into several specific blocksâ€”initial setup where vectors and testing scenarios are defined, clock signal generation, dynamic testing within nested loops triggering based on the provided test scenarios, and final results display indicating the test completion. Such extensive testing aids in ensuring that the ADPCM implementation behaves as expected under various configurations, handling errors and discrepancies effectively during the test operations.
