It is used in comparison checks to validate if the PK0 output from the module matches the expected result during testing.\n- **PK0_ERROR (Error flag for Polarity of Quantizer Output 0)**: An internal signal that acts as a flag to indicate an error when there is a discrepancy between the expected and actual PK0 output. When PK0 does not match PK0_EXP, this flag can be toggled to signal an error, influencing conditional actions like stopping the test depending on directives defined (`ERRORSTOP`).\n- **SIGPK_EXP (Expected Signal Passed Key)**: Similar to PK0_EXP, this internal signal stores the expected output for the SIGPK, which is retrieved from testing vector data. It is essential for ensuring that the SIGPK output aligns with what is expected under test conditions.\n- **SIGPK_ERROR (Error flag for Signal Passed Key)**: Functions like PK0_ERROR, this flag indicates an error condition when the actual SIGPK output fails to meet the expected SIGPK_EXP during a test sequence.
