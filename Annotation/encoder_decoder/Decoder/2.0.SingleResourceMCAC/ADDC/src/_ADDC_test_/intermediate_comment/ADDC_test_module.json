    "module": "The 'test' module functions as a testbench for the 'ADDC' module, initializing and managing simulation parameters and system states to verify correctness and functionality. It employs input signals like clock, reset, and scan chains to toggle between test modes and operational states, driving the 'ADDC' module under test conditions, with output scan chains used to observe outcomes. Simulation control is achieved through specific initializations and terminations using $finish after setup."
