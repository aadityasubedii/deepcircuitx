Module name: test.  
Module specification: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for the 'ADDC' module, focusing on its simulation and verification in a testing environment. It initializes and manages various control and data signals to test the functionality of the 'ADDC' module. Input ports include `clk` (clock) for synchronizing operations, `reset` for setting a known state, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` for loading test data, `scan_enable` for enabling scan operations, and `test_mode` for switching operational modes. The output ports, `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, are used to observe the internal state and test results. Internal signals mirror the inputs and outputs, facilitating the test operations within the 'ADDC' module. The code blocks in the module include instantiation of the 'ADDC' module, setting up simulation parameters like time format and optional SDF annotation, initializing all signals to zero, and ending the simulation using `$finish` to properly conclude the test after setup. This structured approach ensures thorough testing and debugging capabilities for the 'ADDC' module under different conditions.
