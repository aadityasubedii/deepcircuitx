Invert the highest bit of the DQ input if it is set, and adjust the value accordingly.\n2. Similarly modify the SEZ input based on its highest bit.\n3. Sum two possibly modified inputs, DQI and SEZI.\n4. Determine if the resulting combined value (DQSEZ) has its highest bit set, which is output as PK0.\n5. Check if the combined value (DQSEZ) is zero and output the result as SIGPK.\n\nAdditionally, the module appears to support scan testing processes, indicated by inputs such as `scan_inX` and outputs like `scan_outX`, as well as handling specific test modes.
