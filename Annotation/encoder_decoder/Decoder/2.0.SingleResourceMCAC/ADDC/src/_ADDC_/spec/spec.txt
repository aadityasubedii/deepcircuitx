Module name: ADDC. 
Module specification: The ADDC module is designed for digital signal processing, specifically for manipulating and combining the DQ and SEZ digital input signals, often used in audio processing or telecommunications. The module provides inputs for `reset`, `clk`, and various `scan` ports (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`) controlled by `scan_enable` and `test_mode`, primarily to support scan testing functionality. Output ports include `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, as well as `PK0` (indicating the most significant bit of the computed result) and `SIGPK` (indicating if the result is zero). Internally, the module utilizes signals: `DQS` and `SEZS` (binary detectors for the most significant bit of `DQ` and `SEZ`, respectively), `DQI` and `SEZI` (modified inputs based on `DQS` and `SEZS`), and `DQSEZ` (the sum of `DQI` and `SEZI`). Code blocks include operations to modify the inputs based on their highest order bits, compute these inputs, and evaluate their combination for certain conditions (`PK0` and `SIGPK`). The module's operations are aligned with the timing provided by the `clk` signal and can be reset to a known state using the `reset` input.
