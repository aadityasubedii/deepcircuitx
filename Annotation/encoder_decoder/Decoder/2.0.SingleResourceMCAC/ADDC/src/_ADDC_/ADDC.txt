The ADDC module performs digital signal processing by modifying and summing digital inputs DQ and SEZ based on their most significant bits. It utilizes internal logic to invert DQ and adjust SEZ when their respective highest bits are set, sums the modified values, and outputs flags indicating specific properties of the result (highest bit set and zero condition). This is facilitated by synchronous operations controlled by a clock signal and optional scan testing inputs and outputs for diagnostic purposes.
