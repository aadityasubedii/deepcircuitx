    "module": "This directive sets the simulation time scale to 1 nanosecond, ensuring precise and consistent time measurements across Verilog simulations. It specifies both the time unit and the time precision as 1 nanosecond, thereby standardizing the interpretation of time throughout the simulation processes without implementing any digital logic itself."
