There are no internal signals mentioned or used within the scope of this code fragment. The '`timescale` directive is employed for specifying simulation time units and precision and is not associated with defining or utilizing any internal signals within a module. Thus, this answer reiterates that the provided code snippet does not include or reference any internal signals pertaining to a Verilog module."
