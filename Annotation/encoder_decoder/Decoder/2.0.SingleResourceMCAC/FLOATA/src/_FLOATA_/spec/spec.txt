Module name: FLOATA. Module specification: The FLOATA module is designed to process a 16-bit input `DQ`, representing a floating-point number, to output an 11-bit signal `DQ0` that includes the sign, exponent, and mantissa of the input number. Key input ports include `reset` for resetting the internal state, `clk` for clocking, `scan_in[0:4]` and `scan_enable` for enabling scan mode primarily for testing purposes, `test_mode` for activating special test modes, and `DQ` which carries the floating-point input. The outputs are `scan_out[0:4]`, which function as scan chain outputs, and `DQ0`, which holds the processed floating-point number. Internally, the module utilizes `DQS` to capture the Most Significant Bit (MSB) of `DQ` as the sign of the number, while `MAG` isolates the magnitude by masking off the sign bit. The `EXP` register calculates the exponent based on the position of the first '1' in `MAG`, and `MANT` extracts the mantissa using the exponent to adjust the bit position. The code includes a decoding mechanism for determining the exponent in `EXP` based on the pattern of `MAG`, and the computed `MANT` and `EXP` are together assigned to `DQ0` along with the sign bit `DQS`. This structured and systematic approach allows the module to accurately convert and output floating-point representations suitable for further processing or testing within digital systems.
