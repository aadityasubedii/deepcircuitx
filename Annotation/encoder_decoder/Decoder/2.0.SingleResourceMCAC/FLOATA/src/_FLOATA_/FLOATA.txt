The FLOATA module processes a 16-bit input floating-point number `DQ` to output an 11-bit reformatted number `DQ0` containing sign, exponent, and mantissa. It extracts the sign bit directly, calculates the exponent by detecting the position of the first '1' in the magnitude using a series of conditional statements, and adjusts the mantissa accordingly. These values are combined to form the resulting output, accommodating both normal operation and scan chain testing functionalities.
