    "module": "The \"test\" module simulates a digital audio processing system, validating various encoding and decoding operations against predefined test vectors. It employs arrays for test configurations and iteratively tests conditions through nested loops, applying input vectors \"DQ\", checking outputs \"DQ0\", and reporting errors when outputs deviate from expected results, thereby ensuring the system's robustness under different operational conditions."
