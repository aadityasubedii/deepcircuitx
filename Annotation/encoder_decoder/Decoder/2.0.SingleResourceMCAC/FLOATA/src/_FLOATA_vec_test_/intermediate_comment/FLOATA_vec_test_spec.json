    "spec": "Module name: test. \nModule specification: The \"test\" module primarily simulates a digital audio processing system for various encoding and decoding scenarios. It is designed to load and execute specific test cases to verify the correctness of processing based on the input data stream represented by the port \"DQ\" (16-bit digital audio signal) against the expected outputs \"DQ0\" (11-bit output data). Input ports include \"reset\" and \"clk\" for system initialization and synchronization, \"scan_in0\" to \"scan_in4\" for scan testing, \"scan_enable\" to enable scan mode, and \"test_mode\" for toggling between normal and test operation modes. Corresponding output scan ports are \"scan_out0\" to \"scan_out4\". Internally, the module employs arrays like \"rates\", \"laws\", \"operations\", \"types\", and \"models\" for configuring test vectors across multiple scenarios. Index and counter variables such as \"rate\", \"law\", \"operation\", \"type\", \"model\", \"j\", and \"loop\" are used to navigate these configurations. Vector size and expected results for comparison are stored in \"vectorSizes\", \"DQs\", and \"DQ0s\". The code structure includes initialization blocks for setting up the system states and loading test vectors, followed by nested loops designed to iterate through the test matrix by applying different configurations and monitoring outputs. Conditions check the output integrity against expected values, and the test procedure accommodates verbose logging and error stopping for detailed analysis and immediate troubleshooting during failures. Lastly, the module concludes tests with a completion message signaling the end of the simulation process.",

It is designed to load and execute specific test cases to verify the correctness of processing based on the input data stream represented by the port \"DQ\" (16-bit digital audio signal) against the expected outputs \"DQ0\" (11-bit output data). Input ports include \"reset\" and \"clk\" for system initialization and synchronization, \"scan_in0\" to \"scan_in4\" for scan testing, \"scan_enable\" to enable scan mode, and \"test_mode\" for toggling between normal and test operation modes. Corresponding output scan ports are \"scan_out0\" to \"scan_out4\". Internally, the module employs arrays like \"rates\", \"laws\", \"operations\", \"types\", and \"models\" for configuring test vectors across multiple scenarios. Index and counter variables such as \"rate\", \"law\", \"operation\", \"type\", \"model\", \"j\", and \"loop\" are used to navigate these configurations. Vector size and expected results for comparison are stored in \"vectorSizes\", \"DQs\", and \"DQ0s\". The code structure includes initialization blocks for setting up the system states and loading test vectors, followed by nested loops designed to iterate through the test matrix by applying different configurations and monitoring outputs. Conditions check the output integrity against expected values, and the test procedure accommodates verbose logging and error stopping for detailed analysis and immediate troubleshooting during failures. Lastly, the module concludes tests with a completion message signaling the end of the simulation process."
