The UPB module adjusts a base input signal Bn to produce an output BnP based on various input conditions, effectively processing signal data for conditional adjustments. It employs internal computations of signal magnitude (DQnMAG) and signal sign (BnS), along with conditional logic to determine upper (UGBn) and lower bounds (ULBn), which are then used to compute the final adjusted output. The module synchronizes operations via a clock input and supports modify operations in test scenarios through designated scan inputs and outputs.
