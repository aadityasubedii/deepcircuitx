Module name: Not Available. 
Module specification: The provided Verilog snippet does not define a module but merely includes a `timescale directive, which sets both the time unit and the time precision for simulations to 1 nanosecond. This directive is critical for ensuring accurate timing simulations but does not by itself constitute a module or imply functionality beyond timing settings. As such, there are no input or output ports, nor are there any internal signals or distinct blocks of code within this snippet. It serves solely to configure the simulation environment's temporal resolution and lacks any functional components typical of a Verilog module. Therefore, no detailed module functionality, port descriptions, internal signal use, or code blocks can be discussed or delineated for this Verilog directive.
