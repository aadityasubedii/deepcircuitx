Module name: test. 
Module specification: The 'test' module acts primarily as a testbench for the `UPB` module to facilitate scan-based testing functionalities. The module handles multiple input and output ports: The inputs include `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset` (to initialize or reset the module's internal state), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (for loading test data into the module), `scan_enable` (activates scan mode), and `test_mode` (for selecting specific test operational modes). The outputs are `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, which output the test data processed within the module. The internal signals also replicate these input and output definitions, ensuring the proper passage and retrieval of data for testing purposes. The Verilog code contains key sections: the instantiation of the `UPB` module where all these ports are mapped to the `UPB` moduleâ€™s respective ports, and an initial block that sets up the simulation environment including time formatting, an optional SDF annotation for scan timing simulation (dependent on the `SDFSCAN` compilation flag), initializes all the control and test input signals to zero, and then concludes the simulation with `$finish`. This setup indicates a foundational structure for further expansion or integration with additional test sequence scripts or modules to fully utilize its designed capabilities in varied test scenarios.
