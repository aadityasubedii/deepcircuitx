    "module": "The 'test' module serves as a testbench for the 'UPB' module, focusing on scan-based testing functionalities by managing test patterns and result observation through scan chains. It achieves this by instantiating the 'UPB' module and connecting its inputs and outputs to various control and test signals, such as clock, reset, test inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`), and test control signals (`scan_enable`, `test_mode`). The test environment includes an initial block that initializes all signals, optionally reads in timing information via SDF, and ends the simulation to establish a baseline test configuration."
