The `boot_mem128` module interfaces with a Wishbone-compliant bus system, managing memory read and write operations for 128-bit data widths. It facilitates memory interactions through Wishbone signals, incorporates test modes, and provides conditional debug configurations specific to Xilinx Spartan-6. Internal processes, such as transaction initiations and data flow, are controlled by signals like `start_write` and `start_read`, with memory operations enabled through programmable byte-level granularity using `byte_enable` and `address` decoding. This module also offers robust testing features through scan inputs and outputs, promoting effective design verification.
