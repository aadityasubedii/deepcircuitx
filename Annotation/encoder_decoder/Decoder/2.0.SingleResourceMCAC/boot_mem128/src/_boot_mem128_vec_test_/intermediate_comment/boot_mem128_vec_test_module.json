    "module": "The \"test\" module initializes and tests the 'boot_mem128' memory module by simulating various test inputs and conditions. It defines input and output ports for clock, reset, test modes, and scan data channels which interface with the instantiated 'boot_mem128'. An initial block sets simulation parameters, initializes all inputs to zero to ensure a known state, optionally annotates timing verification data, and concludes testing with a simulation end command, ensuring a comprehensive testing environment for module verification."
