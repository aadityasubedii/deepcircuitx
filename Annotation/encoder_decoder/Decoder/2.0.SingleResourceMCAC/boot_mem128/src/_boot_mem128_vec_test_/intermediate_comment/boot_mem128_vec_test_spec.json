    "spec": "Module name: test. \nModule specification: The \"test\" module functions to initialize and simulate test scenarios for a memory unit, particularly 'boot_mem128,' by setting conditions conducive for a boot sequence. The module has several input ports including `clk`, `reset`, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, and `test_mode`. The `clk` serves as the synchronization pulse for operations, `reset` initializes the system, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` are inputs for test data, `scan_enable` activates the test mode, and `test_mode` determines the operational mode (test or normal) of the memory. Output ports `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` allow examination of the outputs after test data is processed, aiding in behavior verification under test conditions. These ports are managed by internal signals corresponding directly to their respective ports, ensuring direct control and data passage within the module. The module encompasses an initial block that sets simulation time formatting, optionally annotates an SDF file (`ifdef SDFSCAN` for scan-test specific timing verification), initializes all inputs to zero, and concludes the simulation with a `$finish` call. This structure efficiently sets a framework for verifying the memory module's boot and scan processes under controlled test inputs.",
