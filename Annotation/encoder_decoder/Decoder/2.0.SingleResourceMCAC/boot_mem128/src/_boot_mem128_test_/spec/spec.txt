Module name: test. Module specification: The "test" module is intended for evaluating the functionality of a boot memory using a Wishbone bus protocol. It supports both normal memory operations and scan-based testing for manufacturing checks or debugging. Input ports include `clk` (clock signal), `reset` (resets internal states), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (inputs for scan testing), `scan_enable` (activates scan mode), `test_mode` (enables test operations), and Wishbone-specific signals like `i_wb_adr` (address input), `i_wb_sel` (selection mask), `i_wb_we` (write enable), `i_wb_dat` (data for memory writes), `i_wb_cyc` (indicates active cycle), and `i_wb_stb` (valid data strobe). Output ports are `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` (outputs scan results), `o_wb_dat` (outputs read data), `o_wb_ack` (transaction acknowledgment), and `o_wb_err` (error indicator for transactions). Internal signals include an integer `i` for loop indexing and an instance of `boot_mem128` designated `top`, which performs actual memory operations. The code contains multiple sections: an instantiation of `boot_mem128` for interfacing with the boot memory, an always block for clock generation, initial block setup for reset and default signal values, tasks `wb_write_strobe` and `wb_read_strobe` managing write and read operations respectively, and a verification section within `wb_read_strobe` to compare output data against expected results, signaling any mismatches.
