    "module": "The \"test\" module is designed to evaluate boot memory operations interfaced with a Wishbone bus protocol, supporting standard memory operations and specialized scan-based testing for robustness checks. It implements a series of tests by interfacing with the `boot_mem128` module, which executes the memory operations. Key input and output signals manage and monitor the data transfer and test outcomes, while internal controls via tasks like `wb_write_strobe` and `wb_read_strobe` handle read and write operations, checking data accuracy against expected results. The module provides crucial feedback through dedicated outputs, indicating operational status and error conditions."
