This includes testing different scenarios such as write and read operations to the memory. It uses numerous control signals (like `i_wb_we`, `i_wb_cyc`, `i_wb_stb`) to manage data transactions over this bus, and it verifies data integrity through read-back checks. The module also supports scan-based testing (with inputs like `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` and outputs like `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`) and can operate in a test mode, which might be related to manufacturing test or similar applications. Tasks within the module (`wb_write_strobe` and `wb_read_strobe`) manage the specifics of the read and write operations, ensuring the data written to memory can be correctly read back and verified."

They establish communication and control for operations on the Wishbone interface, manage data flow during memory tests, and control the operational mode (normal or test mode) of the module.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`: Test scan outputs used during scan-based testing to output test results.\n- `o_wb_dat`: The data read from the memory during a read operation on the Wishbone bus.\n- `o_wb_ack`: Acknowledgment signal which indicates the acceptance of the transaction on the Wishbone bus.\n- `o_wb_err`: Error signal indicating any discrepancies during Wishbone transfers.\n\nExplanation: Output ports serve to communicate the results of internal operations and tests to external entities. `scan_out` lines convey results from scan-based tests, while `o_wb_dat` provides the output for read transactions through the Wishbone bus. The `o_wb_ack` and `o_wb_err` further manage and indicate the status of communication and integrity via the Wishbone interface."
