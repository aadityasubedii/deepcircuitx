    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The \"test\" module is designed for simulation and testing of the FLOATB module, which processes various signals and configurations to validate different digital operations under varied conditions. The module inputs include `reset` for initializing the internal state, `clk` as the clock signal for synchronization, multiple `scan_in` ports for test vector inputs, `scan_enable` for enabling scan test mode, `test_mode` for toggling specific testing protocols, and a `SR` bus for status or control bits. The outputs correspondingly include multiple `scan_out` ports and a `SR0` bus, reflecting the module's response to the inputs under test conditions. Internally, the module utilizes arrays to hold predefined configurations (`rates`, `laws`, `operations`, `types`, `models`), variables for indexing and loop control (`rate`, `law`, `operation`, `type`, `model`, `j`, `loop`), and memory blocks for anticipated results (`vectorSizes`, `SRs`, `SR0s`). The code contains blocks for initializing test configurations, toggling clock signals, configuring I/O during simulations, and extensive loops for testing all combinations of inputs based on predefined `models`, `rates`, `types`, `operations`, and `laws`. This comprehensive testing ensures that the module verifies the correct processing of each input set against expected behavior, logging any discrepancies and halting on errors if configured (`ERRORSTOP`). The simulation signals completion of all tests before termination.",

Module specification: The \"test\" module is designed for simulation and testing of the FLOATB module, which processes various signals and configurations to validate different digital operations under varied conditions. The module inputs include `reset` for initializing the internal state, `clk` as the clock signal for synchronization, multiple `scan_in` ports for test vector inputs, `scan_enable` for enabling scan test mode, `test_mode` for toggling specific testing protocols, and a `SR` bus for status or control bits. The outputs correspondingly include multiple `scan_out` ports and a `SR0` bus, reflecting the module's response to the inputs under test conditions. Internally, the module utilizes arrays to hold predefined configurations (`rates`, `laws`, `operations`, `types`, `models`), variables for indexing and loop control (`rate`, `law`, `operation`, `type`, `model`, `j`, `loop`), and memory blocks for anticipated results (`vectorSizes`, `SRs`, `SR0s`). The code contains blocks for initializing test configurations, toggling clock signals, configuring I/O during simulations, and extensive loops for testing all combinations of inputs based on predefined `models`, `rates`, `types`, `operations`, and `laws`. This comprehensive testing ensures that the module verifies the correct processing of each input set against expected behavior, logging any discrepancies and halting on errors if configured (`ERRORSTOP`). The simulation signals completion of all tests before termination."
