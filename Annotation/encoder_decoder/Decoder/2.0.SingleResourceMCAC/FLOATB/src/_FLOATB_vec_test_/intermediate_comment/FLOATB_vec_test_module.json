    "module": "The \"test\" module simulates and validates the functionality of the FLOATB module by supplying various predefined test vectors (rates, operations, laws, types) and checking the outputs against expected results. It achieves this through a series of nested loops that automate the application of all combinations of test scenarios, with detailed error logging and optional simulation halts on discrepancies, controlled by clock toggling and conditional testing within the Verilog environment."
