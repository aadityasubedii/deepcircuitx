Module name: test.  
Module specification: The "test" module is a testbench designed for the "FLOATB" module, aiming to validate its scan chain functionality by simulating a test environment. The input ports include a reset signal that clears the internal state of "FLOATB", a clk signal for timing operations, scan_in0 to scan_in4 for feeding test data, scan_enable to activate the scan test mode, and test_mode to toggle between normal and test operations. The output ports, scan_out0 to scan_out4, deliver the test data processed through the scan chain. Internally, the test module makes use of registers for clk, reset, the scan inputs, scan_enable, and test_mode to maintain and control these signals during simulation. Wire types are utilized for the scan outputs to directly reflect the state transition based on the input test data. The module includes an initial block that sets up the environment: initializing signal states, potentially annotating timing data depending on a conditional compile (SDFSCAN), and terminating the simulation with $finish. This setup provides a thorough framework for assessing and corroborating the internal mechanisms of the "FLOATB" module under controlled test conditions.
