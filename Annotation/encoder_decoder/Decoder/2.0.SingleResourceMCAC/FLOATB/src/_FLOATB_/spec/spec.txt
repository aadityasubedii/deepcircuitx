Module name: FLOATB. Module specification: The FLOATB module is designed for converting a 16-bit signed integer into an 11-bit pseudo floating point format by segregating the sign, exponent, and mantissa. The provided inputs to the module include `reset` for resetting internal states, `clk` for clocking operations, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` for scanning inputs during test modes, `scan_enable` to enable scanning, `test_mode` to switch between test and operational modes, and `SR` as the primary 16-bit signed integer input. Outputs consist of `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` to export scanning results, and `SR0` which is the 11-bit result showcasing the input `SR` in floating point-like format. Internally, the `SRS` wire determines the sign of `SR`, `MAG` computes its magnitude, `EXP` stores the exponent representing the position of the highest non-zero bit, and `MANT` forms the mantissa by shifting `MAG`. The module utilizes conditional and shift operations to set `MAG` based on `SR's` sign bit and employs a `casez` block for determining `EXP` based on the leading zeros in `MAG`. Finally, `SR0` is computed by concatenating `SRS`, `EXP`, and `MANT`. This module efficiently translates an integer to a form that simplifies floating-point arithmetic processing.
