The FLOATB module converts a 16-bit signed integer to an 11-bit format representing sign, exponent, and mantissa, mimicking a floating-point structure. It calculates the sign from the most significant bit, determines the magnitude, calculates the exponent from the position of the first non-zero bit, and computes the mantissa by normalizing the magnitude. The outputs are concatenated into the final format, combining operational and test modes through various inputs and internal mechanism handling.
