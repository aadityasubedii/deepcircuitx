It first determines if the number is positive or negative using its most significant bit (stored in `SRS`), calculates its magnitude (`MAG`), and depending on the first non-zero bit position in `MAG`, sets an exponent (`EXP`) which indicates the position of this bit. Then, it computes a mantissa (`MANT`) by shifting `MAG` right by the number of positions indicated by `EXP`. Finally, the module combines the sign bit, exponent, and mantissa into an 11-bit output `SR0`, seemingly converting the input into a floating point-like format."
