    "spec": "Module name: FLOATB. Module specification: The FLOATB module is designed for converting a 16-bit signed integer into an 11-bit pseudo floating point format by segregating the sign, exponent, and mantissa. The provided inputs to the module include `reset` for resetting internal states, `clk` for clocking operations, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` for scanning inputs during test modes, `scan_enable` to enable scanning, `test_mode` to switch between test and operational modes, and `SR` as the primary 16-bit signed integer input. Outputs consist of `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` to export scanning results, and `SR0` which is the 11-bit result showcasing the input `SR` in floating point-like format. Internally, the `SRS` wire determines the sign of `SR`, `MAG` computes its magnitude, `EXP` stores the exponent representing the position of the highest non-zero bit, and `MANT` forms the mantissa by shifting `MAG`. The module utilizes conditional and shift operations to set `MAG` based on `SR's` sign bit and employs a `casez` block for determining `EXP` based on the leading zeros in `MAG`. Finally, `SR0` is computed by concatenating `SRS`, `EXP`, and `MANT`. This module efficiently translates an integer to a form that simplifies floating-point arithmetic processing.",

Specifically, it extracts the most significant bit of `SR`, indicating whether the value is positive (0) or negative (1).\n- `MAG` is a wire computed as the magnitude of `SR`. If the input `SR` is negative, `MAG` calculates the two's complement (invert and add 1) confined to the lower 15 bits. If `SR` is positive, `MAG` is directly equal to `SR`. This operation effectively converts the input to its absolute value, ignoring the sign.\n- `EXP` is a register that stores the exponent value determined by the position of the highest non-zero bit in `MAG`. This value essentially counts the number of leading zeros before the first one in `MAG` and determines the shift needed to normalize `MAG`.\n- `MANT` is a wire that represents the mantissa, calculated by shifting `MAG` to the right by the value in `EXP`. This shifting normalizes `MAG` so that it lies within a standard range, preserving its most significant bits."
