Module name: TDMO. Module specification: The TDMO (Time Division Multiplexing Output) module is designed to handle time-division multiplexing output operations in digital communication or processing systems. It accepts a variety of inputs including a reset signal, serial clocks, frame synchronization signal, scan inputs, test mode, and Wishbone bus interface signals for reading or writing data to registers. Output ports include serialized data, frame synchronization signal, buffered serial clock, scan outputs, and Wishbone bus signals indicating data availability and error conditions. Internally, the TDMO utilizes clock management signals such as serial_clk and selected_clk to determine the operating clock source based on the mode of operation (test mode or normal mode). It processes data through registers and buffers organized into serializing blocks, frame synchronization handling, and Wishbone bus interface management. The code is arranged into several always blocks and assignments, with logic to manage serializing data outputs, cycling data channel bits, handling frame synchronization, managing Wishbone read/write operations, and handling internal state resets. This sophisticated organization guarantees the accurate timing and ordering necessary for multiplexed data stream handling in complex digital systems.
