The TDMO module handles time-division multiplexing output operations for digital systems, multiplexing data from various channels into a serial data stream. It utilizes inputs like reset, several types of clocks, frame sync, and a Wishbone bus interface for data management, and outputs serialized data along with synchronization and clock signals. Internally, the module operates with various clock management signals, data registers, and operational modes to manage serialization, adjust to testing conditions, and handle frame alignment, ensuring robust and accurate data output synchronization in a high-speed digital environment.
