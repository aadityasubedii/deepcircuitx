    "module": "The 'test' module initializes and simulates the 'TDMO' module under predefined conditions, serving as a platform for verifying its operation. It employs a setup with defined input and output connections for clock, reset, and scan functionalities. Using an initial block, it sets low initial states for these signals, optionally annotates SDF for precise simulation, and concludes the test run, thereby ensuring comprehensive test coverage and reliable module verification."
