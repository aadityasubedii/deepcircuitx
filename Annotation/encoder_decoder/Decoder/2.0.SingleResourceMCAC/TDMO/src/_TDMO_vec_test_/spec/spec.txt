Module name: test.  
Module specification: The 'test' module is specifically designed to set up and simulate the 'TDMO' module under various test conditions using defined input and output ports. The input ports include `clk` (clock signal for timing), `reset` (to reset the module's internal state), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (scan inputs for shifting in test data), `scan_enable` (to activate or deactivate the scan operation), and `test_mode` (to toggle the moduleâ€™s test mode altering normal operations). Corresponding output ports `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` are used to observe internal states or results post-test data processing, essential for the module's behavior diagnostics during testing. Internally, the signals are set up as wire for outputs and reg for inputs and control signals. The module comprises a primary instantiation block connecting these inputs and outputs to the 'TDMO' module, and an initial block which configures initial signal states, sets up time format, optionally annotates Standard Delay Format (SDF) information for accurate timing during simulations via conditional compilation, and terminates the simulation. This structure is critical for ensuring accurate setup and verification of the 'TDMO' module under testing conditions.
