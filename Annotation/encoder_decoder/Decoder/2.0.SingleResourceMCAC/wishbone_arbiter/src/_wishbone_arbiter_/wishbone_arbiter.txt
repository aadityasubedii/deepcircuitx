The `wishbone_arbiter` module manages traffic on a Wishbone bus interface, facilitating communication between one master and multiple slave modules by routing address, data, and control signals. Internally, it decodes the master's address to select the targeted slave and directs the master's requests to the appropriate slave based on this address. Responses from slaves are then aggregated and sent back to the master, ensuring synchronized and conflict-free transactions within a shared bus architecture.
