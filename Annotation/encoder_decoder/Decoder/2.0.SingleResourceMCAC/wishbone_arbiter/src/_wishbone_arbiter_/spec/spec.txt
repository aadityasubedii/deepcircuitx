Module name: wishbone_arbiter. Module specification: The `wishbone_arbiter` is a Verilog module designed to manage transactions between a single master module and multiple slave modules on a Wishbone bus interface, commonly used in microcontroller system architectures. The module inputs include a reset signal, a clock signal (clk), scan-related signals (scan_in0-4, scan_enable, test_mode) for test purposes, and signals from the master (i_m0_wb_adr, i_m0_wb_sel, i_m0_wb_we, i_m0_wb_dat, i_m0_wb_cyc, i_m0_wb_stb) carrying information about the transaction desired. Additionally, it takes inputs from each slave module (i_sX_wb_dat, i_sX_wb_ack, i_sX_wb_err for X=0 to 9), indicating each slave's response to transaction requests. The outputs directed towards the master include the data, acknowledgement, and error status (o_m0_wb_dat, o_m0_wb_ack, o_m0_wb_err), while outputs targeted at each slave (o_sX_wb_adr, o_sX_wb_sel, o_sX_wb_we, o_sX_wb_dat, o_sX_wb_cyc, o_sX_wb_stb for X=0 to 9) convey transaction details from the master. Internally, the module decodes the master's address to select the appropriate slave (current_slave) and forwards relevant control signals, managing transaction directions by interfacing with memory configurations. The entire routing and decision logic is encapsulated in this module, ensuring efficient and conflict-free communication between a singular master and multiple slave devices on a shared bus system.
