This module serves as a testbench for a Wishbone bus arbiter, verifying its functionality across 10 slave interfaces. It generates clock signals, initializes inputs, and executes a series of tests for each slave interface. The testbench checks address, data, and control signal correctness between master and slave interfaces, verifies proper signal routing and timing for read and write operations, and displays error messages for any mismatches detected. It uses internal signals for temporary storage and comparison during testing, systematically exercising the arbiter's capabilities to ensure reliable operation in a multi-slave Wishbone bus system.
