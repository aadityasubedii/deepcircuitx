Module name: test. Module specification: The test module is a testbench for a Wishbone bus arbiter, instantiating a "wishbone_arbiter" module and performing various tests on it. It has input ports for clock, reset, scan chain inputs, test mode controls, master interface signals, and slave interface acknowledgment, error, and data signals. Output ports include scan chain outputs, master interface data and control signals, and slave interface address, select, write enable, data, cycle, and strobe signals for all 10 slave interfaces. Internal signals like i, adr, sel, we, cyc, stb, dat, and slave_data are used for temporary storage and comparison during testing. The module generates clock signals, initializes inputs, and runs through a series of tests for each of the 10 slave interfaces. It checks the correctness of address, data, and control signals between the master and slave interfaces, verifies
