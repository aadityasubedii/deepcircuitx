    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The \"test\" module serves as a simplistic and functional testbench primarily designed for the 'wishbone_arbiter' module. It is tasked with initializing and conducting basic simulation tests on the 'wishbone_arbiter' by providing necessary input signals like clock (clk) and reset, as well as configuring scan chains and test modes. The module includes input ports such as clk (the clock signal that synchronizes operations), reset (to clear the module's state), five scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4 for shifting test data), scan_enable (activates scan mode), and test_mode (activates specific test functionalities). Output ports include five scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4), which output test data shifted through the internal scan chain, essential for internal state monitoring and testing. The module leverages internal signals matching these inputs and outputs to interface directly with the 'wishbone_arbiter' module instantiated within. The structural code of the module incorporates an initial block for setting test conditions, including simulation settings and modifiers influenced by conditional directives like SDFSCAN for timing analysis. This block initializes all inputs to their default states and promptly concludes the simulation, essentially setting up and tearing down a basic test environment without executing specific test sequences, making it beneficial for rudimentary integration checks and functionality testing of the inner workings of the 'wishbone_arbiter'.",
