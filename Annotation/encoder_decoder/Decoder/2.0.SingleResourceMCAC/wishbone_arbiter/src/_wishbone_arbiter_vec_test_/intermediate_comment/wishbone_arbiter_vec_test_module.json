    "module": "The \"test\" module functions as a testbench for the 'wishbone_arbiter,' initializing and simulating essential inputs such as clock, reset, scan inputs, scan enable, and test mode to verify module integration and basic operations. It employs an initial block to set default states and execute a quick termination, incorporates conditional SDF annotation for timing analysis under scan test conditions, and interacts with the 'wishbone_arbiter' through instantiated module connectivity, facilitating direct testing of input-output behavior and internal state verification."
