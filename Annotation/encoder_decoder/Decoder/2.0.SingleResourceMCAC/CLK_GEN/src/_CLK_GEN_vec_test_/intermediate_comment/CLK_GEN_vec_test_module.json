    "module": "The 'test' module acts as a testbench for the 'CLK_GEN' module, simulating and validating clock generation and scan functionalities. It uses input ports like 'reset', 'clk', 'scan_in' inputs, 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode', along with corresponding output ports to monitor the scan chain outcomes. Internally, it initializes all inputs to zero and concludes testing in an initial block that also potentially annotates timing data via SDF based on a conditional compilation directive. This setup enables comprehensive testing and verification of the CLK_GEN module under various conditions."
