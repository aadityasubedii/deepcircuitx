Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is designed to serve primarily as a testbench for the 'CLK_GEN' module, focusing on clock generation and scan functionalities crucial for diagnostics and testing in digital circuits. This module incorporates several input ports including 'reset', 'clk', 'scan_in0' through 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode'. 'reset' is intended for resetting the CLK_GEN module, 'clk' provides the necessary clock signal, and 'scan_in0' through 'scan_in4' are used to input test data. 'scan_enable' activates scan testing mode, and 'test_mode' toggles the testing behavior of CLK_GEN. The outputs are 'scan_out0' through 'scan_out4', which display the results of the data shifted through the scan chain. Internal to the module, signals like 'clk' and 'reset' are defined as registers and manage timing and initial conditions respectively. The instantiation of the CLK_GEN module is connected to these signals, configuring how it operates based on the inputs and controlling its reset and clock functionality. The module also features an initial block which sets all inputs to zero at the start and ends the test simulation. This block includes conditional SDF annotation for standardized delay format if the 'SDFSCAN' preprocessor directive is defined. This comprehensive setup ensures that the CLK_GEN module's functionalities can be effectively tested and verified under different conditions.
