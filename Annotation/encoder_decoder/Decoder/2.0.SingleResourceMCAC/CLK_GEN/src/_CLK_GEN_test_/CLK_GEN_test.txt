The `test` module simulates a clock generation system for verifying synchronization and clock period accuracy across multiple outputs. It employs `CLK_GEN` for clock signals, utilizes input ports like `reset`, `clk`, and various scan inputs for initializing and testing states, and generates output clocks (`o_sys_clk`, `o_serial_clk`, `o_frame_syn`, `o_co_proc_clk`) alongside scan outputs. Internal signals control serial clock generation and synchronize testing, executed through iterative simulation blocks that validate the timing and frame alignment against expected metrics.
