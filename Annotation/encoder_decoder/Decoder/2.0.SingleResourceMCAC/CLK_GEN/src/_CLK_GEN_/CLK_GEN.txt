The CLK_GEN module generates synchronized clock signals and a frame synchronization signal tailored for various system requirements, processing inputs such as a primary clock and reset signals, with special modes like test mode. It manages its outputs—system clock, serialized clock, frame sync signal, and coprocessor clock—via internal counters, multiplexers that select clock sources based on the operating mode, and logic blocks handling toggling and synchronization, ensuring accurate and stable operation across system components.
