    "spec": "Module name: CLK_GEN. Module specification: The CLK_GEN module is designed to generate synchronized clock signals and a frame synchronization signal for various system applications. It accepts input signals such as a primary clock (`clk`), reset (`reset`), and operates under special conditions indicated by signals like `test_mode` and `i_frame_syn`. Outputs of this module include the system clock (`o_sys_clk`), serialized clock (`o_serial_clk`), frame synchronization signal (`o_frame_syn`), and coprocessor clock (`o_co_proc_clk`). Internally, it utilizes registers (`ser_count`, `co_count`, `fs_count`, `frame_syn`, `first_pass`, and others) and multiplexers (`mux_serial_clk`, `mux_co_proc_clk`) to control and toggle clocks based on various operating modes dictated by the inputs. The Verilog code comprises different blocks handling different functionalities: the CLKBUFX4 instantiations drive the output clocks, aforementioned multiplexors select different clock sources under `test_mode`, and `always` blocks determine the behavior of internal clocks (`ser_clk`, `co_proc_clk`) and frame sync logic depending on internal counters and states. This structured approach ensures precise clock signal delivery and synchronization across different parts of a digital system.",

                    "text": "Module name: CLK_GEN. Module specification: The CLK_GEN module is designed to generate synchronized clock signals and a frame synchronization signal for various system applications. It accepts input signals such as a primary clock (`clk`), reset (`reset`), and operates under special conditions indicated by signals like `test_mode` and `i_frame_syn`. Outputs of this module include the system clock (`o_sys_clk`), serialized clock (`o_serial_clk`), frame synchronization signal (`o_frame_syn`), and coprocessor clock (`o_co_proc_clk`). Internally, it utilizes registers (`ser_count`, `co_count`, `fs_count`, `frame_syn`, `first_pass`, and others) and multiplexers (`mux_serial_clk`, `mux_co_proc_clk`) to control and toggle clocks based on various operating modes dictated by the inputs. The Verilog code comprises different blocks handling different functionalities: the CLKBUFX4 instantiations drive the output clocks, aforementioned multiplexors select different clock sources under `test_mode`, and `always` blocks determine the behavior of internal clocks (`ser_clk`, `co_proc_clk`) and frame sync logic depending on internal counters and states. This structured approach ensures precise clock signal delivery and synchronization across different parts of a digital system."
