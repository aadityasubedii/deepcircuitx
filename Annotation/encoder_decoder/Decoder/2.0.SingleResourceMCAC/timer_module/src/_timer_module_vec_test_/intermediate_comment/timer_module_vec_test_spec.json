    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is designed for simulation purposes, specifically to set up and test a 'timer_module'. It facilitates scan-based testing by initializing and controlling various test inputs and observing scan outputs. The module includes input ports such as clk (clock), reset, scan_in0 to scan_in4 (scan chain inputs), scan_enable (scan operation control), and test_mode (mode toggling between normal and test operations). It outputs scan_out0 to scan_out4, which are used to observe the module's response to scan test inputs. Internally, 'test' employs both wire and reg type signals to manage the states and outputs. Wire types are used for scan outputs, while reg types are employed for clock, reset, scan inputs, scan enable, and test mode signals. The module notably comprises an instantiation of the 'timer_module', connecting all these inputs and outputs specified. A simulation environment is established in the initial block: setting the simulation time format, optionally annotating an SDF file for delay configuration under the compiler directive 'SDFSCAN', initializing all inputs to zero, and ending the simulation with $finish, which effectively demonstrates a controlled setup for testing the 'timer_module' under specified conditions.",
