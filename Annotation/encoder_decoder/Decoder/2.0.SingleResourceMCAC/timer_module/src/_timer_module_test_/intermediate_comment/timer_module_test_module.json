    "module": "The 'test' module interfaces with the 'timer_module' for testing purposes, allowing simulation under various initial conditions and modes. It manages input signals like clock, reset, scan inputs, and modes, and provides corresponding outputs through scan chains. Internal setup includes initializing these signals and timing simulations using optionally included SDF annotations, controlled by initial blocks for setting default states and ending the simulation."
