Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module serves as a testing interface for a 'timer_module', primarily employed in simulation environments to examine the module's behavior under various conditions. It uses input ports such as 'clk' (clock) for synchronization, 'reset' for initializing or resetting the timer's state, 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' for inputting test patterns, 'scan_enable' for activating scan operations, and 'test_mode' for enabling testing functionalities. The output ports 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' correspond to each scan input, helping in observing the timer's response from its scan chains after testing. Internally, the module declares 'clk' and 'reset' as reg type signals used to control timing and initial state setting, respectively. The scan inputs ('scan_in0' to 'scan_in4'), 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode' are also defined as reg type to maintain test states. The module includes an instance of 'timer_module', wired to all inputs and outputs, ensuring the interfacing and functionality as intended. Additionally, it incorporates setup for time formatting and conditional Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotations for enhanced timing simulation, initialized in an 'initial' block which also sets default states for all inputs and terminates simulation with $finish. This setup makes it useful for testing the 'timer_module' extensively in simulated test scenarios, ensuring its compliance with expected timing and functional behaviors.
