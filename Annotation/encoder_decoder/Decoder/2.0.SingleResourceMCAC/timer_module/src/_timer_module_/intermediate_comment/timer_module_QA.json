It features three timer units, each with control, load, and value registers to configure and monitor the timers' behaviors and states. The module includes functionality for setting timer intervals, controlling their modes (such as automatic reloading), and handling timer interrupts to signal when timers reach zero. It supports both read and write operations via the bus to modify and check timer states and configurations. The logic ensures proper synchronization and updating of timer states based on control settings and decrements times accordingly. Additionally, there are debug sections in the code to assist in testing and verifying functionality during development."
