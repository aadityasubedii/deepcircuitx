The 'timer_module' manages precise timing functions using the Wishbone bus protocol, ideal for systems that require multiple timed operations. It incorporates three independent timers that can be configured, monitored, and automatically reloaded through the Wishbone interface, utilizing input/output ports for control, data transfer, and interrupts signaling. Internal logic includes dedicated registers for timer settings and values, and control flows for handling timer expirations and system-wide synchronization, all within a structured Verilog implementation that includes provision for diagnostic testing and read/write operations to ensure robust, efficient functionality.
