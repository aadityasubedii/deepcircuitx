    "module": "The 'test' module functions as a testbench for the 'LIMD' module, facilitating initialization and scan testing. It employs an 'LIMD' instance and configures it with a clock, reset, various scan inputs and outputs, and mode controls. Initialization sets all inputs to zero and applies necessary conditions, using `$sdf_annotate` for timing simulations under scan configurations, and terminates with `$finish` to end the simulation. This structured approach ensures detailed testing without additional logic within the testbench."
