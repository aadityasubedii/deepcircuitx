    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for evaluating the 'LIMD' module, primarily focusing on initializing and simulating the module under scan test conditions. Input ports include 'clk' (clock signal for timing), 'reset' (resets the 'LIMD' module), 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' (inputs specific test patterns into the 'LIMD' module), 'scan_enable' (activates scan mode), and 'test_mode' (changes operational behavior for testing purposes). The output ports, 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4', give back the results from the scan operations, reflecting various internal states of the 'LIMD' module. Internal signals such as 'clk', 'reset', and all scan-related signals (both input and output) are utilized to control and monitor the operations within the module. The code is structured into major blocks: the instantiation of the 'LIMD' module where all the ports are connected, and the 'initial' block which sets up simulation parameters, applies initial conditions, and includes handling for synthesized design delays (`$sdf_annotate`) conditional on compilation directives (`ifdef SDFSCAN`). The simulation concludes by executing the `$finish` command, indicating the end of the testing procedure. This setup ensures comprehensive testing of the 'LIMD' module's functionality under various conditions without implementing additional logic within the test module itself.",
