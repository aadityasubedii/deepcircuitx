Module name: LIMD. Module specification: The LIMD module is designed for range adjustment and filtering of a 16-bit signal A1T based on another signal A2P, incorporated within digital systems that require dynamic input signal processing. It has input ports for reset, clk, five scan signals (scan_in0 to scan_in4) used primarily for testing, scan_enable for enabling scan operations, test_mode for altering module operations during tests, and two 16-bit data signals (A1T and A2P). The output ports include similar scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) for test data extraction and a 16-bit output A1P, which is the calculated and adjusted value of A1T. Internally, the module leverages three signals: OME is a constant set to 15360, used as an offset to define upper (A1UL) and lower limits (A1LL) for A1P, where A1UL and A1LL are dynamically calculated based on A2P relative to OME and a fixed value of 65536. The module operates such that if A1T falls within specific predefined ranges relative to A1UL and A1LL, it is adjusted to these limits; otherwise, it directly reflects A1T. The operational logic is encapsulated within an 'always' block triggered by changes in A1T and A2P, ensuring timely updates of A1P as input conditions vary. This setup makes LIMD suitable for applications requiring strict adherence to signal thresholds influenced by varying reference points.
