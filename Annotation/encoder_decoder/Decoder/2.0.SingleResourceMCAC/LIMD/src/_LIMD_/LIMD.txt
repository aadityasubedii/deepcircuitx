The LIMD module adjusts a 16-bit input signal A1T within dynamic limits determined by another input A2P, ensuring it stays within defined boundaries for applications requiring range filtering. It implements this by calculating internal signals—OME (a fixed offset), A1UL (upper limit), and A1LL (lower limit)—which dynamically set the thresholds. Based on A1T's value relative to these limits, the output A1P is conditionally adjusted within an always block, responding to changes in A1T and A2P to maintain signal integrity.
