    "module": "The 'test' module serves as a testbench for simulating the 'UPA1' module, used to verify functionality and timing via various test modes and scan chains. It initializes inputs like reset, clock and scan, configures test modes through control signals, observes outputs through scan chains, and supports conditional SDF file loading to enhance timing simulation. This setup ensures comprehensive testing of the 'UPA1' module under realistic operational conditions."
