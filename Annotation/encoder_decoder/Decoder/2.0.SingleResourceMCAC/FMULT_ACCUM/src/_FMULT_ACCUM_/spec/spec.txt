Module name: FMULT_ACCUM. Module specification: The `FMULT_ACCUM` module is designed for digital signal processing, primarily performing multiplication and accumulation of inputs based on coefficients and data queues. It receives an assortment of input signals including `reset`, `start`, `clk`, coefficient inputs (`b1` to `b6`, `a1`, `a2`), data queues (`dq1` to `dq6`, `sr1`, `sr2`), and various signals for scan testing (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, `test_mode`). The outputs include scan chain outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`), an operation complete signal (`done`), and error or result signals (`sez`, `se`). Internally, the module uses registers like `f1`, `f2` for storing selected coefficients and data queues respectively, a state indicator `in_sel`, and control signals such as `clear` and `done`. The core of the module is governed by a state machine encapsulated within an always block triggered by positive edges of `reset` or `clk`. This block controls transitions through various operational states, initializes data, selects inputs, and manages the `FMULT` and `ACCUM` submodule instances (`FMULT_INST0` and `ACCUM_INST0`) for processing the inputs. These submodules are tied to the main module through the internal wiring (`S`, `W`), which transfers results and data among them, ensuring sequential processing according to the defined operational logic. The module also supports scan testing features, handled by the submodules and controlled through the primary scan-related inputs and outputs. This specification succinctly captures the functionality and organizational structure of `FMULT_ACCUM`, detailing how it manages data processing through a controlled state machine and submodules interaction.
