    "spec": "Module name: FMULT.  \nModule specification: The FMULT module is designed for floating-point multiplication, specifically handling the product of two inputs AnBn and SRnDQn and generating an output WAnWBn. The inputs include a reset signal, a clock signal (clk), scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4) used for scan testing, a scan enable signal, and a test mode signal. The outputs consist of scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) corresponding to each scan input and the product of the multiplication in floating-point format (WAnWBn). Internal signals within the module, such as AnBnS, AnBnMAG, AnBnMANT, AnBnEXP, SRnDQnS, SRnDQnEXP, SRnDQnMANT, WAnWBnS, WAnWBnEXP, WAnWBnMANT, and WAnWBnMAG, are crucial for interpreting and manipulating the various components (sign, exponent, and mantissa) of the inputs. The module contains several blocks: Sign determination, where the sign of AnBn and SRnDQn are extracted; Magnitude calculation for AnBn; Exponent extraction and calculation for AnBn using cascaded conditional assignments; Calculation of final sign, exponent, and mantissa for the output based on the provided operands' values. This combination of arithmetic and logical operations allows the FMULT module to handle numerical range and overflow adjustments efficiently, making it a robust choice for circuit designs involving floating-point arithmetic operations.\n",
