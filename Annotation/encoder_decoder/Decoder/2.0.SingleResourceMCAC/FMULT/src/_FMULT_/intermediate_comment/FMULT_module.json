    "module": "The FMULT module performs floating-point multiplication of two input values, AnBn and SRnDQn, producing a result WAnWBn, adjusted for floating-point formatting including sign, exponent, and mantissa calculations. This functionality is achieved through internal signal manipulations for sign determination, magnitude adjustment, exponent calculation, and output preparation, combined with conditional and arithmetic operations to handle different numerical ranges and overflow conditions efficiently."
