The multiplication is done after extracting and manipulating the sign, exponent, and mantissa from the inputs, with adjustments for the format and magnitude. The result includes a corrected sign, exponent, and scaled mantissa, handling different numerical ranges and overflow conditions. This module also includes additional logic to interface with testing and scan operations."
