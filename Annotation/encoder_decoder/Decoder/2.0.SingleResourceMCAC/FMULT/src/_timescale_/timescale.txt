The code snippet sets the simulation time unit and precision to 1 nanosecond, ensuring that simulations accurately reflect the intended timing for analysis. There are no module functionalities or implementation details provided as the snippet only contains the `timescale` directive, which configures simulation settings and does not participate in any module-specific operations or signal processing.
