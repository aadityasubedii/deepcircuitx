    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: The 'test' module encapsulates the simulation of an FMULT module primarily for scan testing purposes. It manages test modes, and simulation of clock, reset operations and scan chains within a testing environment. This module has multiple input ports including `clk` (clock), `reset`, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, and `test_mode`. The `clk` input is the primary clock that controls the FMULT module operations. `reset` is used to reset the FMULT to a known state. `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` are utilized to drive scan test data into the FMULT's internal state elements, while `scan_enable` dictates whether the module operates in normal or scan test mode. `test_mode` switches the module between operational modes. Corresponding output ports are `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, mirroring the internal data shifted through the scan chains, facilitating the verification of internal states under various test conditions. Internal definitions include `clk` and `reset` as registers, critical for initializing and synchronizing the FMULT operations. Additionally, the Verilog file defines and uses the `FMULT` instance and initializes it with all inputs and outputs properly mapped; this instance is central to the functionality of the 'test' module. The initial block is notable for setting up essential simulation properties such as the time format and optional SDF annotation (if compiled with `SDFSCAN` defined), initializing all states, and simulating end of operations via `$finish`. This structured approach facilitates detailed states and behavior verification of the FMULT module under strict test scenarios, typical in production testing and debugging phases.",
