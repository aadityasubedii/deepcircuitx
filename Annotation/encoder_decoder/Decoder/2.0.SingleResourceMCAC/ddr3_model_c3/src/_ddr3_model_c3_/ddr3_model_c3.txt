This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM memory device, implementing its behavior and timing characteristics. It processes input commands, manages internal states, and performs read/write operations while adhering to DDR3 specifications. The module uses task-based implementations for command decoding, data handling, and timing checks. It maintains mode registers, tracks bank states, and enforces timing parameters through various counters and flags. The module also includes comprehensive error checking and reporting for timing violations and illegal operations.
