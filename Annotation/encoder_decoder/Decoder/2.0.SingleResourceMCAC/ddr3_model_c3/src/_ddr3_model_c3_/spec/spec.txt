Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module represents a DDR3 SDRAM memory model that simulates the behavior and timing characteristics of a DDR3 memory device. It includes input ports for control signals (rst_n, ck, ck_n, cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), addressing (ba, addr), and data transfer (dm_tdqs, dq, dqs, dqs_n), as well as output ports for termination (tdqs_n) and an input for on-die termination control (odt). The module uses internal signals to manage timing parameters, mode registers, bank states, and various counters for different operations. It implements features such as initialization sequence, mode register settings, read/write operations with proper latencies, and adherence to DDR3 timing specifications. The code is organized into
