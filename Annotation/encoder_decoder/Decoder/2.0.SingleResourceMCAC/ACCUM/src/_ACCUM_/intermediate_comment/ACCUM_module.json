    "module": "The ACCUM module functions as an accumulator, adding the 16-bit input `W` to the output register `S` with each clock cycle (`clk`) unless a reset (`reset`) or clear (`clear`) signal is active. It is implemented using an always block sensitive to the clock and reset signals, checking for reset first, then clear, and finally performing the addition when neither control signal is active, ensuring robust, synchronous operations tailored for both regular functioning and testing scenarios."
