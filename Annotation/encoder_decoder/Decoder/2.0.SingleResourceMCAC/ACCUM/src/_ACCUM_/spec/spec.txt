Module name: ACCUM. Module specification: The ACCUM module is an accumulator which adds the input signal `W` to the registered output `S` on each positive edge of the clock `clk`, unless either the `reset` or `clear` inputs are high. The module efficiently accumulates or clears the output based on these control signals, facilitating predictable, synchronous operations. Inputs to the module include `reset`, an asynchronous signal resetting `S` to 0; `clk`, which synchronizes data operations; `clear`, a synchronous signal which clears `S` at the clock edge; `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` for scan chain testing; `scan_enable`, controlling the operation of scan test inputs; `test_mode`, toggling test-specific behaviors; and `W`, a 16-bit data input. The outputs comprise `S`, a 16-bit register accumulating `W`, and `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, reflecting internal states for diagnostics in test modes. The module lacks internal signals, directly utilizing its input and output constructs to manage the state of `S`. The Verilog describes a crucial combinational logic, executed in an always block triggered by the positive edge of `clk` or the high state of `reset`, prioritizing reset operations, followed by clear conditions, and then regular accumulation. This design ensures flexibility for testing and regular operation within the same structural framework.
