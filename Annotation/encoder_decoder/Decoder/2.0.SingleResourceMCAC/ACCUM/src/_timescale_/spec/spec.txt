Module name: Not available. 
Module specification: The Verilog snippet provided does not constitute an entire module but is limited to a directive line: `timescale 1ns / 1ns`. This directive solely sets the time unit and time precision at 1 nanosecond each for simulations using this code. It does not encompass the declaration or definition of a Verilog module, hence there are no input or output ports, or internal signals involved. Additionally, there are no distinct blocks or sections concerning functional logic or data operations. The directive functions to control simulation-specific settings, ensuring that time in simulations is measured and represented accurately without introducing any additional functional complexities typically observed in Verilog modules.
