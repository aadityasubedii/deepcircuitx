    "module": "This directive sets the time unit and precision for Verilog simulations to 1 nanosecond, ensuring that all simulated events and operations are quantified and aligned precisely with the defined temporal resolution. It does not embody a typical module structure but manages simulation environment settings crucial for accurate timing analysis."
