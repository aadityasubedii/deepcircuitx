    "module": "The 'test' module serves as a testbench for the 'uart' module, focusing on initialization and signal control for functional and scan testing. It includes input ports for reset, clock, and testing signals, and outputs for observing scan results. Implementation details cover the instantiation of the 'uart' module, configuration of a timing environment, optional SDF annotation for scan tests, and initial signal settings, ensuring all components are initialized to known states before simulation termination."
