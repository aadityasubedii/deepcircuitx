Module name: test. 
Module specification: The 'test' module is a testbench designed for the functional and scan testing of a 'uart' module. It primarily manages the initialization and controlling of signals including reset, clock, and several test-related inputs and outputs. Its input ports include 'reset', which resets the internal state of the 'uart' module; 'clk', a clock signal for synchronization; 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', which are used as scan inputs to provide test vectors; 'scan_enable', which enables scan test mode operation; and 'test_mode', which switches the module into a test mode. The output ports are 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4', used for observing the outputs from the 'uart' during scan testing. Internal signals such as 'clk', 'reset', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode' assist in controlling the functional and timing aspects of the module under test. The code includes an instantiation of a 'uart' module, time format specifications for simulation, conditional annotation of an SDF file for scan testing, and the initialization of primary signals before terminating the simulation.
