Module name: uart. Module specification: This module implements a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) interface with configurable baud rates, supporting both transmit and receive operations. It features input ports for clock, reset, scan chain inputs, Wishbone bus interface, and UART signals, while output ports include scan chain outputs, Wishbone bus responses, UART interrupt, and transmit/receive signals. Internal signals manage FIFO buffers, state machines, and timing for both transmit and receive operations. The module is divided into several functional blocks: FIFO management for both TX and RX, transmit and receive state machines, baud rate generation, interrupt handling, and Wishbone bus interface. It supports features such as configurable FIFO depths, flow control (CTS/RTS), and various UART configurations through register access. The code includes debugging features and error checking for FIFO overflow/
