It handles serial communication with configurable baud rates, supporting both transmit and receive operations. The module includes FIFO buffers for both TX and RX, interrupt generation, and flow control (CTS/RTS). It also implements a Wishbone bus interface for register access and data transfer. The UART supports various configurations such as enabling/disabling FIFOs, setting baud rates, and controlling interrupts. The module uses state machines to manage the transmission and reception of data bits, including start, data, and stop bits."
