    "module": "This module implements a UART interface with configurable baud rates, supporting both transmit and receive operations. It utilizes FIFO buffers for TX and RX, state machines for bit-level operations, and a Wishbone bus interface for register access and data transfer. The module includes features such as flow control (CTS/RTS), interrupt generation, and configurable settings (e.g., FIFO depth, baud rate). It manages timing through clock-based counters, handles data serialization/deserialization, and provides status flags for FIFO fullness and interrupts."
