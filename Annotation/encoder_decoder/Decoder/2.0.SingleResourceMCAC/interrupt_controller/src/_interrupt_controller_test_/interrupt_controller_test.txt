The 'test' module is designed to simulate and test the 'interrupt_controller' under various conditions, focusing on both normal and scan mode operations. It achieves this through a suite of input and output ports connected to an instantiated 'interrupt_controller', controlled by initial conditions set in the code for simulation purposes, including zeroing inputs and optionally loading SDF conditions when compiled with 'SDFSCAN', concluding with a simulation termination command.
