Module name: test. 
Module specification: The 'test' module is designed primarily for simulation and testing of the 'interrupt_controller'. It facilitates testing the behavior of the controller in both normal and test (scan) modes. The module contains several input ports: `clk` (a clock signal for synchronization), `reset` (a signal to reset the controller to a known state), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (test inputs used to feed test data into the controller), `scan_enable` (to enable test mode), and `test_mode` (to switch between normal and test operational modes). The output ports include `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, which provide feedback or results from the scan testing. Internally, similar named signals are used to connect these external ports to the instantiated `interrupt_controller` module, ensuring proper data flow and control for testing operations. The Verilog code comprises two main blocks: the instantiation of the `interrupt_controller`, where all input and output connections are defined, and an initial block which sets up the initial state for simulation, including setting all inputs to zero, and optionally annotating an SDF file when compiled with `SDFSCAN`, before terminating the simulation with `$finish`. This setup is crucial for testing the functionality and operational integrity of the interrupt controller under controlled conditions.
