    "module": "The 'test' module serves as a testbench for the 'interrupt_controller', simulating various operational scenarios to ensure its functionality and robustness in handling interrupts. It deploys input ports for clock, reset, scan operations, and test modes, along with respective outputs for viewing the results. The code initializes test conditions and optionally incorporates timing information from SDF files when compiled with SDFSCAN. This structure facilitates systematic, scenario-based testing of the interrupt controller's response to internal state manipulations and special operational modes."
