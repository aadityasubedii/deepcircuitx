Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is designed to simulate the 'interrupt_controller' module, primarily for testing its robustness and correctness in handling various interrupts under controlled scenarios. This testbench module includes various input ports such as clk (clock signal), reset, scan_in0 to scan_in4 (scan chains for internal state manipulation and testing), scan_enable (activates scan test mode), and test_mode (activates specific test behaviors). Output ports include scan_out0 to scan_out4, which output the result of the scan inputs after processing. Internal signals, replicated as input and output port signals, include clk, reset, scan inputs, scan_enable, and test_mode, and they facilitate the correct operation and synchronization of the test simulation. The Verilog code includes an instance of the 'interrupt_controller', which is wired to the respective inputs and outputs. The initial block initializes signals, optionally annotates timing information using SDF files if compiled with SDFSCAN defined, and sets simulation start conditions, thus ensuring that the 'interrupt_controller' can be tested from a known state, under various scenarios including reset and scan operations.
