    "module": "This Verilog snippet sets the simulation time parameters, specifying both the time unit and time precision as 1 nanosecond. This directive informs simulation tools on handling time-related calculations, ensuring that simulations operate with a high level of temporal accuracy, though it does not itself implement any functional logic or module behaviors."
