It handles both regular interrupts (IRQs) and fast interrupts (FIRQs). The module aggregates interrupt input signals from various sources (like UART, timers, and DMI), and it can set or clear these interrupts through write operations to specific control registers. The output of the module determines which interrupts are active based on enabled settings and can generate combined interrupts signals (`o_irq` and `o_firq`) for the system. The module supports reading and writing register values through a Wishbone interface, allowing for dynamic control of interrupt settings at runtime."
