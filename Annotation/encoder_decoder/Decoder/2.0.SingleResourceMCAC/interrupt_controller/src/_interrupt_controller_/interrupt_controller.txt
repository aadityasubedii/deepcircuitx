The `interrupt_controller` module manages and prioritizes regular and fast interrupts from various system components like UARTs and timers via a Wishbone interface. It integrates input interrupt signals, classifies them into IRQs and FIRQs based on enabled settings, and processes them for appropriate system response. Internal logic uses registers to enable, disable, and store interrupt states, ensuring dynamic control while maintaining system stability. Output signals include both data for the Wishbone bus and interrupt signals to the CPU, facilitated by conditional checks synchronized with system clock and reset operations.
