Module name: LIMC. Module specification: The LIMC is a Verilog module designed to limit the ranges of a 16-bit input signal, A2T. It outputs a corresponding 16-bit signal, A2P, which adjusts according to predefined upper and lower limits to maintain signal stability or ensure operational safety in electronic systems. The module includes input ports such as reset, clk (for synchronization), five scan_in ports (scan_in0 to scan_in4) for testing purposes, scan_enable to activate scanning, and test_mode that modifies the module's normal behavior. The output ports include five corresponding scan_out ports (scan_out0 to scan_out4) and the modified signal A2P. Internally, the module utilizes two 16-bit registers, A2UL and A2LL, holding the upper (0x3000) and lower (0xD000) limits, respectively. The core functional block evaluates the input signal A2T and adjusts A2P accordingly: if A2T is between 0x8000 and 0xD000, A2P is set to 0xD000; if A2T is between 0x3000 and 0x7FFF, A2P is set to 0x3000; otherwise, A2P mirrors A2T. This ensures that A2P never exceeds the defined thresholds, thereby safeguarding the device's functioning or ensuring compliance with design specifications.
