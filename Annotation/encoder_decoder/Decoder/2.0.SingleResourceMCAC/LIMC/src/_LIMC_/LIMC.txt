The LIMC module limits a 16-bit input signal (A2T) within specified upper (0x3000) and lower (0xD000) thresholds, outputting the adjusted signal as A2P. It uses internal registers (A2UL for the upper limit and A2LL for the lower limit) to set A2P based on ranges defined relative to A2T, ensuring signal stability and operational safety in systems.
