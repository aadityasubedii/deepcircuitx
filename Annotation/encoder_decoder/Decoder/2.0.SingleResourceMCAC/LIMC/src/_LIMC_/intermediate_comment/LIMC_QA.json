It adjusts the output signal, A2P, based on predefined upper and lower limits. If A2T is between 0x8000 and a lower limit (0xD000), A2P is set to this lower limit. If A2T is between an upper limit (0x3000) and 0x7FFF, A2P is set to the upper limit. For values of A2T outside these ranges, A2P simply mirrors the value of A2T. This could be used to ensure signal values stay within certain operational boundaries."

Whenever the value of A2T falls between this upper limit and 0x7FFF, the output A2P is set to A2UL, effectively capping it at this upper threshold.\n- A2LL: Similar to A2UL, A2LL is another 16-bit internal register that holds the lower limit for the input signal A2T. It is set to a constant value of 0xD000. If A2T is within the range of 0x8000 to A2LL, the output A2P is set to A2LL, ensuring the signal does not drop below this lower threshold."
