    "module": "The \"test\" module functions as a testbench for the \"LIMC\" DUT, providing necessary control and input signals for scan testing. It initializes all control and input signals to zero, connects these signals to the DUT, optionally applies SDF annotations based on compilation directives, and terminates the simulation immediately to establish a basic environment for potential extensive scan testing."
