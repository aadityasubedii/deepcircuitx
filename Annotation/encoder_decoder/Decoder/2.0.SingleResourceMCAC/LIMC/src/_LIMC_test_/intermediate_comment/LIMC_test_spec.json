    "spec": "Module name: test. \nModule specification: The \"test\" module serves as a testbench for the Design Under Test (DUT), named \"LIMC\". It is primarily designed to initialize and provide signals to the DUT, aiding in the assessment of its functionalities through scan testing. The module includes input ports such as `clk` (clock input for synchronization), `reset` (for initializing or resetting the DUT), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (scan input ports for inserting test data into the DUT's flip-flops), `scan_enable` (to enable scan testing mode), and `test_mode` (to toggle the DUT into a test-specific mode). The output ports comprised of `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, output the data from the DUT's flip-flops, essential for observing the internal states during test operations. Internally, the module employs these signals to interface with the DUT instance named `top`. Within its initial block, the module sets all inputs and controls to zero, optionally annotates SDF timing information depending on the `SDFSCAN` compilation macro, and concludes the simulation immediately using `$finish;` for a straightforward initial test setup without extended sequences or timing simulations. This structure effectively prepares the environment for further detailed scan testing as needed.",
