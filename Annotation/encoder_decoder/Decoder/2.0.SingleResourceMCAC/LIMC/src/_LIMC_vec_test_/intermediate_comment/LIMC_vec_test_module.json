    "module": "The 'test' module is designed to validate the LIMC system by simulating various configurations and verifying outputs against expected results. It utilizes arrays for storing configuration parameters, and loops through these configurations to drive tests, capturing discrepancies through comparisons of actual and expected outputs. The environment is synced by a clock signal, toggled to coordinate with the input of test data and observation of outputs, ensuring comprehensive system testing within defined scenarios."
