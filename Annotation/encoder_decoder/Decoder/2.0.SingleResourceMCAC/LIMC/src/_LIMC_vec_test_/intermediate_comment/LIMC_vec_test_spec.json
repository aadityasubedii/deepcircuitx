    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: The 'test' module is a comprehensive testbench designed to validate the LIMC system under various configurations and input conditions. It simulates the system using input ports such as a clock signal (clk), a reset signal (reset), scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4), a scan enable (scan_enable), a test mode (test_mode), and a 16-bit input array (A2T). The scan inputs and the test mode control the test sequences and conditions, while A2T drives test data into the system. The outputs include scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) for observing internal states and a 16-bit output array (A2P) that represents the processed test results. Internal signals include arrays for rates, laws, operations, types, and models, alongside variables like rate, law, operation, type, model, j, and loop that manage the flow of test configurations and sequences. Temporary storage for vector sizes and in/output data (vectorSizes, A2Ts, A2Ps) is also used. The code is structured into blocks for initializing simulation parameters, toggling the clock, setting up testing scenarios under various conditions through nested loops, reading expected input/output data, and comparing actual outputs to expected results. If discrepancies are found, error messages are generated. The test ends with a message indicating the completion of all test scenarios.",

The primary purpose is to validate the LIMC's behavior under different conditions by checking if the actual output matches the expected output.

It simulates the system using input ports such as a clock signal (clk), a reset signal (reset), scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4), a scan enable (scan_enable), a test mode (test_mode), and a 16-bit input array (A2T). The scan inputs and the test mode control the test sequences and conditions, while A2T drives test data into the system. The outputs include scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) for observing internal states and a 16-bit output array (A2P) that represents the processed test results. Internal signals include arrays for rates, laws, operations, types, and models, alongside variables like rate, law, operation, type, model, j, and loop that manage the flow of test configurations and sequences. Temporary storage for vector sizes and in/output data (vectorSizes, A2Ts, A2Ps) is also used. The code is structured into blocks for initializing simulation parameters, toggling the clock, setting up testing scenarios under various conditions through nested loops, reading expected input/output data, and comparing actual outputs to expected results. If discrepancies are found, error messages are generated. The test ends with a message indicating the completion of all test scenarios."
