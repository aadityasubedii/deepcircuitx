It supports write and read operations where the width of the data and the address can be parameterized. The SRAM supports byte-level writing enabled by the 'i_byte_enable' signal, allowing selective updating of bytes within the word during a write operation. It has an initialization feature controlled by the 'INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO' parameter where memory can either remain unchanged, be set to all zeros, or be set to all ones upon reset.
