    "module": "The generic_sram_byte_en module simulates a parameterizable SRAM supporting byte-wise write operations and flexible initialization. It utilizes input signals for data, address, and byte enable for selective memory updates, and incorporates test modes with scan chains. Resets trigger memory initialization based on a configurable parameter, while clock-driven logic handles data reads and writes, ensuring operations are synchronous and tailored to the byte-level granularity."
