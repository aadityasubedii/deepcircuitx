Module name: generic_sram_byte_en. Module specification: The generic_sram_byte_en module mimics a parameterizable SRAM with selective byte enable functionality for memory operations. It supports write and read operations where both data and address widths are customizable. The module is structured with inputs for reset, clock (clk), and test mode operationsâ€”including scan chain data for test mode accessed through scan_in0 to scan_in4 inputs and scan_out0 to scan_out4 outputs. Writing into the memory is enabled through the i_write_enable signal, and the specific memory location is determined by the i_address input. Data to be written and byte enable signals are provided by i_write_data and i_byte_enable, respectively, which control byte-wise data writing. The module outputs read data through the o_read_data port which provides the data stored at a specified memory address. Internally, the module includes a memory array 'mem' used for storing data, with iterators 'i' and 'j' controlling byte-wise writing and memory initialization during reset. The model includes mechanisms to handle reset conditions where memory can either be initialized to zeros, remain unchanged, or set to all ones based on the INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO parameter through a conditional block. Write operations are further detailed in another code block that iterates over each byte, checking byte enable signals to selectively update memory.
