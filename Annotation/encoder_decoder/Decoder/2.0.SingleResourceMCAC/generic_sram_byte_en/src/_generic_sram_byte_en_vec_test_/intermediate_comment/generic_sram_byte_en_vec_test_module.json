    "module": "The 'test' module facilitates the scan testing of the `generic_sram_byte_en` component by simulating inputs and capturing outputs through dedicated scan chains. It initializes and manages timing, input, and output signals such as clock, reset, and scan chains, controlled via an initial block that sets conditions, optionally includes SDF annotations for accuracy in timing verification, and uses a termination command to conclude the simulation post-initialization."
