Module name: test. 

Module specification: The 'test' module acts as a testbench specifically designed to test the 'generic_sram_byte_en' module, specifically its SRAM functionality with byte enable capability. This module uses input ports: 'clk' (clock signal to synchronize operations), 'reset' (resets the module to a known state), 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' (scan input signals for scan test pattern shifting), 'scan_enable' (activates scan test mode), and 'test_mode' (indicates operation in test mode). The output ports include 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4', which are used to observe the test outputs post scan operations. Internal signals mirror these input and output ports to facilitate connections and module operations internally. The primary block in the code is the instantiation of the 'generic_sram_byte_en' module connecting all these ports. The initial block sets up the simulation environment, including time formatting and possible SDF file annotation conditional on compile-time flags, initializing signal states, and ending the simulation. This setup effectively verifies the 'generic_sram_byte_en' module's response to various test scenarios, ensuring its functionality and reliability through structured test pattern inputs and outputs.
