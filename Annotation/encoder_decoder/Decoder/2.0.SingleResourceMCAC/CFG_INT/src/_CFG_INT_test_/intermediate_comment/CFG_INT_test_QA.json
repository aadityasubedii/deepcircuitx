The test is conducted by stimulating input signals and observing the output response over 1000 test cycles for encoder and decoder configurations, comparing the results against expected values. It involves the use of tasks for writing and reading coded data via the interface, error checking, and generating random test data to validate correct behavior and interaction of internal components under test conditions, including error handling and system reset functionality. Furthermore, it includes test scenarios for checking status registers and flags indicating operational readiness in both encoding and decoding elements of the design. The module uses inline comments to identify critical sections, such as initialization, test signal generation, and error check points, enhancing readability and maintainability of the test procedure."
