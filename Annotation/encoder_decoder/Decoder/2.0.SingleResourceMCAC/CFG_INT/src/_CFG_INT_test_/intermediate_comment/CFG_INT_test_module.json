    "module": "The 'test' module exercises the functionality of a configurable hardware using the Wishbone protocol to validate encoder and decoder operations. It initializes digital signals and employs tasks to handle read/write operations via the Wishbone interface, simulating various test conditions through random data generation and strobe sequences, checking error handling, and confirming data integrity with expected values."
