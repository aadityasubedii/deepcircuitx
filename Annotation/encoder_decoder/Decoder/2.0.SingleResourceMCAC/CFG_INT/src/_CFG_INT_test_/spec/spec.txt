Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is designed to verify the functionality of a configurable integrated hardware utilizing the Wishbone interface for encoder and decoder operations. The module uses asynchronous reset (`reset`), clock signal (`clk`), and various scan inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`) and outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`) for diagnostics. Control signals like `scan_enable` and `test_mode` toggle between normal operation and test modes. Internally, the module manages control, data, address, and Wishbone interface signals such as `cs`, `ws`, `rs` (for select, write, and read operations respectively), data buses (`w_data`, `r_data`), address buses (`addrs`, `i_wb_adr_e`, `i_wb_adr_d`), and interface controls (`i_wb_sel_e`, `i_wb_sel_d`, `i_wb_we_e`, `i_wb_we_d`). The code is structured into initialization, main test loops for encoder and decoder read/write operations, random test data generation, data verification stages, and tasks like `wb_read_strobe_e/d` and `wb_write_strobe_e/d` to manage Wishbone read and write operations for both encoder and decoder. Overall, the module provides extensive test coverage for ensuring the functionality of the encoded and decoded data paths under dynamic conditions, with provisions for error detection and reporting.
