The CFG_INT module handles configuration and interface operations for encoders and decoders within an integrated circuit, facilitating data management and settings adjustments via input signals and internal states. It supports reset, clock, and scan operations along with read and write functionalities, merging Wishbone bus interactions for robust data handling. It implements separate logical blocks for dealing with encoder and decoder configurations, including read and write operations synchronized by internally generated clocks, and manages transaction acknowledgments through internal sequential logic and status registers.
