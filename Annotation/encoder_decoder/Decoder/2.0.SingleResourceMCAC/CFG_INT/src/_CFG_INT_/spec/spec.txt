Module name: CFG_INT.

Module specification: The CFG_INT module is designed to manage configuration and interfacing tasks for encoder and decoder settings in an integrated circuit. This module accepts input signals including a reset, clock, scan inputs, and control signals for read/write operations, and integrates with a Wishbone bus for specific operations. It outputs scan results and read data, and provides data and status over the bus for both encoders and decoders. Internal signals such as configuration status flags, readiness indicators, and buffers support the data handling and transaction acknowledgment processes. The code is divided into several key sections: resetting and initializing on power-up or reset, reading from the encoder and decoder channels, and handling write operations to configure the channels. Additionally, separate blocks handle Wishbone bus interactions for encoder and decoder configurations, managing transactions including data delivery and acknowledgment. Overall, this module ensures robust data handling and configuration management within customizable encoder and decoder setups in a system.
