    "spec": "Module name: test. \nModule specification: The 'test' module is designed as a testbench for simulating the 'CFG_INT' integrated circuit configuration, ensuring it performs correctly under various conditions. It simulates input and output for the 'CFG_INT' module through established connections like a clock (`clk`), reset (`reset`), multiple scan chains (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`), scan enable (`scan_enable`), and test mode (`test_mode`) signals. These inputs are primarily used for shifting test patterns into the 'CFG_INT' module, whereas outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`) provide the response based on these test patterns, crucial for analyzing the module's integrity. The internal signals within the testbench include all inputs and outputs connected to the 'CFG_INT' module, facilitating the operational control and synchronization required for testing. The Verilog code contains an initial block which initiates these signals to default (low) states, includes a timestamp format for simulation, conditionally loads a Standard Delay Format (SDF) file if supported by the simulation environment (`SDFSCAN` directive), and terminates the simulation with `$finish`, ensuring all processes halt effectively after initial conditions are set and evaluated. This module serves as a comprehensive environment to verify the functionality and response accuracy of the 'CFG_INT' under test modes, capitalizing on automated test pattern generation and response analysis.",
