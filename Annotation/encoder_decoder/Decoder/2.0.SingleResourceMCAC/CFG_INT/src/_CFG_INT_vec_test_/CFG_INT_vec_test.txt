The 'test' module functions as a testbench for verifying the 'CFG_INT' integrated circuit configuration, ensuring accurate operation under varied test conditions. It implements this by initializing signals like clock, reset, multiple scan inputs and outputs, scan enable, and test modes to default states, and includes conditional SDF annotations for precise timing simulations, effectively simulating and analyzing the response of 'CFG_INT' to ensure its integrity and functional correctness.
