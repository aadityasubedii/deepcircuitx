This Verilog snippet configures simulation timing by setting a timescale of 1 nanosecond for both the time unit and the resolution, ensuring that the simulator interprets and measures time consistently during simulations. It does not contain functional modules or processing elements, as its purpose is solely to establish simulation parameters.
