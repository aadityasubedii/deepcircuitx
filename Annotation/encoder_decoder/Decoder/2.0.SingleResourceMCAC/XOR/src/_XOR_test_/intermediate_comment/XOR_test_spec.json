    "spec": "Module name: test. \nModule specification: The \"test\" module is specialized for evaluating the functionality of an XOR component within a test environment. It contains both input and output ports such as `clk` (clock input to synchronize operations), `reset` (resets the module's state), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (inputs for scan data used in test modes), `scan_enable` (activates the scan mode), `test_mode` (selects between normal and test operations), `DQ` and `DQn` (digital inputs for additional logic functions), and outputs `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` (show results from scan test) plus `Un` (outputs specific module status or results). Internal signals like `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` and `Un` are integrated directly from the XOR module representing values manipulated within, primarily used for testing and fault detection. The code architecture features an instantiation of an XOR module connected correctly with the test environment, a clock signal generator that operates on half the defined clock period (`CLK_PERIOD`), and an initial block setting initial conditions and terminating the simulation, aligning with its designed purpose for immediate output verification in specialized test setups without continuous operation. Thus, this module effectively sets up an environment to apply, control, and observe various test stimuli and responses in the XOR device under examination.",
