The "test" module is designed to evaluate the XOR component's functionality by simulating various test conditions. It features input ports for controlling and monitoring state, such as clocks, resets, multiple scan data inputs, and mode selections. Outputs reflect the internal scan results and module status. The module orchestrates these processes through a clock generator that toggles on half the predefined clock period, a setup for initial signal values, and termination post-setup to facilitate rapid testing without continuous operation. This setup ensures precise control and monitoring needed for component verification.
