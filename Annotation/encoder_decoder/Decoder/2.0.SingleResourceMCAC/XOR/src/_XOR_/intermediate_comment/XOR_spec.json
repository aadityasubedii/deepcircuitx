    "spec": "Module name: XOR. \nModule specification: The XOR module is designed to perform a simple yet crucial diagnostic function within digital systems by computing the exclusive OR (XOR) of the most significant bits from two digital input signals, DQ and DQn. It operates under either normal or test conditions dictated by the \u2018test_mode\u2019 input. The primary inputs include 'reset' and 'clk' for synchronization and resetting module state, 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' and 'scan_enable' for scan testing, 'test_mode', and the digital signals 'DQ' (16 bits) and 'DQn' (11 bits). The outputs are 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4', mirroring the scan inputs and possibly serving further processing, and 'Un', which outputs the result of the XOR operation on the most significant bits of DQ and DQn. Internally, the module utilizes registers 'DQS' and 'DQnS' to store these significant bits from 'DQ' and 'DQn' respectively. The main operational block encapsulated by 'always @ (DQn, DQ)' ensures immediate response to input changes, continuously updating 'DQS', 'DQnS', and 'Un' based on current inputs, with 'Un' representing the XOR output of these internal registers. This module plays a vital role in enabling condition-responsive functionalities or diagnostics within larger digital frameworks.",
