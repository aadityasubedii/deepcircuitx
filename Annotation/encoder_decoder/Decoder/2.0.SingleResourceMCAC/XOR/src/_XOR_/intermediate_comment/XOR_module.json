    "module": "The XOR module computes the exclusive OR of the most significant bits of two digital signals, DQ and DQn, to support diagnostics in digital systems under various operational modes. It stores these bits in internal registers, DQS and DQnS, and updates the output Un in response to input changes, continuously reflecting the XOR result of these significant bits."
