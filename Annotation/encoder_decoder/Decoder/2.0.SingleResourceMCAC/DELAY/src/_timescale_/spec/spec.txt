Module name: Not available. 
Module specification: The provided Verilog snippet contains only a `timescale directive and does not encompass any specific Verilog module. The `timescale directive sets the simulation time parameters, with both the time unit and the time precision defined as 1 nanosecond. This directive primarily assists in controlling how time is interpreted during simulation processes, ensuring that the simulation operates with specified resolution and timing accuracies. It does not involve any input or output ports, internal signals, or functional blocks because it is not part of a more extensive module. Therefore, the actual functionality concerning digital logic or module behavior cannot be derived from this isolated directive. Further, as only the `timescale directive is present and no additional Verilog module code is provided, there are no descriptions of internal signals or separate code blocks. This snippet is purely a simulation configuration detail with no direct impact on logic synthesis or module functionality outside the simulation environment.
