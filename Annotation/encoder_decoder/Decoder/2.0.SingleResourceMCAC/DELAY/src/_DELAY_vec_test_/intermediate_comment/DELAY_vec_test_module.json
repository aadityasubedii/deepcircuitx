    "module": "The \"test\" module simulates the \"DELAY\" submodule by initializing test conditions and monitoring outputs. Using input ports for clock, reset, scan data, and mode settings, along with output ports to observe responses, it configures the DELAY submodule through direct signal mappings and a controlled initial block that sets simulation parameters and states, concluding with a simulation finish command. This setup aids in verifying the DELAY submodule's functionality and timing under various test scenarios."
