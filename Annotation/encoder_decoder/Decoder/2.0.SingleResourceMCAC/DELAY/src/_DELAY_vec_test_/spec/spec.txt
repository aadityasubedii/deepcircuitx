Module name: test. Module specification: The "test" module is designed to simulate the behavior of the "DELAY" submodule, specifically focusing on initializing and testing the signal handling through various test modes. Input ports include 'clk' (clock) used for synchronization, 'reset' for initializing the submodule state, 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' for serial test data input, 'scan_enable' to activate test modes, and 'test_mode' to set the operation mode. Output ports are 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4', serving as serial outputs for observed test results. Internal signals mirror these ports, managing timing, resetting conditions, data input, test operations, and data output. The code features an initialization block where simulation parameters such as time format are set, optional SDF annotations are included based on compilation flags, all signals are set to default states, and the simulation concludes with a $finish call, indicating a controlled and concise test run for initial setups and checks. Overall, this module primarily establishes a test environment for the "DELAY" submodule.
