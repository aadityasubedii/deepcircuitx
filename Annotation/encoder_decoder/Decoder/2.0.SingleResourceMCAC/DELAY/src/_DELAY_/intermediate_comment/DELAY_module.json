    "module": "The DELAY module functions as a 31-stage shift register, delaying the input signal 'X' by 31 clock cycles before outputting it as 'Y'. It employs an array of registers 'R[0:30]' and a separate register 'Y' for the output; each clock pulse shifts the data through the registers, starting from 'R[0]' and ending at 'R[30]', which directly feeds the output 'Y'. If reset is asserted, all registers including 'Y' are set to a defined reset value 'RSTVAL', ensuring the module can be reinitialized as required."
