It takes an input 'X' and sequentially shifts it through 31 register stages (R[0] to R[30]) each clock cycle. The output 'Y' is then assigned the value from the last register (R[30]) after every clock pulse, effectively creating a delay of 31 clock cycles between the input X and the output Y. If the reset is activated, all the registers, including the output Y, are initialized to the value specified by the parameter RSTVAL. This module is parameterized by SIZE, which specifies the bit-width of the inputs X, output Y, and internal registers R, and by RSTVAL, which defines the reset value for these registers."
