    "spec": "Module name: DELAY. Module specification: The DELAY module serves as a shift register with a depth of 31, designed to delay the input signal 'X' by 31 clock cycles before being output as 'Y'. Key input ports include 'reset' (an active-high signal for initializing registers to a default reset value specified by RSTVAL), 'clk' (the clock signal for synchronizing data shifts), specific scan inputs 'scan_in0' through 'scan_in4' and 'scan_enable' for test configurations, 'test_mode' for toggling operation modes, and 'X', the primary data input. Output ports comprise 'scan_out0' through 'scan_out4' and the delayed data output 'Y'. Internally, the module utilizes an array 'R' of 31 registers, which sequentially store the data shifts happening each clock cycle, and a register 'Y' that holds the output, sourced from the last register in the sequence. The code includes an always block triggered on either a positive clock edge or a positive reset edge, handling the reset logic by initializing all registers and outputs, and the normal shift operation that updates the register values and output successively each clock tick. This design ensures a comprehensive setup for data delay, testing, and reset functionalities within digital systems involving clock-synchronized operations.\n",

It takes an input 'X' and sequentially shifts it through 31 register stages (R[0] to R[30]) each clock cycle. The output 'Y' is then assigned the value from the last register (R[30]) after every clock pulse, effectively creating a delay of 31 clock cycles between the input X and the output Y. If the reset is activated, all the registers, including the output Y, are initialized to the value specified by the parameter RSTVAL. This module is parameterized by SIZE, which specifies the bit-width of the inputs X, output Y, and internal registers R, and by RSTVAL, which defines the reset value for these registers."

These registers are used to store the sequential data shifts occurring each clock cycle. When a reset occurs, all elements of this register array are set to the value of RSTVAL. During normal operation, data is shifted from R[0] to R[30], effectively creating a 31-stage shift register.\n- Y: A register that holds the output data of the module.
