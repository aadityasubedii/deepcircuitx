Module name: APRSC. Module specification: The APRSC module is a complex digital signal processing unit, likely designed for audio processing applications. It interfaces with a Wishbone bus for control and data exchange, processing input data through multiple stages including floating-point operations, accumulation, and filtering. The module has input ports for reset, clocks (clk, CoPrclk), scan chain inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4), test control signals (scan_enable, test_mode), and Wishbone bus inputs (i_wb_adr, i_wb_sel, i_wb_we, i_wb_dat, i_wb_cyc, i_wb_stb). Output ports include scan chain outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) and Wishbone bus outputs (o_wb_dat, o_wb_ack, o_wb_err).
