    "module": "This module implements a complex digital signal processing unit for audio processing applications. It interfaces with a Wishbone bus for control and data exchange, processing input data through multiple stages including floating-point operations, accumulation, and filtering. The module utilizes various submodules for operations such as addition, multiplication, delay, and trigonometric functions. It incorporates clock management, reset functionality, and supports test modes and scan chain for testing purposes. The processing chain includes peak detection, state estimation, and coefficient updates, with results accessible via the Wishbone interface."
