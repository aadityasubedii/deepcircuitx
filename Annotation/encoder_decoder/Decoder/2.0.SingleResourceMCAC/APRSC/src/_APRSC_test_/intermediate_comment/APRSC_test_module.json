    "module": "The `test` module functions as a testbench for validating the APRSC module by simulating various operational and test conditions using clocks, resets, and multiple control signals. It interfaces with the DUT via the Wishbone bus, where it configures the DUT with predefined parameters, conducts read and write operations, and compares the DUT's response against expected results. This is facilitated through internal tasks for bus transactions and signal synchronization, leveraging loaded test vectors and configurations to ensure comprehensive testing across different scenarios."
