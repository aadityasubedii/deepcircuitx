Module name: test. Module specification: The "test" module is designed for simulating and validating the functionality of an integrated audio processing system, likely an ADPCM codec. It utilizes a Wishbone bus interface for data transactions and implements a comprehensive test suite that covers various operational scenarios. The module's inputs include clock signals (clk, CoPrclk), reset, scan testing inputs, and Wishbone bus inputs for write operations. Outputs consist of scan testing outputs and Wishbone bus outputs for read operations and status signals. Internally, it uses arrays and registers to store test vectors, configuration parameters, and intermediate results. The module is structured into several key sections: initialization, clock generation, reset sequence, test vector loading, and the main test loop. This loop iterates through different combinations of models, rates, operations, types, and laws, applying test vectors to the device under test and verifying the outputs against expected results.
