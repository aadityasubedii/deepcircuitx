    "module": "This module simulates and validates an integrated audio processing system (likely an ADPCM codec) using a Wishbone bus interface. It implements a comprehensive test suite that iterates through various operational scenarios, applying test vectors to the device under test. The module loads test vectors from files, configures the system with different parameters (models, rates, operations, types, laws), and verifies outputs against expected results. It utilizes clock generation, reset sequences, and a main test loop to systematically exercise the system's functionality across multiple channels and configurations."
