    "module": "The 'test' module is designed to validate the functionality of the 'TDMI' module by simulating various test conditions and input scenarios. It achieves this through a series of initialized test setups, clock toggles, and structured test loops which systematically alter inputs and bus communications using the Wishbone protocol. The module uses internal counters, randomized inputs, and specific tasks such as `wb_read_strobe` to comprehensively assess the response of the 'TDMI' module against expected outputs, ensuring robust testing across multiple conditions and scenarios."
