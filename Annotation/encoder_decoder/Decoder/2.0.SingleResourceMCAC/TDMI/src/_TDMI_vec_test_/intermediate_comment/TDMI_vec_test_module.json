    "module": "The \"test\" module establishes a testing environment for the TDMI module, handling the initialization and configuration of control and scan signals for various test conditions. It includes inputs like clock, reset, scan signals, scan enable, and test mode controls, as well as corresponding scan outputs. Inside, the module instantiates the TDMI with these signals, incorporates optional SDF annotation for timing verification, and initializes all conditions to ensure controlled test progression. This structure facilitates comprehensive testing and verification of the TDMI module's functionality and response under different scenarios."
