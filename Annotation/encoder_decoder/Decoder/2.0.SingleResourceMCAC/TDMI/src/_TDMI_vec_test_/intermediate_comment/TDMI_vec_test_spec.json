    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The \"test\" module is designed to facilitate and manage the testing process for a TDMI module. It sets up various control and input signals for testing purposes. The input ports include 'clk' (clock), 'reset', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' (scan inputs), 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode'. 'clk' is used for synchronization, 'reset' initializes the TDMI module to a known state, 'scan_inX' inputs are part of a scan chain for fault detection or internal state observation, 'scan_enable' activates the scan mode, and 'test_mode' toggles between normal and test operation modes. The output ports are 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4', which are used to output the scan results and possibly connect to other modules for extended testing. Internal signals mirror the input and output ports, driving and managing the internal logic and states within the TDMI module and ensuring correct synchronization and functionality during test modes. The code includes an instantiation of the TDMI module, linking all these inputs and outputs appropriately. There is also an initial block that sets the simulation's time format, optionally annotates Standard Delay Format (SDF) data for scan testing based on compilation directives, and initializes all inputs to default states before finishing the simulation. This structure is critical for setting up controlled test environments to verify the functionality and robustness of the TDMI module under various conditions.",
