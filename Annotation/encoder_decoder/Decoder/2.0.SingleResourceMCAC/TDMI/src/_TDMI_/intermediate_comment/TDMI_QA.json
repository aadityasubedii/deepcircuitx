It can selectively operate in normal or test mode, defined by the input `test_mode`. When in normal mode, the module uses the `ser_clk` for operations; in test mode, it uses a regular `clk`. This module reads serial data `data_in` on each rising edge of the selected clock and expects a frame sync signal `frame_sync` to mark the beginning of a data frame. The module buffers this data and counts both bits and channels, providing data and channel information to a wishbone bus interface. This interface allows reading of complete data values or channel information, and supports commands to begin or halt operations. Additionally, the module generates an interrupt `new_data_int` when new data is ready, indicating to external systems that new data has been captured and stored."
