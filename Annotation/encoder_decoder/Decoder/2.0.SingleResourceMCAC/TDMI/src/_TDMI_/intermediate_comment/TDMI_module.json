    "module": "The TDMI module processes serial data inputs synchronized by a frame sync signal and interfaces with a Wishbone bus for data handling. It selects clocks based on the operational mode (test or normal), accumulates data bits into bytes, and tracks frames across channels. In normal mode, it uses the serial clock (`ser_clk`), and in test mode, it switches to the system clock (`clk`). The module provides data output through scan chains and Wishbone bus transactions while indicating data readiness via an interrupt."
