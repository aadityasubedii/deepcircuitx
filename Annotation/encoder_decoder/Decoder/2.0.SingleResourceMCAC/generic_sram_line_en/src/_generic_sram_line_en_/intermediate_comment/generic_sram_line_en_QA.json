It includes initialization functionality, where upon reset, memory can be set to either all zeros or all ones based on a parameter. The module allows data to be written to a specified address when write enable is activated. If write enable is not active during a read operation, it outputs data from the specified memory address. Additionally, it includes test mode and scan path capabilities for testing purposes, using several scan input and output ports."

The output is affected by the reset condition and the `i_write_enable` signal. If write is enabled and an address is specified, it reads zero; otherwise, it provides the data stored at the specified address.\n"

This array is used to store data, providing SRAM's core functionality of read and write operations at designated addresses.\n- `i`: This is an integer used as a loop counter in the reset operation.
