Module name: generic_sram_line_en. 

Module specification: The "generic_sram_line_en" module functions as a configurable SRAM with customizable data and address widths, and includes support for initialization, testing, and normal memory operations. It handles input signals like `reset` for initializing the memory based on the `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO` parameter, `clk` for timing, `test_mode` and `scan_enable` for test operations, besides `scan_in0` through `scan_in4` for input test data and outputs `scan_out0` through `scan_out4` for test data verification. The data handling is managed through `i_write_data` for the data to be stored, `i_write_enable` to control writing operations, and `i_address` to specify the memory address for operations, with the output `o_read_data` providing the data from the memory address specified. Internally, `mem` is utilized as the memory array that stores data with the `DATA_WIDTH`, and `i`, an integer used as a loop indexer during reset for initial memory setup. Key blocks in the code include the memory initialization inside a conditional reset block, where memory can be cleared or set based on a parameter, and the regular memory write and read operations managed during non-reset conditions. This setup ensures robust memory operation with necessary provisions for both normal use and testing phases.
