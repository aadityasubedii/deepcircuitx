Module name: Not available. 
Module specification: The code snippet provided does not define a Verilog module; it solely contains a `timescale directive. This directive sets both the time unit and time precision to 1 nanosecond, which is specifically used for simulation purposes in a Verilog environment. Since there is no module definition, no input or output ports are present, and there are no internal signals or functional blocks of code. The snippet is purely a simulation configuration setting and does not encompass any logical or data processing elements typically found within a Verilog module. Consequently, there is no further functional specification or structural detail to be elaborated on in the context of this code snippet.
