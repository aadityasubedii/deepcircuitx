Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for verifying and diagnosing the 'generic_sram_line_en' module, focusing on evaluating the scan chain feature typically used for silicon testing. The test module inputs include a clock signal (`clk`) to coordinate synchronous operations, an asynchronous reset (`reset`) for initializing the state, scan chain data inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`), a scan mode activation signal (`scan_enable`), and a test mode signal (`test_mode`). Output ports include the scan outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`), which represent the data shifted through the scan chain, allowing observation of internal states and diagnosing module integrity under test conditions. The internal wiring also contains these connections, ensuring the proper functionality of this test interface with the 'generic_sram_line_en' module. The initial block in the code sets up the environment, initializing all inputs to their default states, handling optional conditional Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotations for timing verification in SDF simulation environments, and ultimately concludes the simulation with a `$finish` directive. Overall, this setup provides a structured approach to testing and validation, critical for the verification of the scan chain process in the module under scrutiny.
