    "spec": "Module name: test.\nModule specification: The 'test' module is specifically crafted for simulation testing of the submodule 'generic_sram_line_en'. It controls the initialization and simulation of inputs such as a clock (`clk`), a reset signal (`reset`), scan inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`), a scan enable (`scan_enable`), and a test mode (`test_mode`). The output ports include scan outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`). The `clk` acts as the synchronization signal driving the sequential logic, with `reset` ensuring the system starts in a known state. The scan inputs are key during scan testing for loading test data into specific elements like flip-flops, while `scan_enable` and `test_mode` signals allow the control of the test conditions within the circuit, enabling modes beneficial for detailed testing. Inside the module, the main block is the instantiation of the `generic_sram_line_en` submodule, which connects these inputs and outputs directly. The initial block sets the time format for simulations and optionally includes Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotation for timing accuracy in test scenarios. It also initializes all signals to their start values, concluding with a `$finish` call to end the simulation. This organization ensures the module acts as a comprehensive testbench for robust verification of the `generic_sram_line_en` submodule behavior under various test inputs and conditions.",

When active, it allows for the shift and capture operations needed for scan testing.\n- `test_mode`: An internal signal that determines the operational mode of the `generic_sram_line_en` module.
