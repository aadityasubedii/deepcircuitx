    "module": "The 'test' module facilitates the simulation testing of the 'generic_sram_line_en' submodule, providing a framework for verifying module behaviors under various testing conditions. It achieves this by initializing and simulating inputs like clock, reset, scan chain inputs, scan enable, and test mode toggles, directly linked to the submodule. Key functionalities include setting up timing formats and incorporating optional SDF annotations to enhance testing accuracy, crucial for validating the design in a controlled simulation environment."
