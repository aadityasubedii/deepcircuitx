    "module": "The 'test' module functions as a test bench for verifying the operation of digital encoder-decoder models through detailed simulation and comparison with expected results. It uses inputs for clock signals, test modes, and scan inputs, combined with internal configuration arrays like 'rates', 'laws', and 'models' to drive the simulation. Outputs are compared against expected values under various conditions, recorded in 'In1s' and 'Out1s' arrays, using nested testing loops. Errors are logged, and the process systematically verifies all possible operational scenarios to ensure model accuracy and robustness."
