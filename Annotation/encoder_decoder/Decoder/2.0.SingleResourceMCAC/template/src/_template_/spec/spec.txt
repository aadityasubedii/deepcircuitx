Module name: TEMPLATE. Module specification: The TEMPLATE module is a basic Verilog framework designed for further elaboration and development. It does not currently implement specific logic operations but sets the groundwork with a basic structure. The module includes two input ports named 'sig1' and 'sig2', and one output port named 'sig3'. Although the exact functionalities of these ports aren't defined, they are positioned to potentially interact with or influence the internal logic after further code addition. Internally, the module declares an 8-bit register '8bit_reg' and three other registers 'reg0', 'reg1', 'reg2', which could serve diverse roles like storing temporary data or control flags in future versions of the module. Additionally, it contains an 8-bit bus '8bit_bus', and three wires 'wire0', 'wire1', 'wire2' that could be used for data movement or signal assignment in expanded implementations. Currently, the module serves primarily as a placeholder or template, with clearly structured sections for inputs, outputs, and internal signals but without active implementations.
