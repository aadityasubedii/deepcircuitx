The TEMPLATE module serves as a foundational framework for further development, lacking specific functionality at this stage. It includes input ports (sig1, sig2) and an output port (sig3) designed for future signal processing, along with internal signals like registers (8bit_reg, reg0, reg1, reg2) and wires (8bit_bus, wire0, wire1, wire2) that are poised to support data storage and signal routing in enhanced versions of the module.
