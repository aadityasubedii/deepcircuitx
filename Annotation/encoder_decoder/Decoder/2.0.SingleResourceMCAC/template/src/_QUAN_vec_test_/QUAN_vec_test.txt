The test module simulates a testbench for the QUAN module, verifying its quantization under varying encoding rates and law settings by using test vectors. It initializes encoding rates and laws, reads test vectors from memory, applies these settings in the QUAN module, and checks the quantization output against expected results, hence ensuring QUANâ€™s functional integrity across various conditions.
