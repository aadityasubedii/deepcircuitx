Typically, registers are used to store data or state information, although its specific purpose in this case isn't specified due to lack of functional code.\n- `reg0`, `reg1`, `reg2`: Single-bit registers that serve to store individual bits of data or control signals within the module.

Wires are continuously driven and carry values from source to destination.\n- `wire0`, `wire1`, `wire2`: Single-bit wires that can carry individual control or data signals. Wires provide conduits for signals and are used to connect different elements within the module, although the exact connections and roles are not defined in the snippet.\n\nOverall, these are standard Verilog types of storage and transmission signals, used typically for data or control pathways, but without further operational detail or design context provided in the snippet, their specific roles remain unspecified."
