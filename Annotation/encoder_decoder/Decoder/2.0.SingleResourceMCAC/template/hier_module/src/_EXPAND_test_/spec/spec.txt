Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is created to simulate and facilitate the initial testing of the 'EXPAND' submodule by providing necessary configurations and environments for scan testing and fault simulation. The module includes input ports such as `reset`, `clk` (clock), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (scan inputs), `scan_enable` (controls scanning operations), and `test_mode` (activates the test mode in the submodule). The output ports are `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, which reflect the results of the serial shift operations performed in the test mode enabled by the `scan_enable`. Internally, this module utilizes registered signals (`clk`, `reset`, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, `test_mode`) to drive and control the behavior of the submodule 'EXPAND', which is instantiated as 'top'. The `initial` block in the Verilog code sets the timing format, optionally annotates the Standard Delay Format (SDF) file for scan delay fault simulation depending on compilation directives, initializes all inputs and internal registers to zero, and finishes the simulation. This setup ensures that the 'EXPAND' submodule can be thoroughly tested under controlled and simulated conditions tailored for both normal and fault scan operations.
