This involves configuring input pins like `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, and `test_mode`, along with output scan pins `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`. The `test` module sets up a basic simulation environment with timing indicated in nanoseconds and handles the initial conditions such as reset and clock signals being low, and all scan inputs being low. The module appears to be designed for conditions both with and without scan delay fault simulation (SDF) through conditional compilation directives for SDF file annotation."

It likely brings the submodule to a known initial state.\n- `clk`: This is the clock input, which is crucial for timing the sequential logic in the submodule `EXPAND`.\n- `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`: These are scan inputs used for test purposes, especially in a scan test environment where testing of flip-flops and other state elements is required through serial shifting of test data.\n- `scan_enable`: This input controls whether the scanning mechanism (shift and capture operations in test mode) is active.\n- `test_mode`: This enables the test mode of operation within the submodule `EXPAND`, which can alter the normal functional behavior for purposes of testing.\n\nOutput ports: `scan_out0`, `scan_out1`, `scan_out2`, `scan_out3`, `scan_out4`.\nExplanation:\n- `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`: These are output ports that present the results from serially shifted test data through `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` when `scan_enable` is active.
