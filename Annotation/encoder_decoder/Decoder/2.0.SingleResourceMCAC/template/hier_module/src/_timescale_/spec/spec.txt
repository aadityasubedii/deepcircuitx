Module name: N/A. 
Module specification: The provided Verilog snippet does not define a Verilog module; it only includes a `timescale directive (`timescale 1ns / 1ns`). This directive is utilized to set the time unit and the time precision for the simulation environment, ensuring that any timing calculations within simulations (when modules are indeed defined and used) are interpreted in nanoseconds. There are no input or output ports, as there is no module structure defined. Consequently, there are also no internal signals or varied blocks or sections within the code since it solely consists of this directive without encompassing any functional or structural elements of a hardware design. This specification strictly relates to simulation settings and does not elaborate on any hardware module functionality, structure, or signal processing.
