Module name: EXPAND. Module specification: The EXPAND module is designed primarily to interface with scanning and testing mechanisms in digital systems, facilitating activities like testability and configurable I/O behaviors. It operates under the control of the following input ports: 'reset' to initialize or restart module operations; 'clk' which is the clock signal for synchronizing sequential logic; 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' serving as channels in the scan chain for diagnostics and testing; 'scan_enable' which activates the moduleâ€™s scanning function; and 'test_mode' that toggles between normal operation and test-specific functionalities. The module outputs corresponding signals 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' which are utilized to pass test results or internal states out of the module, potentially to subsequent modules in a scan chain or external logging/test apparatus. The provided Verilog code primarily outlines the EXPAND module's interface without delving into internal logic, as it doesn't define any internal signals or describe specific logic blocks within the module. This suggests that the internal implementation details, which would specify how inputs affect outputs, are abstracted or yet to be provided. Therefore, without additional code, the specifics of internal operations including any logic blocks or their functions remain unspecified.
