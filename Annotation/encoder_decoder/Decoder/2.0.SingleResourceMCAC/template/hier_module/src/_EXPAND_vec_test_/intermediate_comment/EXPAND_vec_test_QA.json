The initial block sets default values to these signals and specifies time formatting and optional SDF (Standard Delay Format) annotation for scan testing in a synthesis or testbench simulation environment, essentially setting up the initial conditions for a testing or verification process."

When asserted (high), the module works in scan test mode, allowing the scan_in0 to scan_in4 inputs to control the internal state.\n- test_mode: Enables a specific test mode within the EXPAND module, potentially altering its usual operational behavior for various testing scenarios.\n\nOutput ports: scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4.\nExplanation: These outputs correspond to the scan chain outputs, providing serial output from the flip-flops or internal state of the EXPAND module during scan testing. These are used to observe and verify the state of the module post scan-in operations, essential for validating the internal functionality during testing."
