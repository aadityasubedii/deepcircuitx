    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module primarily focuses on setting up the simulation environment for verifying the functionality and proper operation of the 'EXPAND' sub-module. It sets up and controls a clock signal, a reset signal, multiple scan input and output signals, a scan enable, and a test mode signal. The input ports include 'reset', 'clk', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode'. 'reset' and 'clk' are responsible for resetting the internal states and synchronizing the operations, respectively. 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' are used for serially inputting test data, 'scan_enable' toggles between normal and scan test modes, and 'test_mode' activates specific testing protocols. The output ports, 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4', serially output the scan results, crucial for analyzing the internal state post testing. Internally, the module uses these same signals to control and feed into the 'EXPAND' top module, mapping directly to similarly named ports on this submodule. The Verilog code comprises primarily of an instantiation of the 'EXPAND' submodule connected as per the specified ports and an initial block which sets all inputs to default values, specifies time and SDF annotation for scan testing, and terminates the simulation, thus providing an initial testing state and ending the simulation run.",
