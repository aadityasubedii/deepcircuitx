    "module": "The 'test' module setups up a simulation environment for the 'EXPAND' submodule, managing clock synchronization, reset, test inputs, scan control, and modes. It achieves this through defining input and output ports for all test and clock signals linked appropriately to 'EXPAND', an initial block setting all inputs to zeros, and configurations for optional SDF annotations, encapsulating initial conditions and termination of the testing sequence."
