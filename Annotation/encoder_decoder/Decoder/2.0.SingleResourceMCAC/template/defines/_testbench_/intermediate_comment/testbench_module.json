    "module": "The 'test' module demonstrates the manipulation of compilation output using Verilog preprocessor directives, specifically illustrating conditional compilation effects. It achieves this by defining and undefining macros (`ENC`, `DEC`), conditionally including a header file (\"global_defines.vh\"), and utilizing `$display` to show how macro states affect the outputted values of variables `A` and `B` at various stages, without requiring input or output ports or internal signals."
