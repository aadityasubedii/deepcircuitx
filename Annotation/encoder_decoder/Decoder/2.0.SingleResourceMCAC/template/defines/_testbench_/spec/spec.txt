Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is designed to demonstrate the use of preprocessor directives in Verilog, specifically focusing on conditional compilation based on macro definitions. This module does not have any input or output ports as its primary function is to serve as an educational and testing tool rather than performing any particular hardware operations. There are no internal signals such as wires or registers used within the module. Instead, the module utilizes macro definitions (`ENC`, `DEC`) and `$display` statements to show the effects of conditionally included content from the "global_defines.vh" file on the compilation and simulation output. The module includes three major sections in its initial block: first, it defines `ENC`, includes the "global_defines.vh", and displays the values of `A` and `B`; second, it redefines to `DEC` after clearing previous definitions, includes the file again, and displays updated `A` and `B`; finally, it clears all definitions to demonstrate the results when neither `ENC` nor `DEC` is defined. These sections collectively depict how varying the macro definitions impact the compiled values of `A` and `B`, providing a clear output of variable states in each scenario without using physical signals or ports.
