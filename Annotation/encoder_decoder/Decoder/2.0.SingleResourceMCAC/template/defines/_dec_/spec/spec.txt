Module name: dec. Module specification: The "dec" module is designed primarily for debugging purposes, where it initializes and displays the values of two 2-bit registers named A and B. These registers are set using predefined macros `A and `B, which are likely defined in the included file "global_defines.vh". The module does not feature any input or output ports, emphasizing its purpose to solely demonstrate internal values within a simulation environment without external data interaction. Internally, the module utilizes the registers A and B to hold and display these values, fulfilling its role in verifying correct initialization during the simulation. The key component of the "dec" module is the initial block that contains the assignment of values to A and B from the macros and a display statement that outputs the current values of these registers to the console. This setup aids developers in ensuring that the macro values are correctly defined and behaving as expected.
