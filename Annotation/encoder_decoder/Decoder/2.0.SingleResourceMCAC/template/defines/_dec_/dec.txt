The "dec" module initializes and displays the values of two 2-bit internal registers, A and B, primarily for debugging purposes in simulation environments. It assigns predefined macro values `A and `B to these registers and outputs their values using a $display statement, with no external inputs or outputs involved, ensuring straightforward functionality verification.
