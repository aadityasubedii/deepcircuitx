Module name: enc. Module specification: The 'enc' module is designed primarily for monitoring and potentially debugging purposes within a larger encoding system. It initializes and shows the values of two 2-bit internal registers, A and B, with values drawn from predefined parameters (`A and `B) likely defined in the included "global_defines.vh" file. This module does not feature any input or output ports, as its function is confined to the internal display of these values using the $display statement. The main body of the code comprises an initial block that assigns the predefined values to A and B and then displays these values. This hint at its purpose for internal status reporting or debugging within a system titled 'enc', suggesting a role related to encoding processes. The module uses the ifdef `ENC to potentially conditionalize this behavior, indicating its use might be configurable based on the compilation flags set in the environment or makefile directing the synthesis or simulation of the Verilog code.
