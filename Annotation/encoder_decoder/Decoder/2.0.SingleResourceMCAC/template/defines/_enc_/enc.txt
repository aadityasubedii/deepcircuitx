The 'enc' module displays the values of two internally managed 2-bit registers, A and B, initialized from parameters `A and `B defined in "global_defines.vh". Its functionality is contained in an initial block where A and B are set and their values are displayed using the $display statement, primarily serving debugging or monitoring purposes within an encoding system setup.
