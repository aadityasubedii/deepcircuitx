This is accomplished through the use of initial block which executes at simulation start, and the $display system tasks are used to print these values. This suggests that the 'mcac' module is used for monitoring or debugging purposes, to check the state of these variables in the 'ENC' and 'DEC' sub-modules at the beginning of the simulation."
