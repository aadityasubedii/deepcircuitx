    "module": "The 'mcac' module functions as a monitoring tool for debugging by displaying the internal states of the 'A' and 'B' signals in its sub-modules 'ENC' and 'DEC'. It achieves this through an initial block executing at simulation start, which outputs the values of these signals using $display tasks, ensuring visibility of the sub-modules' state without interaction through external ports."
