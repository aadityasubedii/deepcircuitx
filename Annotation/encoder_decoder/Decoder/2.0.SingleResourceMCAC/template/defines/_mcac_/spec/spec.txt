Module name: mcac. Module specification: The 'mcac' module is primarily used for monitoring and possibly debugging the internal states of its sub-modules 'ENC' and 'DEC'. It does not have any input or output ports, indicating it operates independently without interfacing directly with other external modules or systems. Key internal signals, 'A' and 'B', are utilized within these sub-modules, and their values are displayed at the start of the simulation to track or log their states. The module consists of an initial block which serves solely to display the values of these signals using `$display` system tasks, thereby detailing the internal state of 'ENC' and 'DEC' at the simulation's inception. This setup suggests that the main purpose of the 'mcac' module is to aid in debugging and monitoring the operational statuses of the encapsulated sub-modules by reporting critical variables.
