Module name: a25_barrel_shift.
Module specification: The "a25_barrel_shift" module implements a versatile barrel shifter with options for quick and full barrel shifts, designed to process 32-bit words based on specified shifting functions. It accepts various inputs including a clock signal (`clk`), an active high reset signal (`reset`), scan and test mode flags (`scan_enable`, `test_mode`), a 32-bit word to be shifted (`i_in`), a carry input (`i_carry_in`), an 8-bit shift amount (`i_shift_amount`), a boolean for immediate zero optimization (`i_shift_imm_zero`), and a 2-bit function selector (`i_function`). The outputs are a 32-bit shifted word (`o_out`), a carry output (`o_carry_out`), and a stall signal (`o_stall`) indicating if the quick shifter is active but insufficient for the specified shift amount. Internal signals include `quick_out`, `quick_carry_out` for outputs from the quick shifter, and `full_out`, `full_carry_out`, `full_out_r`, and `full_carry_out_r` for handling and stabilizing outputs from the full shifter across clock cycles. The register `use_quick_r` decides between using quick or full shifter outputs based on the stall condition. The module encapsulates two instances of `a25_shifter` parameterized to function as quick and full barrel shifters. The behavioral component managed by clock and reset signals updates internal registers (`full_out_r`, `full_carry_out_r`, and `use_quick_r`) and outputs based on the current operation mode and the outputs from either of the shifters.
