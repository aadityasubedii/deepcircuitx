    "spec": "Module name: a25_barrel_shift.\nModule specification: The \"a25_barrel_shift\" module implements a versatile barrel shifter with options for quick and full barrel shifts, designed to process 32-bit words based on specified shifting functions. It accepts various inputs including a clock signal (`clk`), an active high reset signal (`reset`), scan and test mode flags (`scan_enable`, `test_mode`), a 32-bit word to be shifted (`i_in`), a carry input (`i_carry_in`), an 8-bit shift amount (`i_shift_amount`), a boolean for immediate zero optimization (`i_shift_imm_zero`), and a 2-bit function selector (`i_function`). The outputs are a 32-bit shifted word (`o_out`), a carry output (`o_carry_out`), and a stall signal (`o_stall`) indicating if the quick shifter is active but insufficient for the specified shift amount. Internal signals include `quick_out`, `quick_carry_out` for outputs from the quick shifter, and `full_out`, `full_carry_out`, `full_out_r`, and `full_carry_out_r` for handling and stabilizing outputs from the full shifter across clock cycles. The register `use_quick_r` decides between using quick or full shifter outputs based on the stall condition. The module encapsulates two instances of `a25_shifter` parameterized to function as quick and full barrel shifters. The behavioral component managed by clock and reset signals updates internal registers (`full_out_r`, `full_carry_out_r`, and `use_quick_r`) and outputs based on the current operation mode and the outputs from either of the shifters.",

It can process both immediate zero shifts and carry inputs. The selection between quick and full shifting is determined by the shift amount and whether the quick shift result is still valid (i.e., it doesn't stall, determined by the `use_quick_r` register). The outputs of the module are the shifted data (`o_out`), the carry output resulting from the shift (`o_carry_out`), and a stall signal (`o_stall`) that indicates whether the quick shift is being used and if it's capable of handling the current shift amount. The actual shifting logic is encapsulated in instances of `a25_shifter`, parameterized differently for quick and full barrel shift capabilities. The reset operation initializes the state by setting output registers to zero and enabling the quick shift mode."
