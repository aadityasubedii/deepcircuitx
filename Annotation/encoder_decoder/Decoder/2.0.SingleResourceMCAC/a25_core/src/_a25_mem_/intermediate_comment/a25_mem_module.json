    "module": "The `a25_mem` module manages memory interactions for a processor, handling cached and uncached access, and orchestrates data write-back processes. It operates by reading input control signals like stalls, address validity, and operation type, coordinating internal logic for optimal memory access through signals that manage caching and data flow. The module interfaces directly with a cache submodule and utilizes conditional logic to control outputs, ensuring efficient memory usage and system synchronization."
