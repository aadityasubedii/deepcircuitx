Module name: a25_mem.

Module specification: The `a25_mem` module in Verilog is designed to manage memory access for a processor, specifically coordinating interactions between cached and uncached data accesses while also integrating write-back functionality. It handles inputs such as the system clock (`clk`), reset signal (`reset`), and control signals like `scan_enable` for test modes, and `i_fetch_stall` and `i_exec_stall` for stalling memory operations during fetch and execute stages. The module uses address and data inputs (`i_daddress`, `i_daddress_nxt`, `i_write_data`) along with flags (`i_write_enable`, `i_byte_enable`, etc.) to execute memory operations. It outputs signals such as `o_mem_stall` to indicate memory operation status, `o_mem_read_data` along with `o_mem_read_data_valid` for data read from memory, and write-back requests (`o_wb_cached_req` and `o_wb_uncached_req`).

Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `cache_read_data` and `address_cachable` to handle cached data operations, and `uncached_data_access` to manage direct memory accesses. It also uses a variety of control signals (`sel_cache`, `cached_wb_req`, etc.) to regulate the flow and operation of data transactions. Major sections within the module include memory read and write logic management, stalling conditions analysis based on input stalls and cache status, and the integration with an internal cache module (`a25_dcache`) that processes part of these interactions. The module further ensures coordinated operation with controls over write-back mechanisms linked through both cached and uncached pathways, alongside comprehensive handling of the test and operational modes through scan and reset functionalities. These functionalities are seamlessly orchestrated to ensure efficient memory access and integrity during the processor's operations.
