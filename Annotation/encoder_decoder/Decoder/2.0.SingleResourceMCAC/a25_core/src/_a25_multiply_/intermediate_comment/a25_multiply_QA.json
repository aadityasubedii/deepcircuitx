This module employs a multiplication algorithm that involves partial additions, conditionally modified by specific operation flags dictated by i_function: the LSB chooses standard multiply or no operation, and the MSB toggles optional accumulation with a previous result. Outputs include the 32-bit result of the multiplication or multiplication-accumulation, condition flags after the operation completion, and an indication signal when the operation is done. The computation is sensitive to stall and execution signals impacting its cycle by cycle behavior, and is also configurable to work with specific FPGAs, allowing different hardware implementation of the addition used in the algorithm."
