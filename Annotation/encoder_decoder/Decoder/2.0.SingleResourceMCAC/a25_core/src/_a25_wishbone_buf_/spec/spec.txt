Module name: a25_wishbone_buf. Module specification: The 'a25_wishbone_buf' module acts as a buffer for Wishbone interface transactions, managing both read and write operations efficiently. This module permits the queuing of write requests when the outbound interface is not ready, using an internal buffering system, and ensures read requests are correctly aligned with incoming data. Input ports include 'clk' (clock signal), 'reset' (to reset the module), 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' for test purposes, control signals like 'i_req' (request from master), 'i_write' (distinguishes between read and write operations), data inputs 'i_wdata', address 'i_addr', byte enables 'i_be', and signals 'i_accepted', 'i_rdata', and 'i_rdata_valid' to manage data acceptance and read data validity from the slave device. Output ports generated are 'o_rdata' (output read data), 'o_ack' (acknowledgment to the master), 'o_valid' (validity of output data), 'o_write', 'o_wdata', 'o_be', and 'o_addr' signalling various statuses and data relevant to ongoing transactions. Internally, the module uses several signals and registers such as 'wbuf_used_r' (tracks buffer usage), buffers like 'wbuf_wdata_r' (stores write data temporarily), 'wbuf_addr_r' (corresponding addresses), and 'wbuf_be_r' (byte enables for buffer), alongside pointers 'wbuf_wp_r' and 'wbuf_rp_r' to manage the circular buffer. Handling flags like 'busy_reading_r' and 'wait_rdata_valid_r' assist in synchronizing read operations and validating incoming data. The module comprehensively manages data transmission via conditional push and pop operations on the buffer, managing multiple state registers under clock and reset conditions to ensure smooth operations of reading from and writing to the Wishbone bus. This design effectively handles data integrity, transmission acknowledgment, and proper synchronization necessary for reliable Wishbone transactions.
