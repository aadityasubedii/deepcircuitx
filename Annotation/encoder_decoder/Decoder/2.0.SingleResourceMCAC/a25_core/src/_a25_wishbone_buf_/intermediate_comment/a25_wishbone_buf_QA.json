It uses internal buffering to manage write requests when the accepting input (i_accepted) is not ready, thus preventing data loss and ensuring that requests are processed sequentially. The module supports handling data, address, write enable signals, and byte enable lines, distinguishing between read and write operations. Further, it includes logic to handle acknowledgments and data-valid signals, interacting smoothly with external Wishbone-compliant devices or interfaces. This enables the module to operate effectively in environments where read and write operations must be carefully coordinated, such as in hardware where processing times and response times vary. The module also includes provisions for reset conditions, ensuring that it can be reliably reset to a known state."
