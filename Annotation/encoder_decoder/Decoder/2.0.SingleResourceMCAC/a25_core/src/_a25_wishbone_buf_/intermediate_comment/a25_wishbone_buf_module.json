    "module": "The a25_wishbone_buf module acts as an intermediary buffering mechanism for the Wishbone bus interface, facilitating the efficient handling of read and write requests and managing data integrity and transmission acknowledgments. It employs a dual-entry buffer for queuing write requests when the output interface is unavailable, and it synchronizes read requests through status tracking registers and conditional logic for data acceptance and validity, ensuring seamless operational transitions on clock edges and reset conditions."
