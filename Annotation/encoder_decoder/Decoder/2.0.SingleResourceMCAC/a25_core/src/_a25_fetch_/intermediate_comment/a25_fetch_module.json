    "module": "The a25_fetch module handles instruction fetching by deciding between cache and memory based on cachability and readiness. It processes input signals indicating system status and operational requirements, uses internal logic to manage data fetching, and coordinates stalling and write-back operations. The module integrates caching logic through the a25_icache sub-module, ensuring efficient instruction retrieval and synchronization with system components."
