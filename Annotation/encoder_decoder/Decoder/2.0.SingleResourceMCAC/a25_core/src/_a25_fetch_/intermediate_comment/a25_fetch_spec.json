    "spec": "Module name: a25_fetch. \n\nModule specification: The \"a25_fetch\" module is primarily responsible for the instruction fetch process in a processing system, intelligently deciding whether to retrieve instructions from a cache or directly from memory. The module is equipped with various input ports including 'clk' (clock signal for synchronized operations), 'reset' (resets module states), 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' (for test functionalities), several stall signals ('i_mem_stall', 'i_exec_stall', 'i_conflict') that influence the stalling of the fetch operations, 'i_system_rdy' (system readiness), and 'i_iaddress' with 'i_iaddress_valid' (current instruction address and its validity), among others. On the output side, it provides 'o_fetch_stall' (stalls the fetch stage), 'o_fetch_instruction' (the fetched instruction), and 'o_wb_req' with 'o_wb_address' (write-back request and corresponding address).\n\nInternally, the module employs signals such as 'core_stall', 'cache_stall', 'cache_read_data', and 'wb_req_r' to facilitate effective decision-making processes about fetching, caching, and memory access operations. For instance, 'core_stall' aggregates various external and internal stall conditions, while 'sel_cache' decides whether to access the cache based upon conditions like cachability and cache enable states. 'cache_read_data' represents the piece of data fetched from the cache relevant to the current instruction, and 'wb_req_r' assists in handling write-back requests spanning multiple clock cycles for seamless synchronization.\n\nThe design is sectionalized into processing logic that includes address cachability determination, cache selection logic, data path selections (either from cache or memory based on conditions), fetch instruction and stall status assignment, and write-back logistics control. Coupled with an instantiated module 'a25_icache' for specific cache handling, it effectively oversees the data flow for instruction fetch processes, cache interfacing, and write-back operations satisfying different operational requirements and conditions set by the input signals and internal logic assessments.",

The module is equipped with various input ports including 'clk' (clock signal for synchronized operations), 'reset' (resets module states), 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' (for test functionalities), several stall signals ('i_mem_stall', 'i_exec_stall', 'i_conflict') that influence the stalling of the fetch operations, 'i_system_rdy' (system readiness), and 'i_iaddress' with 'i_iaddress_valid' (current instruction address and its validity), among others. On the output side, it provides 'o_fetch_stall' (stalls the fetch stage), 'o_fetch_instruction' (the fetched instruction), and 'o_wb_req' with 'o_wb_address' (write-back request and corresponding address).\n\nInternally, the module employs signals such as 'core_stall', 'cache_stall', 'cache_read_data', and 'wb_req_r' to facilitate effective decision-making processes about fetching, caching, and memory access operations. For instance, 'core_stall' aggregates various external and internal stall conditions, while 'sel_cache' decides whether to access the cache based upon conditions like cachability and cache enable states. 'cache_read_data' represents the piece of data fetched from the cache relevant to the current instruction, and 'wb_req_r' assists in handling write-back requests spanning multiple clock cycles for seamless synchronization.\n\nThe design is sectionalized into processing logic that includes address cachability determination, cache selection logic, data path selections (either from cache or memory based on conditions), fetch instruction and stall status assignment, and write-back logistics control. Coupled with an instantiated module 'a25_icache' for specific cache handling, it effectively oversees the data flow for instruction fetch processes, cache interfacing, and write-back operations satisfying different operational requirements and conditions set by the input signals and internal logic assessments."
