Module name: a25_decode. Module specification: This module is responsible for decoding ARM instructions in an A25 processor. It takes inputs such as clock, reset, fetched instruction, core stall, interrupts, and execution status, and generates control signals for other parts of the processor. The module implements a state machine to handle different instruction types, including data processing, memory operations, branches, and coprocessor instructions. It also manages interrupts and exceptions. Key internal signals include instruction decoding logic, ALU and barrel shifter control, register selection, and status bit management. The module is organized into several blocks, including instruction decoding, control state management, condition checking, and output generation. It handles various instruction types like REGOP, TRANS, BRANCH, MTRANS, MULT, and SWAP, generating appropriate control signals for each. The decoder produces outputs that control the ALU, register file, memory access, and program counter operations
