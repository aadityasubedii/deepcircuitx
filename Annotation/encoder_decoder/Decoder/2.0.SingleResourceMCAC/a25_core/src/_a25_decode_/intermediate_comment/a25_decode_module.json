    "module": "This module decodes ARM instructions for an A25 processor, generating control signals for various processor components. It implements a state machine to handle different instruction types, manages interrupts and exceptions, and produces outputs for ALU, register file, memory access, and program counter operations. The module uses combinational logic for instruction decoding and a sequential state machine for control flow. It processes inputs such as fetched instructions, core status, and interrupts, and generates control signals based on the current state and decoded instruction. The module handles various instruction types, including data processing, memory operations, branches, and coprocessor instructions, adjusting control signals accordingly."
