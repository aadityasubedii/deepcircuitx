Module name: a25_wishbone. 

Module specification: The a25_wishbone module serves as an interface controller for a Wishbone bus, which facilitates communication between multiple masters and slave devices in system-on-chip designs. This module primarily handles the arbitration, buffering, and transfer management of data between three ports (port0, port1, and port2) and an external Wishbone-compliant device. The input ports include clk (clock signal), reset (asynchronous reset), scan_enable (control signal for test modes), test_mode (signal for operational testing), along with requests, write enables, write data, byte enables, and addresses for each port. Output ports send acknowledgment signals and read data back to the ports, as well as address, byte select, write enable, data, bus cycle, and strobe signals to the Wishbone bus.

Internally, the module uses arrays of signals like wbuf_valid, wbuf_accepted, wbuf_write, wbuf_wdata, wbuf_be, wbuf_addr, and wbuf_rdata_valid to validate, accept, determine the type of operation (read/write), store write data, specify active bytes, hold addresses, and confirm the validity of read data for each port. Other significant signals include new_access (indicating the possibility to start a new bus access) and serving_port (tracking which port is currently being served).

The code is structured into several blocks: instantiation blocks for each port's buffer handling, signal assignments for managing access and operations on the Wishbone bus, and an always block for setting and resetting conditions as well as managing the overall data transfer flow based on port requests and bus status. Each section is meticulously designed to ensure efficient data handling and maintaining system integrity during operations.
