Module name: a25_write_back. 
Module specification: The 'a25_write_back' module is designed to handle the final stages of memory read operations within a processor, specifically storing and forwarding the read data and addresses when not stalled. The module has several input ports: 'clk' (clock signal), 'reset' (reset signal), 'scan_enable', 'test_mode' (test mode indicator), 'i_mem_stall' (stall signal), 'i_mem_read_data' (32-bit data from memory), 'i_mem_read_data_valid' (validity of the read data), 'i_mem_load_rd' (11-bit read destination address), 'i_daddress' (direct address), and 'i_daddress_valid' (validity signal for the direct address). It outputs three signals: 'o_wb_read_data' (32-bit read data), 'o_wb_read_data_valid' (data validity signal), and 'o_wb_load_rd' (read destination address). Internally, the module utilizes registers 'mem_read_data_r', 'mem_read_data_valid_r', 'mem_load_rd_r', and 'daddress_r' to hold the memory read data, its validity status, the read destination address, and the direct address, respectively. The code features two primary blocks: one involved in updating 'mem_read_data_r', 'mem_read_data_valid_r', and 'mem_load_rd_r' based on 'i_mem_stall' status, and another for updating 'daddress_r', also conditional on the stall status. The module ensures that outputs are only updated when no stall condition is present, thereby maintaining data integrity across processor cycles.
