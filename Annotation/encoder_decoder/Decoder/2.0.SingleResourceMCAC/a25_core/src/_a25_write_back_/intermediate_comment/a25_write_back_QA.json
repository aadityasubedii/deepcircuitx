The module effectively captures the read data, its validity, and the corresponding read addresses from input signals, storing these temporarily in internal registers. This captured data is available for output, enabling subsequent stages or modules within the system to use the read data once confirmed as valid and not stalled. Additionally, it holds the direct address ('i_daddress') when no stall condition is present, facilitating address-handling tasks in memory-driven operations. This module operates under synchronization with a clock and can be reset as required."

It mirrors data held in the internal register `mem_read_data_r` when not stalled.\n- **o_wb_read_data_valid**: Output signal that mirrors the validity status of the read data held internally. Indicates that the data on `o_wb_read_data` can be trusted as valid.\n- **o_wb_load_rd**: 11-bit output read destination address associated with the output read data, which is driven by the internal register `mem_load_rd_r`."
