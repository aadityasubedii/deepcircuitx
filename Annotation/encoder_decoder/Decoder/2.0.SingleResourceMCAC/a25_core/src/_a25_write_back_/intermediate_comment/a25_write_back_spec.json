    "spec": "Module name: a25_write_back. \nModule specification: The 'a25_write_back' module is designed to handle the final stages of memory read operations within a processor, specifically storing and forwarding the read data and addresses when not stalled. The module has several input ports: 'clk' (clock signal), 'reset' (reset signal), 'scan_enable', 'test_mode' (test mode indicator), 'i_mem_stall' (stall signal), 'i_mem_read_data' (32-bit data from memory), 'i_mem_read_data_valid' (validity of the read data), 'i_mem_load_rd' (11-bit read destination address), 'i_daddress' (direct address), and 'i_daddress_valid' (validity signal for the direct address). It outputs three signals: 'o_wb_read_data' (32-bit read data), 'o_wb_read_data_valid' (data validity signal), and 'o_wb_load_rd' (read destination address). Internally, the module utilizes registers 'mem_read_data_r', 'mem_read_data_valid_r', 'mem_load_rd_r', and 'daddress_r' to hold the memory read data, its validity status, the read destination address, and the direct address, respectively. The code features two primary blocks: one involved in updating 'mem_read_data_r', 'mem_read_data_valid_r', and 'mem_load_rd_r' based on 'i_mem_stall' status, and another for updating 'daddress_r', also conditional on the stall status. The module ensures that outputs are only updated when no stall condition is present, thereby maintaining data integrity across processor cycles.",

The module effectively captures the read data, its validity, and the corresponding read addresses from input signals, storing these temporarily in internal registers. This captured data is available for output, enabling subsequent stages or modules within the system to use the read data once confirmed as valid and not stalled. Additionally, it holds the direct address ('i_daddress') when no stall condition is present, facilitating address-handling tasks in memory-driven operations. This module operates under synchronization with a clock and can be reset as required."

It mirrors data held in the internal register `mem_read_data_r` when not stalled.\n- **o_wb_read_data_valid**: Output signal that mirrors the validity status of the read data held internally. Indicates that the data on `o_wb_read_data` can be trusted as valid.\n- **o_wb_load_rd**: 11-bit output read destination address associated with the output read data, which is driven by the internal register `mem_load_rd_r`."

It serves as an intermediary storage to maintain the data value until it can be output through `o_wb_read_data`, reliably capturing data for subsequent processing stages when not stalled.\n- **mem_read_data_valid_r**: This register holds the validity status of the read data stored in `mem_read_data_r`. It helps ensure that the data being output is valid by storing the validity state and mirroring it on the `o_wb_read_data_valid` output port when not under stall conditions.\n- **mem_load_rd_r**: An 11-bit register storing the read destination address corresponding to the memory read data (`i_mem_read_data`). This register captures the address from which the data was read so that it can be passed to the subsequent stages through `o_wb_load_rd`, ensuring correct data-routing and processing continuity.\n- **daddress_r**: This 32-bit register captures the direct address from the input `i_daddress` when the memory transactions are not stalled.
