Module name: a25_icache. Module specification: The a25_icache module implements a configurable instruction cache for the A25 processor. It supports parameterized cache size, line size, and associativity (2, 3, 4, or 8 ways). The module manages cache operations including initialization, read/write, hit/miss handling, and cache line filling. Key inputs include clock, reset, address signals, cache control signals, and write buffer data. Outputs are stall signals, read data, and write buffer requests. Internal signals manage cache state transitions, tag comparisons, data selection, and replacement policies. The module is divided into sections for state management, address handling, tag and data memory interactions, way selection logic, and hit detection. It utilizes parameterized memory blocks for tags and data storage, implements a pseudo-random replacement policy, and includes debug and error checking functionalities. The cache supports normal operation,
