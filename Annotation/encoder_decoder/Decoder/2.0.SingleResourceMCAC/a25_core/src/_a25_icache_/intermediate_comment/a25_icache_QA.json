It supports several parameterized configurations such as cache size, line size, and associativity defined by the number of ways. The cache provides mechanisms for reading data through a tag comparison to check for hits. If a miss occurs, it can fetch data from a write buffer or initiate a fill sequence to fetch data from memory. It handles cache operations including initialization, cache line filling upon miss, cache invalidation, and regular core operations. Cache states and transitions between them are managed based on the inputs such as address, stall signals, and cache commands (e.g., flush, enable). The module is designed to work under normal, scan, and test modes."
