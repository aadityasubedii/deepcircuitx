    "module": "The a25_icache module implements a configurable instruction cache for the A25 processor, supporting parameterized cache size, line size, and associativity. It manages cache operations including initialization, read/write, hit/miss handling, and cache line filling. The module utilizes state machines for control, parameterized memory blocks for tag and data storage, and implements a pseudo-random replacement policy. It handles address decoding, tag comparisons, data selection, and includes debug and error checking functionalities. The cache supports normal operation, scan mode, and test mode, providing efficient instruction fetching for the processor while maintaining flexibility and testability."
