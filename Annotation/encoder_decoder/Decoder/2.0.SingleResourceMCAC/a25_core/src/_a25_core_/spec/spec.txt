Module name: a25_core. Module specification: The a25_core module is a central processing unit (CPU) core, likely based on the ARM architecture. It integrates various components for instruction fetching, decoding, execution, memory access, and write-back stages. The module interfaces with external systems through clock (clk), reset, and system ready (i_system_rdy) inputs, as well as interrupt request signals (i_irq, i_firq). It communicates with memory and peripherals via a Wishbone bus interface, with address (o_wb_adr), data (i_wb_dat, o_wb_dat), and control signals (o_wb_sel, o_wb_we, o_wb_cyc, o_wb_stb, i_wb_ack, i_wb_err). Internally, it uses numerous signals to manage data flow, control, an
