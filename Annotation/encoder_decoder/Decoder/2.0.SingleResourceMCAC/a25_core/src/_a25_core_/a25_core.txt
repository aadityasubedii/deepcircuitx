The a25_core module implements a CPU core based on the ARM architecture, integrating instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back stages. It utilizes a Wishbone bus interface for external memory and peripheral communication, and incorporates interrupt handling capabilities. The module's functionality is achieved through interconnected sub-modules (fetch, decode, execute, memory, write-back, wishbone, and coprocessor), each responsible for specific pipeline stages or operations. Internal signals manage data flow, control logic, and status information between these sub-modules, enabling coordinated execution of instructions and memory operations.
