    "module": "This module implements a configurable data cache for a processor, supporting multiple ways and write-back policy. It manages read/write operations, cache hits/misses, and exclusive accesses. The implementation uses separate tag and data memories for each way, employs a random replacement policy, and supports cache initialization and flushing. The module interfaces with the processor core and memory bus, using a state machine to control cache operations. It includes logic for hit detection, data selection, and handling of various cache scenarios, including consecutive writes and exclusive accesses."
