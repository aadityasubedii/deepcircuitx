Module name: a25_dcache. Module specification: This module implements a configurable data cache for a processor, supporting multiple cache ways (2, 3, 4, or 8). It handles read and write operations, manages cache hits and misses, and implements a write-back policy with random replacement. The module interfaces with the processor core and a memory bus, featuring input ports for clock, reset, cache control, and data/address signals, and output ports for read data and stall signals. Internal signals manage cache state, tag/data memory access, hit detection, and replacement logic. The module is structured with sections for state management, memory interfacing, hit detection, data selection, and replacement policy implementation. It includes logic for handling exclusive accesses, cache initialization, and flushing. The design uses parameterized values for cache configuration, allowing flexibility in cache size and organization. The module employs separate tag and data memories for each way, implements
