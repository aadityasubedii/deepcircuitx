Module name: a25_execute. Module specification: The a25_execute module is a critical component of an ARM-based processor design, responsible for the execution stage of instruction processing. It handles arithmetic and logical operations, data manipulation, program counter updates, and conditional execution based on processor status flags. The module interfaces with various components including an ALU, barrel shifter, multiply unit, and register bank. Key input ports include clock and reset signals, stall signals, read data from write-back stage, and numerous control signals for ALU operations, branching, and data routing. Output ports encompass address signals for instruction and data, write data, and various control flags. Internal signals manage data paths, status bits, and intermediate computational results. The module is structured into several functional blocks: status bit management, address calculation, barrel shifting, ALU operations, multiplication, register bank interfacing, and condition code evaluation. It implements intricate logic for privileged operations, interrupt handling
