    "module": "The a25_execute module implements the execution stage of an ARM-based processor, handling arithmetic, logical, and data manipulation operations. It achieves this through integration of an ALU, barrel shifter, multiply unit, and register bank, controlled by various input signals. The module manages program flow, address calculations, and conditional execution based on processor status flags. It implements privileged operations, interrupt handling, and interfaces with memory and coprocessor units. Status bits, data paths, and control signals are carefully managed to ensure correct instruction execution and processor state updates."
