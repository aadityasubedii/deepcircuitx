    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is designed to facilitate testing and simulation of the 'a25_core' sub-module by managing input and output signals related to clock, reset, and scan operations. It includes input ports such as clk, reset, scan_in0 to scan_in4, scan_enable, and test_mode. The clk and reset are critical for synchronizing and initializing the 'a25_core', respectively. Scan_in0 to scan_in4 are used to shift test data into the core, with scan_enable toggling the scan test mode, and test_mode enabling specialized testing states. The output ports, scan_out0 to scan_out4, output the shifted test data for observation. Internal signals mirror the inputs and outputs, ensuring proper linkage and control within the contained 'a25_core' instantiation. The initial block sets simulation parameters, conditions these input signals to default low states, and optionally includes scan chain data via the $sdf_annotate system task when compiled with `SDFSCAN`. Following initialization, the module executes $finish, which typically indicates the end of simulation tests, emphasizing its utility in setting up and validating the initial operational environment for 'a25_core' under test conditions.",
