The 'test' module is primarily designed for testing and simulation of the 'a25_core' submodule by managing input and output signals necessary for test operations. It implements this functionality through defining input ports for clock, reset, scan data, and test controls, and output ports for observing the test output states. Internally, the module instantiates 'a25_core' and connects these ports. The initial block sets simulation time format, initializes all signals to zero, allows optional SDF annotation for detailed testing, and concludes with a finish command to end simulations.
