    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is strategically designed to evaluate the functionality of the 'a25_core' integrated within it, leveraging scan chain methodologies. It capitalizes on input and output ports designated as clk (clock input for driving sequential elements), reset (system initialization), scan_in0 to scan_in4 (inputs for scan chain data loading), scan_enable (activates scan mode), and test_mode (enables specific test operations). The outputs, scan_out0 to scan_out4, emit the results indicating the validity and operational integrity of 'a25_core' under test conditions. Internally, signals like clk_count and testfail are declared for potential clock cycle counting and failure indication, though they are unused in the main provided snippet. The module incorporates an 'a25_core' submodule connected to the aforementioned ports, initiating with a preliminary configuration phase where all inputs are set to zero, and concludes by invoking the $finish statement to terminate the simulation. Additional logic is encapsulated within conditional compilation (`ifdef SDFSCAN) to support SDF (Standard Delay Format) scanning for timing verifications, suggesting its utility in detailed timing analysis scenarios. This setup mirrors typical IC testing frameworks in simulated environments, ensuring comprehensive readiness and diagnostic coverage before deployment in real-world applications.",

They are crucial for loading test vectors into the `a25_core` for testing and validation purposes.\n- scan_enable: This controls the operational mode of the scan chains within the `a25_core`, letting it either operate normally or in a scan-based testing mode.\n- test_mode: This signal enables special modes within the `a25_core` that are specifically used for testing and diagnostics.\n- clk_count: Although not explicitly used in the provided snippet, typically this would be used for counting clock cycles or for timing-related operations within the test module.\n- testfail: This signal, generally used in a complete test environment setup, would indicate a failure in testing, capturing any discrepancies between expected and received scan chain outputs.
