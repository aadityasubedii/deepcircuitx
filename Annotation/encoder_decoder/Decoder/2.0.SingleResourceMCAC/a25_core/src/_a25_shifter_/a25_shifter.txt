The a25_shifter module performs bit-shifting operations (Logical Shift Left, Logical Shift Right, Arithmetic Shift Right, Rotate Right) on a 32-bit input based on an 8-bit shift amount and mode selection. It handles different shift operations via internal 33-bit signals (lsl_out, lsr_out, asr_out, ror_out), with behavior controlled by the FULL_BARREL parameter for selecting detailed or simplified shifting logic. Outputs include the shifted data and a carry-out value, both conditional on the shift type and amount.
