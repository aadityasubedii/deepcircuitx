Module name: a25_shifter. Module specification: The `a25_shifter` module is designed to execute bit-shifting operations on a 32-bit input (`i_in`), with different modes of shifting: Logical Shift Left (LSL), Logical Shift Right (LSR), Arithmetic Shift Right (ASR), and Rotate Right (ROR), based on the input `i_function`. Input ports include `i_in` (32-bit data), `i_carry_in` (1-bit carry-in), `i_shift_amount` (8-bit shift amount), `i_shift_imm_zero` (1-bit immediate zero shift control), and `i_function` (2-bit mode selector). Output ports are `o_out` (32-bit shifted data output) and `o_carry_out` (1-bit carry output). Internal signals like `lsl_out`, `lsr_out`, `asr_out`, and `ror_out` (all 33-bit) temporarily store the outputs of respective shifting operations before being channeled to the output ports. The module adapts to shifting requirements by using parameter `FULL_BARREL` to choose between extensive, detailed shift operations (full barrel) or a simpler, less resource-intensive logic (quick shift). This parameter impacts the detailed granularity of the `generate` blocks which conditionally compile different shift logic circuits based on the `i_shift_amount`. The entire logic of the module is encapsulated in several `generate` blocks that specifically manage the behavior of each type of shift operation and handle the logic differentiation based on `FULL_BARREL` parameter settings. The final output selects the specific shift operation based on `i_function`.
