The shifter can operate in four different modes: Logical Shift Left (LSL), Logical Shift Right (LSR), Arithmetic Shift Right (ASR), and Rotate Right (ROR), as selected by a function code `i_function`. The module can also incorporate a carry input (`i_carry_in`) into the shift operation and produce a carry output (`o_carry_out`). Additionally, the module supports immediate shift-by-zero operations controlled by the `i_shift_imm_zero` signal. Depending on the value of the parameter `FULL_BARREL`, the module chooses between full barrel shifting (detailed shift logic for each possible shift amount) and a quicker, more resource-saving configuration which handles fewer specific cases in each generate block. The results of the shift operation are output on `o_out`."

Depending on the parameter `FULL_BARREL`, it computes shifts with detailed granularity or manages simpler shifts for fewer conditions. It caters to shift amounts directly, incorporating potential incoming carry and zero conditions.\n- `lsr_out` (33-bit): This signal is used to store the result of the Logical Shift Right operation. Similar to `lsl_out`, it behaves differently based on `FULL_BARREL`'s value, handling varying shift depths. It also responds to carry-in and situations where no active shifting occurs (`i_shift_imm_zero`).\n- `asr_out` (33-bit): It carries the results of the Arithmetic Shift Right operation. The functionality adjusts based on the `FULL_BARREL` setting, accounting for shifting with sign extension to preserve the arithmetic nature of the right shifts across multiple scenarios.\n- `ror_out` (33-bit): This signal captures the result from the Rotate Right operation.
