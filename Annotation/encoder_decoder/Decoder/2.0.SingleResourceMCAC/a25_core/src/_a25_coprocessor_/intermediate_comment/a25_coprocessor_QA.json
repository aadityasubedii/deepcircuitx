It processes operational commands and data inputs related to cache control settings, fault status, fault addresses, and defines the cacheable, updateable, and disruptive areas of memory. The module handles different operations based on the coprocessor-related input signals, including opcodes, control registers (CRn), and operational commands. Outputs include the read data from the coprocessor, cache enable signal, cache flush signal, and defines the cacheable area. It also incorporates fault management by updating fault status and address when faults are detected. Additionally, provisions for debugging allow for detailed monitoring and diagnostics of operations within the module."

Synchronizes the operation of the module with the system clock.\n- reset: Reset signal input. Resets internal states to the initial condition.\n- scan_enable: Scan enable signal used potentially for testing or diagnostics.\n- test_mode: Test mode signal allowing the module to enter a test mode for diagnostics or verification.\n- i_core_stall: Stall signal from the core, which pauses operations within the coprocessor when active.\n- i_copro_opcode1, i_copro_opcode2: Opcode inputs to define coprocessor operations.\n- i_copro_crn: Coprocessor control register number input, which specifies which internal register is to be accessed or modified.\n- i_copro_crm, i_copro_num: Additional identifiers which may serve as mode or selector signals in complex coprocessor operations.\n- i_copro_operation: Defines the type of operation, such as read or write, to be performed by the coprocessor.\n- i_copro_write_data: Data to be written into the specified coprocessor's registers.\n- i_fault: Indicates that a fault or error has occurred.\n- i_fault_status: Specifies the nature or status of the fault.\n- i_fault_address: Address location associated with the fault.\n\nExplanation: The input ports mainly serve to receive operation commands, synchronization signals, and data related to coprocessor configuration, management of cache, and fault handling. Signals like `i_core_stall`, `i_fault`, and `reset` control the operational state and error management within the coprocessor.\n\nOutput ports:\n- o_copro_read_data: Outputs data read from the coprocessor based on the queried control register.\n- o_cache_enable: Indicates whether the caching is enabled or disabled.\n- o_cache_flush: Triggers a cache flush operation when set.\n- o_cacheable_area: Specifies areas of memory that are cacheable.\n\nExplanation: The output ports provide control signals and data relevant to cache management and data retrieval from the coprocessor. `o_copro_read_data` fulfills read requests, while `o_cache_enable` and `o_cache_flush` directly control cache operations. The `o_cacheable_area` identifies memory regions applicable for caching, supporting efficient memory management."
