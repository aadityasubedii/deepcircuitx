Module name: a25_coprocessor. Module specification: The `a25_coprocessor` module is responsible for managing cache control, fault handling, and provides a means to configure memory areas for cache operations within a computing system. It operates based on various input signals: `clk` for synchronization with system clock, `reset` for initial setup, `scan_enable` and `test_mode` for diagnostic purposes, `i_core_stall` to pause its operations, opcode signals (`i_copro_opcode1`, `i_copro_opcode2`), control register number (`i_copro_crn`), additional identifiers (`i_copro_crm`, `i_copro_num`), operation type (`i_copro_operation`), data (`i_copro_write_data`), and fault signals (`i_fault`, `i_fault_status`, `i_fault_address`). The outputs include `o_copro_read_data` for read demands from the coprocessor, `o_cache_enable` to control whether caching is enabled, `o_cache_flush` for cache flush commands, and `o_cacheable_area` to specify memory regions that are cacheable. Internally, the module uses registers such as `cache_control`, `cacheable_area`, `updateable_area`, `disruptive_area`, `fault_status`, and `fault_address` to store settings and statuses related to cache operations and fault management. Additionally, it uses a wire signal `copro15_reg1_write` which serves as a control signal to initiate cache flush under specific conditions. In terms of functional blocks, the module contains multiple always blocks responding to `clk` and `reset` events to handle updates to internal registers based on operation commands, manage read operations from coprocessor control registers, and log faults when they occur. Moreover, the module is equipped with conditional compilation for debugging, offering insights into operations by logging them when needed. This module is critical in systems requiring precise control over coprocessor operations, supporting efficient data handling, fault resolution, and enhancing diagnostic capabilities.
