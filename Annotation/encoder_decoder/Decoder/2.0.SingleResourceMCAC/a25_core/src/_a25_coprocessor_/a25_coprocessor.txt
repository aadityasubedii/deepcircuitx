The `a25_coprocessor` module manages cache control and fault handling for a coprocessor, ensuring efficient memory operation and fault resolution. It processes input commands and status signals to update internal control registers, enabling operations such as cache enable, flush, and specification of memory areas for different cache-related operations. Additionally, fault detection logic is employed to store fault statuses and addresses, supported by diagnostic functions under conditional compilation for comprehensive debugging and system verification.
