    "module": "The a25_register_bank module manages processor registers for various operational modes like user, supervisor, and interrupts, ensuring appropriate data handling and context switching. It reads input signals to control data flow, updates registers based on execution modes, and outputs selected register values crucial for CPU tasks. Internal register sets address different modes with dedicated registers like r13_svc, while output logic handles dynamic data selection based on operational requirements, using selectors and mode-specific conditions to regulate the functionality efficiently."
