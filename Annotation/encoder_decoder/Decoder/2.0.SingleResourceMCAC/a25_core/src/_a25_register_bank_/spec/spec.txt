Module name: a25_register_bank. 
Module specification: The "a25_register_bank" is a Verilog module pivotal in managing processor registers, designed for a system that includes user, supervisor, interrupt, and fast interrupt modes, reflecting in tailored register handling. The module takes multiple input signals such as clk (clock signal), reset (to initialize registers), various stall and mode signals (indicating processor state and control flow), data for register updates, and numerous selector signals that determine which register's data is output based on the mode and context. The outputs include register values selected according to the input selectors and the current processor context, such as o_rm, o_rs, o_rd, o_rn, and o_pc, which serve different functionalities in the CPU, including ALU operations and program counter updates.

Internally, the module declares registers r0 to r15 for general-purpose data storage, including specialized registers like r13_svc for supervisor mode, defining the storage during specific control flows. Several intermediate wire signals like r8_out to r12_out are conditioned by the execution or interrupt modes, handling data routed through the module according to the designated functionality by the operation mode.

The code blocks in the module are segmented into initial assignments, logical assignments based on mode operations (like user or interrupt specific operations), conditional register updates influenced by control signals and write-enable signals, and output assignments where the register or immediate values are assigned to output ports based on selector inputs.

In essence, the "a25_register_bank" is structured to ensure context-appropriate register management, supporting robust mode-dependent operations, and efficient data handling essential for responsive CPU functionality. This is achieved through a combination of strategic conditional checks, mode-based routing of data, and dynamic response to various control and status signals.
