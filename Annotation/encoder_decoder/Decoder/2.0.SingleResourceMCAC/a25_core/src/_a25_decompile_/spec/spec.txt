Module name: a25_decompile. Module specification: This module is a decompiler for an ARM processor (likely an ARM25 variant) that generates human-readable assembly-like output for debugging and analysis purposes. It takes various input signals related to instruction execution and processor state, including clock, reset, core stall, instruction data, validity, execution flags, interrupt signals, and program counter information. The module doesn't have explicit output ports; instead, it writes decompiled output to a file. Internally, it uses signals for decoding instructions, such as immediate values, register numbers, opcodes, and instruction types. The module is organized into several blocks: instruction decoding, output formatting, register value retrieval, and file writing. It handles different instruction types (e.g., register operations, memory transfers, branches) and provides detailed logging of executed instructions, interrupts, and memory accesses. The decompiler processes instructions cycle-by-
