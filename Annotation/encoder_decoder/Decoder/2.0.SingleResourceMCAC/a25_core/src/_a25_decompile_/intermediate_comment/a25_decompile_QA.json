It takes various input signals related to instruction execution and processor state, and generates human-readable assembly-like output for debugging and analysis purposes. The module decodes instructions, extracts relevant information such as opcodes and operands, and formats them into readable text. It also handles different instruction types (e.g., register operations, memory transfers, branches) and provides detailed logging of executed instructions, interrupts, and memory accesses. The decompiled output is written to a file for later analysis, helping developers understand the processor's behavior during execution."
