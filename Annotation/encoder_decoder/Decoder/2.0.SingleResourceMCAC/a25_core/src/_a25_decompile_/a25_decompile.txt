This module decompiles ARM processor instructions into human-readable assembly-like output for debugging and analysis. It processes input signals related to instruction execution and processor state, decodes instructions, extracts relevant information (e.g., opcodes, operands), and formats them into readable text. The module handles various instruction types, logs executed instructions, interrupts, and memory accesses, and writes the decompiled output to a file. It operates cycle-by-cycle, using internal signals for instruction decoding and output formatting, and includes functions for retrieving register values and processing different instruction formats.
