    "module": "The a25_alu module serves as an Arithmetic Logic Unit, executing a variety of arithmetic and logical operations based on control signals from a 9-bit function input. It processes two 32-bit inputs and generates corresponding outputs and status flags. Internally, the module leverages multiplexers for input selection and modification (e.g., swapping and negation), conditional compilation for technology-specific arithmetic implementations, and signal extensions. Outputs are determined through a configurable multiplexer, and result flags are set based on operation outcomes, enhancing versatility in diverse computing environments."
