Module specification: The `main_mem` module is a memory management unit tailored for interfacing with a Wishbone bus, featuring parameterizable data and selection widths (WB_DWIDTH, WB_SWIDTH). This unit responds to both write and read operations, supports normal and test operating modes, and accommodates various data widths through conditional compilation blocks. Critical input ports include `clk` (clock signal), `reset` (system reset), `i_wb_adr` (memory address), `i_wb_sel` (byte selection signal), and `i_wb_we` (write enable signal), facilitating controlled reads and writes. Output ports include `o_wb_dat` (data output to the Wishbone bus), `o_wb_ack` (transaction acknowledgment), and `o_wb_err` (error signal, static in this design). Internal signal mechanisms such as `start_write`, `start_read`, and related delays (`start_read_d1`, `start_read_d2`) manage the timing of memory operations. Data masking and addressing adjustments are carried out by signals like `masked_wdata` and `addr_d1`. The code splits operational logic into two blocks managed by a generate statement, catering separately to 128-bit and 32-bit interface configurations, illustrating modular design tailored for robust data handling and error management within diverse system architectures.",

Module specification: The `main_mem` module is a memory management unit tailored for interfacing with a Wishbone bus, featuring parameterizable data and selection widths (WB_DWIDTH, WB_SWIDTH). This unit responds to both write and read operations, supports normal and test operating modes, and accommodates various data widths through conditional compilation blocks. Critical input ports include `clk` (clock signal), `reset` (system reset), `i_wb_adr` (memory address), `i_wb_sel` (byte selection signal), and `i_wb_we` (write enable signal), facilitating controlled reads and writes. Output ports include `o_wb_dat` (data output to the Wishbone bus), `o_wb_ack` (transaction acknowledgment), and `o_wb_err` (error signal, static in this design). Internal signal mechanisms such as `start_write`, `start_read`, and related delays (`start_read_d1`, `start_read_d2`) manage the timing of memory operations. Data masking and addressing adjustments are carried out by signals like `masked_wdata` and `addr_d1`. The code splits operational logic into two blocks managed by a generate statement, catering separately to 128-bit and 32-bit interface configurations, illustrating modular design tailored for robust data handling and error management within diverse system architectures."
