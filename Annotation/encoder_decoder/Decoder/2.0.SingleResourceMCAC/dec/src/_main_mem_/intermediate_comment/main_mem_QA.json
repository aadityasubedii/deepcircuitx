It is parameterized with a data width (`WB_DWIDTH`) and selection width (`WB_SWIDTH`). It accepts write and read commands from the bus, processes these commands based on whether the bus is in normal or test mode, and then either writes data into an internal RAM or reads data from the RAM depending on the command type. The RAM's write and read processes are controlled by signals such as `start_write` and `start_read`. Additionally, the module supports two configurations based on `WB_DWIDTH`: one for 128-bit data width and another for 32-bit data width, adjusting internal data handling accordingly. The module generates appropriate acknowledgment (`o_wb_ack`) and error (`o_wb_err`) signals for operations, ensuring proper communication back to the interfacing bus."

Inputs like `i_wb_we`, `i_wb_adr`, and `i_wb_dat` directly manage the reading and writing process to the internal memory, while other signals like `reset`, `scan_enable`, and `test_mode` are for controlling operational mode and module initialization. \n\nOutput ports:\n- `o_wb_dat`: Output data bus to Wishbone, carries data read from memory.\n- `o_wb_ack`: Acknowledgment signal to Wishbone, indicates the completion of a successful read or write cycle.\n- `o_wb_err`: Error signal to Wishbone, indicates an error condition during a transaction (permanently tied to 0 in the provided code, suggesting no error reporting implemented).\n\nExplanation:\nThe output ports manage the feedback from the memory module back to the bus interface. `o_wb_dat` outputs data fetched from memory during read operations, whereas `o_wb_ack` confirms to the interfacing bus that the transmitted data has been successfully written or read from memory. `o_wb_err` would typically be used for error handling; however, in this implementation, it appears to be unused for active error reporting."
