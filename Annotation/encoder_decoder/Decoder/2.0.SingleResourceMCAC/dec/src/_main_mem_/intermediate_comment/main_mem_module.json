    "module": "The main_mem module serves as a memory management unit interfacing with a Wishbone bus, handling read and write operations with parameterizable data widths. It uses input signals to manage addresses and data transfer, addressing schemes, and utilizes internal registers and conditional blocks to accommodate different data widths (32-bit and 128-bit). The implementation details involve the use of enable signals, data masking, and registers for delayed actions to ensure data integrity and synchronization across bus transactions."
