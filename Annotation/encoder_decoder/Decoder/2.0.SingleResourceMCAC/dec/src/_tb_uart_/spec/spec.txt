Module name: tb_uart.

Module specification: The 'tb_uart' module is a testbench module designed for the simulation of UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) communication in Verilog. It handles both the transmission and reception of UART data. The module inputs include 'clk' (a clock signal), 'reset' (to initialize or reset module states), 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' for triggering specific test conditions, and 'i_uart_cts_n' and 'i_uart_rxd' for UART communication signals. Output ports consist of 'o_uart_txd' and 'o_uart_rts_n', which manage UART data transmission and the readiness signal for data reception, respectively. Internally, the module utilizes signals such as 'clk_uart' (a derived clock signal for UART operations), 'rx_state', 'rx_bit', and 'tx_state', among others, to manage the reception and transmission states and processes. The module features several blocks: a clock buffer instantiation that synthesizes the 'clk_uart', UART RX handler that processes and stores incoming UART data, and a UART TX handler that manages outgoing data. Additional utility includes monitoring and adjusting internal states and counters to accurately facilitate the reception and transmission of UART framed data, making it a comprehensive utility for testing UART communication in hardware simulations.
