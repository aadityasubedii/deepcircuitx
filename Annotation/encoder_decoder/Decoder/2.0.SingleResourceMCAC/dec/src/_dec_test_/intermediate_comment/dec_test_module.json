    "module": "The 'test' module serves to validate the functionality of the 'dec' sub-module using predefined scan inputs and observing the outputs to detect faults or errors. It initializes critical signals like clock, reset, and test modes to their default states, instantiates the 'dec' module linking all necessary inputs and outputs, and optionally incorporates an SDF annotation for timing analysis, demonstrating thorough simulation control and termination processes for effective testing."
