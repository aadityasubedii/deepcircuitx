Module name: test. Module specification: This module is a comprehensive testbench for a digital design, likely a decoder (DEC) or a system containing a decoder. It sets up a simulation environment to verify the functionality of the design under test. The module doesn't have explicit input or output ports, as it's a self-contained testbench. Instead, it generates stimuli internally and monitors the behavior of the design under test. Key internal signals include clock and reset signals, memory initialization variables, UART interfaces, Wishbone bus signals, and various configuration and test vectors. The module is structured into several sections: initialization and configuration, memory loading, clock generation, stimulus application, and output verification. It includes functionality for loading memory contents, generating clock signals, resetting the system, applying test vectors, and checking output responses against expected results. The testbench also incorporates error checking, timeout mechanisms, and simulation termination conditions. It supports various test configurations, including
