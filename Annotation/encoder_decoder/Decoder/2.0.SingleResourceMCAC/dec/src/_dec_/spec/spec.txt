Module name: dec. Module specification: The "dec" module is a multifunctional digital signal processing unit designed for handling various communication protocols and data processing tasks. It integrates several sub-modules including a clock generator, UART, timers, interrupt controller, TDMI (input), TDMO (output), and an A25 core processor, all interconnected through a Wishbone bus architecture. The module features numerous input and output ports for clock signals, serial data, UART communication, and Wishbone bus interfaces. Key inputs include reset, clk, dec_s (serial input), and various Wishbone-related signals. Outputs comprise dec_o (serial output), UART signals, and Wishbone interface signals. Internal signals manage clock distribution, Wishbone bus operations between master and slaves, and interrupt handling. The module utilizes parameters for configuring data widths and the number of Wishbone slaves. It incorporates
