Module name: decoder. Module specification: The `decoder` module is a 2-to-4 binary decoder designed to handle a 2-bit binary input (`w`) and an enable signal (`En`). It produces a 4-bit output (`y`), where only one output bit is set high based on the value of `w` when `En` is active and is set high. If `En` is low, all output bits are set to 0 regardless of `w`'s value. The input ports include a 2-bit wire `w`, which selects the output line, and a single-bit enable wire `En` that controls the decoding operation. The output port is a 4-bit register `y` corresponding to the decoded output, with one of the bits set high based on `w` if enabled. Internally, signals `y`, `w`, and `En` are utilized where `y` acts as the output register, `w` is the address input, and `En` functions as an enable signal. The Verilog code segment features an `always` block that performs the decoding: if `En` is high, a `case` statement maps input `w` to the corresponding output in `y`; otherwise, `y` is cleared to 0. This modular function is essential for applications requiring binary to one-hot decoding in digital circuits.
