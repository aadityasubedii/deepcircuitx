The `decoder` module is a 2-to-4 binary decoder that activates based on an enable signal `En` and inputs `w`. It outputs `y`, setting one of its four bits high corresponding to the input `w` when `En` is high, and sets all to zero otherwise. It achieves this via an always block, utilizing a case statement to map the input `w` to specific outputs in `y` based on `En`'s status.
