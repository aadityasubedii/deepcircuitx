The output depends on the value of the enable signal (`En`). If `En` is high (1), the module decodes the input `w` and sets exactly one of the four output bits to 1 based on the value of `w` (e.g., `w=2'b00` results in `y=4'b0001`). If `En` is low (0), all output bits are set to 0, effectively disabling the output regardless of `w`'s value."
