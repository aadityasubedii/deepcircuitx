The deco2to4 module is a 2-to-4 binary decoder that takes a 2-bit input 'A' and produces a 4-bit output 'D', decoding each binary combination into distinct outputs. It utilizes two instances of a smaller 1-to-2 decoder, deco1to2, which separately process each bit of the input. The results are then combined through logical AND operations to generate the final outputs, effectively mapping each input combination to a unique output line.
