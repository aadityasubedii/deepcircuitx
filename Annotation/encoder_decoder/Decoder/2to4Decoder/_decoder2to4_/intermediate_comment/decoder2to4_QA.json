It takes a 2-bit binary input (A) and generates a 4-bit output (D). The module uses two instances of another decoder, `deco1to2`, which are smaller 1-to-2 decoders to first expand each bit of the input separately. The outputs of these smaller decoders are then logically combined using 'AND' operations to produce the final 4-bit output, where each output bit D[x] represents a specific combination of the input bits, thus effectively decoding the 2-bit input into four distinct outputs."

Explanation: The internal signal 'W' is a 4-bit wide wire array used to hold the intermediate outputs of the two instances of the `deco1to2` module. Each half of this wire array (W[3:2] and W[1:0]) is connected to the output of one instance of the `deco1to2` decoder. The outputs of these individual smaller decoders (consisting of '0' or '1' for each bit based on the input A[0] and A[1]) are then logically combined using 'AND' gates in specific pairings (e.g., W[3] & W[1], W[2] & W[1], etc.) to generate the final four outputs D[0] to D[3]. This arrangement allows for the separation and independent decoding of each bit of the input 'A', and the subsequent combination of these decoded signals to achieve the 2-to-4 decoding functionality."
