Module name: deco2to4. Module specification: The deco2to4 is a 2-to-4 decoder Verilog module, designed to decode a 2-bit binary input into a 4-bit output by utilizing smaller 1-to-2 decoder modules. The 2-bit input, denoted as 'A', is handled by input ports A[0:1], with each bit significantly influencing the computation of the output signals. The result of the decoding process is reflected through the output ports D[3:0], where each bit illustrates one of the four potential combinations of input, effectively mapping the encoded input to designated outputs. Internally, the module uses a wire array W[3:0] that serves as the conduit for intermediate signals from two smaller decoder modules, each connecting to respective bits of the input. These instances of 1-to-2 decoders, named U0 and U1, expand the single bits A[0] and A[1] respectively into two bits, outputting to specific segments of the W array. The combinations required for the final output are achieved through logical AND operations between pertinent pairs of these intermediate signals, thereby generating the accurate outputs for D[0] to D[3] as specified by the decoding logic. This structured approach allows the module to efficiently decode the 2-bit input into the desired 4-bit output through methodical splitting, processing, and recombining of signals.
