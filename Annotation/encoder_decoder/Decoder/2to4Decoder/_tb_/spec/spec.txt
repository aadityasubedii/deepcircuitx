Module name: tb. Module specification: The 'tb' module serves as a testbench for evaluating the 'decoder2to4' module, which is incorporated via an `include` statement for the 'decoder2to4.v' file. This testbench specifically functions by simulating different binary input combinations on the 2-bit input vector `[0:1] A` to observe how the decoder behaves under various conditions. The outputs from the decoder are monitored on a 4-bit wire array `[3:0] b`. The internal signals include `[0:1] A`, a register array used to feed binary inputs to the decoder, and `[3:0] b`, a wire array that displays which decoder output is active based on the current input state. The sequence of operations within the `initial` block includes setting initial states of `A`, progressing through different states with a delay of 12 time units between each state change, and ultimately concluding with a message display indicating the end of the test. The simulation environment enabled by the `$dumpfile` and `$dumpvars` commands records variable states, enhancing the traceability and debugging of the simulation outputs and behavior throughout the test.
