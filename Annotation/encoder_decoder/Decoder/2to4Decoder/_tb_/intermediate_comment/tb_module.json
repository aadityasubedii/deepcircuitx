    "module": "The 'tb' module is a testbench designed to evaluate the 'decoder2to4' module by simulating various binary inputs on the `[0:1] A` signal and observing outputs on the `[3:0] b` wire. It initializes inputs sequentially with a 12-time unit delay, leverages internal signals (`A` for inputs and `b` for outputs), and uses `$dumpfile` and `$dumpvars` for effective debugging and tracking of the simulation process, culminating with a display message signaling test completion."
