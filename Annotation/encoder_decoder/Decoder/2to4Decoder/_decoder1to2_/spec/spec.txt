Module name: deco1to2. Module specification: The `deco1to2` Verilog module is designed as a simple 1-to-2 binary decoder that accepts a single-bit input and generates a two-bit output. The primary functionality of this module is to receive a digital signal A, and based on its state, produce a binary decoded output in a 2-bit vector D. Input A, which is a single-bit digital input, directly determines the binary decoded outputs where D[0] is a direct reflection of A, and D[1] is its logical complement, thus always providing an opposite value to A. There are no internal signals explicitly declared as the module operates directly using the input and output ports. The Verilog code consists of simple continuous assignment statements: `assign D[0] = A;` and `assign D[1] = ~A;` which effectively manage the direct assignment to each part of the output vector D[0:1], demonstrating a straightforward implementation of the decoding functionality without any intermediate storage or conditional logic. This clean and efficient design makes the `deco1to2` module particularly easy to understand and integrate into larger digital systems.
