    "module": "The `deco1to2` module serves as a 1-to-2 binary decoder, taking a single-bit input A and producing a 2-bit output vector D, where D[0] is directly set to the value of A and D[1] is the logical NOT of A. This functionality is achieved through direct continuous assignments within the module, ensuring a simple and efficient decoding process without internal signal complexities."
