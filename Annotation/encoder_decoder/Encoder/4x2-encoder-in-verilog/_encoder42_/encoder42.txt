Module-level comment: The 'encoder42' module is a 4-to-2 priority encoder with an added validity output 'V'. It prioritizes four inputs (D0 has the highest priority) and encodes them into two outputs (Q0, Q1) with V indicating any active input. Using NOT, AND, and OR gates, the module selectively prioritizes inputs and forms the output representation, handling inputs through logical gates to produce the required binary encoded outputs and a validity signal.
