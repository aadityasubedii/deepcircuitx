It takes four input signals (D0, D1, D2, D3) and encodes them into two output signals (Q0, Q1). The encoding is done based on the priority of the inputs, where D0 has the highest priority and D3 has the lowest. The output V is a validity signal that indicates if any of the input signals are 'high' (1). If any input (D0-D3) is high, the output V will be high, indicating a valid encoding state. The logic implements basic functions using NOT and AND gates to manipulate and set prioritization, and OR gates to combine signals for the final outputs."

If D1 is high and D0 is low ('0'), then D1 dictates the state of the outputs.\n- D2: This input has lower priority than D0 and D1. If both D0 and D1 are low, and D2 is high, it influences the outputs.\n- D3: This is the lowest priority input. It only affects the validity output (V) since its state is not directly encoded in the Q0 and Q1 outputs.\n\nOutput ports: Q0, Q1, V.\nExplanation:\n- Q0: Part of the 2-bit output that represents the binary encoding of the highest-priority active input signal. It is '1' if D0 is '1' or if both D0 and D1 are '0' and D2 is '1'.\n- Q1: The second part of the 2-bit output that also contributes to the binary representation of the priority encoding. It receives contribution from an intermediate signal 'a1' as well as D0.\n- V: This is the validity output that goes 'high' ('1') if at least one of the inputs (D0, D1, D2, D3) is high, indicating that the output encoding is valid."
