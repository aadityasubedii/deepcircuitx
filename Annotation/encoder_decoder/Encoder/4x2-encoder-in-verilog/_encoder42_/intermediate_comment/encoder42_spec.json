    "spec": "Module name: encoder42. \nModule specification: The 'encoder42' module serves as a 4-to-2 priority encoder with an added validity output. It accepts four input signals (D0, D1, D2, D3) and delivers two output signals (Q0, Q1), encoding based on the priority where D0 has the highest. An additional output V indicates the presence of at least one high ('1') input, signifying valid encoding. Specifically, inputs D0, D1, D2, and D3 impact the outputs with decreasing priority from D0 to D3. Outputs Q0 and Q1 are part of the 2-bit output representative of the highest-priority active input, with Q1 further influenced by internal logic involving signals 'a1' and 'nD1'. The internal signal 'nD1' is the inverted version of D1, helping in prioritizing D2 over D1 for Q1 through the internal signal 'a1', which is the AND result of 'nD1' and D2. NOT, AND, and OR gates are employed to form these logic relations among the inputs, internal signals, and outputs, smoothly mapped in the module's code structure.",
