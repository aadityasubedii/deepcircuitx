Module name: encoder42_tb.
Module specification: The `encoder42_tb` module is a test bench designed to verify the functionality of a 4-to-2 priority encoder named 'encoder42'. It operates by applying test cases that simulate each of its four binary data input ports (D0, D1, D2, D3) being high sequentially, with the purpose of observing the corresponding binary-encoded output (Q0, Q1) and valid output signal (V) from the encoder. The module lacks internal signals, as it serves the role of stimulating the encoder directly through its inputs and observing the outputs. The test bench code is structured into two main blocks: the declaration of input and output ports, and the initial block. The initial block sets up the test scenarios by driving the input signals in a sequence with 100 ns delays in between to transition through possible input conditions and observe the output responses. There are no internal procedural blocks or functions other than these test scenarios, and the outputs Q0 and Q1 reflect the binary value of the highest-order active input signal, while the V output indicates a valid data conversion.
