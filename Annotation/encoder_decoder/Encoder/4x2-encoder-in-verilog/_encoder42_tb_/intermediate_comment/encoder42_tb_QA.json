The module sets up scenarios where each input D0 through D3 is enabled one at a time, simulating single-high inputs to the encoder. The encoder's outputs Q0, Q1, and V are respectively expected to represent this input behaviour in binary form, where Q0 and Q1 give the binary code of the active input, and V indicates a valid conversion.
