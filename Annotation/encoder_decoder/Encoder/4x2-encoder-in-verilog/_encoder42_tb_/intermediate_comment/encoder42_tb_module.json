    "module": "Module-level comment: The `encoder42_tb` module is a test bench for a 4-to-2 priority encoder, assigned to verify the encoder's output representing the highest priority input. It sequentially sets each input high and observes the output after a delay of 100 ns to ensure the encoder correctly prioritizes and encodes the inputs, producing both the encoded binary output (Q0, Q1) and a valid signal (V)."
