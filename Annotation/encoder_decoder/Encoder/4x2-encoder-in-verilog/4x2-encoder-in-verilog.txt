The repository 4x2-encoder-in-verilog focuses on the implementation and verification of a 4-to-2 priority encoder in Verilog. This priority encoder not only translates the highest active input into a 2-bit output but also produces a validity signal indicating the presence of any active input. The design is structured using basic logical gates which selectively prioritize inputs to generate the required outputs. The repository is composed of two main modules. The 'encoder42' module implements the encoder functionality using NOT, AND, and OR gates to ensure the highest priority input is encoded into the outputs (Q0, Q1) along with a valid signal 'V'. In parallel, the 'encoder42_tb' test bench module verifies the encoder's functionality by systematically activating each input and observing the corresponding outputs after a specific delay, ensuring the encoder operates as intended under various input conditions. Through these modules, the repository provides a comprehensive demonstration of the encoder's design and testing process.
