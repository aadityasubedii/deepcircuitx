They are used to compute specific Boolean operations like ANDing selected bits of X and Y with each other.\n  \n**Output port:** [alb].\n**Explanation:** alb is a single-bit output that represents the Boolean function result computed by ANDing and ORing specific bits of inputs X and Y. It serves as a custom logical flag based on input conditions.\n\n### Module: sec2\n**Input ports:** [z, y]. \n**Explanation:** z and y are two input vectors, both similar to X and Y in sec1 but named differently. z is 4 bits, and y is 3 bits. They undergo bitwise operations similar to those in sec1 to compute another Boolean function.\n  \n**Output port:** [agb].\n**Explanation:** agb is analogous to alb in sec1. It is a single-bit output derived from the bitwise operations on inputs y and z.

It acts as an equality flag for the two inputs.\n\n### Module: fourbitcompv\n**Input ports:** [A, B]. \n**Explanation:** A and B are 4-bit input vectors which serve as the primary inputs to this complex module that orchestrates several operations. These vectors are partly used across the sub-modules sec1, sec2, and sec3 for various comparisons and computations.\n\n**Output ports:** [ALB, AGB, AEB].\n**Explanation:** ALB, AGB, and AEB are single-bit outputs from this main module. Each output signifies a distinct result:\n- ALB is derived from operations performed in sec1, reflecting a specific logical function based on parts of inputs A and B.\n- AGB is derived from operations in sec2, indicating another predicate based on subsets of A and B.\n- AEB results from the equality check performed in sec3, indicating if the input vectors A and B are entirely equal bit-by-bit."
