    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"fourbitcompv\" module performs bitwise comparisons and logical operations on two 4-bit inputs, A and B, using submodules sec1, sec2, and sec3. It outputs three flags: ALB, AGB, and AEB representing various operations. It manipulates input data through internal signals and the unspecified part2 block for preprocessing before directing to appropriate submodules for detailed bitwise computations. This modular approach facilitates structured and efficient data processing to derive each output flag."
