The repository 3InputPriorityEncoder encompasses a collection of Verilog modules tailored to handle various logic and comparison operations. The 'Encoder' module effectively encodes three binary inputs into two outputs, leveraging an assortment of logic gates including NOT, NAND, and OR, and employing methodologies like double negation and conditional logic to ascertain the outputs. In contrast, the 'b_comp1' module focuses on a specialized combinational logic to determine output 'f' based on three inputs, executing direct logical operations without internal stages, which simplifies the logic expression evaluation. Moreover, the 'fourbitcompv' module is designed to handle bitwise operations and comparisons on 4-bit inputs, utilizing multiple submodules for detailed bitwise processing and generating flags related to the equality and comparison of inputs. This repository illustrates a comprehensive approach to encoding and comparison tasks in digital systems, highlighting structured data processing and efficient logical design to cater to specific computational needs.
