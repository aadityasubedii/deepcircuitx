    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'Encoder' module encodes three binary inputs (E2, E1, E0) to two outputs (P1, P0) using NOT, NAND, and OR logic gates. Internally, it features double negation and multiple NAND operations to shape the logical paths that define outputs. P1 and P0 are derived through sequential logic manipulations involving restore and condition-based OR operations from processed inputs."
