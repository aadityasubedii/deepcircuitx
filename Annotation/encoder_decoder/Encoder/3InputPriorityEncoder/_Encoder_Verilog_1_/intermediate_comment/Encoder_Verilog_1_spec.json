    "spec": "Module name: Encoder. Module specification: The 'Encoder' module is designed to perform a specific logical encoding of three input signals, E2, E1, and E0, based on NOT, NAND, and OR operations, to produce two output signals, P1 and P0. Input signals include E2, E1, and E0, where E2 significantly influences the logic tree, being manipulated through multiple NOT and NAND gates. The output signals, P1 and P0, reflect the encoded results of inputs under complex logical operations. Internally, the module utilizes six signals: E2n (inverse of E2), E2nn (double inverse of E2), nand2out (NAND of E2n and E1), nand2outn (inverse of nand2out), nand3out (NAND operation combining nand2out, E2n and E0), and nand3outn (inverse of nand3out). These signals orchestrate a series of transformations that output P1 and P0. P1 is determined by an OR gate that takes inputs from nand2outn (corrected in the description from a typo 'nand2oun' in the code) and nand3outn, while P0 is decided by an OR gate taking inputs from E2nn and nand3outn. This setup showcases the structured manipulation of binary logic to achieve a desired encoding output.",
