Specifically, the output 'f' is true if either both 'x1' and 'x2' are true, or if 'x2' is false and 'x3' is true. This can be perceived as a customized logic gate combination in digital circuits."

They are digital signals (either 0 or 1) that participate in the logical expression assigned to the output 'f'.\n\nOutput ports: f.\nExplanation: This is the output signal of the module. The output 'f' is a digital signal that results from the specific logical combination of the inputs. It represents the computed value based on the expression ((x1 & x2) | (~x2 & x3)), where '&' denotes an AND operation, '|' denotes an OR operation, and '~' denotes a NOT operation.
