Module-level comment: The 'b_comp1' module performs a specific combinational logic operation. It calculates the output 'f' based on inputs 'x1', 'x2', and 'x3' using the logical expression ((x1 & x2) | (~x2 & x3)). This expression ensures that 'f' is true if both 'x1' and 'x2' are true, or if 'x2' is false and 'x3' is true, directly reflecting this condition without internal buffering or additional stages.
