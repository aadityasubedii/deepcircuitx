Module-level comment: The tb_decoder_3x8 module is a testbench for a 3-to-8 line decoder. It tests the decoder's output logic by applying a sequence of 3-bit inputs 'I' while the enable signal 'en' is high. The testbench evaluates the decoder's response as it iterates through all binary combinations of 'I', outputting the results to an 8-bit wire 'd'. Delays of 50 units are introduced between input changes to mimic real-world timing and verify proper decoder functionality before concluding with $stop.
