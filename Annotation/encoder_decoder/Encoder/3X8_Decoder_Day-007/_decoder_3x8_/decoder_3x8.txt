Module-level comment: The "decoder_3x8" module implements a 3-to-8 line binary decoder with enable control. It translates a 3-bit input "I" to a one-hot 8-bit output "d," with the enable "en" turning off all outputs when low. The conversion uses a combinational always block with a case statement to select the active output based on "I".
