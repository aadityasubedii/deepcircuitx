When the enable (en) signal is low, all output bits (d[7:0]) are set to 0, effectively disabling the decoder. If the enable signal is high, the module decodes the 3-bit input (I[2:0]) to activate exactly one of the eight output lines, setting it to high (1) while keeping the rest low (0), according to a binary to one-hot encoding scheme. This is accomplished through a case statement that maps each possible 3-bit input combination to a corresponding one-hot 8-bit output."
