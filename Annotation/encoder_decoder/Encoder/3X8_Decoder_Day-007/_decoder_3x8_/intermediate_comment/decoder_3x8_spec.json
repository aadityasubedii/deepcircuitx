The module has two input ports: \"I\" and \"en.\" \"I\" is a 3-bit wide signal that represents the binary value to be decoded. The \"en\" is an enable signal that when set to 0, forces all output bits to 0, disabling the decoder's functionality. The sole output port, \"d,\" is an 8-bit wide signal where each bit corresponds to one of the eight outputs of the decoder; it represents the decoded output in a one-hot encoding form when \"en\" is high. The module does not use any internal signals apart from inputs and outputs. Within the module's Verilog implementation, the always block checks the enable signal; if low, it sets the output to zero, otherwise, it processes the input \"I\" through a case statement to generate the appropriate one-hot encoding. Each possible value of \"I\" maps to a distinct bit of \"d\" being high, with all other bits set low.
