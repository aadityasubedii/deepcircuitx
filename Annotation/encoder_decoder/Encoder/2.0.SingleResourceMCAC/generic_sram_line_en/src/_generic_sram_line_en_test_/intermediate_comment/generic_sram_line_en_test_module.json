    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module functions as a testbench for the 'generic_sram_line_en' module, simulating input conditions to verify scan and test features. It employs input signals like `clk`, `reset`, and scan inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`), controlled by `scan_enable` and `test_mode`, to evaluate output responses on `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`. The module initializes all signals in the initial block, supports optional SDF annotation for timing tests, and is structured to provide clear checkpoints for observing simulation outcomes."
