    "spec": "Module name: test. \nModule specification: The 'test' module is designed to serve as a testbench for verifying the functionality of the 'generic_sram_line_en' module, focusing primarily on its scanning and test mode operations. This module includes input ports such as `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset` (to initialize the module to a known state), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (for input test data in scan testing), `scan_enable` (to enable scan mode), and `test_mode` (to switch the module to test mode). The outputs, `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, are used to monitor the processed data, validating the scan chain and internal logic under test conditions. Internal signals include all input and output ports, ensuring control and feedback during simulation. The module's Verilog code is structured into a declaration block for inputs/outputs and internal signals, an instantiation of `generic_sram_line_en`, and an initial block. The initial block sets up the simulation environment, initializing all signals, potentially applying Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotation if compiled with SDFSCAN for detailed timing and delay analysis, and finishing with the termination of the simulation. This comprehensive setup ensures a detailed and controlled environment for testing and verification of the connected module.",
