It has a functionality to initialize the memory to zero or one during reset, based on the parameter setting. The module handles reads and writes to the SRAM memory array based on the input address and write enable signal. If the write enable is active, the data at the specified address is updated; otherwise, the data is read from the memory. It also supports scan chain functionality typically used in testing the hardware for manufacturing defects."
