Module name: generic_sram_line_en. 
Module specification: The "generic_sram_line_en" module is designed to simulate a generic static random-access memory (SRAM) with configurable data and address sizes. It supports basic memory operations such as read and write, initialized by an enable-controlled memory address and handles special operations during testing phases via scan chains. The input ports include 'reset' and 'clk' for reset and clock operations, 'test_mode' and 'scan_enable' for managing test modes and scan operations, 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' representing serial inputs for scan data, along with 'i_write_data', 'i_write_enable', and 'i_address' for writing data to memory. Output ports feature 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' for serial output scan data, and 'o_read_data' that outputs data read from the memory. The internal signals include 'mem', a memory array that holds data, and 'i', an integer loop variable used during reset to initialize memory contents. In the code, an always block triggered by clock or reset events manages memory initialization, data writing, and reading, ensuring that output data is set to zero during write operations or reflects the memory content during read operations.
