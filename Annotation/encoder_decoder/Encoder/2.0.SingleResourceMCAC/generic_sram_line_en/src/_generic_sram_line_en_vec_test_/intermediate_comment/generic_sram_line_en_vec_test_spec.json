    "spec": "Module name: test. \nModule specification: The 'test' module is designed to facilitate the simulation and testing of the 'generic_sram_line_en' sub-module by initializing conditions such as the clock and reset signals, and configuring test mode and scan enable inputs. It encompasses input ports including `clk` (clock signal), `reset` (resets internal states), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (provide scan test data), `scan_enable` (enables scan operations), and `test_mode` (switches between normal and test modes). Output ports include `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, which output the scan test results from the sub-module. Internal to the module, signals such as `clk` and `reset` synchronize and initialize operations, while `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, along with `scan_enable` and `test_mode`, are pivotal in controlling scan operations and test configurations. The code is structurally divided into a declaration block for wires and regs, instantiation of the `generic_sram_line_en` sub-module which effectively assigns these inputs to outputs via its operational logic, and an initial block which sets the initial state for the simulation, including optionally annotating an SDF file if compiled with SDFSCAN defined, and terminates the simulation. This detailed configuration ensures that the module can accurately simulate and analyze the specified scanning operations for robust testing of the 'generic_sram_line_en' sub-module.",

They are critical during scan operations for testing the integrity and functionality of the SRAM lines.\n- `scan_enable`: This input is used to enable scan operations within the module, allowing scan test data to be shifted in and out through the scan chains.\n- `test_mode`: Input to determine if the module should operate in normal mode or special test mode which potentially alters its behavior for test purposes.\n\nOutput ports: `scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4`.\nExplanation: \n- `scan_out0 to scan_out4`: These outputs are the resultant scan test data shifted out from the 'generic_sram_line_en' sub-module following scan operations.
