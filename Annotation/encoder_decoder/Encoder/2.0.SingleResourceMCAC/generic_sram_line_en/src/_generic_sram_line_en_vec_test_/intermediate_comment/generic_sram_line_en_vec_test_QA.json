They are critical during scan operations for testing the integrity and functionality of the SRAM lines.\n- `scan_enable`: This input is used to enable scan operations within the module, allowing scan test data to be shifted in and out through the scan chains.\n- `test_mode`: Input to determine if the module should operate in normal mode or special test mode which potentially alters its behavior for test purposes.\n\nOutput ports: `scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4`.\nExplanation: \n- `scan_out0 to scan_out4`: These outputs are the resultant scan test data shifted out from the 'generic_sram_line_en' sub-module following scan operations. They provide visibility into the module's behavior when scan data is processed, essentially used for the verification and diagnosis of the corresponding scan chains in test mode."
