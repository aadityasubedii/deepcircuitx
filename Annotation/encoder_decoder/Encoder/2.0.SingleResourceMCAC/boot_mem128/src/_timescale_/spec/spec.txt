Module name: Not applicable.  
Module specification: The provided Verilog snippet does not define a hardware module but consists solely of a simulation directive, the `timescale 1ns / 1ns. This directive sets the unit of time measurement and the time precision for simulations within a Verilog environment. Specifically, it specifies that each unit of time in the simulation corresponds to one nanosecond, and the simulation can differentiate times down to one nanosecond. There are no input or output ports, internal signals, or different blocks or sections within this code snippet, as it serves only to configure the simulation environment and does not describe any hardware logic or computational functions.
