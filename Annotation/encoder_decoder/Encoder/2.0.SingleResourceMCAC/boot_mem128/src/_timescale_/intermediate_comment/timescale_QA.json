Specifically, the `timescale directive (`timescale 1ns / 1ns) in Verilog sets the unit of time measurement and the time precision for the module simulation. This means that each unit of time in the simulation corresponds to one nanosecond, and the simulator can differentiate times down to one nanosecond.

It merely instructs the simulator on the time scale and precision to be used during simulation, without involving any processing or computational elements where internal signals would be required or described. Hence, there are no internal signals to elaborate on in this specific scenario."
