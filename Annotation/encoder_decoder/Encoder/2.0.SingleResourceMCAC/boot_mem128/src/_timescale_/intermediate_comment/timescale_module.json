    "module": "Module-level comment: This Verilog file contains only a `timescale directive, setting the simulation time unit and precision to 1 nanosecond. It configures the simulation environment without defining any hardware functionality, inputs, outputs, or internal signals. Its sole purpose is to standardize the time measurement accuracy for simulations, ensuring consistency across simulation processes."
