    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for the 'boot_mem128' module, incorporating input and output signals for scanning and test modes, including clk, reset, and scan_in0 to scan_in4. It initializes these signals to simulate various operational scenarios and includes conditional SDF annotation for timing analysis. This facilitates a controlled testing environment to verify the operational integrity of the 'boot_mem128' module in simulated contexts."
