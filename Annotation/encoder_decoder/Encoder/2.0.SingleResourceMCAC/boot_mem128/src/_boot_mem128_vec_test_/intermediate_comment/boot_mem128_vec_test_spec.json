    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module functions primarily as a testbench tailored explicitly for the 'boot_mem128' module, designed to initialize and simulate various testing scenarios crucial for verifying its proper operation. It integrates input ports which include: 'clk' (a clock signal synchronizing operations), 'reset' (resets the module to a known state), 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' (inputs to scan chains for testing internal logic), 'scan_enable' (enables the scan operation), and 'test_mode' (sets the module into a test mode for various operations). Corresponding output ports 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' are aligned with the input scan ports, providing observable serial outputs for internal testing verification. Internal signals mirror these inputs and outputs directly and are extensively utilized for driving and testing the connected 'boot_mem128' module within simulation environments. The code structure features an instantiation of 'boot_mem128', with all related ports wired accordingly, and an initial block that sets up the simulation environment, applies initial conditions to signals, and possibly integrates an SDF (Standard Delay Format) file for timing verification if compiled under specific conditions (`ifdef SDFSCAN`). The module effectively supports thorough testing procedures ensuring the 'boot_mem128' module's reliability in simulated operations.",
