It includes input ports such as `clk` (clock input), `reset` (system reset), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (scan chain inputs), `scan_enable` (enable scan test), `test_mode` (activate test mode), and multiple Wishbone interface signals like `i_wb_adr` (address input), `i_wb_sel` (select input), `i_wb_we` (write enable), `i_wb_dat` (data input), `i_wb_cyc` (indicate an active transfer), and `i_wb_stb` (strobe signal). The output ports consist of `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` for the scan chain outputs and Wishbone signals `o_wb_dat` (data output), `o_wb_ack` (acknowledge signal), and `o_wb_err` (error signal). Internal signals include the aforementioned outputs which are sourced from the connected \"boot_mem128\" module. The module includes initialization and cleanup procedures, simulation of input scenarios including toggle of input signals, and employs the tasks `wb_write_strobe` and `wb_read_strobe` for performing specific memory write and read operations with optional validation of read data against expected values. All these functionalities ensure that the \"boot_mem128\" module operates as expected under various test conditions.",

It includes input ports such as `clk` (clock input), `reset` (system reset), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (scan chain inputs), `scan_enable` (enable scan test), `test_mode` (activate test mode), and multiple Wishbone interface signals like `i_wb_adr` (address input), `i_wb_sel` (select input), `i_wb_we` (write enable), `i_wb_dat` (data input), `i_wb_cyc` (indicate an active transfer), and `i_wb_stb` (strobe signal). The output ports consist of `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` for the scan chain outputs and Wishbone signals `o_wb_dat` (data output), `o_wb_ack` (acknowledge signal), and `o_wb_err` (error signal). Internal signals include the aforementioned outputs which are sourced from the connected \"boot_mem128\" module. The module includes initialization and cleanup procedures, simulation of input scenarios including toggle of input signals, and employs the tasks `wb_write_strobe` and `wb_read_strobe` for performing specific memory write and read operations with optional validation of read data against expected values. All these functionalities ensure that the \"boot_mem128\" module operates as expected under various test conditions."
