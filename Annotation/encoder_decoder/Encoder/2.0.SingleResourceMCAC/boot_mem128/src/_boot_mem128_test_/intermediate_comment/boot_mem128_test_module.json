    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"test\" module acts as a test bench for the \"boot_mem128\" module, simulating a clock and performing memory transactions via a Wishbone interface. It handles input initialization and cleanup, mirrors module behavior with internal signals, and verifies operation through write and read tasks. This setup actively tests and confirms the functionality under controlled, simulated operations."
