    "spec": "Module name: boot_mem128. \nModule specification: The 'boot_mem128' module is a memory management unit interfacing with a Wishbone bus, primarily designed to manage read and write operations to a memory block with a configurable data and address width. It includes input ports such as `clk` for clock synchronization, `reset` for internal state resets, various `scan_in` and `scan_out` for test purposes, and `i_wb_*` signals for interfacing with the Wishbone bus which include address, data, and control signals. The output ports include `o_wb_dat` for output data, `o_wb_ack` for transaction acknowledgement, and `o_wb_err` for error signaling in memory operations. Internally, the module utilizes signals like `start_write` and `start_read` to initiate memory operations, `read_data` and `write_data` for holding the data being transferred, and `byte_enable` and `address` for selective memory access and location addressing. The module is structured into blocks handling the initialization and conditional compilation for debug features (`AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG`), memory operation initiation, data and address assignment, and memory hardware instantiation (`generic_sram_byte_en`). Additionally, it includes conditional generation of memory blocks or the use of parameterized memory models depending on compilation flags. These elements collectively enhance the module\u2019s utility and flexibility in embedded hardware design tasks, supporting both test and operational modes efficiently.",

It includes input ports such as `clk` for clock synchronization, `reset` for internal state resets, various `scan_in` and `scan_out` for test purposes, and `i_wb_*` signals for interfacing with the Wishbone bus which include address, data, and control signals. The output ports include `o_wb_dat` for output data, `o_wb_ack` for transaction acknowledgement, and `o_wb_err` for error signaling in memory operations. Internally, the module utilizes signals like `start_write` and `start_read` to initiate memory operations, `read_data` and `write_data` for holding the data being transferred, and `byte_enable` and `address` for selective memory access and location addressing. The module is structured into blocks handling the initialization and conditional compilation for debug features (`AMBER_WISHBONE_DEBUG`), memory operation initiation, data and address assignment, and memory hardware instantiation (`generic_sram_byte_en`). Additionally, it includes conditional generation of memory blocks or the use of parameterized memory models depending on compilation flags. These elements collectively enhance the module\u2019s utility and flexibility in embedded hardware design tasks, supporting both test and operational modes efficiently."
