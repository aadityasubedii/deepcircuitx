Module name: eth_rxcounters. Module specification: The 'eth_rxcounters' module is dedicated to managing byte and Inter-Frame Gap (IFG) counters in an Ethernet receiver. This verilog module features input ports such as 'MRxClk' (the receiver clock), 'Reset' (resets all counters and states), 'MRxDV' (data valid indicator), state signals ('StateIdle', 'StateSFD', 'StateData', 'StateDrop', 'StatePreamble'), and a number of control signals including 'DlyCrcEn', 'Transmitting', 'MaxFL', 'r_IFG', and 'HugEn'. Output ports include flags like 'IFGCounterEq24' and 'ByteCntEq0' through 'ByteCntEq7', in addition to others like 'ByteCntGreat2', 'ByteCntSmall7', 'ByteCntMaxFrame', and 'ByteCntOut' which indicate specific conditions of the byte counting process. The internal signals such as 'ResetByteCounter', 'IncrementByteCounter', 'ResetIFGCounter', and 'IncrementIFGCounter' manage the operational logic of resetting and incrementing counters based on frame reception states and conditions. Byte and IFG counters are implemented via 'always' blocks that respond to rising edges of 'MRxClk' or a high 'Reset', adjusting internal states and counts. The module thoroughly handles edge cases and conditional increments, ensuring accurate byte and IFG counting aligned with Ethernet standards and dynamic reception conditions.
