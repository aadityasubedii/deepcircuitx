    "module": "Module-level comment: This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM device, implementing timing checks, command decoding, and read/write operations. It models memory-specific features like burst operations, refresh cycles, and power-down modes. The module uses input ports for control signals, address/bank selection, and data management, with internal signals tracking timing parameters, operational states, and data pipelines. It performs comprehensive timing checks, handles various DDR3 commands, and simulates data read/write operations with appropriate delays and error checking."
