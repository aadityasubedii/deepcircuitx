    "spec": "Module name: clocks_resets. \n\nModule specification: The 'clocks_resets' Verilog module is primarily designed for clock and reset management within FPGA systems, particularly targeting Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6 families. The module accepts differential clock inputs (i_brd_clk_n, i_brd_clk_p), a system reset signal (i_brd_rst), and a DDR calibration completion indicator (i_ddr_calib_done). It produces a system reset output (o_sys_rst), a primary system clock (o_sys_clk), and an additional clock output (o_clk_200). Internally, the module uses signal synchronization techniques and condition-based configurations to manage the states efficiently. Several important internal signals include calib_done_33mhz, pll_locked, and rst0 among others, serving various purposes from reset synchronization to clock signal stabilization. The module's code is structured into conditional sections using compiler directives (`ifdef`, `endif`) that differentiate hardware configurations based on the FPGA type. For instance, configurations and instantiation differ for Spartan-6 and Virtex-6, using respective components like PLL_ADV and MMCM_ADV for clock management. Additionally, the non-Xilinx FPGA simulation context is provided using behavioral modeling to emulate the clock handling typically expected in real hardware scenarios. This way, the module ensures robust integration of clock and reset functionalities aligned with specific FPGA characteristics.\n",

It takes differential board clock signals (i_brd_clk_n, i_brd_clk_p), a board reset signal (i_brd_rst), and a calibration completion signal (i_ddr_calib_done) as inputs. It produces three outputs: a system reset signal (o_sys_rst), a system clock signal (o_sys_clk), and another clock signal (o_clk_200). The module includes conditional checks to either use dedicated FPGA blocks like IBUFGDS, PLL_ADV, or MMCM_ADV for clock management, depending on the type of FPGA (Xilinx Spartan-6 or Virtex-6). The functionality includes generating the system reset signal based on calibration completion and reset synchronization, and generating the system clock based on PLL or MMCM configurations specific to the FPGA type. The outputs reflect system synchronization and reliability via the combined management of clocks and resets."

This resets the connected subsystems/modules.\n- o_sys_clk: System clock output derived from PLL or MMCM, used to drive the internal logic of the FPGA system.\n- o_clk_200: Clock output signal primarily derived directly from the input clock buffer (potentially undergoing some transformation in specific FPGA configurations) to be used by parts of the system that require a specific clock frequency or characteristics."

It is generated by synchronizing and propagating the reset condition through a shift register.\n- `pll_locked`: A status signal from the PLL or MMCM that indicates whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the input frequency, crucial for stable clock output generation.\n- `clkfbout_clkfbin`: Used for feedback connections in PLL or MMCM configurations, critical for maintaining the stability and phase alignment of the generated clock signals.\n- `rst0_sync_r`: A shift register array used to synchronize and delay the reset signal (`i_brd_rst`) propagation based on the clock domain crossing requirements. It helps in stabilizing the reset across multiple clock domains.\n- `ddr_calib_done_sync_r`: A shift register similar to `rst0_sync_r`, but it is used for synchronizing the `i_ddr_calib_done` signal across the clock domain, ensuring the DDR calibration signal is properly aligned with the system's clock domain.\n- `rst_tmp`: A temporary internal reset signal used in the logic to create a final synchronous reset signal. It integrates the board reset and pll_locked status to manage the conditional reset behavior aligned with PLL locking.\n- `pll_clk`: The clock signal generated by the PLL or MMCM, which is used as the primary system clock (`o_sys_clk`) after buffering. It drives the internal logic and operations aligned with system requirements.\n- `brd_clk_ibufg`: This signal is the output of an input buffer that conditions the incoming differential clock signals (`i_brd_clk_n`, `i_brd_clk_p`) to be suitable for internal use, primarily utilized within PLL/ MMCM for generating other required clocks. This processing of the input clock is crucial for noise reduction and signal integrity."

The module accepts differential clock inputs (i_brd_clk_n, i_brd_clk_p), a system reset signal (i_brd_rst), and a DDR calibration completion indicator (i_ddr_calib_done). It produces a system reset output (o_sys_rst), a primary system clock (o_sys_clk), and an additional clock output (o_clk_200). Internally, the module uses signal synchronization techniques and condition-based configurations to manage the states efficiently. Several important internal signals include calib_done_33mhz, pll_locked, and rst0 among others, serving various purposes from reset synchronization to clock signal stabilization. The module's code is structured into conditional sections using compiler directives (`ifdef`, `endif`) that differentiate hardware configurations based on the FPGA type. For instance, configurations and instantiation differ for Spartan-6 and Virtex-6, using respective components like PLL_ADV and MMCM_ADV for clock management. Additionally, the non-Xilinx FPGA simulation context is provided using behavioral modeling to emulate the clock handling typically expected in real hardware scenarios. This way, the module ensures robust integration of clock and reset functionalities aligned with specific FPGA characteristics.\n"

It takes differential board clock signals (i_brd_clk_n, i_brd_clk_p), a board reset signal (i_brd_rst), and a calibration completion signal (i_ddr_calib_done) as inputs. It produces three outputs: a system reset signal (o_sys_rst), a system clock signal (o_sys_clk), and another clock signal (o_clk_200). The module includes conditional checks to either use dedicated FPGA blocks like IBUFGDS, PLL_ADV, or MMCM_ADV for clock management, depending on the type of FPGA (Xilinx Spartan-6 or Virtex-6). The functionality includes generating the system reset signal based on calibration completion and reset synchronization, and generating the system clock based on PLL or MMCM configurations specific to the FPGA type. The outputs reflect system synchronization and reliability via the combined management of clocks and resets."

It is generated by synchronizing and propagating the reset condition through a shift register.\n- `pll_locked`: A status signal from the PLL or MMCM that indicates whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the input frequency, crucial for stable clock output generation.\n- `clkfbout_clkfbin`: Used for feedback connections in PLL or MMCM configurations, critical for maintaining the stability and phase alignment of the generated clock signals.\n- `rst0_sync_r`: A shift register array used to synchronize and delay the reset signal (`i_brd_rst`) propagation based on the clock domain crossing requirements. It helps in stabilizing the reset across multiple clock domains.\n- `ddr_calib_done_sync_r`: A shift register similar to `rst0_sync_r`, but it is used for synchronizing the `i_ddr_calib_done` signal across the clock domain, ensuring the DDR calibration signal is properly aligned with the system's clock domain.\n- `rst_tmp`: A temporary internal reset signal used in the logic to create a final synchronous reset signal. It integrates the board reset and pll_locked status to manage the conditional reset behavior aligned with PLL locking.\n- `pll_clk`: The clock signal generated by the PLL or MMCM, which is used as the primary system clock (`o_sys_clk`) after buffering. It drives the internal logic and operations aligned with system requirements.\n- `brd_clk_ibufg`: This signal is the output of an input buffer that conditions the incoming differential clock signals (`i_brd_clk_n`, `i_brd_clk_p`) to be suitable for internal use, primarily utilized within PLL/ MMCM for generating other required clocks. This processing of the input clock is crucial for noise reduction and signal integrity."

                    "text": "Module name: clocks_resets. \n\nModule specification: The 'clocks_resets' Verilog module is primarily designed for clock and reset management within FPGA systems, particularly targeting Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6 families. The module accepts differential clock inputs (i_brd_clk_n, i_brd_clk_p), a system reset signal (i_brd_rst), and a DDR calibration completion indicator (i_ddr_calib_done). It produces a system reset output (o_sys_rst), a primary system clock (o_sys_clk), and an additional clock output (o_clk_200). Internally, the module uses signal synchronization techniques and condition-based configurations to manage the states efficiently. Several important internal signals include calib_done_33mhz, pll_locked, and rst0 among others, serving various purposes from reset synchronization to clock signal stabilization. The module's code is structured into conditional sections using compiler directives (`ifdef`, `endif`) that differentiate hardware configurations based on the FPGA type. For instance, configurations and instantiation differ for Spartan-6 and Virtex-6, using respective components like PLL_ADV and MMCM_ADV for clock management. Additionally, the non-Xilinx FPGA simulation context is provided using behavioral modeling to emulate the clock handling typically expected in real hardware scenarios. This way, the module ensures robust integration of clock and reset functionalities aligned with specific FPGA characteristics.\n"
