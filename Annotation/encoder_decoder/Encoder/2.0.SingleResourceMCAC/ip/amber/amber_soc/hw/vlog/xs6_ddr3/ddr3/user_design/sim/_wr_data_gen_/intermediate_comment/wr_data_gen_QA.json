The module generates data based on the input command signals and data mode, supporting different data patterns and burst lengths. It controls ready and valid signals for ensuring proper synchronization and timing in data transactions. The module also includes implementational specifics for managing data bursts and end-of-write acknowledgments, engaging with FIFO (First-In, First-Out) memory logic to handle data readiness. This functionality involves calculating when the last word in a data burst is written and signaling it, and setting readiness for new commands based on the burst completion and FIFO states. The module accommodates various configurations and operational modes, ensuring flexibility across different hardware settings and operational requirements."

This signal synchronizes the operation of the module, providing the timing reference for internal logic and state transitions.\n- `rst_i`: Reset input. This active low signal initializes or resets the module's internal state to a defined start condition.\n- `prbs_fseed_i`: PRBS (Pseudo Random Binary Sequence) feed seed. This input initializes the seed for generating pseudo-random data patterns when the module is set to use PRBS data pattern.\n- `data_mode_i`: Data mode input. This signal controls the type of data pattern generation, determining how data is formulated within the module.\n- `cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_validB_i`, `cmd_validC_i`: Command valid inputs. These signals indicate when a new command is valid and should be processed by the module.\n- `fixed_data_i`: Fixed data input. This data is used when the module is configured to use fixed data patterns.\n- `addr_i`: Address input. This signal provides the memory address information for data transactions.\n- `bl_i`: Burst length input. This value specifies the number of data words in a burst transaction.\n- `data_rdy_i`: Data ready input. This signal from an external source indicates that the downstream logic or FIFO can accept data, enabling data output.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `cmd_rdy_o`: Command ready output. This signal indicates the module is ready to receive a new command, reflecting the internal state considering the FIFO's ability to accept more data.\n- `last_word_o`: Last word output. This signal goes high to indicate the last word in the current data burst is being processed, used to manage burst transaction timing.\n- `data_valid_o`: Data valid output. This signal asserts when the module has valid output data available following the defined data generation pattern and considering FIFO readiness.\n- `data_o`: Data output. This is the actual data output based on the selected pattern or fixed data, formed according to input command specifications.\n- `data_wr_end_o`: Data write end output (registered). This signal indicates the end of a data write operation, typically asserted when the last word in a burst is sent and the FIFO can accept it."

These flags trigger internal processes based on the validity of incoming commands, coordinating data generation and transaction timings.\n- `burst_count_reached2`: Flag to monitor burst count status. Used in internal logic to keep track of when a burst transaction reaches its completion.\n- `data_valid`: Data validity flag. Indicates whether the data being output is valid, contingent upon FIFO readiness and internal command states.\n- `user_burst_cnt`: User-defined burst count tracker. Maintains a count of data words in the current burst, decrementing as data is processed to manage burst-bound operations.\n- `walk_cnt`: Counter used likely for internal state management or stepping through data patterns or sequences. Specific use may depend on deeper internal logic not fully visible.\n- `u_bcount_2`: A specialized counter signal, likely used in conjunction with `last_word_o` to determine the precise timing for when the last data word in a burst is being handled.\n- `fifo_not_full`: FIFO status signal derived from external input `data_rdy_i`. Used throughout the module to ensure data transactions only occur when the FIFO can accept more data.\n- `last_word_t`: Temporary signal related to the generation of the `last_word_o` signal, aiding in the determination of when a data burst is concluding.\n\nExplanation:\nThe internal signals in the `wr_data_gen` module are primarily used for managing data flow and command processing synchronization within the module, particularly in relation to external FIFO mechanisms and data-burst commands. Each signal plays a critical role in ensuring data is accurately generated, validated, and synchronized to external memory or FIFO interfaces. These internal states help in dynamically adjusting to command inputs, managing data bursts, and ensuring robust data transaction handling."
