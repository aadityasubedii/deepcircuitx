    "module": "Module-level comment: The a25_coprocessor module manages coprocessor configurations, facilitating cache control and error handling in processor systems. It synchronizes operations with system clocks and adjusts based on core stalls. The module processes input commands to enable/disable caching, manage cacheable and updateable regions via register operations, and handles faults by capturing and debugging statuses and addresses. Its implementation includes conditional always blocks and assignments that ensure proper timing and logic decisions, aiding in efficient system stability and responsiveness."
