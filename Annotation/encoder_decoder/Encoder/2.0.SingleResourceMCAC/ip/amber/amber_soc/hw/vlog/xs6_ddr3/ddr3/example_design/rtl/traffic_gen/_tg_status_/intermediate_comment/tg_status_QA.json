It outputs a status and error signal based on specific input conditions. The module operates synchronously to a clock input `clk_i` and includes functionality to reset or manually clear error states. When specific error conditions are detected (data error without being previously set and without an error already set), the module captures and outputs details like the mismatching data addresses, data lengths, buffer status, and the data values of comparison and read operations. This error information is maintained until reset or manual clear is applied."

Used to synchronize the operations within the module.\n- **rst_i**: Reset input. Resets the error_status and error_set when active.\n- **manual_clear_error**: Manual clear input. Used to reset the error_status and error_set without requiring a reset.\n- **data_error_i**: Data error signal input. Indicates when there is a data error that needs to be captured and processed.\n- **cmp_data_i**: Comparison data input. Holds the data that is being compared in the error checking process.\n- **rd_data_i**: Read data input. Contains the data that was actually read and is used in comparison against cmp_data_i.\n- **cmp_addr_i**: Address input of the comparison operation. Used to identify which data/address is under error scrutiny.\n- **cmp_bl_i**: Block length input related to the data being compared. Indicates the length of data block involved in the error.\n- **mcb_cmd_full_i**: Memory Command Buffer (MCB) command full input. Indicates whether the command buffer is full.\n- **mcb_wr_full_i**: MCB write full input. Signals if the write buffer of the MCB is full.\n- **mcb_rd_empty_i**: MCB read empty input. Used to indicate that the read buffer of the MCB is empty.\n\nOutput ports: \n- error_status, error.\nExplanation: \n- **error_status**: Wide output register which holds detailed error information including the error data address, block length, condition of various buffers at the moment of the error, and the mismatched data information.\n- **error**: Flag output which indicates if there is an ongoing error. Stays active until the error condition is cleared either by reset or manual clear."

It is used to detect edges or transitions of the `data_error_i` signal (which indicate the arrival of new data errors) as part of the logic to set error flags and statuses only on new errors.\n- **error_set**: This is a register used to indicate if an error has been detected and set. Once set, this signal remains high until the error conditions are cleared either through a reset (`rst_i`) or a manual clear (`manual_clear_error`). It prevents the overwriting of the `error_status` register, allowing the system to address and rectify the errors without losing information about the first detected error."
