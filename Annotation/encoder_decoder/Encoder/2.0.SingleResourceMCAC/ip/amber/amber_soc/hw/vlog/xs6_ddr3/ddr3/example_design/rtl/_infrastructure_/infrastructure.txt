Module-level comment: The 'infrastructure' module manages clock signals and reset synchronization for FPGA systems. It supports differential and single-ended clock inputs and includes PLL for multiple clock outputs at various phases. It buffers and synchronizes reset signals conditioned on PLL lock status, ensuring system stability and reliable operations through controlled clock management and reset synchronization mechanisms.
