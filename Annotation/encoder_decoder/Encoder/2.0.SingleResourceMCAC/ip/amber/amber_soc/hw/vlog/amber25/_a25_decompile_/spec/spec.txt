Module name: a25_decompile. Module specification: This module is a decompiler for an ARM processor (likely an ARM25 variant) designed for debugging and analysis purposes. It takes various inputs related to instruction execution and processor state, including clock (i_clk), core stall (i_core_stall), instruction (i_instruction), instruction validity (i_instruction_valid), undefined instruction flag (i_instruction_undefined), execution flag (i_instruction_execute), interrupt type (i_interrupt), interrupt state (i_interrupt_state), instruction address (i_instruction_address), program counter select (i_pc_sel), and program counter write enable (i_pc_wen). The module has no output ports, instead writing decompiled instruction information to a file. Internal signals include instruction components (e.g., imm32, reg_n, opcode), execution flags, and temporary storage for calculations.
