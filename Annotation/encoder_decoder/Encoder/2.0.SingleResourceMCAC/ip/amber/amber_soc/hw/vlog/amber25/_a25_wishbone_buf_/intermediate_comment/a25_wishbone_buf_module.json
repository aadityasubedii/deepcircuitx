    "module": "Module-level comment: The a25_wishbone_buf module serves as a double buffering mechanism for managing read and write transactions on the Wishbone bus, accommodating interface speed differences and ensuring data integrity. It uses input signals to initiate transactions, stores operations in internal buffers, and manages these with pointers and status registers. Outputs are generated based on the buffer's state, systematically handling data flows and acknowledgments. The design effectively sequences bus operations to enhance system reliability and performance."
