    "spec": "Module name: wishbone_arbiter.\nModule specification: The \"wishbone_arbiter\" is a critical module tailored to arbitrate access to a shared Wishbone bus among multiple master devices, ensuring efficient and orderly communication between the masters and various slave devices. The module utilizes a set of input and output ports such as `i_wb_clk` (clock signal), `i_m0_wb_adr`, `i_m1_wb_adr` (address inputs for master 0 and master 1), and corresponding byte select, write enable, data, cycle, and strobe signals to handle read and write operations. Output ports include `o_m0_wb_dat`, `o_m1_wb_dat` (data outputs to masters), along with respective acknowledgment and error signals, plus slave addressing and control outputs (`o_s0_wb_adr` to `o_s7_wb_adr`). Internal signals like `m0_wb_hold_r`, `m1_wb_hold_r` (hold registers), `current_master`, `select_master`, `next_master` (master control), and `current_slave` (slave selector) manage the state and control flow within the module. Code blocks within the module are dedicated to determining master and slave selection based on current bus statuses and requests (`current_master`, `select_master`), routing master commands to appropriate slave devices (`master_adr`, `master_sel`, etc.), and directing responses back to the initiating masters (`master_rdat`, `master_ack`, `master_err`). The configuration for memory mapping and device addressing is integrated via an included VH file (`memory_configuration.vh`). This module ensures that the bus system maintains integrity and operates efficiently under the protocol constraints of the Wishbone specification, accommodating simultaneous requests and controlling access rights.",

It controls which master has access to the bus based on cyclical and strobe (stb) signals and whether acknowledgements are still pending from previous data requests. The arbiter allocates the bus resource to requesting masters and routes the data flow between the selected master and the appropriate slave device based on the target address. It assesses address ranges for routing by consulting included memory configuration files. The arbiter also manages read and write operations, directing data to the correct destination and handling errors and acknowledgements between the masters and slaves."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports:\n- `i_wb_clk`: Clock input signal for the Wishbone bus. It is used to synchronize the operations of the arbiter, ensuring that data transfer and control operations occur in a defined order.\n- `i_m0_wb_adr`, `i_m1_wb_adr`: Address inputs from master 0 and master 1 respectively. These inputs specify the address locations on the slaves that the masters intend to access.\n- `i_m0_wb_sel`, `i_m1_wb_sel`: Byte select signals from master 0 and master 1 respectively. These signals indicate which bytes in the data word are active and ought to be written or read.\n- `i_m0_wb_we`, `i_m1_wb_we`: Write enable signals from master 0 and master 1 respectively. A high signal indicates a write operation is intended by the master.\n- `i_m0_wb_dat`, `i_m1_wb_dat`: Data inputs from master 0 and master 1 respectively. These inputs contain data to be written to the slave devices when a write operation is performed.\n- `i_m0_wb_cyc`, `i_m1_wb_cyc`: Bus cycle signals from master 0 and master 1 respectively. A high signal indicates an active bus cycle, meaning the master is requesting control of the bus to start a transaction.\n- `i_m0_wb_stb`, `i_m1_wb_stb`: Strobe signals from master 0 and master 1 respectively. These signals are used to indicate a valid data transfer or bus transaction is ready to take place.\n- `i_s0_wb_dat` to `i_s7_wb_dat`: Data inputs from slave 0 to slave 7 respectively. These are data lines from slaves back to the arbiter, carrying data that the masters have requested or read operation responses.\n- `i_s0_wb_ack` to `i_s7_wb_ack`: Acknowledge signals from slave 0 to slave 7 respectively. These signals indicate that the slave has completed the requested operation.\n- `i_s0_wb_err` to `i_s7_wb_err`: Error signals from slave 0 to slave 7 respectively. These signals indicate an error during the transaction.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `o_m0_wb_dat`, `o_m1_wb_dat`: Data outputs to master 0 and master 1 respectively. These outputs send data read from the slave devices back to the respective masters.\n- `o_m0_wb_ack`, `o_m1_wb_ack`: Acknowledge outputs to master 0 and master 1 respectively. These signals indicate to the masters that their request has been processed, either successfully or with an error.\n- `o_m0_wb_err`, `o_m1_wb_err`: Error outputs to master 0 and master 1 respectively. These signals indicate that an error was encountered during the processing of the request.\n- `o_s0_wb_adr` to `o_s7_wb_adr`: Address outputs to slave 0 to slave 7 respectively. These outputs specify the address locations the masters are trying to access on the slaves.\n- `o_s0_wb_sel` to `o_s7_wb_sel`: Byte select outputs to slave 0 to slave 7 respectively. These signals specify which bytes in the data word the transaction is targeting.\n- `o_s0_wb_we` to `o_s7_wb_we`: Write enable signals to slave 0 to slave 7 respectively. These signals control whether the operation is a read or a write.\n- `o_s0_wb_dat` to `o_s7_wb_dat`: Data outputs to slave 0 to slave 7 respectively. These outputs carry data being sent from the masters for write operations.\n- `o_s0_wb_cyc` to `o_s7_wb_cyc`: Bus cycle signals to each slave, indicating an active transaction.\n- `o_s0_wb_stb` to `o_s7_wb_stb`: Strobe outputs to slave 0 to slave 7 respectively. These signals are used to trigger a valid data transfer or transaction.\n\nExplanation: The input ports primarily relate to receiving control signals, data, and transaction requests from the master devices and the slave responses. The output ports are used to route these requests and responses between the masters and the correct slaves, initiate actions on the slaves, send data back to the masters, and communicate the status of the transactions."

It helps manage transactions spanning multiple clock cycles.\n  \n- `current_master`, `current_master_r`: The `current_master` signal indicates which master (0 or 1) is currently granted access to the bus. `current_master_r` is a registered version that holds this value stable through clock cycles as necessary for synchronization and stable operation.\n  \n- `next_master`: This signal is used to decide which master should be given priority to access the bus in the next state when both masters request access simultaneously.\n  \n- `select_master`: This wire signal is used to determine which master gets access to the bus based on their current state (whether they are held or not).\n  \n- `current_slave`: This is used to index the current slave based on the master's address signal. This signal ensures that the requests from the masters are directed to the correct slave device.\n  \n- `master_adr`, `master_sel`, `master_we`, `master_wdat`, `master_cyc`, `master_stb`: These signals represent the consolidated address, select, write enable, write data, cycle, and strobe signals deriving from the currently active master. They act as a bridge carrying the master's transaction requests to the slaves.\n  \n- `master_rdat`, `master_ack`, `master_err`: These are responses from the current slave directed back to the relevant master. They respectively represent the read data, acknowledgment of a successful transaction, and error signal if an issue occurred.\n\nIn summary, these internal signals interconnect the logic within the `wishbone_arbiter` to manage, direct, and control communication and transactions between masters and slaves on a shared bus, ensuring accurate, synchronized bus operation which adheres to the Wishbone protocol."

The module utilizes a set of input and output ports such as `i_wb_clk` (clock signal), `i_m0_wb_adr`, `i_m1_wb_adr` (address inputs for master 0 and master 1), and corresponding byte select, write enable, data, cycle, and strobe signals to handle read and write operations. Output ports include `o_m0_wb_dat`, `o_m1_wb_dat` (data outputs to masters), along with respective acknowledgment and error signals, plus slave addressing and control outputs (`o_s0_wb_adr` to `o_s7_wb_adr`). Internal signals like `m0_wb_hold_r`, `m1_wb_hold_r` (hold registers), `current_master`, `select_master`, `next_master` (master control), and `current_slave` (slave selector) manage the state and control flow within the module. Code blocks within the module are dedicated to determining master and slave selection based on current bus statuses and requests (`current_master`, `select_master`), routing master commands to appropriate slave devices (`master_adr`, `master_sel`, etc.), and directing responses back to the initiating masters (`master_rdat`, `master_ack`, `master_err`). The configuration for memory mapping and device addressing is integrated via an included VH file (`memory_configuration.vh`). This module ensures that the bus system maintains integrity and operates efficiently under the protocol constraints of the Wishbone specification, accommodating simultaneous requests and controlling access rights."

It controls which master has access to the bus based on cyclical and strobe (stb) signals and whether acknowledgements are still pending from previous data requests. The arbiter allocates the bus resource to requesting masters and routes the data flow between the selected master and the appropriate slave device based on the target address. It assesses address ranges for routing by consulting included memory configuration files. The arbiter also manages read and write operations, directing data to the correct destination and handling errors and acknowledgements between the masters and slaves."

                    "text": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports:\n- `i_wb_clk`: Clock input signal for the Wishbone bus. It is used to synchronize the operations of the arbiter, ensuring that data transfer and control operations occur in a defined order.\n- `i_m0_wb_adr`, `i_m1_wb_adr`: Address inputs from master 0 and master 1 respectively. These inputs specify the address locations on the slaves that the masters intend to access.\n- `i_m0_wb_sel`, `i_m1_wb_sel`: Byte select signals from master 0 and master 1 respectively. These signals indicate which bytes in the data word are active and ought to be written or read.\n- `i_m0_wb_we`, `i_m1_wb_we`: Write enable signals from master 0 and master 1 respectively. A high signal indicates a write operation is intended by the master.\n- `i_m0_wb_dat`, `i_m1_wb_dat`: Data inputs from master 0 and master 1 respectively. These inputs contain data to be written to the slave devices when a write operation is performed.\n- `i_m0_wb_cyc`, `i_m1_wb_cyc`: Bus cycle signals from master 0 and master 1 respectively. A high signal indicates an active bus cycle, meaning the master is requesting control of the bus to start a transaction.\n- `i_m0_wb_stb`, `i_m1_wb_stb`: Strobe signals from master 0 and master 1 respectively. These signals are used to indicate a valid data transfer or bus transaction is ready to take place.\n- `i_s0_wb_dat` to `i_s7_wb_dat`: Data inputs from slave 0 to slave 7 respectively. These are data lines from slaves back to the arbiter, carrying data that the masters have requested or read operation responses.\n- `i_s0_wb_ack` to `i_s7_wb_ack`: Acknowledge signals from slave 0 to slave 7 respectively. These signals indicate that the slave has completed the requested operation.\n- `i_s0_wb_err` to `i_s7_wb_err`: Error signals from slave 0 to slave 7 respectively. These signals indicate an error during the transaction.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `o_m0_wb_dat`, `o_m1_wb_dat`: Data outputs to master 0 and master 1 respectively. These outputs send data read from the slave devices back to the respective masters.\n- `o_m0_wb_ack`, `o_m1_wb_ack`: Acknowledge outputs to master 0 and master 1 respectively. These signals indicate to the masters that their request has been processed, either successfully or with an error.\n- `o_m0_wb_err`, `o_m1_wb_err`: Error outputs to master 0 and master 1 respectively. These signals indicate that an error was encountered during the processing of the request.\n- `o_s0_wb_adr` to `o_s7_wb_adr`: Address outputs to slave 0 to slave 7 respectively. These outputs specify the address locations the masters are trying to access on the slaves.\n- `o_s0_wb_sel` to `o_s7_wb_sel`: Byte select outputs to slave 0 to slave 7 respectively. These signals specify which bytes in the data word the transaction is targeting.\n- `o_s0_wb_we` to `o_s7_wb_we`: Write enable signals to slave 0 to slave 7 respectively. These signals control whether the operation is a read or a write.\n- `o_s0_wb_dat` to `o_s7_wb_dat`: Data outputs to slave 0 to slave 7 respectively. These outputs carry data being sent from the masters for write operations.\n- `o_s0_wb_cyc` to `o_s7_wb_cyc`: Bus cycle signals to each slave, indicating an active transaction.\n- `o_s0_wb_stb` to `o_s7_wb_stb`: Strobe outputs to slave 0 to slave 7 respectively. These signals are used to trigger a valid data transfer or transaction.\n\nExplanation: The input ports primarily relate to receiving control signals, data, and transaction requests from the master devices and the slave responses. The output ports are used to route these requests and responses between the masters and the correct slaves, initiate actions on the slaves, send data back to the masters, and communicate the status of the transactions."

It helps manage transactions spanning multiple clock cycles.\n  \n- `current_master`, `current_master_r`: The `current_master` signal indicates which master (0 or 1) is currently granted access to the bus. `current_master_r` is a registered version that holds this value stable through clock cycles as necessary for synchronization and stable operation.\n  \n- `next_master`: This signal is used to decide which master should be given priority to access the bus in the next state when both masters request access simultaneously.\n  \n- `select_master`: This wire signal is used to determine which master gets access to the bus based on their current state (whether they are held or not).\n  \n- `current_slave`: This is used to index the current slave based on the master's address signal. This signal ensures that the requests from the masters are directed to the correct slave device.\n  \n- `master_adr`, `master_sel`, `master_we`, `master_wdat`, `master_cyc`, `master_stb`: These signals represent the consolidated address, select, write enable, write data, cycle, and strobe signals deriving from the currently active master. They act as a bridge carrying the master's transaction requests to the slaves.\n  \n- `master_rdat`, `master_ack`, `master_err`: These are responses from the current slave directed back to the relevant master. They respectively represent the read data, acknowledgment of a successful transaction, and error signal if an issue occurred.\n\nIn summary, these internal signals interconnect the logic within the `wishbone_arbiter` to manage, direct, and control communication and transactions between masters and slaves on a shared bus, ensuring accurate, synchronized bus operation which adheres to the Wishbone protocol."

The module utilizes a set of input and output ports such as `i_wb_clk` (clock signal), `i_m0_wb_adr`, `i_m1_wb_adr` (address inputs for master 0 and master 1), and corresponding byte select, write enable, data, cycle, and strobe signals to handle read and write operations. Output ports include `o_m0_wb_dat`, `o_m1_wb_dat` (data outputs to masters), along with respective acknowledgment and error signals, plus slave addressing and control outputs (`o_s0_wb_adr` to `o_s7_wb_adr`). Internal signals like `m0_wb_hold_r`, `m1_wb_hold_r` (hold registers), `current_master`, `select_master`, `next_master` (master control), and `current_slave` (slave selector) manage the state and control flow within the module. Code blocks within the module are dedicated to determining master and slave selection based on current bus statuses and requests (`current_master`, `select_master`), routing master commands to appropriate slave devices (`master_adr`, `master_sel`, etc.), and directing responses back to the initiating masters (`master_rdat`, `master_ack`, `master_err`). The configuration for memory mapping and device addressing is integrated via an included VH file (`memory_configuration.vh`). This module ensures that the bus system maintains integrity and operates efficiently under the protocol constraints of the Wishbone specification, accommodating simultaneous requests and controlling access rights."
