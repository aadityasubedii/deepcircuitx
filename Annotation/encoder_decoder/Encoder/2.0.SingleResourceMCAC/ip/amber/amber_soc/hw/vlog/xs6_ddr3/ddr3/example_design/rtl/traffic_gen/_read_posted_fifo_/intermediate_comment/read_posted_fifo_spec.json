    "spec": "Module name: read_posted_fifo. \n\nModule specification: The `read_posted_fifo` Verilog module is engineered to handle FIFO operations tailored for hardware systems managing data/command transactions, with configurations editable for specific hardware families, such as SPARTAN6, and burst lengths. It features input ports including `clk_i` for module synchronizing, `rst_i` for module reset, and `cmd_valid_i`, `data_valid_i` for validating commands and data respectively. There are also inputs like `addr_i`, `bl_i` for addressing and specifying burst lengths, and control signals like `cmd_sent`, `bl_sent`, and external readiness checks through `gen_rdy_i`. Output ports include `cmd_rdy_o` signaling command readiness, `gen_valid_o`, `gen_addr_o`, `gen_bl_o` for output validation and addressing, and `rd_buff_avail_o` indicating buffer availability. Internal signals such as `empty_r`, `full`, `wr_en`, and `rd_en` manage FIFO state and data flow control. `wait_cnt` and `wait_done` manage operation synchronization post-command acceptance. \n\nThe module contains multiple procedural blocks like asynchronous reset handling, write and read enable logic, output data validation, and counter management for tracking data received versus data requested. An instance of the `afifo` submodule, parameterized by the module, manages the core FIFO operations with specific configurations for depth, data size, and synchronization, outputting to `full`, `empty`, and data ports like `gen_bl_o` and `gen_addr_o`. This module efficiently supports real-time data handling and synchronization in complex digital designs where high responsiveness and correct data management are crucial.",

It features input ports including `clk_i` for module synchronizing, `rst_i` for module reset, and `cmd_valid_i`, `data_valid_i` for validating commands and data respectively. There are also inputs like `addr_i`, `bl_i` for addressing and specifying burst lengths, and control signals like `cmd_sent`, `bl_sent`, and external readiness checks through `gen_rdy_i`. Output ports include `cmd_rdy_o` signaling command readiness, `gen_valid_o`, `gen_addr_o`, `gen_bl_o` for output validation and addressing, and `rd_buff_avail_o` indicating buffer availability. Internal signals such as `empty_r`, `full`, `wr_en`, and `rd_en` manage FIFO state and data flow control. `wait_cnt` and `wait_done` manage operation synchronization post-command acceptance. \n\nThe module contains multiple procedural blocks like asynchronous reset handling, write and read enable logic, output data validation, and counter management for tracking data received versus data requested. An instance of the `afifo` submodule, parameterized by the module, manages the core FIFO operations with specific configurations for depth, data size, and synchronization, outputting to `full`, `empty`, and data ports like `gen_bl_o` and `gen_addr_o`. This module efficiently supports real-time data handling and synchronization in complex digital designs where high responsiveness and correct data management are crucial."
