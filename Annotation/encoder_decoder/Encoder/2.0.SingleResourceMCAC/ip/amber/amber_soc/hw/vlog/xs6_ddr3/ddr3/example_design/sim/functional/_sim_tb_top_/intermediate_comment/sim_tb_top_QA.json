The code initializes a clock signal and a reset signal, manages parameters related to the memory configuration like address width, data port size, and clock periods, and instantiates the memory and memory controller designs. The testbench checks the functionality of this memory system by monitoring calibration success and signaling errors or successful test completion based on the calibration results.

It is critical for timing and is used to synchronize operations across the memory interface. It oscillates periodically, with a frequency determined by the parameter `C3_MEMCLK_PERIOD`.\n- **c3_sys_rst**: This is the input reset signal. It is used to reset the system to a known state at the start of the simulation or under specific conditions. The actual reset signal used internally (`c3_sys_rst_i`) is determined by this input in conjunction with the `C3_RST_ACT_LOW` parameter to account for active high or active low reset logic.\n\nOutput ports:\n1. error\n2. calib_done\n\nExplanation:\n- **error**: This output signal indicates if there are any errors during the memory interface's operation. It is one of the critical indicators to determine if the memory integration and operations are functioning correctly during the simulations.\n- **calib_done**: This output signal indicates whether the calibration process of the memory interface is completed successfully.
