    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a Wishbone interface for an Ethernet controller, managing communication between the Ethernet MAC and system bus. It handles transmit/receive operations, buffer management, and interrupt generation. The module uses separate clock domains for Wishbone and Ethernet, employing synchronization logic for cross-domain signals. It manages buffer descriptors, controls data flow between FIFOs and memory, and generates status signals and interrupts based on Ethernet frame transmission and reception events."
