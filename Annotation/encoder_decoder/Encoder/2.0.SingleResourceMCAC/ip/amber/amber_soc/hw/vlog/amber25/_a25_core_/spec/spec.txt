Module name: a25_core. Module specification: The 'a25_core' module is a central processing unit implemented in Verilog, designed to interface with a Wishbone bus, which is evident from its input and output ports tailored for Wishbone protocol. It operates upon an input clock (`i_clk`) and can be manually reset using the `i_reset` port. It handles both regular and fast interrupt requests through `i_irq` and `i_firq` respectively, and can communicate the readiness of the system via `i_system_rdy`. The data exchange with external devices and memory through the Wishbone bus is facilitated by ports such as `o_wb_adr` for address, `o_wb_sel` for data lane selection, `o_wb_we` for write enabling, along with data inputs and outputs (`i_wb_dat` and `o_wb_dat`), and handshake signals (`o_wb_cyc`, `o_wb_stb`, `i_wb_ack`, `i_wb_err`).

Internal signals within the module manage instruction and data address handling (`execute_iaddress`, `execute_daddress`), data transactions (`write_data`, `write_enable`), fetched instructions (`fetch_instruction`), and flags for exclusive access and cache control (`decode_exclusive`, `cache_enable`). Stages of operation such as fetching, decoding, executing, memory access, and write-back are organized into dedicated subprocesses (`a25_fetch`, `a25_decode`, `a25_execute`, `a25_mem`, `a25_write_back`), each responsible for a segment of the CPU's operation. The signals also control error management, status updates, and conditions for instruction processing.

Furthermore, a coprocessor interface (`a25_coprocessor`) is included to enhance functionality such as managing additional control signals and performing special operations as dictated by the system architecture. This structured approach supports modular updates and maintenance, aligns with advanced microprocessor design principles enabling effective execution of instructions, handling of interrupts, and interactions with memory and peripherals through a disciplined control flow and data management strategy.
