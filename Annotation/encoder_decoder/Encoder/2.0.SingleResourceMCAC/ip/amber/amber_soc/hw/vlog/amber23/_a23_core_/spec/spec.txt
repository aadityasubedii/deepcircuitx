Module name: a23_core. 
Module specification: The `a23_core` is designed as a central processing unit (CPU) core for embedded systems, implemented using the Verilog hardware description language and structured to handle various CPU operations such as instruction fetch, decode, execution, and interaction with peripherals and coprocessor. It integrates with a Wishbone bus for memory and peripheral data transfers. Key input ports include `i_clk` (clock signal), `i_irq` (interrupt request input), and `i_firq` (fast interrupt request), along with `i_system_rdy` (system ready signal) and `i_wb_dat` (input data from the Wishbone bus). It produces several output ports like `o_wb_adr` (address output to the Wishbone bus), `o_wb_sel` (select lines for the Wishbone bus), and `o_wb_we` (write enable signal). Internal signals such as `execute_address`, `write_data`, and `read_data` control execution flow and data management within the CPU, while `status_bits_mode` and `status_bits_irq_mask` manage operation modes and interrupt handling. The module contains four primary internal blocks: `a23_fetch` for fetching instructions, `a23_decode` for decoding instructions, `a23_execute` for executing instructions, and `a23_coprocessor` for managing coprocessor interactions, caching, and handling special operations like interrupts and exceptions, ensuring comprehensive management of CPU functionalities.
