It has two interfaces: a write interface where data is input through `i_write_data` and controlled via `i_write_enable`, and a read interface where data is output through `o_read_data`. The module is parameterized with `DATA_WIDTH` of 21 bits and `ADDRESS_WIDTH` of 8 bits to specify the size of the memory address and data being handled. Internally, data is split and managed between two separate sections labeled as 'read_data_lo' and 'read_data_hi' for lower and higher parts of the RAM, respectively. The module is designed to operate under a single clock `i_clk` for both read and write operations, ensuring data synchronization. An initialization sequence checks parameter configurations to ensure that they match the expected settings for proper module functionality."

It has a width determined by the `DATA_WIDTH` parameter.\n- `i_write_enable` controls whether the data on the `i_write_data` line should be written into the RAM.

The width of this address line is determined by the `ADDRESS_WIDTH` parameter.\n\nOutput ports: [o_read_data].\nExplanation:\n- `o_read_data` outputs the data read from the RAM based on the address specified by `i_address`. The width of the data matches the `DATA_WIDTH` defined by the parameter. The output data is assembled from two sections of the RAM represented by `read_data_lo` and `read_data_hi` through specific bit selections and concatenations."
