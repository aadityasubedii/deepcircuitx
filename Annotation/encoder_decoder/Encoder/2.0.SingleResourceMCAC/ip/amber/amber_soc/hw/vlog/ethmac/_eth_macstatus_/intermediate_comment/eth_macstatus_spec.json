    "spec": "Module name: eth_macstatus. \n\nModule specification: The `eth_macstatus` module is designed for managing status signals in an Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) layer, specifically handling different states and errors associated with packet transmission and reception. The module's input ports include clock signals (`MRxClk`, `MTxClk`), reset signal (`Reset`), various receive and transmit state signals (`MRxDV`, `RxStateSFD`, `RxStateData`, etc.), byte counters (`RxByteCnt`), error detection (`RxCrcError`, `MRxErr`), and transmission control signals (`Transmitting`, `StartTxDone`, etc.). The output ports consist of status flags such as `ReceivedPacketGood`, `ReceiveEnd`, and error indicators (`InvalidSymbol`, `LatchedCrcError`), among others. Internal signals like `TakeSample`, `SetInvalidSymbol`, and `RxLateCollision` are critical for internal logic operations, determining when to sample the received packets, flagging invalid symbols, and detecting late collisions, respectively. The code is structured into several blocks, each handling specific parts of the status management such as error latching, state updates upon sample taking, collision detection, and status flag updating based on the specific conditions of the transmission and reception processes. This organized approach ensures that the MAC layer can accurately monitor and react to different states and errors during network data transmission, maintaining data integrity and proper communication flow.",

It is checked and set under specific frame reception and sampling conditions.\n\n- **DribbleNibble**: This signal indicates an error with nibble alignment in the received data. It is set when there\u2019s an issue with the last nibble of the received data under certain receive state conditions.\n\n- **ReceivedPacketTooBig**: A register signal that flags if a received packet exceeds the maximum allowed length as set by module configuration. It considers the huge frame enable status and is assessed along with packet sampling conditions.\n\nThese internal signals play critical roles in managing and monitoring detailed aspects of packet reception and status indication within the Ethernet MAC layer, ensuring accurate data handling and error management."

The module's input ports include clock signals (`MRxClk`, `MTxClk`), reset signal (`Reset`), various receive and transmit state signals (`MRxDV`, `RxStateSFD`, `RxStateData`, etc.), byte counters (`RxByteCnt`), error detection (`RxCrcError`, `MRxErr`), and transmission control signals (`Transmitting`, `StartTxDone`, etc.). The output ports consist of status flags such as `ReceivedPacketGood`, `ReceiveEnd`, and error indicators (`InvalidSymbol`, `LatchedCrcError`), among others. Internal signals like `TakeSample`, `SetInvalidSymbol`, and `RxLateCollision` are critical for internal logic operations, determining when to sample the received packets, flagging invalid symbols, and detecting late collisions, respectively. The code is structured into several blocks, each handling specific parts of the status management such as error latching, state updates upon sample taking, collision detection, and status flag updating based on the specific conditions of the transmission and reception processes. This organized approach ensures that the MAC layer can accurately monitor and react to different states and errors during network data transmission, maintaining data integrity and proper communication flow."
