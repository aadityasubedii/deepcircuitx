    "spec": "Module name: a23_wishbone.\n\nModule specification: The `a23_wishbone` module serves as an interface between a core processor and a Wishbone-compliant bus, orchestrating data transactions like read and write operations controlled by a finite state machine (FSM). Utilizing a system clock `i_clk`, it manages transactions based on the presence or absence of bus acknowledgments, handling of exclusive access, and burst transfers. The module accepts inputs such as `i_select` for enabling transactions, `i_write_data` for data to write, `i_write_enable` to specify write operations, `i_byte_enable` for active byte lanes during transfers, `i_address` for specifying memory address, and other control signals related to cache and error handling. Output ports include `o_stall` for stalling the core processor and various signals (`o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_cyc`, `o_wb_stb`) to manage the transaction status and data on the Wishbone bus. Internal signals like `wishbone_st` for managing FSM state, `wbuf_*` signals for buffering addresses and data, and conditions flags e.g., `read_ack`, enhance transaction handling during bus wait states or acknowledged cycles. The code consists of several blocks including state handling via combinatorial and sequential logic to determine bus transaction status, initiation, progression, and completion based on internal and input conditions, ensuring robust interaction with the Wishbone bus interface.",

It manages read and write operations, including exclusive access and burst transfers, while also taking care of stalls and data buffering when the bus is busy or waiting for acknowledgments. The operation is controlled by a finite state machine with states for idle, different burst stages, and waiting for acknowledgments."

Utilizing a system clock `i_clk`, it manages transactions based on the presence or absence of bus acknowledgments, handling of exclusive access, and burst transfers. The module accepts inputs such as `i_select` for enabling transactions, `i_write_data` for data to write, `i_write_enable` to specify write operations, `i_byte_enable` for active byte lanes during transfers, `i_address` for specifying memory address, and other control signals related to cache and error handling. Output ports include `o_stall` for stalling the core processor and various signals (`o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_cyc`, `o_wb_stb`) to manage the transaction status and data on the Wishbone bus. Internal signals like `wishbone_st` for managing FSM state, `wbuf_*` signals for buffering addresses and data, and conditions flags e.g., `read_ack`, enhance transaction handling during bus wait states or acknowledged cycles. The code consists of several blocks including state handling via combinatorial and sequential logic to determine bus transaction status, initiation, progression, and completion based on internal and input conditions, ensuring robust interaction with the Wishbone bus interface."

It manages read and write operations, including exclusive access and burst transfers, while also taking care of stalls and data buffering when the bus is busy or waiting for acknowledgments. The operation is controlled by a finite state machine with states for idle, different burst stages, and waiting for acknowledgments."

Utilizing a system clock `i_clk`, it manages transactions based on the presence or absence of bus acknowledgments, handling of exclusive access, and burst transfers. The module accepts inputs such as `i_select` for enabling transactions, `i_write_data` for data to write, `i_write_enable` to specify write operations, `i_byte_enable` for active byte lanes during transfers, `i_address` for specifying memory address, and other control signals related to cache and error handling. Output ports include `o_stall` for stalling the core processor and various signals (`o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_cyc`, `o_wb_stb`) to manage the transaction status and data on the Wishbone bus. Internal signals like `wishbone_st` for managing FSM state, `wbuf_*` signals for buffering addresses and data, and conditions flags e.g., `read_ack`, enhance transaction handling during bus wait states or acknowledged cycles. The code consists of several blocks including state handling via combinatorial and sequential logic to determine bus transaction status, initiation, progression, and completion based on internal and input conditions, ensuring robust interaction with the Wishbone bus interface."
