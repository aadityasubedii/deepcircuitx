    "spec": "Module name: eth_register. Module specification: The `eth_register` is a Verilog module designed to function as a parameterizable data register primarily used for storing and updating data synchronized by clock signals and conditioned by reset and write enable signals. It features input ports including `DataIn`, a data input accepting bit-width specified data to be written into the register; `Write`, a control signal enabling data writing when high; `Clk`, a clock signal to synchronize data writing; `Reset`, an asynchronous reset that immediately sets the output to a `RESET_VALUE`; and `SyncReset`, a synchronous reset that sets the output to `RESET_VALUE` on the next clock edge. The only output port is `DataOut`, which outputs the current data stored in the register. Internally, `DataOut` is defined as a register with a width governed by the `WIDTH` parameter and serves the dual purpose of holding data and being resettable under specific conditions. Within the code, the primary operational logic is encapsulated in an always block triggered by the positive edge of `Clk` or a positive edge of `Reset`. This block prioritizes the asynchronous and synchronous reset conditions before handling data writing when the `Write` signal is active, following the synchronous nature of typical digital hardware designs. This setup ensures that data integrity and deterministic reset behavior are maintained under various operating conditions.",

The module serves to hold and update data based on certain control signals. It has inputs for data (`DataIn`), a write enable signal (`Write`), a system clock (`Clk`), and reset signals (`Reset` and `SyncReset`). The output is `DataOut`, which mirrors input `DataIn` when the `Write` signal is active, ensuring data is written only on positive clock edges. The module includes reset functionality where the content of `DataOut` can be set to a defined `RESET_VALUE` either asynchronously through the `Reset` signal or synchronously through the `SyncReset` signal. These reset conditions override the write capability to ensure reliable reset behavior in varying circumstances."

Data is written on the rising edge of this clock signal.\n- `Reset`: An asynchronous reset control signal that, when set to high, will reset the output register `DataOut` to a predefined `RESET_VALUE` irrespective of the clock signal.\n- `SyncReset`: A synchronous reset control signal that resets the `DataOut` register to the `RESET_VALUE` on the next positive edge of the clock signal when this signal is set to high.\n\nOutput ports: [DataOut].\nExplanation: \n- `DataOut`: This is the output port of the module and holds the data value currently stored in the register.
