Module name: cmd_gen. Module specification: The cmd_gen module is a command generator for memory interface applications, designed to generate address, instruction, and burst length commands for memory operations. It supports various addressing modes (BRAM, fixed, PRBS, sequential), instruction modes, and burst length modes, capable of generating different command patterns (PRBS, fixed, BRAM) based on configuration parameters. The module takes inputs such as clk_i, rst_i, run_traffic_i, rd_buff_avail_i, and various configuration signals, and outputs addr_o, instr_o, bl_o, and cmd_o_vld. Internal signals like addr_counts, prbs_addr, and instr_out are used for address generation and command formation. The module is divided into sections for address generation, instruction generation, burst length determination, and pipeline control. It includes features for different FPGA
