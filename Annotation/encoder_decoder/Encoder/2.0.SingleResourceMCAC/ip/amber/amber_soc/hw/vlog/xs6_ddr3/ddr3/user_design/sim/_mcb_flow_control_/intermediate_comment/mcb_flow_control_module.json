    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mcb_flow_control' module orchestrates command and data flow control to an external memory controller block using a structured state machine design. It processes command validity, memory address, and data path readiness through various states like READY, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT, and REFRESH_ST. Based on these inputs, it outputs new command readiness, commands, addresses, burst lengths, and data validations. Transition logic and synchronization are managed by purpose-built internal signals and registered conditions, reflecting system demands and configuration specifics, such as SPARTAN6 compatibility."
