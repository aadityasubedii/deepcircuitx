Module name: a23_cache. Module specification: The a23_cache module implements a configurable cache memory system for a processor, likely part of the Amber 23 series. It supports multiple cache lines, configurable words per line, and multiple associativity levels (ways). The module handles data storage, retrieval, exclusive access checks, write and read operations, cache flushing, and refill operations from backing memory. It interfaces with the core CPU and a bus (possibly Wishbone) for data transactions. Key input ports include clock, select, exclusive access, write data, address, and cache control signals. Output ports provide read data, stall signals, and bus requests. Internal signals manage cache state, way selection, tag and data operations, and various control flags. The module is organized into sections for state management, RAM instantiation for tags and data, hit detection, way selection logic, and read/write handling. It employs techniques like
