Module name: a25_icache. Module specification: The a25_icache module implements an instruction cache for the Amber 25 (A25) core architecture. It features a configurable multi-way associative cache with parameters for cache size, ways, and addressing dimensions. The module handles cache operations including flushing, data fetching, and managing cache hits and misses. It has input ports for clock (i_clk), core stall (i_core_stall), address selection (i_select), current and next addresses (i_address, i_address_nxt), cache enable and flush controls (i_cache_enable, i_cache_flush), and write-back data (i_wb_read_data, i_wb_ready). Output ports include stall signal (o_stall), read data (o_read_data), and write-back request (o_wb_req).
