It interacts with both an instruction cache and external memory. The module decides whether to fetch instructions from the cache or external memory based on inputs like the instruction address, cache configuration, and stall conditions. It outputs the fetched instruction as well as the fetch stall signal and memory bus requests as needed. The module also handles cacheable areas and waits for data from memory when the cache or memory is not immediately ready, hence managing different stall conditions to ensure correct timing and operation of fetching instructions."
