It supports multiple cache ways (configurable as 2, 3, 4, or 8) and handles read/write operations, cache hits/misses, and cache line fills. The module manages cache state transitions, tag comparisons, and data storage/retrieval. It also includes features for exclusive access and cache flushing. The cache is designed to improve memory access performance by providing faster access to frequently used data."
