    "spec": "Module name: cmd_prbs_gen. \nModule specification: The 'cmd_prbs_gen' module generates pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) primarily for applications such as addresses or instructions generation. The module is parameterizable allowing various configurations for PRBS type, width, and seed initialization. It utilizes input ports 'clk_i' for clock signals, 'prbs_seed_init' for initializing the seed value, 'clk_en' for enabling the clock, and 'prbs_seed_i' for input seed values which control the sequence generation. The single output 'prbs_o' provides the generated PRBS. Internally, the module features 'ZEROS' a zero-width signal for specific PRBS modes, 'prbs' holds the PRBS value, and 'lfsr_q' functions as the linear feedback shift register (LFSR) manipulating sequence generation. The Verilog code structurally contains generate blocks accommodating configurations like 64-bit, 32-bit address, or instruction-length modes each with specific LFSR configurations influenced by parameters such as 'FAMILY', 'PRBS_CMD', etc. Each block has specific conditions for PRBS generation and adaptation such as exclusive-or operations for feedback and logical operations for masking conditions. This modular design allows extensive flexibility and customization, adapting to different specific hardware requirements and scenarios.",

The module is parameterizable allowing various configurations for PRBS type, width, and seed initialization. It utilizes input ports 'clk_i' for clock signals, 'prbs_seed_init' for initializing the seed value, 'clk_en' for enabling the clock, and 'prbs_seed_i' for input seed values which control the sequence generation. The single output 'prbs_o' provides the generated PRBS. Internally, the module features 'ZEROS' a zero-width signal for specific PRBS modes, 'prbs' holds the PRBS value, and 'lfsr_q' functions as the linear feedback shift register (LFSR) manipulating sequence generation. The Verilog code structurally contains generate blocks accommodating configurations like 64-bit, 32-bit address, or instruction-length modes each with specific LFSR configurations influenced by parameters such as 'FAMILY', 'PRBS_CMD', etc. Each block has specific conditions for PRBS generation and adaptation such as exclusive-or operations for feedback and logical operations for masking conditions. This modular design allows extensive flexibility and customization, adapting to different specific hardware requirements and scenarios."
