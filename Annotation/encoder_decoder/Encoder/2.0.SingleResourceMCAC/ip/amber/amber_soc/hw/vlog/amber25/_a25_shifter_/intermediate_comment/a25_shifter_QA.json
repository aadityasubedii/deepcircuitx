It supports four types of shifts\u2014logical shift left (LSL), logical shift right (LSR), arithmetic shift right (ASR), and rotate right (ROR). The shift result is output through o_out, and any carry-out is output through o_carry_out. The module can operate in two modes determined by the FULL_BARREL parameter: full barrel for detailed shift operations up to 32 bits, and a reduced mode for quicker shifts with limited functionality. The module adapts its behavior dynamically based on the shift function and amount to either preserve the sign bit (in ASR), adjust for end-around carry (in ROR), or shift zeros into the vacated bit positions (in LSL and LSR)."

Depending on the type of shift function selected, different transformations are applied to this data.\n- ```i_carry_in```: This input is used as a bit input in certain shifting conditions, acting as an additional input bit that can affect the outcome when shifts result in bits being carried out.\n- ```i_shift_amount```: This 8-bit input specifies how many positions the input data (i_in) should be shifted.\n- ```i_shift_imm_zero```: This is a control signal used to determine if the shift amount is effectively zero, influencing certain behaviors in shift calculations and optimizations.\n- ```i_function```: This 2-bit input selects which type of shift operation to perform\u2014logical left, logical right, arithmetic right, or rotate right.\n\nOutput ports: ```o_out, o_carry_out```.\nExplanation:\n- ```o_out```: This 32-bit output is the result of the shift operation performed on the input data (i_in), accordingly modified based on the shift amount (i_shift_amount) and the specific function selected (i_function).\n- ```o_carry_out```: This output signals if there was a carry during the shift operation.

Depending on the shift amount, it rearranges bits from the input `i_in`, shifting them left and filling vacated positions with zeros.\n- `lsr_out`: This signal (33 bits) holds the result of the logical shift right (LSR) operation. It shifts the bits of `i_in` to the right according to the shift amount. Bits that pass beyond the least significant bit boundary are carried to the carry-out, and zeros are filled in from the left.\n- `asr_out`: This signal (33 bits) stores the output of the arithmetic shift right (ASR) operation. Similar to `lsr_out`, but instead of filling with zeros, the vacated positions on the left are filled with the sign bit of `i_in` to preserve the number's sign.\n- `ror_out`: This signal (33 bits) is used to hold the result of the rotate-right (ROR) operation. It rotates the bits of `i_in` rightward, wrapping the shifted bits around to the most significant bit position, effectively creating a circular shift. The bit shifted out from the least significant position can influence the carry out."
