    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements control and status registers for an Ethernet MAC interface. It manages configuration settings, interrupt handling, and MII operations through address-based read/write operations. The module uses multiple instances of eth_register for data storage, implements clock domain crossing for interrupt signals, and provides outputs for MAC control. It handles various Ethernet parameters including flow control, frame padding, and MAC address filtering."
