    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"eth_txethmac\" module manages Ethernet MAC transmission processes including frame padding, CRC computation, and collision detection and handling. Using a combination of internal state machines (\"eth_txstatem\"), counters (\"eth_txcounters\"), and dedicated CRC computation (\"eth_crc\"), it orchestrates sending Ethernet frames while dynamically adjusting to network conditions and ensuring data integrity. This modular design together with a strategic mix of sequential and combinational logic ensures robust and efficient frame transmission over Ethernet."
