    "module": "Module-level comment: This module generates memory interface commands (address, instruction, burst length) for various FPGA families. It supports multiple addressing modes (BRAM, fixed, PRBS, sequential), instruction types, and burst lengths. The module uses PRBS generators, counters, and state machines to create diverse command patterns. It manages refresh commands, handles read/write operations based on buffer availability, and outputs commands through a pipeline structure for flexible timing and synchronization with other system components."
