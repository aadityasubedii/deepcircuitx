Module-level comment: The 'eth_cop' module acts as a controller in WISHBONE bus architectures, managing transactions between two masters (m1, m2) and two slaves (s1, s2). It routes signals for addresses, data, and control based on transaction requests, acknowledging sessions, and handling errors. Internally, it employs state-tracking signals, conditional processing blocks, and error monitoring to ensure efficient and reliable bus management.
