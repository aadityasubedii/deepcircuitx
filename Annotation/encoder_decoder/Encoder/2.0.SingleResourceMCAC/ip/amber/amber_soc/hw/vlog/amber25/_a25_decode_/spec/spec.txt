Module name: a25_decode. Module specification: This module implements the instruction decode stage of an ARM processor. It takes fetched instructions as input and generates control signals for other parts of the processor. The module decodes various instruction types, handles interrupts, and manages the processor's state machine. Key input ports include clock (i_clk), reset (i_reset), fetched instruction (i_fetch_instruction), and status signals (e.g., i_irq, i_firq, i_dabt). Output ports include decoded control signals for ALU operations, register selection, memory accesses, and status bit updates. Internal signals are used for instruction parsing, state management, and conflict detection. The module is organized into several blocks, including instruction decoding logic, control state machine, interrupt handling, and various execution units for different instruction types (e.g., data processing, memory transfers, multiplication). It supports conditional execution, different operating modes,
