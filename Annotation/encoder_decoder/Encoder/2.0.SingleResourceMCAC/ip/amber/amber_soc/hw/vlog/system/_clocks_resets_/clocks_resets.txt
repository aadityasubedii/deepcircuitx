Module-level comment: The 'clocks_resets' module manages clock and reset signals for FPGA systems, particularly the Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6. It utilizes differential clock inputs and a system reset signal to produce a main system clock and an additional 200 MHz clock. Internally, it incorporates PLL (Phase Locked Loop) or MMCM (Mixed-Mode Clock Manager) for clock generation regulated by FPGA type, and synchronizes resets and DDR calibration states using shift registers and conditional logic, ensuring stable and effective clock and reset operations across varying configurations.
