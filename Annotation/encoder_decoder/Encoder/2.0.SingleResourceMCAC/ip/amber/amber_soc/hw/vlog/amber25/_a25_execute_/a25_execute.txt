/*
 * a25_execute: Execution stage of an ARM-like processor pipeline.
 * Processes instructions, performs ALU and multiply operations,
 * manages data/instruction addressing, and updates processor state.
 * Implements conditional execution, barrel shifting, and register
 * bank operations. Handles interrupts, privileged modes, and
 * coprocessor interactions. Uses combinational logic for next-state
 * calculations and sequential logic for state updates.
