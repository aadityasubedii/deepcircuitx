    "spec": "Module name: tg_status. \n\nModule specification: The 'tg_status' module is designed to function as an error detection and status reporting component within larger systems. It monitors a data error input (`data_error_i`) and compares incoming data signals (`cmp_data_i` and `rd_data_i`) to detect mismatches. This module uses a clock input (`clk_i`) for synchronization, a reset input (`rst_i`) for clearing internal states, and a manual clear input (`manual_clear_error`) for manually clearing error states. The operations related to memory control are indicated through signals like memory controller command full (`mcb_cmd_full_i`), write full (`mcb_wr_full_i`), and read empty (`mcb_rd_empty_i`). The outputs of the module include an error status register (`error_status`) that logs detailed error-related data and an error output signal (`error`) that indicates an active error condition. Internally, the module uses two signals: `data_error_r` for delaying the error input signal by one clock cycle to detect rising edge events, and `error_set` as a flag to indicate and manage the active error state. The Verilog code is structured into blocks handling the error detection based on input conditions, resetting error states, and updating the error status register with relevant details such as error data, address, and command queue statuses. This organized approach ensures proper error logging and status reporting essential for diagnostic and operational purposes in systems relying on precise data handling and memory management.",

It operates by monitoring the incoming data error signal (`data_error_i`) relative to a given test condition or comparison (`cmp_data_i` and `rd_data_i`). If an error condition (change in the `data_error_i` without a prior error being set) is detected just after a rising clock edge and no reset (`rst_i`) or manual clear signal (`manual_clear_error`) is active, it captures and records various information including the error data, address, command full indicators, and additional details to `error_status`. In this context, the `error_status` is augmented to show comprehensive error details split into distinct fields for diagnostics. The module emits an `error` output when such conditions are met to indicate an active error status. This could help in identifying discrepancies during operations, especially in a memory testing or data comparison scenario."

It synchronizes the operations of the module, ensuring the logic updates occur at each clock edge.\n- **rst_i**: Reset input. It is used to reset the internal states of the module to their default values, clearing any error states or statuses.\n- **manual_clear_error**: Manual error clear input. When active, it clears the current error state manually, regardless of other conditions.\n- **data_error_i**: Data error input. Indicates when there is a mismatch or any error in the data being monitored or tested.\n- **cmp_data_i**: Comparison data input. This is a reference data used to compare against `rd_data_i` to detect any discrepancies.\n- **rd_data_i**: Read data input. The data read from a source which is to be compared against `cmp_data_i` for errors.\n- **cmp_addr_i**: Comparison address input. It holds the address corresponding to the current data comparison, captured when an error occurs.\n- **cmp_bl_i**: Comparison burst length input. Indicates the burst length during operations, captured when an error occurs.\n- **mcb_cmd_full_i**: Memory controller command full input. Indicates if the command queue of the memory controller is full.\n- **mcb_wr_full_i**: Memory controller write full input. Indicates if the write queue of the memory controller is full.\n- **mcb_rd_empty_i**: Memory controller read empty input. Shows whether the read data queue of the memory controller is empty.\n\nOutput Ports:\n- `error_status`, `error`.\n\nExplanation:\n- **error_status**: Error status output as a register. It logs detailed error-related data such as the error data, error address, comparison burst length, and the full/empty status of various memory controller queues. This register is large, holding bits for address, data comparison results, and status flags.\n- **error**: Error output signal. A binary flag that indicates whether an error has been detected and logged. This signal becomes active if the error detection conditions are met and helps in external handling or response to the error condition."

It delays the error input signal by one clock cycle to detect rising edge events such as when `data_error_i` transitions from 0 to 1 without an error already being set, which helps in capturing the onset of a new error condition.\n- **error_set**: This signal is a flag used to indicate whether an error has been detected and is currently active within the module. Once set, this flag remains high until either a reset (`rst_i`) is applied or the `manual_clear_error` input is activated. Its primary role is to prevent repetitive error logging by ensuring that once an error is registered, subsequent errors are ignored until a reset or a clear command is issued."
