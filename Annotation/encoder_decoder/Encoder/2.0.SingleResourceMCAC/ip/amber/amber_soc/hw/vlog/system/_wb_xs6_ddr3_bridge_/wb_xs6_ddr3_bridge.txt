Module-level comment: The `wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge` module facilitates communication between a Wishbone bus and a DDR3 memory controller, managing address translation, data buffering, and command sequencing. It handles read and write operations using input conditions and internal flags to queue commands and buffer data when necessary, respecting DDR3 timing needs. The module differentiates processing based on bus data width settings, ensuring compatibility and efficient memory operations.
