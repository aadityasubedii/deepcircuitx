It supports read\n * and write operations with byte-level granularity. The module uses four 2048x8-bit\n * SRAM blocks, each handling one byte of the 32-bit data. Write operations are\n * controlled by both write enable and byte enable signals, allowing selective\n * writing to individual bytes within a 32-bit word.\n */"
