It utilizes input signals such as operation codes, control register values, and fault details to output control responses like cache enable signals, flush commands, and mappings of cacheable, updateable, and disruptive areas. The module operates only when there isn't a fetch stall, ensuring synchronization with the CPU's fetching sequence. It also dynamically updates and outputs coprocessor data based on incoming configuration and fault information.
