Module name: a25_register_bank.

Module specification: The `a25_register_bank` module is designed to manage the register sets across different processor modes including User, Supervisor, IRQ, and FIQ in an ARM architecture-based processor. The module handles the reading and writing of register values, updating the program counter, and switching between different register contexts based on execution modes. It utilizes input ports such as `i_clk` for the clock signal, various mode indicators (`i_mode_idec`, `i_mode_exec`), select signals for registers (`i_rm_sel`, `i_rs_sel`, `i_rn_sel`), and write enable signals (`i_pc_wen`, `i_reg_bank_wen`). The output ports include the outputs of the selected general registers (`o_rm`, `o_rs`, `o_rd`, `o_rn`) and the program counter (`o_pc`). Internal signals such as `usr_idec`, `firq_exec` manage condition checks for mode states, and `pc_wen_c`, `reg_bank_wen_c` facilitate conditional register and program counter updates to manage stalls effectively. The code is structured into sections handling initial definitions and inclusive files, signal assignments for decoding and execution conditions, always blocks to update registers and program counters based on write enables, and `assign` statements for output based on the selection inputs, providing full control and flexibility over the processor's operational functioning associated with register handling.
