Module name: mcb_soft_calibration_top.

Module specification: The 'mcb_soft_calibration_top' module is designed for conducting both software-based and hardware-level calibration for various types of DDR memory in a memory controller block configuration. It interfaces with external calibration mechanisms using input ports such as UI_CLK (User Interface Clock), RST (Reset), IOCLK (I/O Clock), PLL_LOCK (PLL lock status), and several memory controller-specific signals like MCB_UOSDO (Memory Controller Block User Output Serial Data Out) and MCB_UO_CAL_START (Start calibration signal from Memory Controller Block), among others. On the output side, it manages calibration completion signals (e.g., DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL), self-refresh signals (SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ, SELFREFRESH_MODE), and data/command interfacing signals to the memory controller (e.g., MCB_UIADD, MCB_UICMD). Internal signals such as IODRP_ADD (address for DRP) and RZQ_IODRP_SDO (Serial Data Output for RZQ calibration) facilitate memory calibration through dynamic reconfiguration and impedance adjustments. The code includes blocks for interfacing with bidirectional impedance pins (RZQ_Pin and ZIO_Pin) and DDR parameter-dependent calibration, governed by SKIP settings. These components work together within the module to ensure robust calibration and optimal operation of memory systems in various usage scenarios, ensuring stability and performance of the memory controller.
