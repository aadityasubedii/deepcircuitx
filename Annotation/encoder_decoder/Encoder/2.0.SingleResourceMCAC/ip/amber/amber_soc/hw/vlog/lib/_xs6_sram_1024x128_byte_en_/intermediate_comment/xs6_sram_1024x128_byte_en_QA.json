It uses 8 RAMB16BWER blocks from a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA to create the memory. The module supports read and write operations with a 128-bit data width and 10-bit address space. It also includes byte-enable controls for selective writing of individual bytes within the 128-bit word. The memory is split into two banks, each containing 512 entries, controlled by the most significant address bit. The module allows for initialization of the memory contents through parameters."
