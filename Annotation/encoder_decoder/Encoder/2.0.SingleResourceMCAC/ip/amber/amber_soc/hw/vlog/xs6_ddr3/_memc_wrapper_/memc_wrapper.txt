Module-level comment: 
/*
 * This module implements a wrapper for a DDR3 SDRAM memory controller interface.
 * It provides multiple ports (p0-p5) for command, write, and read operations,
 * and supports AXI interfaces (s0-s5) for advanced system integration.
 * The module handles memory timing, calibration, and various controller settings.
 * It interfaces with external DDR3 SDRAM and manages data transfer between
 * the system and memory, including clock management and status reporting.
