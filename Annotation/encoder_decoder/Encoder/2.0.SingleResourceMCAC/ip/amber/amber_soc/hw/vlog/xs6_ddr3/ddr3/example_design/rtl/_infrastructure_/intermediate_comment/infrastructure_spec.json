Module specification: The 'infrastructure' module is designed for clock signal management and reset synchronization in FPGA-based systems, supporting both differential and single-ended clock inputs. It includes input ports such as sys_clk_p and sys_clk_n for differential clock inputs, sys_clk for single-ended input, and sys_rst_i for system reset input. The output ports include clk0 (general system clock), rst0 (synchronized reset output), async_rst (asynchronous reset), sysclk_2x and sysclk_2x_180 (higher frequency clocks), mcb_drp_clk (MCB clock), pll_ce_0 and pll_ce_90 (control signals for serializer/deserializer), and pll_lock (PLL lock status). Internal signals such as clk_2x_0, clk_2x_180, and others are used for various functions like clock buffering, feedback for PLL, and status monitoring. Key blocks of the code handle differential and single-ended input configurations, PLL configuration for clock generation following specified multipliers and dividers, clock buffering for stability, and reset management that includes the use of synchronous and asynchronous methods to assure proper system initialization and operation stability.",

Module specification: The 'infrastructure' module is designed for clock signal management and reset synchronization in FPGA-based systems, supporting both differential and single-ended clock inputs. It includes input ports such as sys_clk_p and sys_clk_n for differential clock inputs, sys_clk for single-ended input, and sys_rst_i for system reset input. The output ports include clk0 (general system clock), rst0 (synchronized reset output), async_rst (asynchronous reset), sysclk_2x and sysclk_2x_180 (higher frequency clocks), mcb_drp_clk (MCB clock), pll_ce_0 and pll_ce_90 (control signals for serializer/deserializer), and pll_lock (PLL lock status). Internal signals such as clk_2x_0, clk_2x_180, and others are used for various functions like clock buffering, feedback for PLL, and status monitoring. Key blocks of the code handle differential and single-ended input configurations, PLL configuration for clock generation following specified multipliers and dividers, clock buffering for stability, and reset management that includes the use of synchronous and asynchronous methods to assure proper system initialization and operation stability."
