Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: This module serves as a top-level interface for a memory controller block (MCB) with support for multiple AXI and UI (User Interface) ports. It integrates various sub-modules including mcb_raw_wrapper and axi_mcb instances for different ports. The module handles clock management, AXI interface translation, and arbitration between multiple ports accessing the memory. It supports up to six ports, each with its own set of input and output signals for command, write, and read operations. The module also includes AXI interface signals for up to six AXI ports. Internal signals are used to connect the mcb_raw_wrapper instance with the axi_mcb instances for each port. The module manages clock signals, including sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, pll_ce_0, and pll_ce_90
