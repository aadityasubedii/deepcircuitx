Module name: dumpvcd. Module specification: The `dumpvcd` module is specifically tailored for debugging purposes within the AMBER processor simulation environment by enabling the dumping of Value Change Dump (VCD) files, which are pivotal for monitoring the state and signal values over certain simulation periods. There are no input or output ports in this module; instead, it functions based on internally handled conditions using global variables and signals. Key internal signals include `clk_count` from the `U_DECOMPILE` submodule for tracking simulation time, and various control and data signals from the `U_EXECUTE` submodule like `o_write_enable`, `o_write_data`, and register values (`r0-r15`) which are crucial for detailed state tracking during VCD file generation. The code within the module is encapsulated in conditionally compiled blocks (`AMBER_DUMP_VCD` directive), including initialization to set up VCD file paths and control directives, dumping of variables associated with several submodules (`U_EXECUTE`, `U_DECOMPILE`, etc.), and always blocks to handle the dump on/off timing based on the `clk_count`. This conditionally activates VCD data capture for a preconfigured interval and allows for optional automatic test termination based on simulation tick count (`AMBER_TERMINATE` directive).
