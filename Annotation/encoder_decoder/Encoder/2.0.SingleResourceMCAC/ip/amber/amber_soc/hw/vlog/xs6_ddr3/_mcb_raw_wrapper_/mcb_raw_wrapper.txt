Module-level comment: This module implements a Memory Controller Block (MCB) wrapper for interfacing with various DDR memory types. It manages low-level signaling, timing, and I/O operations for memory transactions. The module uses IODRP2 components for I/O configuration, implements address mapping logic, and supports multiple port configurations. It handles clock management, calibration, and self-refresh operations, providing a flexible interface for different memory types and configurations in FPGA designs.
