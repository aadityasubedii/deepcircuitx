    "spec": "Module name: boot_mem128.  \nModule specification: The `boot_mem128` module is a memory interface designed for read and write operations through the Wishbone bus protocol with parameterization for data width, select width, and memory address width. It supports robust data transfer and timing control through the use of synchronization and acknowledgment signals tailored for various FPGA targets. The primary input ports include `i_wb_clk` for the clock signal, `i_wb_adr` for the memory address, `i_wb_sel` for active byte selection, `i_wb_we` for write enable, `i_wb_dat` for input data, `i_wb_cyc` indicating a bus cycle, and `i_wb_stb` for strobe signaling. The outputs are `o_wb_dat` carrying the data read from memory, `o_wb_ack` for operation acknowledgment, and `o_wb_err` signaling errors. Internally, the module utilizes signals like `start_write` and `start_read` to initiate memory operations, `read_data` and `write_data` for handling data, `byte_enable` derived from `i_wb_sel`, `address` computed from `i_wb_adr`, and operational debugging signals like `jitter_r` and `start_read_r`. The code integrates conditional compilation blocks for debug modes and specific FPGA targets management, alongside memory component instantiation for data storage and retrieval, effectively partitioned to work under different configurations and optional parameter files for extended flexibility.",

It is asserted when the strobe (`i_wb_stb`), write enable (`i_wb_we`) signals are active, and there is no ongoing read operation (`start_read_r` is inactive).\n- start_read: This signal is used to initiate a read operation from the memory.

This data is output to `o_wb_dat` during a read operation.\n- write_data: Holds the data to be written into the memory, sourced from the input `i_wb_dat`.\n- byte_enable: A signal derived from `i_wb_sel` which specifies which bytes in the data bus are active and should be written to or read from.\n- address: Calculated from the input address `i_wb_adr`, scaling it down to the memory address width by adjusting its bits as required for memory addressing.\n- jitter_r: A specialized register used in debug mode to generate a pseudo-random sequence, affecting the acknowledgment behavior (`o_wb_ack`) to help in stress testing and debug scenarios.\n- start_read_r: A register or set of registers (depending on debug mode) that keeps track of the state of read operations to control the sequences and timings of the read acknowledgments, ensuring they are aligned with the clock cycles and operational requirements."
