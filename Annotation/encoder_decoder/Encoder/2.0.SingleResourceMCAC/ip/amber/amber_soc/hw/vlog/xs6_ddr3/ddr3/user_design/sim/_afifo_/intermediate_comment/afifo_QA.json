It is designed to handle data buffering between two different clock domains, specifically handling writes on a 'wr_clk' and reads on a 'rd_clk'. The FIFO uses gray code counters to manage read and write pointers, which helps to safely handle the asynchronous nature of the read and write processes. It includes controls for checking when the FIFO is full, empty, or almost full. The FIFO accepts input data ('wr_data') on write operations enabled by 'wr_en', and outputs data ('rd_data') on read operations enabled by 'rd_en'. The module also integrates safety mechanisms to avoid race conditions through synchronization blocks controlled by the 'SYNC' parameter."

Used to clock all write operations into the FIFO.\n- `rst`: Reset input. When asserted, it initializes or resets the FIFO state.\n- `wr_en`: Write enable signal. When high, it allows data on the `wr_data` bus to be written into the FIFO.\n- `wr_data`: Write data bus. Holds the data to be written into the FIFO when `wr_en` is asserted.\n- `rd_en`: Read enable signal. When high, it allows data to be read from the FIFO.\n- `rd_clk`: Read clock input. Used to clock all read operations from the FIFO.\n\nOutput ports: [rd_data, full, empty, almost_full].\nExplanation: \n- `rd_data`: Read data bus. Outputs the data read from the FIFO when `rd_en` is asserted.\n- `full`: Indicates that the FIFO is full and cannot accept more data. It is high when FIFO reaches its maximum storage capacity.\n- `empty`: Indicates that the FIFO is empty and contains no data to read. It is high when there are no valid data entries inside the FIFO.\n- `almost_full`: Signals that the FIFO is almost full.
