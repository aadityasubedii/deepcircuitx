Module-level comment: The `test_module` interfaces with a system bus for diagnostics and testing, featuring UART control, timers for interrupts, a pseudo-random number generator, and memory control. It utilizes Wishbone signals for operations, managing data transfers, interrupts, and conditional outputs based on clock cycles. Internal logic is controlled via registers and sequencing to handle data flow and system responses efficiently, supporting flexible bus widths and configurations.
