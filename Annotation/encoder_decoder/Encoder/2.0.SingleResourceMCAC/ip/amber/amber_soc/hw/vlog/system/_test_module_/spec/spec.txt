Module name: test_module. Module specification: The `test_module` is a Verilog module tailored for diagnostics and testing within systems interfacing via a Wishbone bus. This configurable module manages tasks like serial communication through UART, interrupt generation via timers, pseudo-random number generation, and basic memory control, adaptable through parameters `WB_DWIDTH` and `WB_SWIDTH` for bus width settings. It incorporates input ports such as `i_clk` for clock signals, `i_wb_adr` for address bus, `i_wb_sel` for byte selection, `i_wb_we` for write enable, `i_wb_dat` for input data, `i_wb_cyc` signifying an active bus cycle, and `i_wb_stb` indicating data transfer. The output ports include `o_irq` for standard interrupts, `o_firq` for fast interrupts, `o_mem_ctrl` indicating memory control status, `o_wb_dat` for data bus output, `o_wb_ack` for operation acknowledge, `o_wb_err` for error flagging, `o_led` for LED control, and `o_phy_rst_n` managing a physical reset signal. Internal signals such as `firq_timer` and `irq_timer` handle interrupt timing, `random_num` generates random values, and other registers like `tb_uart_txd_reg`, `mem_ctrl_reg`, and `led_reg` manage UART data, memory, and LED status respectively. The code structure contains conditional hardware configurations for different bus widths, read and write operations handling through case statements, and sequential elements tied to the rising edge of the clock input. This module effectively supports multiple diagnostic and control operations for systems utilizing a Wishbone bus interface.
