Module-level comment: // This a25_core module implements a CPU core with Wishbone bus interface.
// It includes fetch, decode, execute, memory, and write-back stages,
// handles interrupts, and interfaces with a coprocessor.
// The core uses internal pipelining and control signals to manage
// instruction flow, memory access, and data processing, supporting
// various CPU operations and system interactions.
