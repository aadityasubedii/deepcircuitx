Module name: example_top. Module specification: This module serves as a top-level wrapper for a DDR3 memory controller interface, instantiating a memory controller (memc3_wrapper_inst) and a testbench (memc3_tb_top_inst) to verify the controller's functionality. It features input ports for system clock (c3_sys_clk) and reset (c3_sys_rst_i), and output ports for various DDR3 memory interface signals, including address (mcb3_dram_a), bank address (mcb3_dram_ba), control signals (mcb3_dram_ras_n, mcb3_dram_cas_n, mcb3_dram_we_n), and data lines (mcb3_dram_dq). The module also includes bidirectional ports for data strobe signals (mcb3
