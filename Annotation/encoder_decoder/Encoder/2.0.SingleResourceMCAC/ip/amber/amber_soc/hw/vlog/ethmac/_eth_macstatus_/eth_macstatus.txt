Module-level comment: The `eth_macstatus` module manages status signals for Ethernet packet transmission and reception. It integrates input signals like errors, state transitions, and byte counts, processing through internal signal handling and state latching. Various blocks manage error detection, state update protocols, and status flag control, resulting in accurate transmission and reception statuses essential for MAC layer operations in network communications.
