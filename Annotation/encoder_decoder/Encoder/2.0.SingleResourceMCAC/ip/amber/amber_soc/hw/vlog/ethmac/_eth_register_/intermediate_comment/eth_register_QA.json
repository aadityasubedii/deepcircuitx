The module serves to hold and update data based on certain control signals. It has inputs for data (`DataIn`), a write enable signal (`Write`), a system clock (`Clk`), and reset signals (`Reset` and `SyncReset`). The output is `DataOut`, which mirrors input `DataIn` when the `Write` signal is active, ensuring data is written only on positive clock edges. The module includes reset functionality where the content of `DataOut` can be set to a defined `RESET_VALUE` either asynchronously through the `Reset` signal or synchronously through the `SyncReset` signal. These reset conditions override the write capability to ensure reliable reset behavior in varying circumstances."

Data is written on the rising edge of this clock signal.\n- `Reset`: An asynchronous reset control signal that, when set to high, will reset the output register `DataOut` to a predefined `RESET_VALUE` irrespective of the clock signal.\n- `SyncReset`: A synchronous reset control signal that resets the `DataOut` register to the `RESET_VALUE` on the next positive edge of the clock signal when this signal is set to high.\n\nOutput ports: [DataOut].\nExplanation: \n- `DataOut`: This is the output port of the module and holds the data value currently stored in the register.

It outputs the value based on the input `DataIn` when the `Write` signal is active and the `Clk` (clock) signal has a positive edge.
