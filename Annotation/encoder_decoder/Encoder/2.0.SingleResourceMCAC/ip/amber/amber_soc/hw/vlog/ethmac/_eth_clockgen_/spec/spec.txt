Module name: eth_clockgen.  
Module specification: The `eth_clockgen` module is designed to generate a management data clock (Mdc) for Ethernet hardware management, operating based on a clock division principle which is set through an input `Divider`. The module takes three inputs: `Clk`, which acts as the main timing reference; `Reset`, which resets internal states and outputs; and `Divider`, an 8-bit input defining the frequency division for Mdc. Outputs from this module include `Mdc`, the management data clock; `MdcEn`, a signal active when Mdc is low and the internal count is zero; and `MdcEn_n`, which is active when Mdc is high under the same counter condition. Internally, the module uses several signals such as `CountEq0` to determine if the internal counter `Counter` has reached zero, `CounterPreset` which holds the preset value for the `Counter` derived from the adjusted Divider input through `TempDivider`, and `TempDivider` which ensures the frequency of Mdc is half or less than the input Divider value. The code includes conditional blocks for managing the reset state and for toggling Mdc and updating Counter based on the clock edge and reset conditions. These blocks effectively manage the calculations and updates required for generating the correct clock signals and associated enable lines based on the current counter and divider settings.
