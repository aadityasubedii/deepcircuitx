    "module": "Module-level comment: The a25_alu module serves as an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of executing various arithmetic and logical functions, including addition, AND, OR, XOR, and data extension operations. It operates on two 32-bit inputs, utilizing 9 control bits from `i_function` for operation selection and operand handling (swap, NOT). Resultant outputs are a 32-bit operational result and a 4-bit flag status. Internally, it utilizes conditional compilation for FPGA optimizations and incorporates standard and conditional constructs to determine operation results and flags efficiently."
