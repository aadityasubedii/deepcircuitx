    "module": "Module-level comment: The `tb_uart` module simulates a UART interface for testing transmission and reception of serial data. It manages UART protocol operations using input control signals for data readiness (`i_uart_cts_n`, `i_uart_rxd`) and output control signals for transmission status (`o_uart_txd`, `o_uart_rts_n`). The module features are driven by internal machineries for clock handling, states monitoring, bit counting, and FIFO management for data buffering, ensuring a comprehensive testing environment for UART-based designs."
