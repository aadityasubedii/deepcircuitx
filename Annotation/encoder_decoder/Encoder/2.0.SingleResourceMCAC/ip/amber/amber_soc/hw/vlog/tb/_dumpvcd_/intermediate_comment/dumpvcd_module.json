    "module": "Module-level comment: The `dumpvcd` module enables debugging by dumping VCD files, crucial for tracing the AMBER processor's states during simulation. It utilizes no I/O ports but operationalizes through internal signals and various submodule variable dumps. The setup and control of dumping are managed within conditionally compiled blocks, dynamically engaging data capture based on the simulation tick count and predefined intervals."
