Module name: iodrp_mcb_controller.

Module specification:
The 'iodrp_mcb_controller' is a Verilog module developed for interfacing with memory using a Dynamic Reconfigurable Port (DRP), capable of handling both read and write operations through sequential logical control determined by an internal finite state machine (FSM). The inputs to the module include `memcell_address`, an 8-bit address of the memory cell; `write_data`, an 8-bit data for writing; `rd_not_write`, a control signal dictating the operation type; `cmd_valid`, a signal to execute commands; `use_broadcast` controlling the broadcast mode; `drp_ioi_addr` for DRP addressing; `sync_rst` for synchronous reset; `DRP_CLK` which is the clock input; and `DRP_SDO`, the DRP's serial data output. The output ports are `read_data`, holding the result of read operations; `rdy_busy_n`, indicating module readiness; `DRP_CS`, `DRP_SDI`, `DRP_ADD`, and `DRP_BKST`, handling various aspects of DRP interfacing and control; and `MCB_UIREAD`, indicating an update and read state in the memory control block. Internal signals such as `memcell_addr_reg`, `data_reg`, and several control and state tracking signals like `bit_cnt` and `state` are used to manage data flow, maintain state information, and sequence operations in sync with the DRP_CLK. The module's code structure is segmented into initialization, state transitions based on FSM, data shifting through tasks, and conditional signal assignments that guide the module through various operational phases from address setting to data handling, regulating the DRP operations effectively through meticulous state management.
