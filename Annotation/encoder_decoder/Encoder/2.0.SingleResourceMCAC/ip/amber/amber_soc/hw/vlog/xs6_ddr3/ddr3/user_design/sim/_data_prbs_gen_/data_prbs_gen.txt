Module-level comment: The "data_prbs_gen" is a pseudo-random binary sequence generator utilizing an LFSR for outputs based on periodic initialization and feedback shifts. Inputs manage clocking and LFSR seeding, while outputs the PRBS stream. Critical components are differential updates handled by triggers on clock edges, enabling flexible testing and initialization configurations.
