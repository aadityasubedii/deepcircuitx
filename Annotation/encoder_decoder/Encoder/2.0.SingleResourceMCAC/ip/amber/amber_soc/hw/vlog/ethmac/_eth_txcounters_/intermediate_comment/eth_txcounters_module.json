    "module": "Module-level comment: The `eth_txcounters` module manages transmission counters for Ethernet frames, tracking byte and nibble counts across various states like preamble, IPG, and data. It uses multiple input signals to identify current states and triggers for resetting or incrementing counters. Outputs provide critical transmission metrics such as byte counts and condition flags. Internally, it relies on stateful logic implemented in synchronous always blocks and combinational assignments, ensuring accurate counter operations in response to state transitions and packet transmission events."
