Module-level comment: The `wb_ddr3_bridge` module acts as an intermediary between Wishbone and DDR3 interfaces, managing read and write operations. It handles address translations, command issuance based on operation type, and synchronizes data transfers. Inputs control commands and data flow based on bus and memory status signals, while internal signal manipulations ensure correct timing and operational sequencing. This module supports conditional compilation for FPGA-specific optimizations, ensuring flexibility across different hardware environments.
