Module name: xilinx_dist_ram_16x32. Module specification: The xilinx_dist_ram_16x32 is a Verilog module that implements a dual-port RAM with 16 addressable locations, each storing a 32-bit word. This module utilizes the Xilinx-specific primitive, RAM16X1D, to construct a 32-bit wide RAM using 32 instances of 16x1 dual-port RAM. Input ports include 'we' (Write Enable), 'wclk' (Write Clock), 'data_in' (32-bit input data), 'write_address' (4-bit address for writing), and 'read_address' (4-bit address for reading). The output port is 'data_out', which outputs the 32-bit data corresponding to the read address. Internal wires 'waddr' and 'raddr' are employed to directly connect the write and read address inputs to the corresponding address ports on each RAM16X1D instance. The module mainly consists of 32 instances of RAM16X1D, each connected to a bit of the input data, output data, and part of both address buses. Each RAM16X1D instance supports simultaneous independent read and write operations to different addresses, enabling efficient and flexible memory operations suitable for high-throughput applications such as data buffering or storage in FPGAs.
