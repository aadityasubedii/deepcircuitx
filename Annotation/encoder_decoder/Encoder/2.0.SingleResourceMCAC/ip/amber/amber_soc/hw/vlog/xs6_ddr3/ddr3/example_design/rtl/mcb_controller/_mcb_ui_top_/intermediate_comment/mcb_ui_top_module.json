    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/*\nThis module implements a Memory Controller Bridge (MCB) interface supporting multiple ports and memory types. It manages memory operations through command scheduling, data read/write handling, and provides both native and AXI interfaces. The module uses a raw MCB wrapper, port-specific interface logic, and clock management circuitry to achieve its functionality. It supports customization via parameters and incorporates arbitration, calibration, and timing management for efficient memory control.\n*/"
