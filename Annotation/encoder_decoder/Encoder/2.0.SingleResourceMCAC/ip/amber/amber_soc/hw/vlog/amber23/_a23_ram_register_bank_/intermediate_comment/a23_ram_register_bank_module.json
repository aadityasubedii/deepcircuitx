    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"a23_ram_register_bank\" module emulates a CPU register bank, handling different execution modes and register operations for an ARM architecture-based processor. It includes inputs for mode selection, program counter updates, and general register data handling. Outputs reflect selected register values. Internally, the module uses address decoding and multiple register banks to manage and output data based on the operation mode. Operations are synchronized with the system clock and can be stalled based on external control. This design facilitates dynamic CPU state management and operation execution."
