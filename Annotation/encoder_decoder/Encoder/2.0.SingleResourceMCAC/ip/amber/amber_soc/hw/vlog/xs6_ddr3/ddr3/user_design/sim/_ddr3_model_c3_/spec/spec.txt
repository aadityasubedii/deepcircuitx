Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM memory device, implementing timing checks, command decoding, and memory read/write operations. It has input ports for clock (ck, ck_n), control signals (cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), addressing (ba, addr), and data (dq, dqs, dqs_n), with output port tdqs_n and bidirectional ports for data mask/termination (dm_tdqs). Internal signals include timing parameters, mode register settings, and various counters for tracking operations. The module is structured with tasks for command decoding, data handling, and timing checks. It simulates DDR3 functionality including initialization, mode register settings, refresh operations, and various DDR3 commands (activate, read, write, precharge). The module
