Module-level comment: The 'a25_wishbone' module manages multi-master bus arbitration using the Wishbone protocol. It handles read and write requests from three ports, determining bus access through internal buffers and control signals like `wbuf_valid`, `wbuf_accepted`, and `serving_port`. Bus transactions are coordinated across ports via conditional logic within clocked blocks to ensure synchronized, secure data transfer, and proper acknowledgment cycles per the Wishbone standard.
