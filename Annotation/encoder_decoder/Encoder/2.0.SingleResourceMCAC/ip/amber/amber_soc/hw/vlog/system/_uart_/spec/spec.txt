Module name: uart. Module specification: This module implements a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) interface with configurable baud rates and FIFO buffers. It handles both transmission and reception of serial data, interfacing with a Wishbone bus for configuration and data transfer. The module has input ports for clock, Wishbone bus signals, UART CTS, and RXD; and output ports for Wishbone data, acknowledge, error, UART interrupt, TXD, and RTS. Internal signals include FIFO management for TX and RX, state machines for transmit and receive operations, and various control registers. The code is organized into several main blocks: Wishbone interface logic, transmit logic with FIFO management, receive logic with FIFO management, register access for configuration and status, and debug/error checking sections. The module supports features such as flow control, configurable word length
