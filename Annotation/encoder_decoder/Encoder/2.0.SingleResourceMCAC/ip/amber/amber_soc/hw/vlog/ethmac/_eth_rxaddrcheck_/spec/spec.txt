Module name: eth_rxaddrcheck. Module specification: The eth_rxaddrcheck module is designed to check the Ethernet receiver's address, determining the validity of inbound frame addresses by comparison to predefined conditions such as the device's MAC address, broadcast, or multicast addresses. It features input ports including MRxClk (Ethernet receive clock), Reset (reinitializes the module), RxData (received data), Broadcast, r_Bro (broadcast receive-enable configuration), r_Pro (protocol-specific configuration), ByteCntEq2 to ByteCntEq7 (byte counters for frame processing), HASH0 and HASH1 (hash tables for multicast), CrcHash and CrcHashGood (CRC hash processing), Multicast, MAC (device's MAC address), StateData (state information), RxEndFrm (indicating the end of frame), PassAll (bypass address checking), and ControlFrmAddressOK (control frame address validity). The output ports include RxAbort (signals frame reception abortion for invalid addresses) and AddressMiss (signals an address mismatch).

Internally, the module uses several signals such as BroadcastOK (validates broadcast frames), RxAddressInvalid (flags invalid receiver addresses), RxCheckEn (enables receiver address checking based on state), HashBit (a component of multicast verification), IntHash (determines hash table usage), ByteHash (part of the CRC hash computation), MulticastOK, and UnicastOK (validate multicast and unicast addresses, respectively). The code is organized into sections performing initialization/reset actions, address validation including unicast, multicast, and broadcast checks, and output signal updates based on the evaluations of frame reception validity. The various always and assign blocks manage these functionalities across differing clock edges or state conditions, ensuring robust frame processing in diverse operational scenarios.
