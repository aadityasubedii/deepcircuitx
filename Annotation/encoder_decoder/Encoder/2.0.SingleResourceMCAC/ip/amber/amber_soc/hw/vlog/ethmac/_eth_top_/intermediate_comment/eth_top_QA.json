It integrates various sub-modules to handle Ethernet communication, including:\n\n1. MIIM (Management Interface) for PHY management\n2. MAC control for flow control and pause frame handling\n3. Transmit and receive Ethernet MAC modules\n4. Wishbone interface for communication with a host system\n5. MAC status monitoring\n\nThe module handles both transmit and receive paths, manages buffer descriptors, and provides interfaces for external connections such as MII (Media Independent Interface) signals. It also includes features like collision detection, flow control, and various configuration options for Ethernet frame handling. The module is designed to be configurable and supports different operating modes and features through its register interface."
