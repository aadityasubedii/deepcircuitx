It manages read and write operations by handling address translation, command initiation, and data transfer while checking for busy conditions. The module captures incoming Wishbone transactions, translates them into DDR3 commands, handles data alignment, masks data bits as necessary, and manages handshake signals to confirm transaction completion. The conditional compilation (`ifdef` for XILINX_VIRTEX6_FPGA) suggests that it can be adapted for specific hardware implementations, adjusting data handling according to the target FPGA architecture."
