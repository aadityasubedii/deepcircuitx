Module name: data_prbs_gen. 
Module specification: The "data_prbs_gen" module is a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) generator primarily designed for various digital communication or encryption applications. It leverages a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) mechanism to produce a sequence. The module has several input ports: 'clk_i' is the main clock input, 'clk_en' enables the LFSR operation when high, 'rst_i' initializes or resets the LFSR state according to `EYE_TEST` configuration, 'prbs_fseed_i' allows for seeding the LFSR forcefully, 'prbs_seed_init' triggers the seed initialization, and 'prbs_seed_i' provides an initial seed value. The sole output port, 'prbs_o', outputs the generated PRBS. Internally, ‘prbs’ is the registered output of the LFSR, and ‘lfsr_q’ is the shift register representing the state of the LFSR itself. The Verilog code contains two main procedural blocks: the first block, an always block triggered on the positive edge of 'clk_i', handles the LFSR’s initialization, reset, and updates according to the clock enables. The second always block, sensitive to changes in ‘lfsr_q’, updates the ‘prbs’ based on the current state of ‘lfsr_q’. An assignment statement continuously assigns the value of 'prbs' to 'prbs_o' for output. The use of parameters like 'EYE_TEST' provides options for testing configurations, enhancing the module's adaptability in practical scenarios.
