    "module": "Module-level comment: The a23_barrel_shift_fpga module performs bit-shifting operations (LSL, LSR, ASR, ROR) on a 32-bit input data (`i_in`) based on an 8-bit shift amount (`i_shift_amount`), incorporating special controls like a zero shift force (`i_shift_imm_zero`). It efficiently handles edge cases and various shift modes through a detailed generate block for dynamic bit manipulation, conditional statement-based masking, and multiple internal control signals, producing a shifted output (`o_out`) and a carry-out (`o_carry_out`)."
