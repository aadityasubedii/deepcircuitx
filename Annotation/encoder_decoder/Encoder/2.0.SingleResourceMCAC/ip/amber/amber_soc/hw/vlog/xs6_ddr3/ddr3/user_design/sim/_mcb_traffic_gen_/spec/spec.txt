Module name: mcb_traffic_gen. Module specification: The mcb_traffic_gen module is a sophisticated traffic generator designed for memory controller blocks (MCB), primarily used for testing and simulating various memory access patterns. It supports configurable parameters for burst lengths, data patterns, command patterns, and operational modes (read, write, or bi-directional). The module interfaces with memory control operations through numerous input and output ports, including clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), run traffic control (run_traffic_i), address range inputs (start_addr_i, end_addr_i), seed inputs (cmd_seed_i, data_seed_i), mode selection inputs (addr_mode_i, instr_mode_i, bl_mode_i, data_mode_i), and various MCB interface signals for command, write, and read operations. Internally, it utilizes a range of signals for
