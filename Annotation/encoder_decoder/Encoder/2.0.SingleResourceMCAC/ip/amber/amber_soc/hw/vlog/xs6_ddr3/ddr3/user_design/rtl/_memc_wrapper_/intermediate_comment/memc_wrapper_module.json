It handles \n * DDR3 memory operations, including calibration and arbitration. The module \n * interfaces with external memory using standard DDR3 signals and provides \n * multiple ports for other system components to access memory. It uses PLL \n * signals for timing and implements various memory timing parameters.\n */"
