Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module represents a behavioral model of a DDR3 SDRAM memory device. It simulates the operation of a DDR3 memory, including timing checks, command decoding, read/write operations, and various memory-specific features such as burst operations, refresh cycles, and power-down modes. The module has input ports for control signals (rst_n, ck, ck_n, cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address and bank selection (ba, addr), and data management (dm_tdqs, dq, dqs, dqs_n). It also has an output port (tdqs_n) and an input port for on-die termination (odt). Internally, the module uses numerous signals and registers to track timing parameters, operational states, and data pipelines. These include
