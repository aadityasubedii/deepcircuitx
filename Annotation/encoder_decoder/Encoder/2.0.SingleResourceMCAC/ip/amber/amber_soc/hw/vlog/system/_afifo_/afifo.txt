Module-level comment: The `afifo` module implements an asynchronous FIFO buffer with separate write (`wr_clk`) and read (`rd_clk`) clocks, using Gray code for pointer synchronization across clock domains. It supports data writes when not full (`i_push` & `o_full`) and reads when not empty (`i_pop` & `o_empty`), managing data transfers with internal pointers and a storage array, ensuring synced operations in a multi-clock environment.
