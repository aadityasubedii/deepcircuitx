This RAM allows for simultaneous read and write operations. The module uses 32 instances of the RAM16X1D primitive, a type of 16x1 dual-port RAM provided by Xilinx, each handling 1 bit of the 32-bit data words. 'we' is the write enable input which controls whether data is written during a write operation, 'wclk' is the write clock, 'data_in' is the 32-bit input data for writing, 'write_address' is the 4-bit address for writing data, and 'read_address' is the 4-bit address for reading data. The outputs at these addresses are placed on 'data_out'. This configuration allows independent read and write operations at different addresses during the same clock cycle, making it suitable for applications needing high-throughput data buffering or storage in FPGAs."

Thus, whenever a write operation occurs, `waddr` determines at which memory location within each RAM block the incoming data bit (`data_in`) should be written.\n- `raddr`: Similar to `waddr`, this is a wire that holds the read address, connected to the `read_address` input port. This signal is used as the address for read operations in each RAM16X1D primitive.
