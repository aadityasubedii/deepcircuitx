Module name: wb_ddr3_bridge. 

Module specification: The `wb_ddr3_bridge` module acts as a bridge between a Wishbone bus interface and a DDR3 memory interface, primarily managing and translating read and write operations between these two protocols. The module has several input ports including `i_clk` (clock input), `i_wb_adr` (Wishbone address input), `i_wb_sel` (byte select signals), `i_wb_we` (write enable signal), `i_wb_dat` (data input for writes), `i_wb_cyc` (indicates the duration of a cycle), `i_wb_stb` (initiates an operation), `i_cmd_full` (indicates full command queue), `i_wr_full` (write buffer status), `i_rd_data` (data read from DDR3 memory), and `i_rd_empty` (status of the read buffer). The output ports include `o_wb_dat` (data output to Wishbone), `o_wb_ack` (transaction acknowledge), `o_wb_err` (error signal), `o_cmd_en` (enables DDR3 command execution), `o_cmd_instr` (command type for DDR3), `o_cmd_byte_addr` (adjusted address for commands), `o_wr_en` (DDR3 write enable), `o_wr_mask` (write masking for data lines), and `o_wr_data` (data being written to DDR3). The internal signals such as `start_write`, `start_read`, `ddr3_busy`, `read_ack`, and others manage the flow and timing of data transactions based on the status of inputs and the specific required operations. The module's code is organized into blocks handling the setup of DDR3 commands and addresses, execution conditions for writes and reads, and data transfer, facilitated by signal assignments and conditioned always blocks. This structured approach ensures efficient data management and synchronization between the interfaces.
