Module-level comment: The `iodrp_mcb_controller` module manages data flow between memory cells and a DRP, facilitating both read and write operations. It orchestrates this through a finite state machine (FSM) that navigates through states like READY, ADDR_PHASE, and DATA_PHASE, responding to changes in input commands and control signals. Internal registers stabilize data and address inputs, while output ports transmit status and data to the DRP. Shifting operations and state transitions are driven by the DRP_CLK signal, and synchronization is managed via a sync_rst input.
