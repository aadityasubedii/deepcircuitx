It manages different states such as Idle, Inter-Packet Gap (IPG), Preamble, Data transmission, Padding (PAD), Frame Check Sequence (FCS), Jamming signal handling, BackOff due to collision, and Defer state management. The module primarily handles transitions between these states based on a variety of input signals that represent different Ethernet frame transmission and line status conditions, as well as operational errors like collisions or under-runs. It uses these inputs to control the output state signals and to start specific actions like jamming or backoff. This helps in managing the flow and integrity of data as it is sent across the network."
