Module-level comment: This module decodes ARM instructions and generates control signals for CPU execution. It implements a state machine to handle various instruction types, including data processing, memory operations, branches, and interrupts. The module decodes instructions, manages control flow, handles interrupts and exceptions, and generates appropriate signals for ALU operations, register access, memory operations, and status bit management. It supports multi-cycle operations, coprocessor interactions, and privilege level changes, interfacing with other CPU components to coordinate instruction execution and maintain processor state.
