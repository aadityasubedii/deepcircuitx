    "spec": "Module name: a25_coprocessor. Module specification: The a25_coprocessor module serves as a configuration and handling logic system for cache control and error management in a processor environment. This module processes a variety of inputs, including clock signals (i_clk) for synchronization, a reset signal (i_reset) for initializing the internal state, and core stall signals (i_core_stall) to manage operational halts. It also handles specific coprocessor operations and register identifiers through inputs such as i_copro_opcode1, i_copro_opcode2, i_copro_crn, i_copro_crm, and i_copro_num. These determine the types of operations performed, such as read or write as specified by i_copro_operation, and handle data through i_copro_write_data. Fault management is executed using inputs like i_fault, i_fault_status, and i_fault_address, which help manage and debug faults within the system.\n\nThe outputs include o_copro_read_data, which returns data from coprocessor registers based on read operations, o_cache_enable and o_cache_flush which are controlled by internal operation settings to manage caching processes efficiently, and o_cacheable_area which specifies the manageable cache areas based on the coprocessor configurations.\n\nInternally, the module utilizes several signals such as cache_control, cacheable_area, updateable_area, disruptive_area, fault_status, fault_address, and copro15_reg1_write. These signals help manage caching operations, define memory areas with specific properties, capture fault-related data, and indicate specific register operations.\n\nThe code is structured into several always blocks and conditional assign statements: one block handles the fault status and address registration upon a fault signal; another performs register operations for cache and memory area configurations based on coprocessor commands; a block for output data generation based on the requested coprocessor read operations. Additionally, conditional statements are used to define output signals based on internal states. Debug blocks are also included, wrapped in compiler directives, to assist in development and troubleshooting by printing relevant operational data and register transactions.",

                    "text": "Module name: a25_coprocessor. Module specification: The a25_coprocessor module serves as a configuration and handling logic system for cache control and error management in a processor environment. This module processes a variety of inputs, including clock signals (i_clk) for synchronization, a reset signal (i_reset) for initializing the internal state, and core stall signals (i_core_stall) to manage operational halts. It also handles specific coprocessor operations and register identifiers through inputs such as i_copro_opcode1, i_copro_opcode2, i_copro_crn, i_copro_crm, and i_copro_num. These determine the types of operations performed, such as read or write as specified by i_copro_operation, and handle data through i_copro_write_data. Fault management is executed using inputs like i_fault, i_fault_status, and i_fault_address, which help manage and debug faults within the system.\n\nThe outputs include o_copro_read_data, which returns data from coprocessor registers based on read operations, o_cache_enable and o_cache_flush which are controlled by internal operation settings to manage caching processes efficiently, and o_cacheable_area which specifies the manageable cache areas based on the coprocessor configurations.\n\nInternally, the module utilizes several signals such as cache_control, cacheable_area, updateable_area, disruptive_area, fault_status, fault_address, and copro15_reg1_write. These signals help manage caching operations, define memory areas with specific properties, capture fault-related data, and indicate specific register operations.\n\nThe code is structured into several always blocks and conditional assign statements: one block handles the fault status and address registration upon a fault signal; another performs register operations for cache and memory area configurations based on coprocessor commands; a block for output data generation based on the requested coprocessor read operations. Additionally, conditional statements are used to define output signals based on internal states. Debug blocks are also included, wrapped in compiler directives, to assist in development and troubleshooting by printing relevant operational data and register transactions."
