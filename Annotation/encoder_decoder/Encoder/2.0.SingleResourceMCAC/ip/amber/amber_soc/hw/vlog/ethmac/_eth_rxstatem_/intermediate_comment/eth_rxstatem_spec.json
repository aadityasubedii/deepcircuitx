    "spec": "Module name: eth_rxstatem. Module specification: The 'eth_rxstatem' module is designed to manage the state transitions in an Ethernet receiver's state machine. It operates by monitoring input signals such as MRxDV (Data Valid) and controlling outputs that represent different machine states. The inputs include MRxClk (the clock signal), Reset (reset signal), MRxDV (data validity indicator), ByteCntEq0 (byte count equals zero), ByteCntGreat2 (byte count greater than two), MRxDEq5 (received data equals hexadecimal 5), Transmitting (transmission indicator), MRxDEqD (received data equals hexadecimal D), IFGCounterEq24 (inter-frame gap counter equals 24), and ByteCntMaxFrame (byte count reaches the maximum frame size). The outputs are two-bit StateData (indicating data reception states), StateIdle (idle state), StatePreamble (preamble detection), StateSFD (Start Frame Delimiter detection), and StateDrop (frame drop condition). Internally, the module uses signals like StartIdle, StartDrop, StartData0, StartData1, StartPreamble, and StartSFD to manage state transitions based on conditions deduced from the inputs. The code is structured around a sequential block triggered by the positive edge of MRxClk or a positive edge of Reset, managing state assignments with conditional checks for starting or stopping various states. An operational flow is established through signal conditioning and state determination logic to ensure correct state transitions responding to incoming frame data and conditions, effectively guiding the Ethernet frame reception and error handling process.",

It handles transitions between various states based on inputs like MRxDV (Data Valid) and specific byte and frame conditions. These states include Idle, Preamble detection, Start Frame Delimiter (SFD), data reception (StateData0 and StateData1), and conditions for dropping frames (StateDrop). The module uses signals to start these states based on the conditions met within the Ethernet frame reception process.

It's crucial in determining whether to process or ignore incoming data.\n- ByteCntEq0: Indicates if the byte count is equal to zero, used to manage state transitions related to frame boundaries.\n- ByteCntGreat2: Indicates if the byte count is greater than two, used in specific state transitions where more than two bytes are needed for decisions.\n- MRxDEq5: This input is true when the received data equals hexadecimal 5, used for SFD detection in Ethernet frames.\n- Transmitting: Indicates whether transmission is occurring, used to decide whether to drop the frame.\n- MRxDEqD: This signal is true when the received data equals hexadecimal D, indicates the end of an acceptable frame format.\n- IFGCounterEq24: Indicates when the inter-frame gap counter equals 24, used in managing proper spacing between frames.\n- ByteCntMaxFrame: Indicates when the byte count has reached a maximum frame size, used to detect frame size violations.\n\nOutput ports: StateData, StateIdle, StateDrop, StatePreamble, StateSFD.\nExplanation:\n- StateData: A 2-bit output indicating data reception states (StateData0 and StateData1); facilitates tracking of frame data reception phases.\n- StateIdle: Indicates the idle state of the machine, signaling no data processing and the readiness for a new frame.\n- StateDrop: Indicates when a frame is being dropped due to errors or abnormal conditions, ensuring error handling.\n- StatePreamble: Indicates the detection of preamble in the Ethernet frame, representing synchronization bits prior to data frames.\n- StateSFD: Indicates the recognition of the Start Frame Delimiter, crucial for marking the start of frame data in Ethernet communication."

It is activated when MRxDV is low, indicating no valid data, and either StateDrop, StatePreamble, StateSFD is true, or any of the StateData states are active.\n- StartDrop: This signal controls when to drop a frame, based on various conditions such as if transmitting is active during idle state, if MRxDEqD doesn\u2019t happen after SFD within the frame gap period, or if the byte count exceeds the maximum allowable frame size during data reception.\n- StartData0 and StartData1: These two signals manage the transitioning into and between the two data receiving states (StateData0 and StateData1). StartData0 is asserted when in SFD state if MRxDEqD and IFGCounterEq24 are true, or when transitioning from StateData1 under certain conditions. StartData1 is asserted when transitioning from StateData0 unless the maximum frame byte count is reached.\n- StartPreamble: This signal triggers the transition to the Preamble state when MRxDV is high, indicating valid data, MRxDEq5 is not true, and the system is in the idle state without transmitting.\n- StartSFD: This signal manages the transition to the SFD state, initiated when MRxDV is high and MRxDEq5 is true, either from an idle state (not transmitting) or from a preamble state.
