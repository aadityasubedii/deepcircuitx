    "module": "Module-level comment: The `mcb_soft_calibration_top` module calibrates DDR memory interfaces in a Memory Controller Block (MCB) for optimal operation. It utilizes dynamic reconfiguration ports (DRPs) to adjust I/O timing and impedance, processes signals through IOBUF and IODRP2 components for data exchange, and handles various calibration subroutines conditionally based on memory type and user-defined settings. The module effectively coordinates calibration via internal control logic and signal interfacing, ensuring system stability and performance."
