Module-level comment: The `eth_spram_256x32` module interfaces with a single-port RAM on various FPGA platforms, facilitating byte-level write operations. It processes input commands via `clk`, `ce`, `we`, `addr`, and `di` to either read or write data to the RAM, outputting through `do`. Inside, RAM instances are conditional on FPGA type, which governs the specific RAM behavior, utilizing internal control `write_enable` determined by `ce` and `we` for enabling writes.
