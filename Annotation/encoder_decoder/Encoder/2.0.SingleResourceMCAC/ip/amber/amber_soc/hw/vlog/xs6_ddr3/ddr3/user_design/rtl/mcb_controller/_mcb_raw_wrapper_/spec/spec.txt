Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: This module serves as a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) interface, providing a configurable interface to various types of DDR memory (DDR, DDR2, DDR3, MDDR) with support for different data widths (4, 8, or 16 bits) and multiple ports. The module handles address and data signals, command generation, and timing control for memory operations. Input ports include clock signals (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), control signals (pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, pll_lock, sys_rst), and port-specific signals for up to six memory ports (e.g., p0_arb_en, p0_cmd_clk, p0_cmd_en). Output ports provide status information for each memory port (e.g.,
