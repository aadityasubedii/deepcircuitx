Module name: main_mem. Module specification: The 'main_mem' module is designed to simulate a main memory component interfacing with a Wishbone bus, configurable for 32-bit or 128-bit data widths. The module accepts inputs such as `i_clk` (clock signal), `i_mem_ctrl` (memory control for addressing mode), `i_wb_adr` (address bus), `i_wb_sel` (byte enables), `i_wb_we` (write enable), `i_wb_dat` (data for writing), `i_wb_cyc` (cycle active signal), and `i_wb_stb` (strobe/valid transfer signal). It outputs `o_wb_dat` (data read from memory), `o_wb_ack` (acknowledgment signal), and `o_wb_err` (error status, which is static at '0'). Internally, the module uses a register array `ram` to simulate memory cells, with signals like `start_write` and `start_read` to initiate memory operations, `rd_data` and `masked_wdata` to manage data during read/write operations, and `wr_en`, `wr_mask` for conditional writing. The module also manages data width-specific operations through separate generate blocks (labels `wb128` and `wb32`) handling 128-bit and 32-bit data widths respectively. Each block adjusts addressing, data routing, and memory interactions based on the operation and Wishbone signals.
