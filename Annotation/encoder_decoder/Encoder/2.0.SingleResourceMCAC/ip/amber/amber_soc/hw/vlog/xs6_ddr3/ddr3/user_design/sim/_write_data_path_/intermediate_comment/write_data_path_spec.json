    "spec": "Module name: write_data_path. Module specification: The 'write_data_path' module is designed for managing data writing operations in memory-related hardware systems, specifically tailored for configurable memory applications and handling memory burst operations. It synchronizes data processing and command flow via input ports including a clk_i (clock input), rst_i (reset signal array), cmd_valid_i, cmd_validB_i, cmd_validC_i (command valid signals), prbs_fseed_i (pseudo-random binary sequence feed), data_mode_i (data operation mode selector), fixed_data_i (constant data values), addr_i (memory address input), bl_i (burst length specifier) and data_rdy_i (data ready signal). The output ports include cmd_rdy_o (command ready signal), data_valid_o (data validity flag), last_word_wr_o (last word in sequence indicator), data_o (processed data output), data_mask_o (data availability bitmask), and data_wr_end_o (end of data write flag). Internally, the module features two main signals: 'data_valid', a wire signal that indicates the validity of the current data, and 'cmd_rdy', a register that shows the module's readiness for new commands. Within the module, the 'wr_data_gen' submodule is instantiated with specific parameters like bus widths and burst lengths and is connected to both inputs and outputs of the main module, orchestrating the generation and processing of data per the configured modes and commands. This setup facilitates efficient data handling and supports functionalities necessary for operations such as test patterns generation and eye tests, making it versatile for various data-intensive operations in memory systems.",

                    "text": "Module name: write_data_path. Module specification: The 'write_data_path' module is designed for managing data writing operations in memory-related hardware systems, specifically tailored for configurable memory applications and handling memory burst operations. It synchronizes data processing and command flow via input ports including a clk_i (clock input), rst_i (reset signal array), cmd_valid_i, cmd_validB_i, cmd_validC_i (command valid signals), prbs_fseed_i (pseudo-random binary sequence feed), data_mode_i (data operation mode selector), fixed_data_i (constant data values), addr_i (memory address input), bl_i (burst length specifier) and data_rdy_i (data ready signal). The output ports include cmd_rdy_o (command ready signal), data_valid_o (data validity flag), last_word_wr_o (last word in sequence indicator), data_o (processed data output), data_mask_o (data availability bitmask), and data_wr_end_o (end of data write flag). Internally, the module features two main signals: 'data_valid', a wire signal that indicates the validity of the current data, and 'cmd_rdy', a register that shows the module's readiness for new commands. Within the module, the 'wr_data_gen' submodule is instantiated with specific parameters like bus widths and burst lengths and is connected to both inputs and outputs of the main module, orchestrating the generation and processing of data per the configured modes and commands. This setup facilitates efficient data handling and supports functionalities necessary for operations such as test patterns generation and eye tests, making it versatile for various data-intensive operations in memory systems."
