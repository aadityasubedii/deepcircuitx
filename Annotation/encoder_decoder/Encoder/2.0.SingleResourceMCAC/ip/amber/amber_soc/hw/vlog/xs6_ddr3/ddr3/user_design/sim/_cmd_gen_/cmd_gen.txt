Module-level comment: This module generates memory commands (read, write, refresh) for Xilinx FPGA memory controllers. It supports various addressing modes (fixed, sequential, PRBS) and burst lengths. The module uses PRBS generators for address, instruction, and burst length in PRBS mode. It manages command timing, handles read buffer availability, and ensures proper sequencing based on selected modes and system conditions. The module incorporates configurable parameters for different memory widths and burst lengths, making it adaptable for various FPGA families and memory configurations.
