Module name: sim_tb_top. Module specification: This module is a testbench for simulating and verifying a DDR3 memory controller. It instantiates a DDR3 memory model, a memory controller design, and a test module. The testbench has no external input or output ports, as it generates its own stimuli and reports results internally. Key internal signals include clock (c3_sys_clk), reset (c3_sys_rst), error indicators (c3_error, c3_cmp_error), calibration status (c3_calib_done), and various memory interface signals (mcb3_dram_*). The module is divided into several sections: clock generation, reset logic, DDR3 memory model instantiation, memory controller instantiation, and test logic instantiation. It also includes logging functionality to report test results and timing checks for calibration completion. The testbench
