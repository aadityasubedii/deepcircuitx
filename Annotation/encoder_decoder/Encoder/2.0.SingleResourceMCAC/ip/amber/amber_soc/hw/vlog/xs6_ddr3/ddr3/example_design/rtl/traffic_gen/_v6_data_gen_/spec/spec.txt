Module name: v6_data_gen. Module specification: This module is a data generator for memory testing purposes, supporting various data patterns including address-based, PRBS (pseudo-random binary sequence), walking 1's/0's, neighbor, and hammer patterns. It takes inputs like clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), data mode (data_mode_i), address (addr_i, m_addr_i), and control signals (cmd_startA-E, data_rdy_i, fifo_rdy_i), and outputs generated data (data_o) based on the selected mode and configuration. Internal signals include pattern-specific data registers (prbs_data, adata, hdata, ndata, w1data, w0data), counters (acounts, walk_cnt), and control flags (burst_count_reached2, data_valid). The module is organized into sections
