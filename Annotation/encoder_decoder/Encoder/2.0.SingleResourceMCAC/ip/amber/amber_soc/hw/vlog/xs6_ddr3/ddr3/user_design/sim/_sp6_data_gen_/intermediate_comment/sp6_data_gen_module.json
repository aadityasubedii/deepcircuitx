    "module": "Module-level comment: This module generates configurable data patterns for testing purposes. It supports various patterns (fixed, walking ones/zeros, address-based, PRBS, hammer) and data widths (32/64/128 bits). The module uses input configurations and internal logic to select and generate the appropriate pattern. It employs combinational logic for pattern selection and sequential logic for pattern generation, with separate blocks for each pattern type. The output is synchronized with clock and control signals, allowing for burst-mode operation and integration with memory interfaces."
