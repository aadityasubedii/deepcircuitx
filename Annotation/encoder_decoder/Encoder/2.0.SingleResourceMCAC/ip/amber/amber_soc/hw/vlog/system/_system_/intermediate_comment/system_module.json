    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a system-on-chip (SoC) design integrating an Amber processor core, memory controllers, UARTs, Ethernet MAC, timers, and interrupt controllers. It uses a Wishbone bus architecture for inter-component communication and provides interfaces for DDR3 memory and Ethernet PHY. The module manages clock generation, reset, and system initialization, with configurable options for different FPGA platforms, particularly Xilinx Spartan-6. It orchestrates data flow and control between various components, handling interrupts and memory access, to create a complete embedded system solution."
