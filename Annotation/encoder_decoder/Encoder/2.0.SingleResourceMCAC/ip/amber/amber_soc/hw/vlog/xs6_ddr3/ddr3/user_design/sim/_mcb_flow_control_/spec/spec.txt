Module name: mcb_flow_control. Module specification: The 'mcb_flow_control' module is designed for managing the flow of commands and data to an external memory controller block (MCB). It handles the readiness and validity of command paths and data paths for read and write operations. The inputs include clk_i (clock input for synchronization), rst_i (reset to initialize states), cmd_valid_i (validity of command input), cmd_i (specifies operation type), addr_i (memory address), bl_i (burst length), mcb_cmd_full (indicates if MCB command queue is full), last_word_wr_i (last word in write operation), wdp_rdy_i (write data path ready), last_word_rd_i (last word in read operation), and rdp_rdy_i (read data path ready). Outputs are cmd_rdy_o (module ready for new command), cmd_o (command output to MCB), addr_o, bl_o (address and burst length outputs), cmd_en_o (command path enable), data path validations (wdp_valid_o, wdp_validB_o, wdp_validC_o), and read data validations (rdp_valid_o, along with direct mappings of write and read addresses and lengths, wr_addr_o, rd_addr_o, wr_bl_o, rd_bl_o). Internal signals control various functionalities including cmd_fifo_rdy (FIFO readiness), push_cmd, xfer_cmd (data/command transfer initiators), and next_state/current_state for state machine transitions. These transitions manage whether the system is preparing a command, transferring data, awaiting further instructions, or handling error states. The module employs a state machine with states like READY, READ, WRITE, CMD_WAIT, and REFRESH_ST to manage between various operational phases based on input signals. This structured design ensures the module efficiently manages memory access requests, addressing both performance and synchronization needs in systems such as those using SPARTAN6 technology family.
