    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'infrastructure' module manages clock generation, distribution, and reset operations for digital circuits. It supports both differential and single-ended clock inputs and handles synchronous and asynchronous reset functionalities. Internally, it utilizes PLL for generating various clock outputs and phases, synchronizing resets, and ensuring system stability through continuous monitoring of lock status and execution of reset sequences. This module is pivotal in providing stable and diversified clock signals for robust digital system functionality."
