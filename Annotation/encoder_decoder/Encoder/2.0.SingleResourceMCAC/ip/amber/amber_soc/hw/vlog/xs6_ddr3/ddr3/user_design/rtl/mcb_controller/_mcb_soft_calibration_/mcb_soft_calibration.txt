Module-level comment: This module performs soft calibration for a Memory Controller Block (MCB), including termination and DQS signal calibration. It implements a state machine that adjusts RZQ and ZIO termination values, sets initial DQS delays, and dynamically calibrates DQS signals. The module handles input/output termination, dynamic calibration, and self-refresh requests. It uses IODRP controllers for configuration and iteratively adjusts delays based on measured values to optimize memory interface timing and signal integrity.
