Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: This module is a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) interface, designed to handle connections between the user interface and memory devices (DDR/DDR2/DDR3 SDRAM). It manages address and data operations, clock generation, and I/O functions, supporting various memory configurations. The module includes numerous input ports for clock signals, commands, data, and control signals for up to 6 ports, as well as output ports for status information, memory interface signals, and data. Key internal signals include reset management, synchronization, and calibration signals. The code is organized into sections for port configuration, address mapping, IODRP2 instantiations for DQ and DQS signals, and output buffer instantiations. It implements functionality for different port configurations, data widths, and memory types, making it adaptable to various memory interface requirements. The module
