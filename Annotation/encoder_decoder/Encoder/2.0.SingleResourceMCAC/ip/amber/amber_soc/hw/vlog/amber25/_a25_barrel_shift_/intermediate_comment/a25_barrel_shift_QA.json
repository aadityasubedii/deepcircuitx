It takes a 32-bit input (`i_in`) and shifts it based on an 8-bit shift amount (`i_shift_amount`). The module can adjust the carry output (`o_carry_out`) and supports immediate zero shifting (`i_shift_imm_zero`). The shifting functionality can vary based on the 2-bit `i_function` input. Outputs also include a 32-bit shifted output (`o_out`) and a stall signal (`o_stall`), which indicates when the full shifter is used over the quick variant. The choice of shifter is made based on the magnitude of `i_shift_amount` and whether it's operable within the quick shifter's capability."
