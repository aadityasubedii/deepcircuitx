Module name: clocks_resets. 

Module specification: The 'clocks_resets' Verilog module is primarily designed for clock and reset management within FPGA systems, particularly targeting Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6 families. The module accepts differential clock inputs (i_brd_clk_n, i_brd_clk_p), a system reset signal (i_brd_rst), and a DDR calibration completion indicator (i_ddr_calib_done). It produces a system reset output (o_sys_rst), a primary system clock (o_sys_clk), and an additional clock output (o_clk_200). Internally, the module uses signal synchronization techniques and condition-based configurations to manage the states efficiently. Several important internal signals include calib_done_33mhz, pll_locked, and rst0 among others, serving various purposes from reset synchronization to clock signal stabilization. The module's code is structured into conditional sections using compiler directives (`ifdef`, `endif`) that differentiate hardware configurations based on the FPGA type. For instance, configurations and instantiation differ for Spartan-6 and Virtex-6, using respective components like PLL_ADV and MMCM_ADV for clock management. Additionally, the non-Xilinx FPGA simulation context is provided using behavioral modeling to emulate the clock handling typically expected in real hardware scenarios. This way, the module ensures robust integration of clock and reset functionalities aligned with specific FPGA characteristics.
