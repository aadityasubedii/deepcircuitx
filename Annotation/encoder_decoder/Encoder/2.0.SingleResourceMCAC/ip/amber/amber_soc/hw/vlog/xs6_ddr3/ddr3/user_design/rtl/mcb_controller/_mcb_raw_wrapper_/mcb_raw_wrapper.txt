Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable Memory Controller Block (MCB) wrapper for DDR memory interfaces. It supports various DDR types, data widths, and multiple ports. The module manages address/data signals, command generation, and timing control using IOB instantiations and IODRP2 components. It handles memory operations through port-specific interfaces, implements calibration logic, and provides status signals. The design uses generate statements for flexibility and includes DQS/DQ management, address/command signal generation, and clock management to interface with external DDR memory devices.
