It supports reading from and writing to different registers based on the selected operation mode. The module also deals with conditional updates of registers based on flags and masks including status bit flags, interrupt masks, and mode executions. The outputs are determined by selectors i_rm_sel, i_rds_sel, and i_rn_sel which choose the source register for output based on the current executing mode and provided conditions. The logic for each register is gated by different write enable signals and mode-specific conditions, ensuring that each register is safely and correctly handled as per the CPU's operational requirements."
