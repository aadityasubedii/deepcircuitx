Module name: generic_sram_line_en.
Module specification: The "generic_sram_line_en" module simulates a generic static random-access memory (SRAM) with parametrizable data width and address size, incorporating an enable functionality for writing. The module accepts a clock input (`i_clk`) for operation synchronization, a data input (`i_write_data`) whose width is defined by the `DATA_WIDTH` parameter, a write enable signal (`i_write_enable`), and an address input (`i_address`) defined by the `ADDRESS_WIDTH` parameter. It outputs data read from the SRAM (`o_read_data`) with the width matching `DATA_WIDTH`. Internally, the module uses a memory array (`mem`) which stores data; the array is indexed by the address and can be initialized to zero based on the `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO` parameter setting. This parameter-driven initialization is handled in a conditional generate block. The main logic, encapsulated within an `always` block triggered on the rising edge of 'i_clk', controls the reading and writing operations: it writes the input data to the specified memory address when `i_write_enable` is high, or outputs the data from the specified memory address to `o_read_data` when `i_write_enable` is low, specifically setting `o_read_data` to zero during write operations.
