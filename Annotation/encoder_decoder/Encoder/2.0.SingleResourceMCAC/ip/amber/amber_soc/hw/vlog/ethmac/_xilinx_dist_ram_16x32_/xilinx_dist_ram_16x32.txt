Module-level comment: The xilinx_dist_ram_16x32 module is a dual-port RAM with 32-bit width and 16 depth, using 32 Xilinx RAM16X1D primitives. It supports simultaneous read and write operations with independent addressing. Inputs include write enable, write clock, data input, and write/read addresses. Output is the read data. Each RAM16X1D instance handles a single bit of the data word, allowing concurrent operations at different addresses.
