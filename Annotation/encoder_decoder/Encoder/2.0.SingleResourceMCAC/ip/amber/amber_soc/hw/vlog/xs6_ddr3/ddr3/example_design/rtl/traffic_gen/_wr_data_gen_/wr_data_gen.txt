Module-level comment: The `wr_data_gen` module generates write data for memory interfaces, adaptable to FPGA types like SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6. It orchestrates data flow based on parameters like data width and burst length and employs sub-modules tailored to specific FPGA families for optimized performance. Inputs dictate operational modes and data states, while internal logic coordinates command readiness, data validity, and sequence flow, ensuring efficient data handling and burst management in memory operations.
