It implements clock generation, distribution, and resetting functionalities based on the provided parameters. This module includes different clock buffers and PLL configurations to generate multiple clock outputs with specific frequencies and phases. Furthermore, it handles reset synchronization and conditioning, ensuring stable and correct operation through asynchronous and synchronous reset mechanisms. Additionally, this module supports both differential and single-ended clock input types, making it versatile for various system requirements."

They are used when a differential clock source is required for the system.\n- sys_clk: This input is used when a single-ended clock source is required for the system.\n- sys_rst_i: This is the input reset signal, which can be either active high or active low based on the parameter C_RST_ACT_LOW. It initiates a reset condition in the system when asserted.\n\nOutput ports: clk0, rst0, async_rst, sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, mcb_drp_clk, pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, pll_lock.\nExplanation:\n- clk0: Main clock output after it is generated and buffered inside the module.\n- rst0: Reset output that has been synchronized to the clk0 signal. This ensures that the reset is cleanly deasserted with respect to the clk0 clock domain.\n- async_rst: Asynchronous reset output, which reflects a combined logic of an internal reset condition and the PLL lock status. It is used for resetting parts of the system that require immediate response to reset conditions.\n- sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180: These outputs are generated by the BUFPLL_MCB and provide double frequency clock outputs, with sysclk_2x_180 phase shifted by 180 degrees. These are typically used for high-speed data transfers or double data rate (DDR) memory interfaces.\n- mcb_drp_clk: Memory Controller Block (MCB) dynamic reconfiguration port clock, used for configuration and control of memory interfaces or similar peripherals.\n- pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90: Output strobes for the SERDES (serializer-deserializer) blocks, generated from the BUFPLL_MCB. These strobes are crucial for timing-critical applications such as high-speed serialization.\n- pll_lock: This signal indicates whether the Phase Locked Loop (PLL) has successfully locked onto the input clock frequency, ensuring stable clock outputs are being generated."

It assists in managing system behavior during initial power-up stages.\n- syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked: Similar to powerup_pll_locked, but specifically synchronized to the clk0 domain.\n- sys_rst: This is a conditioned system reset signal that accounts for whether the reset is active high or low, based on the configuration.\n- bufpll_mcb_locked: Indicates the locking status of the buffer PLL connected to the Memory Controller Block, which is crucial for the stability of clocks related to memory operations.\n- sys_clk_ibufg: Buffered version of the system clock, which can be either a differential or single-ended input based on the module configuration, used as the primary clock input to the PLL."
