It includes configurations for different clock properties such as input period, output divides, and feedback multipliers mainly for PLL (Phase Locked Loop) use. The module has provisions for handling differential and single-ended clock inputs, generating multiple clock outputs at various phases and frequencies. It also includes reset management, assuring proper reset synchronization across different parts of the system using buffered and phased clocks. The module ensures system stability through controlled clock management and reset synchronization, critical for reliable operation in digital electronics systems."

These ports feed the differential clock signal into the module which then converts it into a single-ended signal internally for further processing.\n- sys_clk is the single-ended clock input used when 'SINGLE_ENDED' clock type is selected providing timing to the internal logic and synchronizing operations.\n- sys_rst_i is the system reset input and helps in initializing or resetting the system to a known state. It can be active high or active low based on the configuration (C_RST_ACT_LOW).\n\nOutput ports: clk0, rst0, async_rst, sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, mcb_drp_clk, pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, pll_lock.\nExplanation:\n- clk0 is a buffered output clock derived from the clock output of the PLL. It's used as a general system clock.\n- rst0 is the output of the reset synchronizer. It's driven by a shift register mechanism accepting asynchronous and PLL-conditional inputs, ensuring clean, glitch-free reset signals.\n- async_rst is an asynchronous reset output providing a quick initialization signal across the system without waiting for clock stabilization. It's influenced directly by the system reset input and the PLL lock status.\n- sysclk_2x and sysclk_2x_180 are higher frequency clock outputs driven by a Buffer PLL, intended for use in modules requiring faster clock speeds. sysclk_2x_180 also provides a clock phase shifted by 180 degrees.\n- mcb_drp_clk is a buffered clock specifically used for memory controller block (MCB) dynamic reconfiguration operations, gated by the PLL's locked status.\n- pll_ce_0 and pll_ce_90 are control signals for SERDES (serializer/deserializer) operation derived from the Buffer PLL, providing essential timing strobes for data alignment and transmission. pll_ce_90 offers a 90 degrees phase shift in comparison to pll_ce_0.\n- pll_lock is a status output indicating whether the PLL has achieved and is maintaining phase and frequency lock, crucial for stable clock tree operation in the system."
