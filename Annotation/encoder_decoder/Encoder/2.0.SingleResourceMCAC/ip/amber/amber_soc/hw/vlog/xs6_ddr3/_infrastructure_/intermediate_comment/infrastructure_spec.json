They serve as inputs to the BUFPLL_MCB block for further processing.\n- `clk0_bufg`: This signal is the global buffered output of `clk0_bufg_in`, used as the primary system clock output `clk0`.\n- `clk0_bufg_in`: This signal is directly derived from the PLL\u2019s output and fed into a global buffer to generate `clk0_bufg`. \n- `mcb_drp_clk_bufg_in`: This is an output from the PLL which is used as an input to a BUFGCE for generating the `mcb_drp_clk`.\n- `clkfbout_clkfbin`: This is an important feedback path used within the PLL for maintaining the stability and regulation of the output frequencies.\n- `locked`: This signal is an output from the PLL indicating whether the PLL has locked onto the input frequency which in turn is used to control the enable pin of `U_BUFG_CLK1` and the `BUFPLL_MCB`.\n- `rst0_sync_r`: This is a shift register used for generating the synchronized reset signal `rst0`. It ensures that the reset signal is stable and synchronized with `clk0`.\n- `rst_tmp`: This signal is used as a pre-condition for the reset synchronizer. It combines the asynchronous system reset with a lock status to manage the reset conditions.\n- `powerup_pll_locked`: This register holds the state of PLL lock after a power-up and is used in conjunction with `sys_rst` to generate the `async_rst` signal.\n- `syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked`: Similar to `powerup_pll_locked`, this register also holds the status of PLL lock but is synchronized with `clk0`.\n- `sys_rst`: This signal conditions the raw reset input `sys_rst_i` based on whether the reset is active-high or active-low (as determined by `C_RST_ACT_LOW`). It is used for internal resetting within the module.\n- `bufpll_mcb_locked`: This is the stable, conditioned output from the BUFPLL_MCB, indicating that the PLL and buffers are locked and operating correctly. This is used to manage internal power up and synchronization states."

                    "text": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \n**Internal Signals:** `clk_2x_0, clk_2x_180, clk0_bufg, clk0_bufg_in, mcb_drp_clk_bufg_in, clkfbout_clkfbin, locked, rst0_sync_r, rst_tmp, powerup_pll_locked, syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked, sys_rst, bufpll_mcb_locked`\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `clk_2x_0, clk_2x_180`: These signals are intermediate outputs from the PLL that are at twice the frequency of `sys_clk` and 180-degree phase-shifted versions. They serve as inputs to the BUFPLL_MCB block for further processing.\n- `clk0_bufg`: This signal is the global buffered output of `clk0_bufg_in`, used as the primary system clock output `clk0`.\n- `clk0_bufg_in`: This signal is directly derived from the PLL\u2019s output and fed into a global buffer to generate `clk0_bufg`. \n- `mcb_drp_clk_bufg_in`: This is an output from the PLL which is used as an input to a BUFGCE for generating the `mcb_drp_clk`.\n- `clkfbout_clkfbin`: This is an important feedback path used within the PLL for maintaining the stability and regulation of the output frequencies.\n- `locked`: This signal is an output from the PLL indicating whether the PLL has locked onto the input frequency which in turn is used to control the enable pin of `U_BUFG_CLK1` and the `BUFPLL_MCB`.\n- `rst0_sync_r`: This is a shift register used for generating the synchronized reset signal `rst0`. It ensures that the reset signal is stable and synchronized with `clk0`.\n- `rst_tmp`: This signal is used as a pre-condition for the reset synchronizer. It combines the asynchronous system reset with a lock status to manage the reset conditions.\n- `powerup_pll_locked`: This register holds the state of PLL lock after a power-up and is used in conjunction with `sys_rst` to generate the `async_rst` signal.\n- `syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked`: Similar to `powerup_pll_locked`, this register also holds the status of PLL lock but is synchronized with `clk0`.\n- `sys_rst`: This signal conditions the raw reset input `sys_rst_i` based on whether the reset is active-high or active-low (as determined by `C_RST_ACT_LOW`). It is used for internal resetting within the module.\n- `bufpll_mcb_locked`: This is the stable, conditioned output from the BUFPLL_MCB, indicating that the PLL and buffers are locked and operating correctly. This is used to manage internal power up and synchronization states."

It adeptly handles various clock input configurations\u2014both differential (via sys_clk_p and sys_clk_n) and single-ended (via sys_clk)\u2014and is capable of generating multiple frequency and phase-varied clock outputs through a sophisticated phase-locked loop (PLL_ADV). The module effectively manages reset synchronization, using an input reset sys_rst_i, and ensures smooth buffering of the output clocks.\n\nKey output ports include clk0, a primary clock output; rst0, a synchronized reset signal; async_rst, an asynchronous reset signal; higher-frequency clock outputs, sysclk_2x and sysclk_2x_180; and specialized outputs like mcb_drp_clk for memory control, as well as pll_ce_0 and pll_ce_90 for phase-locked loop control signals, and pll_lock, an indicator of the PLL's lock status.\n\nInternally, the module uses signals such as clk_2x_0 and clk_2x_180 for double-frequency outputs from the PLL and rst0_sync_r for generating the synchronized reset output. Other signals such as clk0_bufg for buffering or sys_rst for conditioning the reset input based on configuration, play crucial roles in maintaining stability and performance.\n\nThe Verilog implementation entails several sections: input handling which conditions the reset signal and selects the appropriate clock source based on configuration; a PLL block configured for best performance depending on parameter inputs like input clock period and output divides; buffering sections for output clocks; synchronization logic for reset signals to ensure proper system reset behavior; and a BUFPLL_MCB block that manages high-speed output clocks and synchronization signals.\n\nCollectively, these components and their organization within the 'infrastructure' module ensure robust, flexible, and reliable clocking and reset logic suitable for complex digital systems, making it a foundational block in system design."
