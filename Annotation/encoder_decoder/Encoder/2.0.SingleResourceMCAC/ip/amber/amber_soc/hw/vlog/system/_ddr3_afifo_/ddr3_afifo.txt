Module-level comment: The `ddr3_afifo` module serves as an asynchronous FIFO interfacing with DDR3 memory, maintaining data integrity across different clock domains. It handles DDR commands, write, and read operations through instances of generic `afifo` modules, each tailored for specific data types and sizes. It operates on system and DDR clocks, processing commands, addresses, and data based on buffer fullness and ensuring proper synchronization and data flow control between system and DDR domains.
