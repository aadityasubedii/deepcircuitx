    "spec": "Module name: a25_fetch. Module specification: The 'a25_fetch' module is responsible for instruction fetching within a CPU, determining whether to fetch from an instruction cache or external memory. The input ports include i_clk (clock signal), i_reset (reset signal), i_mem_stall, i_exec_stall, i_conflict (all stall and conflict signals), i_system_rdy (system readiness), i_iaddress and i_iaddress_nxt (current and next instruction addresses), i_iaddress_valid (address validity), i_cache_enable (cache operation enable flag), i_cache_flush (cache flush signal), i_cacheable_area (defines cacheable memory areas), and i_wb_read_data, i_wb_ready (external memory or bus data and readiness). The output ports comprise o_fetch_stall (stall status of fetch operation), o_fetch_instruction (fetched instruction data), o_wb_req (request signal to the memory bus), and o_wb_address (memory address requested). Internally, the module employs signals like core_stall, cache_stall, cache_read_data128, cache_read_data, sel_cache, uncached_instruction_read, address_cachable, icache_wb_req, wait_wb, wb_req_r, and wb_rdata32 to handle data fetching logic, manage stalls, cache read operations, instruction selection, and address management. The code is structured into sections handling cache configuration, memory access, data selection, and output signal generation, integrating with an a25_icache instance for cache operations, and managing stall conditions across different internal and external feedback loops. This modular approach ensures efficient instruction fetching based on current system state, caching configurations, and address validity.",

Module specification: The 'a25_fetch' module is responsible for instruction fetching within a CPU, determining whether to fetch from an instruction cache or external memory. The input ports include i_clk (clock signal), i_reset (reset signal), i_mem_stall, i_exec_stall, i_conflict (all stall and conflict signals), i_system_rdy (system readiness), i_iaddress and i_iaddress_nxt (current and next instruction addresses), i_iaddress_valid (address validity), i_cache_enable (cache operation enable flag), i_cache_flush (cache flush signal), i_cacheable_area (defines cacheable memory areas), and i_wb_read_data, i_wb_ready (external memory or bus data and readiness). The output ports comprise o_fetch_stall (stall status of fetch operation), o_fetch_instruction (fetched instruction data), o_wb_req (request signal to the memory bus), and o_wb_address (memory address requested). Internally, the module employs signals like core_stall, cache_stall, cache_read_data128, cache_read_data, sel_cache, uncached_instruction_read, address_cachable, icache_wb_req, wait_wb, wb_req_r, and wb_rdata32 to handle data fetching logic, manage stalls, cache read operations, instruction selection, and address management. The code is structured into sections handling cache configuration, memory access, data selection, and output signal generation, integrating with an a25_icache instance for cache operations, and managing stall conditions across different internal and external feedback loops. This modular approach ensures efficient instruction fetching based on current system state, caching configurations, and address validity."
