Module-level comment: This module decompiles ARM25 processor instructions for debugging and analysis. It decodes incoming instructions, tracks processor state, and generates human-readable disassembly. The module processes various input signals, extracts instruction components, and uses task-based decoding for different instruction types. It writes detailed execution traces to a file, including instruction mnemonics, operands, memory accesses, and interrupt events, providing a comprehensive view of the processor's operation.
