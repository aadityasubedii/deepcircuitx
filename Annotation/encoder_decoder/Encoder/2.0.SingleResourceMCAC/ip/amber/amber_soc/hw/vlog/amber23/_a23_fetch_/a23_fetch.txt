Module-level comment: The `a23_fetch` module manages data fetching by deciding whether to access data from cache or through the Wishbone bus based on cachability and exclusivity. It uses internal signals like `cache_stall` and `wb_stall` and conditional logic to control data flow, interfacing with cache and bus subsystems through `a23_cache` and `a23_wishbone` blocks, ensuring seamless and efficient data transactions respective to system readiness and operational criteria.
