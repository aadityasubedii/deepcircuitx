Module name: mcb_soft_calibration_top. 

Module specification: The `mcb_soft_calibration_top` module is designed for calibrating DDR memory interfaces within a Memory Controller Block (MCB) through soft and hard calibration processes. It operates based on user-provided configuration parameters like memory type and calibration mode and is equipped with provisions to skip certain calibration processes. The module handles memory interfacing calibration activities based on input signals such as `UI_CLK` (user interface clock), `RST` (reset), and `PLL_LOCK` (PLL lock indicator) along with several other calibration command and data signals related to the MCB operations. Outputs include signals indicating the completion of calibration processes and readiness for memory operations. The module employs internal signals such as `IODRP_ADD` and `IODRP_SDI` for dynamic reconfiguration addressing and data input, alongside buffers and tristate control signals (`IODRP_SDO`, `IODRP_BKST`, `RZQ_TOUT`, etc.) for interfacing with external calibration hardware. It integrates control logic that bounds conditionally on memory types and skip flags for calibrations, interfacing with I/O through dedicated modules (`IODRP2`, `IOBUF`) for data transmission and reception. This module serves as a primary element to ensure optimally tuned memory transactions by dynamically managing timing and electrical characteristics through its numerous calibration mechanisms.
