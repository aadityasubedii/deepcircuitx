It allows for selective memory access using byte enable signals enabling byte-wise read and write operations. The module takes a 128-bit data input which it writes to or reads from the memory depending on the byte enable signals and write enable control. It features parameterizable data and address widths, supports simultaneous read and write operations through dual-port RAM, and triggers a warning if the data width or address width parameters are incorrectly set."

It is used to time updates to the memory state and ensure consistent read and write operations.\n- `i_write_data`: The 128-bit data input meant to be written into the memory. This bus carries the data which the module will write to the SRAM when write operations are enabled.\n- `i_write_enable`: A control signal which, when asserted (high), permits data to be written into the SRAM. If deasserted (low), the SRAM will be in a read or idle state.\n- `i_address`: An 8-bit address signal specifying the memory location in the SRAM where data should be written to or read from.\n- `i_byte_enable`: An input consisting of 16 bits (derived from DATA_WIDTH/8) that serves as a mask to determine which bytes of the i_write_data should be actually written into the addressed memory location. Each bit corresponds to a specific byte of the data bus.\n\nOutput ports: o_read_data.\nExplanation: \n- `o_read_data`: A 128-bit output that presents data read from the SRAM.
