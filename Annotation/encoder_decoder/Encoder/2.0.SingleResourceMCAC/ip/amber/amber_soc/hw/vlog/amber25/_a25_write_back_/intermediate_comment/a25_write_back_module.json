    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"a25_write_back\" module manages data transfer during the write-back stage of a pipeline. It captures and registers memory read data, data validity, and destination register when not stalled, supplying continuous outputs. Utilizes registers updated on rising clock edges to maintain output consistency and data validity when non-stalled, ensuring smooth data handling in pipeline operations."
