Module name: eth_registers. Module specification: The eth_registers module implements control and status registers for an Ethernet MAC interface. It handles configuration settings such as MAC address, interrupt masks, flow control, and MII management. The module features input ports for data (DataIn), address (Address), control signals (Rw, Cs), clocks (Clk, TxClk, RxClk), reset (Reset), and various status and control flags. Output ports include data (DataOut), configuration settings (e.g., r_RecSmall, r_Pad, r_HugEn), control flags, and interrupt output (int_o). Internal signals are used for address decoding, register selection, data storage, and interrupt management. The module is organized into sections for register definitions, read/write operations, interrupt handling, and clock domain crossing. It uses multiple instantiations of the eth_register submodule
