Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module implements a soft calibration process for a memory controller block (MCB), performing input termination calibration, DQS signal dynamic calibration, and parameter broadcasting. It utilizes a state machine to control the calibration process, adjusting P-term and N-term values, and DQS delays. Key input ports include UI_CLK (main clock), RST (reset), PLL_LOCK (PLL lock status), and various MCB-related signals. Output ports include DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL (calibration completion indicator), SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ (self-refresh request), and multiple MCB control signals. Internal signals such as STATE (current state), P_Term and N_Term (termination values), and DQS_DELAY (DQS delay value) are used to manage the calibration
