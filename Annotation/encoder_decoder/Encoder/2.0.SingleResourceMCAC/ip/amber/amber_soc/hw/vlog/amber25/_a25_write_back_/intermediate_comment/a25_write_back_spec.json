    "spec": "Module name: a25_write_back\n\nModule specification:\nThe \"a25_write_back\" module is designed to handle the data transfer during the write-back stage of a pipeline architecture in digital systems. Its main function is to capture and store memory read data, the validity of this data, and the corresponding destination register, providing continuous output of these values when the system is not stalled. The module processes the following input ports: `i_clk` (system clock), `i_reset` (system reset, unused in current context), `i_mem_stall` (stall signal), `i_mem_read_data` (memory read data), `i_mem_read_data_valid` (validity of the read data), `i_mem_load_rd` (destination register for the read data), `i_daddress` (memory address, captured but unused), and `i_daddress_valid` (validity signal for the memory address, not utilized). The output ports are `o_wb_read_data` (stored memory data output), `o_wb_read_data_valid` (validity of output data), and `o_wb_load_rd` (destination register ID for the output data). Internally, the module utilizes registers: `mem_read_data_r`, `mem_read_data_valid_r`, and `mem_load_rd_r` to hold and pass the respective states and values based on the system's stall status, and `daddress_r` to record the address input when not stalled. The module's logic is divided into sections controlled by clock-triggered blocks that update these internal states only if there's no stall signal, ensuring data is transferred efficiently during optimum system conditions.",
