    "spec": "Module name: a23_fetch. Module specification: The a23_fetch module orchestrates data fetching processes for a system incorporating caching mechanisms and a Wishbone bus interface. It determines whether to access data from cache or directly from memory based on input configurations such as cachability, exclusivity, and cache operational status. Key inputs include `i_clk` for synchronization, `i_address` and `i_address_nxt` for specifying current and potential future memory addresses, alongside various controls like `i_write_data`, `i_write_enable`, and `i_cache_enable`. Outputs incorporate `o_read_data` for delivering fetched data and signals such as `o_fetch_stall` and Wishbone interface specifics (`o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, etc.) to effectively manage interfacing with external memory. Internally, the module uses signals such as `cache_stall` and `wb_stall` to manage internal flow and operation stalls, and `sel_cache` or `sel_wb` to choose between fetching from cache or Wishbone bus. The code is organized into sections initializing the internal and interfacing connections to the cache and Wishbone bus, governed by blocks `a23_cache` and `a23_wishbone` which handle cache operations and Wishbone bus communication respectively, facilitating coordinated data transactions based on system-readiness and the nature of the access requested.",

                    "text": "Module name: a23_fetch. Module specification: The a23_fetch module orchestrates data fetching processes for a system incorporating caching mechanisms and a Wishbone bus interface. It determines whether to access data from cache or directly from memory based on input configurations such as cachability, exclusivity, and cache operational status. Key inputs include `i_clk` for synchronization, `i_address` and `i_address_nxt` for specifying current and potential future memory addresses, alongside various controls like `i_write_data`, `i_write_enable`, and `i_cache_enable`. Outputs incorporate `o_read_data` for delivering fetched data and signals such as `o_fetch_stall` and Wishbone interface specifics (`o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, etc.) to effectively manage interfacing with external memory. Internally, the module uses signals such as `cache_stall` and `wb_stall` to manage internal flow and operation stalls, and `sel_cache` or `sel_wb` to choose between fetching from cache or Wishbone bus. The code is organized into sections initializing the internal and interfacing connections to the cache and Wishbone bus, governed by blocks `a23_cache` and `a23_wishbone` which handle cache operations and Wishbone bus communication respectively, facilitating coordinated data transactions based on system-readiness and the nature of the access requested."
