It processes inputs related to coprocessor operations, coprocessor register identifiers, and write data to adjust cache settings such as enabling/disabling cache and defining cacheable, updateable, and disruptive areas.

It halts the operations of the module during system stalls, ensuring data integrity and consistency.\n- i_copro_opcode1, i_copro_opcode2: Coprocessor operation codes. These specify the types of operation being requested by the processor.\n- i_copro_crn, i_copro_crm, i_copro_num: Coprocessor register identifiers. They specify which coprocessor registers are targeted for read or write operations.\n- i_copro_operation: Type of coprocessor operation. Determines if the operation is a read or write, affecting how the coprocessor handles data and register access.\n- i_copro_write_data: Data to be written into the coprocessor's register.\n- i_fault: Fault indication input. Signals the presence of a fault, triggering fault status and address storage.\n- i_fault_status: Specifies the fault status in case of an error.\n- i_fault_address: Indicates the memory address involved during a fault.\n\nOutput ports:\n- o_copro_read_data: Coprocessor read data output. Outputs data from coprocessor registers based on read operations specified.\n- o_cache_enable: Cache enable signal. Controls whether caching is enabled or disabled based on the coprocessor configuration.\n- o_cache_flush: Cache flush signal. Triggers a cache flush operation based on write commands to specific coprocessor registers.\n- o_cacheable_area: Specifies the area of memory that is cacheable. Defined by write operations to a specific coprocessor register.\n\nExplanation: \nEach input and output port plays a crucial role in managing the coprocessor configuration and handling specific system operations like cache control and fault management. The inputs determine the operations and the configurations to apply, while the outputs provide the current state and results of these configurations, directly affecting memory management and system stability."
