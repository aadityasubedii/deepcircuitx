Module name: a23_decompile. Module specification: This module is a decompilation and debugging tool for an ARM processor design, designed to monitor instruction execution, decode instructions, and write detailed information to a log file. It takes inputs such as clock (i_clk), instruction-related signals (i_instruction, i_instruction_valid, i_instruction_execute, etc.), interrupt signals, and program counter information. The module doesn't have any output ports as it writes information to a file instead. Internal signals include various decoded instruction components (e.g., imm32, reg_n, opcode), execution flags, and temporary storage. The module is structured into several blocks: signal decoding, instruction type determination, instruction execution monitoring, interrupt handling, and log file writing. It processes each instruction, extracts relevant information, formats it into human-readable text, and writes it to a log file, providing insights into the processor's operation, including
