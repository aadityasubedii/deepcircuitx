Module-level comment: The 'iodrp_mcb_controller' manages memory read/write operations via a Dynamic Reconfigurable Port. Inputs include memory address, data, and control signals, with outputs handling data readout and DRP interfacing. It utilizes an internal FSM to sequence operations, control data flow, and manage state transitions effectively, ensuring synchronized operations with the DRP_CLK. This module efficiently handles complex memory interfacing tasks, adhering to DRP protocols through structured state-driven logic.
