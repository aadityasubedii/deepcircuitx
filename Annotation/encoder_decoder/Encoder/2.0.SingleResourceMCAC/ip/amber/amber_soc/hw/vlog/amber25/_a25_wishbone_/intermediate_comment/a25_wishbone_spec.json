    "spec": "Module name: a25_wishbone. Module specification: The 'a25_wishbone' module is designed for managing data transfers and arbitration on a shared bus in a multi-master bus configuration using the Wishbone protocol. \n\nThis module synchronizes operations using an input clock (`i_clk`) and can be reset (`i_reset`). It handles bus access requests from three ports (`i_port0_req`, `i_port1_req`, `i_port2_req`), including read and write operations specified by (`i_port0_write`, `i_port1_write`, `i_port2_write`). Data, byte enables, and addresses for these operations are input through `i_port0_wdata`, `i_port1_wdata`, `i_port2_wdata`, `i_port0_be`, `i_port1_be`, `i_port2_be`, and `i_port0_addr`, `i_port1_addr`, `i_port2_addr` respectively. The responses to these requests are managed and sent as output through `o_port0_ack`, `o_port1_ack`, `o_port2_ack` for acknowledgments and `o_port0_rdata`, `o_port1_rdata`, `o_port2_rdata` for read data.\n\nInternally, the module uses arrays of signals like `wbuf_valid`, `wbuf_accepted`, `wbuf_write`, `wbuf_wdata`, `wbuf_be`, `wbuf_addr`, and `wbuf_rdata_valid` to manage buffer states, validate data transactions, and control data transfers corresponding to each port. The operation of deciding which buffer's data to transfer is managed through `new_access` and `serving_port` signals.\n\nThe code is structured into several blocks, first initializing and interfacing with storage buffers (`a25_wishbone_buf` instances) for all three ports. These buffers handle the data staging and signal conditioning for each port's bus access. Then, conditional statements within an always block decide which port's request to serve based on buffer validations. The bus transaction signals such as `o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_cyc`, and `o_wb_stb` are allocated and managed based on the active port determined by the `serving_port`. The module processes Wishbone bus responses and manages internal read data validations synchronously.\n\nThis modular and systemic approach ensures that the a25_wishbone module efficiently coordinates the concurrency inherent in a multi-master bus system, optimizing for data integrity and orderly communication.",

It handles arbitration among three requestor ports (port0, port1, and port2), controlling access to the bus based on request and acknowledgment signals. Each port can issue read or write requests with associated data, byte enables, and addresses. The module arbitrates access, manages data transfers, and routes responses back to the appropriate port. Essentially, it acts as an interface coordinator for concurrent access to a shared resource, ensuring orderly communication and data integrity in a multi-master bus configuration."

It handles arbitration among three requestor ports (port0, port1, and port2), controlling access to the bus based on request and acknowledgment signals. Each port can issue read or write requests with associated data, byte enables, and addresses. The module arbitrates access, manages data transfers, and routes responses back to the appropriate port. Essentially, it acts as an interface coordinator for concurrent access to a shared resource, ensuring orderly communication and data integrity in a multi-master bus configuration."

Module specification: The 'a25_wishbone' module is designed for managing data transfers and arbitration on a shared bus in a multi-master bus configuration using the Wishbone protocol. \n\nThis module synchronizes operations using an input clock (`i_clk`) and can be reset (`i_reset`). It handles bus access requests from three ports (`i_port0_req`, `i_port1_req`, `i_port2_req`), including read and write operations specified by (`i_port0_write`, `i_port1_write`, `i_port2_write`). Data, byte enables, and addresses for these operations are input through `i_port0_wdata`, `i_port1_wdata`, `i_port2_wdata`, `i_port0_be`, `i_port1_be`, `i_port2_be`, and `i_port0_addr`, `i_port1_addr`, `i_port2_addr` respectively. The responses to these requests are managed and sent as output through `o_port0_ack`, `o_port1_ack`, `o_port2_ack` for acknowledgments and `o_port0_rdata`, `o_port1_rdata`, `o_port2_rdata` for read data.\n\nInternally, the module uses arrays of signals like `wbuf_valid`, `wbuf_accepted`, `wbuf_write`, `wbuf_wdata`, `wbuf_be`, `wbuf_addr`, and `wbuf_rdata_valid` to manage buffer states, validate data transactions, and control data transfers corresponding to each port. The operation of deciding which buffer's data to transfer is managed through `new_access` and `serving_port` signals.\n\nThe code is structured into several blocks, first initializing and interfacing with storage buffers (`a25_wishbone_buf` instances) for all three ports. These buffers handle the data staging and signal conditioning for each port's bus access. Then, conditional statements within an always block decide which port's request to serve based on buffer validations. The bus transaction signals such as `o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_cyc`, and `o_wb_stb` are allocated and managed based on the active port determined by the `serving_port`. The module processes Wishbone bus responses and manages internal read data validations synchronously.\n\nThis modular and systemic approach ensures that the a25_wishbone module efficiently coordinates the concurrency inherent in a multi-master bus system, optimizing for data integrity and orderly communication."
