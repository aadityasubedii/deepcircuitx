    "spec": "Module name: xs6_sram_256x21_line_en. Module specification: The xs6_sram_256x21_line_en is a Verilog module that implements a dual-port RAM with two interfaces using a RAMB8BWER block in Single-Port Dual Clock (SDP) mode, primarily for write and read operations. It accepts inputs through ports `i_clk` (the clock signal that synchronizes all operations), `i_write_data` (21-bit data to be written to RAM), `i_write_enable` (a boolean that when high, enables writing operation), and `i_address` (an 8-bit address specifying the RAM location for data access). The module outputs data through `o_read_data`, which is a 21-bit output composed of concatenated data from internal signals `read_data_lo` and `read_data_hi`. These internal signals, derived from lower (`DOADO` port) and higher (`DOBDO` port) sections of the RAM, respectively, are essential for reconstructing the data output as specified in the concatenation and bit manipulation in the output assignment. Within the code, the `RAMB8BWER` instantiation configures the RAM attributes and connections for dual clock, read and write operations, address handling, and data input divisions. Initialization sequences are included to check parameter configurations matching the expected functional settings, ensuring robust module operation.",

It has two interfaces: a write interface where data is input through `i_write_data` and controlled via `i_write_enable`, and a read interface where data is output through `o_read_data`. The module is parameterized with `DATA_WIDTH` of 21 bits and `ADDRESS_WIDTH` of 8 bits to specify the size of the memory address and data being handled. Internally, data is split and managed between two separate sections labeled as 'read_data_lo' and 'read_data_hi' for lower and higher parts of the RAM, respectively. The module is designed to operate under a single clock `i_clk` for both read and write operations, ensuring data synchronization. An initialization sequence checks parameter configurations to ensure that they match the expected settings for proper module functionality."

It has a width determined by the `DATA_WIDTH` parameter.\n- `i_write_enable` controls whether the data on the `i_write_data` line should be written into the RAM.

Module specification: The xs6_sram_256x21_line_en is a Verilog module that implements a dual-port RAM with two interfaces using a RAMB8BWER block in Single-Port Dual Clock (SDP) mode, primarily for write and read operations. It accepts inputs through ports `i_clk` (the clock signal that synchronizes all operations), `i_write_data` (21-bit data to be written to RAM), `i_write_enable` (a boolean that when high, enables writing operation), and `i_address` (an 8-bit address specifying the RAM location for data access). The module outputs data through `o_read_data`, which is a 21-bit output composed of concatenated data from internal signals `read_data_lo` and `read_data_hi`. These internal signals, derived from lower (`DOADO` port) and higher (`DOBDO` port) sections of the RAM, respectively, are essential for reconstructing the data output as specified in the concatenation and bit manipulation in the output assignment. Within the code, the `RAMB8BWER` instantiation configures the RAM attributes and connections for dual clock, read and write operations, address handling, and data input divisions. Initialization sequences are included to check parameter configurations matching the expected functional settings, ensuring robust module operation."
