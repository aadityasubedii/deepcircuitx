    "spec": "Module name: eth_outputcontrol.\nModule specification: The `eth_outputcontrol` module manages the Ethernet output signals, Mdo (data output) and MdoEn (data output enable), based on various input signals and operational states. It processes Ethernet writing operations synchronized by the Clk (clock) input, and it accesses control signals such as Reset, WriteOp (write operation), NoPre (omit preamble), InProgress (write operation in progress), ShiftedBit (current data bit), BitCounter (processed bits counter), and MdcEn_n (module enable, active low). The output ports include Mdo, the actual transmitted data bit, and MdoEn, which enables the Mdo signal when high. Internally, the module uses SerialEn to determine the active state of Mdo and MdoEn based on operational conditions like WriteOp and BitCounter. The design incorporates delay elements (MdoEn_2d, MdoEn_d, Mdo_2d, Mdo_d) that stabilize and synchronize the output signals with the clock cycle, ensuring controlled data output timing. The main sections of the Verilog code involve assignments to compute SerialEn based on input conditions, and sequential `always` blocks conditioned on the Clk or Reset signals to handle the logic and timing of outputs\u2014processing conditions to selectively activate and transpose outputs for proper Ethernet signaling. This coordinated approach ensures precise output control suited for Ethernet communication tasks.",

It acts as a control signal enabling data flow through specific parts of the module logic.\n- MdoEn_2d, MdoEn_d: These are registers that form a delay pipeline for the output enable signal (MdoEn). `MdoEn_2d` holds the intermediate state coming through calculation in always blocks, and `MdoEn_d` serves as the stage right before the actual output (MdoEn).
