It interfaces with external systems through the Wishbone bus protocol for data exchanges and control signals. The core handles instruction fetching, decoding, executing, memory access, and write-back stages, illustrated by its internal submodule structure like `a25_fetch`, `a25_decode`, `a25_execute`, `a25_mem`, and `a25_write_back`. The core manages core stalls, interrupt requests, and communicates with a coprocessor and caches, ensuring compute operations are efficiently executed depending on the instructions it receives and the status of internal and external controls and flags."
