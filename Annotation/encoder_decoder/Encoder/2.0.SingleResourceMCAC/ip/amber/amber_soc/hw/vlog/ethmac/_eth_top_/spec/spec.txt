Module name: eth_top. Module specification: The eth_top module is the top-level module for an Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) implementation. It integrates various sub-modules to handle Ethernet communication, including MIIM for PHY management, MAC control for flow control and pause frame handling, transmit and receive Ethernet MAC modules, Wishbone interface for communication with a host system, and MAC status monitoring. The module handles both transmit and receive paths, manages buffer descriptors, and provides interfaces for external connections such as MII signals. Input ports include clock and reset signals, Wishbone bus inputs, MII interface inputs, and management interface inputs. Output ports include Wishbone bus outputs, MII interface outputs, management interface outputs, and interrupt signals. Internal signals are used for configuration, control, status monitoring, synchronization, and data path management. The module is organized into several blocks, including eth_miim for PHY management
