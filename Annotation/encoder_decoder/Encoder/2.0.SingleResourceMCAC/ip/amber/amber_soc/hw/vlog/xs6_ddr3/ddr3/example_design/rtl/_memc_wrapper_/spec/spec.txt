Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: This module serves as a wrapper for a memory controller (MCB) interface, supporting multiple AXI and native port interfaces for external memory interaction. It takes various input signals including system clocks, reset, and memory interface signals, and provides output signals for memory control and data transfer. The module supports up to 6 AXI slave interfaces and 6 native port interfaces, each with its own set of command, write, and read signals. Internal signals handle AXI communication and user override functions. The module instantiates an mcb_ui_top submodule which likely contains the core memory controller logic. The wrapper is designed to be flexible, supporting different memory types and sizes through various parameters. It handles clock management, memory calibration, and provides status information. The code is structured into sections for parameter declarations, port declarations, internal signal declarations, and the instantiation of the mcb_ui_
