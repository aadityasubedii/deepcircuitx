Module name: generic_sram_byte_en. Module specification: The 'generic_sram_byte_en' is a Verilog module designed to function as a byte-enable SRAM memory. It uses a clock signal (`i_clk`) to synchronize its operations, notably reading from and writing to the memory. The module's key inputs include: `i_clk`, which synchronizes the activities inside the memory, `i_write_data`, which carries potential data for memory storage, `i_write_enable`, a control signal to allow or block write operations, `i_address`, an address input specifying the SRAM cell for operations, and `i_byte_enable`, a bit mask that decides which bytes of the data are to be written. The output, `o_read_data`, outputs data stored at the address specified. Internally, the module uses an array `mem` as its memory storage structured based on `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDRESS_WIDTH` parameters, and an index `i` for iterating through byte-specific operations. In the code, the `always` block executes on the positive edge of `i_clk`, either outputting the data held at a specific address or updating that data selectively based on `i_byte_enable`. This module is suitable where only particular sections of a data word need update, preserving the integrity of the untouched bytes.
