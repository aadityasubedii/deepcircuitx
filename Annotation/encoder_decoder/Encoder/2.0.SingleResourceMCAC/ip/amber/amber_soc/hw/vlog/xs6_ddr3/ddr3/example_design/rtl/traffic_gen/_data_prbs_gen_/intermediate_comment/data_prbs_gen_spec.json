    "spec": "Module name: data_prbs_gen.\nModule specification: The 'data_prbs_gen' module is designed to generate pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) mechanism. The module operates based on input signals that include a clock input (`clk_i`), which synchronizes the operations; a clock enable (`clk_en`), which dictates when the LFSR state is updated; and a reset signal (`rst_i`), which initializes or resets internal states when active. Additionally, there is a 32-bit seed modifier input (`prbs_fseed_i`), a seed initialization trigger (`prbs_seed_init`), and a seed value input (`prbs_seed_i`) tailored by the `PRBS_WIDTH` parameter. The output of the module is `prbs_o`, representing the current PRBS state with the same width as the `PRBS_WIDTH`. Internally, the module utilizes two key signals: `prbs` which mirrors the LFSR (`lfsr_q`) excluding the feedback generation bit, facilitating direct output access; and `lfsr_q` itself which is the core shift register used in pseudo-random generation. The operations within the code are divided into two major blocks: the first is a sequential logic block sensitive to `clk_i` that handles LFSR updates under different conditions (reset, seeding, and clock enabled states), and the second is a combinatorial logic block ensuring the output `prbs` consistently reflects the updated LFSR state barring the feedback bit. This structural setup allows for efficient PRBS generation based on configurable parameters and controlled input triggers.",

This module is controlled by a clock input (`clk_i`) and a reset input (`rst_i`). It supports enabling the clock (`clk_en`) and initializing the seed (`prbs_seed_init`). A conditional initial seed setting is also possible, which is adjusted by the parameters `prbs_seed_i`, `prbs_fseed_i`, and a predefined pattern. The behavior of the seed initialization is further modified depending on whether eye testing (`EYE_TEST`) is enabled or not.

All sequential logic operations are synchronized to the rising edge of this clock.  \n- clk_en: Clock enable signal. It controls the updating process of the internal LFSR state. Only when this signal is high (`1`), the internal LFSR updates its state based on the BGalois feedback.\n- rst_i: Reset input. Active-high reset pulse that initializes or resets the internal states and LFSR when high (`1`).\n- prbs_fseed_i: A 32-bit input used for modifying the seed value. This value is added to `prbs_seed_i` during the seed initialization phase.\n- prbs_seed_init: Seed initialization trigger. When high (`1`), it enables the initialization of the LFSR with a new seed value derived from `prbs_seed_i` and `prbs_fseed_i`.\n- prbs_seed_i: An input provided to load a new seed value into the LFSR.
