Module-level comment: The `eth_register` module implements a parameterizable register storing data synchronized by a clock, with control for data write and reset conditions. It handles input data on the rising edge of the clock, conditioned by write enable, and features both asynchronous and synchronous reset functionalities. The output registers the data unless overridden by reset signals, ensuring stability and predefined initialization under reset scenarios.
