    "module": "Module-level comment: The `eth_outputcontrol` module controls Ethernet output signaling, specifically the data output (Mdo) and its enable signal (MdoEn), reacting to input statuses like ongoing write operations and bit transmission stages. It operates on a clock-driven mechanism, resetting with specified signals, and employs intermediate staging registers (MdoEn_2d, MdoEn_d, Mdo_2d, Mdo_d) to ensure output timing and stability. The control logic uses conditions from bit counters and operations types to effectively manage output transitions for reliable Ethernet communication."
