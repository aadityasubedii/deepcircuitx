Module-level comment: The "wishbone_arbiter" module arbitrates access among multiple masters to a shared Wishbone bus, managing master and slave interactions efficiently. It employs input and output controls for address, data, and control signals, utilizing internal states and registers to select active masters and route transactions to designated slaves based on address mapping, controlled by cycle and strobe signals. This ensures synchronized communication adhering to bus protocols.
