The FIFO uses gray code for safely transferring the read and write pointers between the clock domains to avoid synchronization issues. It allows pushing data (`i_data`) into the FIFO when not full (`o_full` is low) and popping data (`o_data`) from the FIFO when not empty (`o_empty` is low). The FIFO handles the data with a parameterizable width `D_WIDTH` and uses a depth of 4 for storage. The full and empty states are determined based on the comparison of gray-coded pointers between the read and write domains."
