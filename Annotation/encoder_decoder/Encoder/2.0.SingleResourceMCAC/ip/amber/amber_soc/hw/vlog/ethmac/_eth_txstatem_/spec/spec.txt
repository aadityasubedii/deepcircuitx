Module name: eth_txstatem.
Module specification: The "eth_txstatem" module simulates the state machine of an Ethernet transmitter, handling various states such as Idle, Inter-Packet Gap (IPG), Preamble, Data transmission, Padding (PAD), Frame Check Sequence (FCS), Jamming, BackOff, and Defer. It utilizes input signals like MTxClk (clock), Reset, and others like ExcessiveDefer and CarrierSense to determine transitions between these states based on network conditions and frame transmission requirements. Key outputs include status flags for each state (e.g., StateIdle, StateIPG) and signals to trigger state transitions (e.g., StartFCS, StartJam). Internal signals such as StartIdle and StartPAD help manage transitions to specific states under certain conditions. Additionally, the module defines rules such as Rule1 to decide IPG timing. The Verilog code comprises two always blocks triggered by the positive edge of MTxClk or Reset, managing state transitions and rule assignments, respectively. These blocks ensure that the transmitter correctly proceeds through its state machine based on incoming data and network events, maintaining robust and correct data transmission over Ethernet.
