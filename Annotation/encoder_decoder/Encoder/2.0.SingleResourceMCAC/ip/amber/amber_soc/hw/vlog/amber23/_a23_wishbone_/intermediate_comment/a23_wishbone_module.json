    "module": "Module-level comment: The `a23_wishbone` module interfaces a core processor with a Wishbone bus, managing data transactions through a state machine. It handles read and write operations, supports exclusive access, and deals with bus stalls using input controls like `i_select`, `i_write_data`, and `i_address`. Outputs control the bus cycle status and data transmission. The module's functionality is implemented via signal assignments and state transitions based on bus and cache activity acknowledgments."
