Module name: v6_data_gen. Module specification: This module is a versatile data generator for memory testing, supporting various data patterns including PRBS, address-based, walking 1's and 0's, neighbor patterns, and fixed data. It takes inputs such as clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), data mode (data_mode_i), addresses (m_addr_i, addr_i), and control signals (cmd_start*), and outputs generated data (data_o) based on the selected mode. The module uses internal signals like prbs_data for PRBS generation, acounts for address-based patterns, w1data for walking patterns, and hdata for hammer patterns. It incorporates several functional blocks including PRBS generation, address pattern generation, walking pattern generation, and neighbor pattern generation. The module supports different data widths and burst lengths, implementing complex logic to handle various numbers of D
