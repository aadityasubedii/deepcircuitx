    "spec": "Module name: generic_sram_byte_en. Module specification: The 'generic_sram_byte_en' is a Verilog module designed to function as a byte-enable SRAM memory. It uses a clock signal (`i_clk`) to synchronize its operations, notably reading from and writing to the memory. The module's key inputs include: `i_clk`, which synchronizes the activities inside the memory, `i_write_data`, which carries potential data for memory storage, `i_write_enable`, a control signal to allow or block write operations, `i_address`, an address input specifying the SRAM cell for operations, and `i_byte_enable`, a bit mask that decides which bytes of the data are to be written. The output, `o_read_data`, outputs data stored at the address specified. Internally, the module uses an array `mem` as its memory storage structured based on `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDRESS_WIDTH` parameters, and an index `i` for iterating through byte-specific operations. In the code, the `always` block executes on the positive edge of `i_clk`, either outputting the data held at a specific address or updating that data selectively based on `i_byte_enable`. This module is suitable where only particular sections of a data word need update, preserving the integrity of the untouched bytes.",

It uses a clock signal (`i_clk`) to synchronize operations. The memory can selectively write data (`i_write_data`) to certain bytes determined by a byte-enable vector (`i_byte_enable`). This conditional write operation happens at specified addresses (`i_address`). If the write enable signal (`i_write_enable`) is active, the data from `i_write_data` can be written to the memory one byte at a time based on the `i_byte_enable`. If `i_write_enable` is not active, it outputs the data stored at the memory address specified by `i_address` to `o_read_data`. This module is particularly useful for scenarios where only specific sections of a data word need to be updated, without altering the entire word, enhancing flexibility and efficiency in memory operations."

All activities inside the module, especially reading from and writing to the memory, are triggered by the rising edge of this clock signal.\n- `i_write_data`: This input port carries the data to be potentially written into the memory. The data width is defined by the `DATA_WIDTH` parameter.\n- `i_write_enable`: A signal that allows or disables writing to the memory. When this signal is high (`1`), the module performs writing operations; otherwise, it outputs the content of a memory address.\n- `i_address`: This input specifies the address in memory where data is to be read from or written to. The size of this address bus is determined by the `ADDRESS_WIDTH` parameter.\n- `i_byte_enable`: This is a mask of enable signals (one per byte of `i_write_data`) that determine which bytes of the data should actually be written into the memory. The width of this vector is `DATA_WIDTH/8`, as each byte has an enable bit.\n\nOutput ports: `o_read_data`. \nExplanation: \n- `o_read_data`: This output port provides the data read from the memory location specified by `i_address`.

It functions as the storage unit of the SRAM, holding the data values that can be read and modified based on operations specified by the input ports.\n  \n- `i`: This is an integer used as an index within the loop in the always block.
