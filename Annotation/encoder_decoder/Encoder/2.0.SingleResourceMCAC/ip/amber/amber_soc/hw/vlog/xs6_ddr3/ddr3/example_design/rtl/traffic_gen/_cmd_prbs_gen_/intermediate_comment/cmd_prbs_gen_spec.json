    "spec": "Module name: cmd_prbs_gen. \nModule specification: The 'cmd_prbs_gen' module is designed to generate pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) using a configurable linear feedback shift register (LFSR). The module's functionality varies based on parameters such as the command type (ADDRESS, INSTR, BLEN), sequence width, and data width as specified in the parameter settings. The input ports include `clk_i` (the main clock signal), `prbs_seed_init` (a seed initialization signal), `clk_en` (a clock enable signal that allows LFSR updates), and `prbs_seed_i` (the initial seed for the LFSR). The output port, `prbs_o`, delivers the generated PRBS. Internally, the module employs several signals: `ZEROS` (a wire providing zero-padding based on address width), `prbs` (a register holding the final PRBS output), and `lfsr_q` (the main LFSR which generates the sequence). The code contains multiple generate blocks catering to different configurations of the LFSR taps based on the 'PRBS_CMD', sequence length specified by 'PRBS_WIDTH', and potentially different logic for different FPGA families like SPARTAN6. Each block configures feedback taps and seed loading operations specific to the PRBS sequence required.",

The module's functionality varies based on parameters such as the command type (ADDRESS, INSTR, BLEN), sequence width, and data width as specified in the parameter settings. The input ports include `clk_i` (the main clock signal), `prbs_seed_init` (a seed initialization signal), `clk_en` (a clock enable signal that allows LFSR updates), and `prbs_seed_i` (the initial seed for the LFSR). The output port, `prbs_o`, delivers the generated PRBS. Internally, the module employs several signals: `ZEROS` (a wire providing zero-padding based on address width), `prbs` (a register holding the final PRBS output), and `lfsr_q` (the main LFSR which generates the sequence). The code contains multiple generate blocks catering to different configurations of the LFSR taps based on the 'PRBS_CMD', sequence length specified by 'PRBS_WIDTH', and potentially different logic for different FPGA families like SPARTAN6. Each block configures feedback taps and seed loading operations specific to the PRBS sequence required."
