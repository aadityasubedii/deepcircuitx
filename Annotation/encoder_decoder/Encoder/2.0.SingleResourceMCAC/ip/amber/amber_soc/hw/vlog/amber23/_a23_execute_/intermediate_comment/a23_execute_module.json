    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements the execute stage of an ARM processor pipeline. It performs arithmetic and logical operations, handles data accesses, and manages processor state updates. The module uses an ALU, barrel shifter, multiplier, and register bank to process instructions based on input control signals and current processor state. It generates output signals for memory operations, register writes, and status updates."
