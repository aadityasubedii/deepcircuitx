Module-level comment: The `eth_random` module generates pseudo-random numbers for Ethernet collision scenarios using an LFSR mechanism. Inputs like `RetryCnt`, `StateJam`, and `ByteCnt` modify the randomness to suit network conditions. The module uses a 10-bit shift register `x` for sequence generation, with conditional latching and output based on network state and retry constraints, ensuring appropriate backoff timings in Ethernet networking.
