    "spec": "Module name: generic_sram_line_en.\nModule specification: The \"generic_sram_line_en\" module simulates a generic static random-access memory (SRAM) with parametrizable data width and address size, incorporating an enable functionality for writing. The module accepts a clock input (`i_clk`) for operation synchronization, a data input (`i_write_data`) whose width is defined by the `DATA_WIDTH` parameter, a write enable signal (`i_write_enable`), and an address input (`i_address`) defined by the `ADDRESS_WIDTH` parameter. It outputs data read from the SRAM (`o_read_data`) with the width matching `DATA_WIDTH`. Internally, the module uses a memory array (`mem`) which stores data; the array is indexed by the address and can be initialized to zero based on the `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO` parameter setting. This parameter-driven initialization is handled in a conditional generate block. The main logic, encapsulated within an `always` block triggered on the rising edge of 'i_clk', controls the reading and writing operations: it writes the input data to the specified memory address when `i_write_enable` is high, or outputs the data from the specified memory address to `o_read_data` when `i_write_enable` is low, specifically setting `o_read_data` to zero during write operations.",

The operations within the module (e.g., reading and writing to memory) are synchronized to the rising edge of this clock signal.\n- **i_write_data**: This input provides the data that should be written into the memory. The data width is defined by the parameter `DATA_WIDTH`. This data is written to the memory location specified by `i_address` when `i_write_enable` is active.\n- **i_write_enable**: This input is a control signal that enables writing to the memory. When this signal is high (`1`), the data from `i_write_data` is written to the memory at the location specified by `i_address`. When low (`0`), the memory write operation is disabled, and the module outputs data from the specified memory location instead.\n- **i_address**: This port specifies the memory address for the read or write operation. The address width is defined by the parameter `ADDRESS_WIDTH`.\n\nOutput ports: o_read_data.\nExplanation:\n- **o_read_data**: This output port holds the data read from the memory. If `i_write_enable` is low, the data from the memory location addressed by `i_address` is placed on this output. The data width of the output matches `DATA_WIDTH`.
