Module name: a23_ram_register_bank.
Module specification: The "a23_ram_register_bank" Verilog module simulates a register bank integral to a CPU, specifically tailored for handling various modes and operations of a processor based on the ARM architecture. It features an array of input and output ports including `i_clk` for the clock signal, `i_fetch_stall` to control operation during fetch stalls, and multiple mode-select inputs like `i_mode_exec`, `i_mode_exec_nxt`, and `i_mode_rds_exec` that manage execution contexts. Data inputs include `i_pc` for the program counter and `i_reg` for general register data, alongside control signals for managing these registers. Outputs consist of data lines `o_rm`, `o_rs`, `o_rd`, `o_rn`, and `o_pc` which output values from selected registers or the program counter depending on the operation and selected mode.

Internally, the module uses signals like `mode_idec`, `mode_exec`, `mode_rds` for decoding operational modes, addresses such as `rm_addr`, `rds_addr`, `rn_addr`, `wr_addr` for managing register select lines and write operations. These address lines connect to register banks `reg_ram_n`, `reg_ram_m`, `reg_ram_ds` designed for storing register values in different modes. Special handling for the program counter and linked status flags involves signals like `r15_out_rm`, `r15_out_rm_nxt`, and `r15_out_rn`, which manage outputs based on the current operation and flag states.

The module's code is structured into logical blocks that handle initial signal assignments, conditional output assignments based on selected register and mode, and an always block which performs the actual register updates and signal processing based on the clock and stall conditions. Each block of code contributes to dynamically managing CPU state in a cycle-accurate manner, ensuring correct emulation of the processor's registration and execution control functionalities. This detailed and organized approach in the design enables clear operation understanding and effective emulation of a CPU's register management system.
