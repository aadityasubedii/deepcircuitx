Module-level comment: The a25_barrel_shift module performs versatile 32-bit data shifting, offering a choice between quick and full-barrel shifter mechanisms. Functionality is determined by input signals such as shift amount, function type, and carry inputs. Output includes shifted data, carry out, and a stall signal to indicate when the full shifter is engaged. Internally, the module uses two instances of a25_shifter with registers managing state between clock cycles, ensuring accurate and responsive shifting operations based on dynamic input conditions.
