Module-level comment: 
/**
 * This module generates various data patterns for memory testing and simulation.
 * It supports fixed, address-based, PRBS, and walking/hammer patterns.
 * The module uses multiplexers to select between different data generation
 * methods based on input mode and control signals. It implements pattern
 * generation logic for different data widths (32/64/128 bits) and DQ pin
 * configurations. The output data is dynamically updated based on clock
 * enables and burst counters.
