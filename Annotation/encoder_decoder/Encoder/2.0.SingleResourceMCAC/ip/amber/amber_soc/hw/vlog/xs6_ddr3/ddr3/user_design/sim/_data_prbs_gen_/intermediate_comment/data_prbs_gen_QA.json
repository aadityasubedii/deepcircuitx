It uses a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) mechanism to generate the sequence. The PRBS generation can be initialized with either a default seed or a combination of a seed input `prbs_seed_i` and a forced seed `prbs_fseed_i`, modified by a preset constant. The generator supports optional enable and reset functionalities. The sequence generation process can be influenced by an eye test condition, `EYE_TEST`, to potentially adjust its operation for testing purposes. The output `prbs_o` provides the generated pseudo-random binary sequence based on the internal LFSR state."

If low, the LFSR contents are not updated, effectively pausing the PRBS generation.\n- `rst_i`: Reset input which, when asserted high, initializes the LFSR state with a seed combination or resets it to a fixed state based on the `EYE_TEST` setting.\n- `prbs_fseed_i`: Input for a forced seed value, typically used to forcibly alter the seed of the LFSR at initialization or during an eye test condition.\n- `prbs_seed_init`: Signal to initialize the seed of the LFSR. When high, it triggers the LFSR to load with a specified seed or a combination of specified and forced seeds.\n- `prbs_seed_i`: Input seed provided typically during initialization, which can be either used alone or modified by the forced seed based on the module\u2019s configuration.\n\nOutput ports: prbs_o.\n\nExplanation:\n- `prbs_o`: Output port that provides the pseudo-random binary sequence generated by the module.

It stands as the core of the PRBS generator, where the feedback and shifting operation of the LFSR takes place. The most significant bit (bit 32 when PRBS_WIDTH is 32) is used in the feedback mechanism to generate the new sequence in conjunction with other bits as per the LFSR polynomial implemented.
