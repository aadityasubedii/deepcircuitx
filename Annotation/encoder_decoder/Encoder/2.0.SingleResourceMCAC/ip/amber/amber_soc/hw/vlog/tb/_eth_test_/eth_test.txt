Module-level comment: The 'eth_test' module simulates Ethernet packet transmission and reception, leveraging state machines for managing data flow and PHY interactions via MDIO. Inputs include clocks and data signals, while outputs control the transmission status and data. Internal states manage transmission phases, CRC checks, and MDIO operations. Useful for testing and validating Ethernet-based designs in hardware simulation environments.
