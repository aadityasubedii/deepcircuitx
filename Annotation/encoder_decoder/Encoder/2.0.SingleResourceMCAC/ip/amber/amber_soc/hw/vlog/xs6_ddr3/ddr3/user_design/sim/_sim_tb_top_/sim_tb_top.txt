Module-level comment: 
/**
 * DDR3 Memory Controller Testbench
 * 
 * This module simulates and verifies a DDR3 memory controller by instantiating
 * a DDR3 memory model, memory controller, and test module. It generates clock
 * and reset signals, sets up memory interface parameters, and monitors for 
 * errors and calibration completion. The testbench logs results and performs
 * timing checks, providing a comprehensive verification environment for the
 * memory controller design.
