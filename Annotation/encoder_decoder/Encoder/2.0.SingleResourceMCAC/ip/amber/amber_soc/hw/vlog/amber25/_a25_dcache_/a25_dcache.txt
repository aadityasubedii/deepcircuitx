Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements a configurable data cache for a processor, supporting multiple ways (2-8).
It handles read/write operations, cache hits/misses, and line fills to improve memory access performance.
The module uses a state machine to manage cache operations, including initialization, tag/data memory access,
way selection, and exclusive access. It interfaces with the processor and write buffer, handling requests,
stalls, and data transfers. The cache employs parameterized values for flexibility and includes debug support.
