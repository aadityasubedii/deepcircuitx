    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'a25_fetch' module fetches instructions for a CPU, choosing between an instruction cache and external memory. It manages stalls and memory bus requests, integrates with a cache controller (`a25_icache`), and selectively outputs fetched instructions based on the system readiness, caching policies, and address validity. It uses various internal control and data signals to synchronize cache operations, handle data alignment, and manage wait conditions for efficient instruction retrieval."
