The input ports include `memcell_address`, an 8-bit address of the memory cell; `write_data`, an 8-bit data to be written; `rd_not_write`, a control signal indicating the operation mode; `cmd_valid` indicating the validity of command inputs; `use_broadcast` for enabling broadcasting; `sync_rst` for synchronous reset; and `DRP_CLK` as the clock signal. The outputs are `read_data`, an 8-bit data read from the memory; `rdy_busy_n` indicating the module's status; `DRP_CS` as a chip select signal; `DRP_SDI` outputting serial data input; `DRP_ADD` showing the address phase; and `DRP_BKST` for broadcasting status. Internal signals like `memcell_addr_reg`, `data_reg`, `shift_through_reg`, and others help in data manipulation and state management. The code structures around a finite state machine with states like READY, DECIDE, ADDR_PHASE, DATA_PHASE, and several transitioning states that control the operation flow based on input signals and internal conditions.

The input ports include `memcell_address`, an 8-bit address of the memory cell; `write_data`, an 8-bit data to be written; `rd_not_write`, a control signal indicating the operation mode; `cmd_valid` indicating the validity of command inputs; `use_broadcast` for enabling broadcasting; `sync_rst` for synchronous reset; and `DRP_CLK` as the clock signal. The outputs are `read_data`, an 8-bit data read from the memory; `rdy_busy_n` indicating the module's status; `DRP_CS` as a chip select signal; `DRP_SDI` outputting serial data input; `DRP_ADD` showing the address phase; and `DRP_BKST` for broadcasting status. Internal signals like `memcell_addr_reg`, `data_reg`, `shift_through_reg`, and others help in data manipulation and state management. The code structures around a finite state machine with states like READY, DECIDE, ADDR_PHASE, DATA_PHASE, and several transitioning states that control the operation flow based on input signals and internal conditions. Key operations include data and address loading, decision-making based on command validity, data shifting, and state transitions triggered on the clock edge with handlers for synchronous reset conditions."
