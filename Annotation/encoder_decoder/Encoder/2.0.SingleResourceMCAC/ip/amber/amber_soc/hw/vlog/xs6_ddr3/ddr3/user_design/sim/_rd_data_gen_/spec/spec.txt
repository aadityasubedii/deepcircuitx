Module name: rd_data_gen.
Module specification: The `rd_data_gen` module is designed for generating read data tailored to different FPGA families, specifically "SPARTAN6" or "VIRTEX6". This module accepts inputs such as clock (`clk_i`), reset (`rst_i`), PRBS seed (`prbs_fseed_i`), data mode (`data_mode_i`), command validation signals (`cmd_valid_i`), fixed data (`fixed_data_i`), address (`addr_i`), burst length (`bl_i`), and data readiness signals (`data_rdy_i`) from downstream components. Outputs include command ready (`cmd_rdy_o`), last word indication (`last_word_o`), user burst length count as one (`user_bl_cnt_is_1_o`), data validity (`data_valid_o`), and data output (`data_o`). Internal signals like `prbs_data`, `cmd_start`, and various data handling and conditional registers manage the module's operational logic in generating data and controlling data flow and burst sequences. The module features dual generate blocks that leverage specific sub-modules (`sp6_data_gen` and `v6_data_gen`) for handling data generation according to the specified FPGA family. These blocks execute data pattern logic, synchronization processes, and command handling based on modular parameters and dynamically assigned values from the inputs, streamlining operations according to the configured memory interface and burst length settings.
