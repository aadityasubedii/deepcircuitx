It monitors the execution of instructions, decodes them, and writes detailed information about each instruction to a log file. The module analyzes various signals from the processor, including instruction opcodes, register values, and memory accesses. It then formats this information into human-readable text, providing insights into the processor's operation, such as executed instructions, register contents, memory operations, and control flow changes. This tool is likely used for debugging and validating the processor's behavior during simulation or testing."
