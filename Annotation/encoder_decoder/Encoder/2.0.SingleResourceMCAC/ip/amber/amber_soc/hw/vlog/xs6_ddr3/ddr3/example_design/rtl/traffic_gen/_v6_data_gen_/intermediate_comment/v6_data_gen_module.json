    "module": "Module-level comment: This module generates data patterns for memory testing, including address-based, PRBS, walking 1's/0's, neighbor, and hammer patterns. It selects and produces the appropriate pattern based on input signals and configuration parameters. The module implements various data generation algorithms, supports different data widths and burst lengths, and includes logic for handling complex patterns like walking and hammer across various bit widths. It uses internal counters, shift registers, and pattern-specific data registers to create the desired output data sequence."
