Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: This module serves as a wrapper for a memory controller interface, supporting multiple ports for command, write, and read operations (up to 6 ports: p0 to p5), and includes AXI interfaces for up to 6 AXI slaves (s0 to s5). It is designed to handle memory operations for DDR3 memory, providing functionality for memory calibration, arbitration between ports, and various timing parameters. The module has numerous input ports including clocks (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), PLL signals (pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, pll_lock), reset (async_rst), and command/data signals for each port. Output ports include memory interface signals (mcbx_dram_addr, mcbx_dram_ba, etc.), status indicators (calib
