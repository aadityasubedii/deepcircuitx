Module name: infrastructure. 

Module specification: 

The 'infrastructure' module is specifically tailored for clock management in digital systems. It adeptly handles various clock input configurations—both differential (via sys_clk_p and sys_clk_n) and single-ended (via sys_clk)—and is capable of generating multiple frequency and phase-varied clock outputs through a sophisticated phase-locked loop (PLL_ADV). The module effectively manages reset synchronization, using an input reset sys_rst_i, and ensures smooth buffering of the output clocks.

Key output ports include clk0, a primary clock output; rst0, a synchronized reset signal; async_rst, an asynchronous reset signal; higher-frequency clock outputs, sysclk_2x and sysclk_2x_180; and specialized outputs like mcb_drp_clk for memory control, as well as pll_ce_0 and pll_ce_90 for phase-locked loop control signals, and pll_lock, an indicator of the PLL's lock status.

Internally, the module uses signals such as clk_2x_0 and clk_2x_180 for double-frequency outputs from the PLL and rst0_sync_r for generating the synchronized reset output. Other signals such as clk0_bufg for buffering or sys_rst for conditioning the reset input based on configuration, play crucial roles in maintaining stability and performance.

The Verilog implementation entails several sections: input handling which conditions the reset signal and selects the appropriate clock source based on configuration; a PLL block configured for best performance depending on parameter inputs like input clock period and output divides; buffering sections for output clocks; synchronization logic for reset signals to ensure proper system reset behavior; and a BUFPLL_MCB block that manages high-speed output clocks and synchronization signals.

Collectively, these components and their organization within the 'infrastructure' module ensure robust, flexible, and reliable clocking and reset logic suitable for complex digital systems, making it a foundational block in system design.
