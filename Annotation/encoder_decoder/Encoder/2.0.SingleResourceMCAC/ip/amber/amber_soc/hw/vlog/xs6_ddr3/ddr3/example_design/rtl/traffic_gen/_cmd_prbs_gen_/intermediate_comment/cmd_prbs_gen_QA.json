It operates with different widths and types of operations depending on the PRBS command (e.g., \"ADDRESS\", \"INSTR\", \"BLEN\"). The core mechanism relies on linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) configured differently for generating sequences of varying lengths (32-bit, 64-bit, and company defined). The LFSR seeds and taps can be initialized and influenced by external inputs, and the generated sequences are output through the 'prbs_o' port. This module is configurable for different FPGA families and address/data widths, making it versatile for various applications requiring PRBS, such as communication systems, data integrity checks, and simulation tests."
