It works with both read and write operations to or from the memory cells. The module operates under a digital clock, and processes data using an FSM (Finite State Machine) to progress through various states to handle address setup, data transfer, and ready/busy signaling. The module includes several configuration states for addressing and data phases, and special handling for broadcasting and shifting requirements tied to specific hardware versions (addressed using the conditional `ifdef`). It interfaces with external components or systems through a series of input and output connections, specifically designed to manage direct memory access within hardware configurations."
