Module name: sp6_data_gen. Module specification: The sp6_data_gen module is a versatile data generation module designed for memory testing and data simulation applications. It generates various data patterns based on input configuration parameters and control signals. The module supports fixed data, address-based data, pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) data, and pattern data such as "walking 1s and 0s" and "hammer" patterns. It takes inputs including clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), PRBS seed (prbs_fseed_i), data mode (data_mode_i), control signals (cmd_startA to cmd_startE), fixed data (fixed_data_i), address (addr_i), and burst count (user_burst_cnt). The primary output is the generated data (data_o). Internally, the module uses signals like prbs_data, adata,
