    "module": "Module-level comment: The xs6_sram_256x21_line_en module is a dual-port RAM utilizing a RAMB8BWER block in SDP mode for simultaneous read and write operations. It processes 21-bit data inputs and 8-bit addresses, synchronizing actions with a single clock. The output is assembled by concatenating and manipulating bits from internal signals `read_data_lo` and `read_data_hi`, derived from different segments of the RAM, to produce a 21-bit output. This setup ensures efficient data storage and retrieval within the specified address space."
