Module-level comment: 
/**
 * This module implements a 4096x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality for Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGAs.
 * It uses 8 RAMB16BWER primitives to create a dual-bank memory structure (4 primitives per bank).
 * The module supports 32-bit read and write operations with byte-level write enables.
 * It uses a 12-bit address input, allowing for 4096 memory locations across two banks.
 * The implementation includes initialization parameters for each SRAM block, enabling pre-loading of memory contents.
