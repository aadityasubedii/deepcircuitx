It supports generating fixed data, address-based data, pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) data, and pattern data such as \"walking 1s and 0s\" and \"hammer\" patterns. Selection and configuration of the data output are controlled by parameters like `data_mode_i`, addressing schemes, data width (`DWIDTH`), and specific pattern-generating configurations triggered by command inputs (`cmd_startA` to `cmd_startE`). This module is versatile for applications requiring dynamic data pattern generation, such as in memory testing or data simulation environments. The output data is altered dynamically depending on various command signals and data modes, making it flexible for complex data manipulation and testing scenarios."

It is the main clock signal for synchronizing the operations within the module.\n- `rst_i`: Reset input. It is used to reset the internal states of the module to initial or default values.\n- `prbs_fseed_i`: Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) initial seed value for generating PRBS data.\n- `data_mode_i`: Data mode input. This control signal selects the data generation mode (fixed, address-based, PRBS, or walking/hammer patterns).\n- `data_rdy_i`: Data ready input. It is a signal indicating whether the data path is ready to accept new data; often used in conjunction with FIFO buffers.\n- `cmd_startA` to `cmd_startE`: Command inputs. These signals initiate various actions or modes within the module, such as starting specific data generation procedures.\n- `fixed_data_i`: Fixed data input. This is used when the data mode is set to generate a fixed data pattern.\n- `addr_i`: Address input. Used for generating address-based data patterns or for other functionalities where address information is required.\n- `user_burst_cnt`: User burst count input. Indicates how many bursts of data are to be processed/generated.\n- `fifo_rdy_i`: FIFO ready input. Indicates if the FIFO (First In First Out memory buffer) is ready to be interacted with.\n\n**Output ports:**\n- data_o\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `data_o`: Data output. This is the primary output of the module, providing the generated data patterns based on the selected modes and inputs.\n"
