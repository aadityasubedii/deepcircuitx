Module name: eth_txethmac.  
Module specification: The "eth_txethmac" module is designed to handle Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) transmission functionalities. It orchestrates the entire transmission process, managing tasks such as padding frames to minimum length, performing Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) computations, detecting and handling collisions, and implementing backoff strategies upon collisions. Input ports include signals like MTxClk (transmission clock), Reset (resets the module), TxStartFrm and TxEndFrm (indicate the beginning and end of frame transmission), as well as TxData (8-bit data for transmission). Output ports such as MTxD (4-bit output data line), MTxEn (transmitter enable), and TxDone (signal completion of frame transmission) directly interface with the network physical layer. Several internal signals, such as ExcessiveDeferOccured and RetryMax, help in managing network traffic conditions by delaying transmissions or handling retries. The module's code is structured around multiple blocks: `eth_txcounters` manages byte and nibble counts crucial for controlling frame size and timing; `eth_txstatem` implements the main state machine controlling the data flow based on input conditions; and `eth_crc` and `eth_random` handle the CRC calculation and backoff randomization respectively during collision scenarios. This modular approach ensures clear functional partitioning aligned with specialized tasks within the transmission process.
