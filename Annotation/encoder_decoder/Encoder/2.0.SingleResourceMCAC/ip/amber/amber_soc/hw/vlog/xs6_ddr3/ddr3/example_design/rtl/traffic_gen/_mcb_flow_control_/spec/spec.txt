Module name: mcb_flow_control. Module specification: The "mcb_flow_control" module is designed to manage the flow of memory controller commands in a system, handling different operations such as read, write, and refresh. It synchronizes these operations using command and data path readiness signals. The module includes input ports like clk_i (clock input), rst_i (reset input), cmd_valid_i (command validity signal), cmd_i (command code), addr_i (memory address), bl_i (burst length), and several signals indicating the status of the command queue and data paths. The output ports include cmd_rdy_o (command ready signal), cmd_o (issued command code), addr_o, bl_o (associated address and burst length), cmd_en_o (command enable signal), and data path validity signals for both read and write operations. Internal signals like cmd_fifo_rdy (FIFO readiness), push_cmd (command push control), and xfer_cmd (command transfer control), along with current_state and next_state are used to maintain and transition through various operational states such as READY, READ, WRITE, and CMD_WAIT based on the system's requirements. The code significantly involves state machine logic in managing transitions between different operations, ensuring precise command handling and data integrity in memory operations.
