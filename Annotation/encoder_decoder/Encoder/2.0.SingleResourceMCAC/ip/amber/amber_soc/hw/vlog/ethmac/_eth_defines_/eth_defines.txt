Module-level comment: This Verilog code segment does not encapsulate a specific module but provides essential macro definitions and constant configurations for Ethernet interface parameters within a system. It sets up memory bases, register addresses, and default parameter values, crucial for managing Ethernet hardware functionalities like buffer sizes and address mapping. This structured configuration aids in the straightforward integration and reuse of Ethernet parameters across various modules or systems that engage in Ethernet communication, streamlining the design process for Ethernet connectivity and control within larger hardware designs.
