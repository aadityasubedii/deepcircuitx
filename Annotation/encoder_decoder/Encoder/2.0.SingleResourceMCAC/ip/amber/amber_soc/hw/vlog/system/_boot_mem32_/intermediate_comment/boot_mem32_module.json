    "module": "Module-level comment: The `boot_mem32` module interfaces with memory via a 32-bit Wishbone bus, facilitating read and write operations. It handles inputs like address, data, and control signals to manage memory transactions dynamically for various FPGA configurations. Internally, it uses flags for conditional compilation and debugging, interactively connecting with either generic or Xilinx-specific memory blocks. This setup allows for adaptable memory operations suited to different hardware environments."
