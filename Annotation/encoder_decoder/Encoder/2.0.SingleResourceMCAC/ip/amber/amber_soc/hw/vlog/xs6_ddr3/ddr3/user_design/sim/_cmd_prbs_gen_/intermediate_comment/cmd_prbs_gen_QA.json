The PRBS generation is guided by the 'PRBS_CMD' parameter, which specifies the type of sequence or functionality, such as generating addresses or instructions, with lengths specified by the 'PRBS_WIDTH' parameter. The module initiates with a seed ('prbs_seed_i') when triggered by 'prbs_seed_init'. Clock enable ('clk_en') controls the generation cycling. The PRBS output is accommodated to various operating conditions and requirements using parameters such as address width, data width, seed width, and specific address or instruction masks. Moreover, different architecture settings like 'FAMILY' can result in varying configurations within the PRBS generation logic, ensuring adaptability across different usage scenarios or FPGA configurations."

This input is used when a determined starting point is necessary for the PRBS.\n- clk_en: Clock enable signal that controls whether the PRBS generator should progress in its sequence generation or remain idle during a clock cycle.\n- prbs_seed_i: Seed value used to initialize the LFSR when 'prbs_seed_init' is asserted. This seed input allows external control over the starting state of the LFSR, impacting the sequence of values generated.\n\nOutput ports: prbs_o.\nExplanation:\n- prbs_o: The output port which presents the pseudo-random binary sequence generated by the LFSR. It serves as the primary output carrying the specified PRBS for utilization in other parts of a system or for further processing. Depending on the mode and parameters configured, this can represent addresses, instructions, or other data forms."

It is used primarily in conjunction with the generation of output sequences in certain modes (like 'INSTR' or 'BLEN') to fabricate parts of the PRBS output where zeros are strategically required as padding or inactive segments.\n- prbs: This registered signal holds the current value of the generated pseudorandom binary sequence. It accumulates the results from the LFSR operations and forms the actual PRBS output after being configured or masked according to the parameterized settings and logic conditions defined for specific device or PRBS characteristics.\n- lfsr_q: This signal represents the internal linear feedback shift register (LFSR), pivotal to generating the PRBS. Its size and functionality adapt based on the parameter 'PRBS_WIDTH' and the 'PRBS_CMD' value. Different polynomial tap configurations (for generating specific sequences based on feedback and shifting) are implemented within defined conditional blocks of the module, influencing how the bits in 'lfsr_q' shift and combine to generate the next state of the PRBS output."
