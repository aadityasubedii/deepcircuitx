It includes interfaces for memory operations via the Wishbone bus protocol, indicated by signals like `o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`, and others. The core handles different types of data operations and manages instruction fetch, decode, execution along with coprocessor interactions and fault detection. It also processes interrupts and manages system states based on operational flags and modes. This architecture is designed to support conditional execution, data alignment handling, and various addressing modes, contributing to a flexible and robust CPU design suitable for a range of applications requiring embedded processing.\n"
