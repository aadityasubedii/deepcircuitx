Module-level comment: The 'cmd_prbs_gen' module generates a configurable pseudo-random binary sequence using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR). It supports various PRBS commands and widths, with its behavior controlled by input signals for clock, initialization, and enable. Internally, it uses parameter-dependent generate blocks to adjust LFSR configurations and taps for different sequence requirements, supporting custom implementations tailored to different FPGA families and operational specifications.
