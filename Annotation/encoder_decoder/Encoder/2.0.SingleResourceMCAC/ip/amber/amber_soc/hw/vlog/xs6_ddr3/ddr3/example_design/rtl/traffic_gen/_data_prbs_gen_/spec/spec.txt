Module name: data_prbs_gen.
Module specification: The 'data_prbs_gen' module is designed to generate pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) mechanism. The module operates based on input signals that include a clock input (`clk_i`), which synchronizes the operations; a clock enable (`clk_en`), which dictates when the LFSR state is updated; and a reset signal (`rst_i`), which initializes or resets internal states when active. Additionally, there is a 32-bit seed modifier input (`prbs_fseed_i`), a seed initialization trigger (`prbs_seed_init`), and a seed value input (`prbs_seed_i`) tailored by the `PRBS_WIDTH` parameter. The output of the module is `prbs_o`, representing the current PRBS state with the same width as the `PRBS_WIDTH`. Internally, the module utilizes two key signals: `prbs` which mirrors the LFSR (`lfsr_q`) excluding the feedback generation bit, facilitating direct output access; and `lfsr_q` itself which is the core shift register used in pseudo-random generation. The operations within the code are divided into two major blocks: the first is a sequential logic block sensitive to `clk_i` that handles LFSR updates under different conditions (reset, seeding, and clock enabled states), and the second is a combinatorial logic block ensuring the output `prbs` consistently reflects the updated LFSR state barring the feedback bit. This structural setup allows for efficient PRBS generation based on configurable parameters and controlled input triggers.
