Module-level comment: The `interrupt_controller` module manages IRQ and FIRQ signals within a system, interfacing with device interrupts and a Wishbone bus. It processes incoming signals from UARTs, an Ethernet MAC, and timers, determining active interrupts based on configurable registers. The module uses parameters for data width handling and contains implementation blocks for data transactions, interrupt handling, and settings modification. Debugging support is embedded to track operations dynamically. This module is essential for prioritizing and responding to system interrupts efficiently.
