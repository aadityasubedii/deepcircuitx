Module-level comment: The 'infrastructure' module manages clock and reset functionalities for digital systems, handling differential and single-ended clock inputs to produce various frequency and phase-adjusted outputs via a PLL_ADV. It synchronizes and buffers outputs for stable operation, integrating clock generation, reset conditioning, and PLL synchronization within distinct Verilog blocks, crucial for robust system performance.
