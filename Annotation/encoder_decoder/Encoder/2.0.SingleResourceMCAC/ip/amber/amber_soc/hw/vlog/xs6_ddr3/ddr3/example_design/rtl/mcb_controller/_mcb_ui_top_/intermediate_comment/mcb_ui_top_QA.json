It supports multiple ports (up to 6) and can be configured for different memory types, data widths, and AXI interfaces. The module handles memory command scheduling, data read/write operations, and provides both native and AXI interfaces. It also includes calibration logic and supports various memory timing parameters. The module can be customized through numerous parameters to adapt to different system requirements and memory configurations."
