    "module": "Module-level comment: The `read_data_path` module manages memory read operations for FPGAs, incorporating error detection and data validation. It utilizes input commands to generate and manage read requests, while processing data through asynchronous FIFOs, error checking mechanisms, and conditional logic tailored for specific FPGA families. This organization ensures accurate data handling, synchronization, and error management in high-performance environments."
