Module name: ddr3_afifo. Module specification: The ddr3_afifo is a Verilog module designed to function as a parametrizable asynchronous FIFO buffer interfacing with DDR3 memory, accommodating data integrity during transfers across different clock domains. The module uses system clock (`i_sys_clk`) for system-side operations and DDR clock (`i_ddr_clk`) for DDR-side operations. Input ports include enable signals (`i_cmd_en`, `i_wr_en`), data (`i_cmd_instr`, `i_cmd_byte_addr`, `i_wr_mask`, `i_wr_data`, `i_wr_addr_32`, `i_ddr_rd_data`), and status signals (`i_ddr_cmd_full`, `i_ddr_wr_full`, `i_ddr_rd_valid`). Output ports include fullness and validity indicators (`o_cmd_full`, `o_wr_full`, `o_rd_data`, `o_rd_valid`), and buffered outputs for DDR commands and write operations (`o_ddr_cmd_en`, `o_ddr_cmd_instr`, `o_ddr_cmd_byte_addr`, `o_ddr_wr_en`, `o_ddr_wr_mask`, `o_ddr_wr_data`, `o_ddr_wr_addr_32`). Internal signals (`cmd_empty`, `wr_empty`, `rd_empty`) indicate the status of the respective buffers, influencing control logic for data transportation. The module consists of three instances of a generic afifo block, each configured for interfacing commands, write operations, and read operations, thereby managing data flow efficiently between the system and DDR memory. Each afifo instance handles data buffering, synchronization, and transfer control, based on clock domain crossing requirements and buffer fullness. This architecture ensures robust data handling and synchronization between the asynchronous domains of the system and DDR memory.
