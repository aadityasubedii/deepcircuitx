    "spec": "Module name: eth_shiftreg.  \nModule specification: The 'eth_shiftreg' is a Verilog module designed to function as a shift register, primarily facilitating data operations for Ethernet-related applications, specifically handling the MDIO interface for PHY register read and write operations. It leverages input ports such as **Clk** (Clock signal for timing), **Reset** (resets outputs to a default state), **MdcEn_n** (enable signal, active low), **Mdi** (serial data input), **Fiad** (PHY device address), **Rgad** (PHY register address), **CtrlData** (control data for operations), **WriteOp** (distinguishes read and write operations), **ByteSelect** (data byte formation selector), and **LatchByte** (controls data latching). The output ports include **ShiftedBit** (serial bit output from the shift register), **Prsd** (parallel formatted data), and **LinkFail** (indicates link failure condition). Internally, the module uses **ShiftReg** (8-bit shift register for serial-to-parallel conversion), **Prsd** as already outlined, and a **LinkFail** signal indicating link status based on specific conditions.\n\nIn terms of operation, the module's always block is sensitive to the rising edge of the clock or a positive reset. With a reset, internal registers are cleared. When not reset and MdcEn_n is active, the module evaluates the ByteSelect to determine the loading method for ShiftReg\u2014from direct data input from Fiad, Rgad, or CtrlData, or through serial data shifting from Mdi. Depending on LatchByte conditions, Prsd is updated with data shifted into ShiftReg, and LinkFail is potentially modified depending on specific Rgad values and ShiftReg contents. The ShiftedBit output is directly mapped from the most significant bit of ShiftReg, signifying the next bit in line for serial transmission. This architectural setup orchestrates the sequence of serial data processing and parallel data formation essential for interfacing with Ethernet PHY components.",
