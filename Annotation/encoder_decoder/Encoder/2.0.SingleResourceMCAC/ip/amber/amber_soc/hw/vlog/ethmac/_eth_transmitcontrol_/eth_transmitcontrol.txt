Module-level comment: The `eth_transmitcontrol` module manages Ethernet control frame transmission, synchronizing processes with MTxClk. It uses input signals like TxReset and TxStartFrmIn to control outputs such as TxCtrlStartFrm and TxCtrlEndFrm, deciding frame start/end. Internally, it tracks states using registers (e.g., ByteCnt, SendingCtrlFrm) and employs condition checks and counters to orchestrate correct data flow and frame multiplexing, ensuring compliance with transmission protocols.
