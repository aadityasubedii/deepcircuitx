It consists of four 2048x8-bit SRAM blocks, each handling one byte of the 32-bit data. The module supports read and write operations with byte-level granularity, allowing selective writing to individual bytes within a 32-bit word. The SRAM can be initialized with custom values using the SRAM[0-3]_INIT_[0-63] parameters. The module provides an interface for clock, write data, write enable, address, byte enable, and read data, making it suitable for use in larger digital designs requiring on-chip memory with byte-level access."
