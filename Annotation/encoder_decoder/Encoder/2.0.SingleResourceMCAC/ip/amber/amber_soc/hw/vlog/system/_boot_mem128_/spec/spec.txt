Module name: boot_mem128.  
Module specification: The `boot_mem128` module is a memory interface designed for read and write operations through the Wishbone bus protocol with parameterization for data width, select width, and memory address width. It supports robust data transfer and timing control through the use of synchronization and acknowledgment signals tailored for various FPGA targets. The primary input ports include `i_wb_clk` for the clock signal, `i_wb_adr` for the memory address, `i_wb_sel` for active byte selection, `i_wb_we` for write enable, `i_wb_dat` for input data, `i_wb_cyc` indicating a bus cycle, and `i_wb_stb` for strobe signaling. The outputs are `o_wb_dat` carrying the data read from memory, `o_wb_ack` for operation acknowledgment, and `o_wb_err` signaling errors. Internally, the module utilizes signals like `start_write` and `start_read` to initiate memory operations, `read_data` and `write_data` for handling data, `byte_enable` derived from `i_wb_sel`, `address` computed from `i_wb_adr`, and operational debugging signals like `jitter_r` and `start_read_r`. The code integrates conditional compilation blocks for debug modes and specific FPGA targets management, alongside memory component instantiation for data storage and retrieval, effectively partitioned to work under different configurations and optional parameter files for extended flexibility.
