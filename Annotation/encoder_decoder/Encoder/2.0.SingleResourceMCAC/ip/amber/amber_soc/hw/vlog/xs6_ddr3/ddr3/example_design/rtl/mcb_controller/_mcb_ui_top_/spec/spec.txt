Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: This module serves as a top-level interface for a memory controller bridge (MCB) supporting multiple ports (up to 6) and various memory types. It manages memory command scheduling, data read/write operations, and provides both native and AXI interfaces. The module includes numerous input and output ports for clock management, reset, port-specific control signals, memory interface signals, and AXI interface signals for up to 6 ports. Internal signals handle address translation, command and data transfer, clock management, and status reporting for each port. The module is divided into several functional blocks, including a raw wrapper for MCB operations, port-specific interface logic (either native or AXI), and clock management circuitry. It supports customization through multiple parameters to adapt to different system requirements and memory configurations. The design incorporates arbitration mechanisms, calibration logic, and supports various memory timing parameters.
