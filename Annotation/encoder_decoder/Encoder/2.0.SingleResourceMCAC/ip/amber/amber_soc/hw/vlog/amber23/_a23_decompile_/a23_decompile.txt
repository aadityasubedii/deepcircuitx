Module-level comment: 
/*
This module decompiles and debugs an ARM processor design by monitoring instruction execution.
It decodes instructions, extracts relevant information, and writes human-readable logs.
The module processes input signals for instructions, interrupts, and program counter,
then formats and writes detailed execution information to a file for analysis.
It uses various internal signals and tasks to decode different instruction types,
handle interrupts, and generate formatted output for debugging purposes.
