Module-level comment: This module implements the instruction decode stage of an ARM processor. It takes fetched instructions and generates control signals for other processor components. The module decodes various instruction types, handles interrupts, and manages the processor's state machine. It uses a complex state machine to process different instruction types, including data processing, memory transfers, and multiplication. The module supports conditional execution, different operating modes, and handles various exceptions. It generates control signals for ALU operations, register selection, memory accesses, and status bit updates based on the decoded instructions and current processor state.
