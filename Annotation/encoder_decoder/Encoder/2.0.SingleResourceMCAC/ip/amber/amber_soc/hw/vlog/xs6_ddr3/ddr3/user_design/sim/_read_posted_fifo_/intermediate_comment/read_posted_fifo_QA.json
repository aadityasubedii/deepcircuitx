This module interfaces with various signals related to the command and data handling, ensuring the orderly and correct processing of read requests and data.\n\nKey functionalities include:\n1. Management of a FIFO to hold read commands and addresses, including logic to handle when the FIFO is full or empty.\n2. Signal generation and control for enabling read data movement when certain conditions are met, such as when the FIFO has enough space or specific wait conditions are satisfied.\n3. Signal condition checking to ensure that data can be read from the FIFO based on parameters like family type or burst length, along with maintaining proper counts of data asked for and received to manage buffer availability dynamically."
