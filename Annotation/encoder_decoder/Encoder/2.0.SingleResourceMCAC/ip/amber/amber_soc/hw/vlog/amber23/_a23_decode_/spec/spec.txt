Module name: a23_decode. Module specification: The a23_decode module is responsible for decoding ARM instructions and generating control signals for executing them in an ARM processor. It handles various instruction types including data processing, memory operations, branches, and interrupts. The module has input ports for clock, data, stall signals, interrupts, abort signals, and status information, while output ports control various aspects of CPU operation such as ALU functions, register selection, memory access, and status bit management. Internal signals are used for instruction decoding, control flow management, and tracking execution states. The module is structured with sections for instruction decoding, control state management, interrupt handling, and generating control signals for different instruction types. It includes a complex state machine to handle multi-cycle operations and special cases like multiply instructions and coprocessor operations. The module also handles privilege levels, exception processing, and interfaces with other CPU components to manage instruction execution, handle interrupts, and maintain
