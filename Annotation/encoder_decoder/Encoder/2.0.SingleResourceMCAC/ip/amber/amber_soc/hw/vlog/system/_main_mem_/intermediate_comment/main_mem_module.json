    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'main_mem' module simulates a parameterizable main memory interacting with a Wishbone bus, supporting 32-bit or 128-bit data widths. It processes read and write operations based on control signals like `i_wb_we` for write enable and `i_wb_stb` for active transfers. Memory accesses are controlled by internal signals such as `start_read` and `start_write`, with separate handling for different data widths managed through conditional generate blocks. The module ensures efficient memory management and operation synchronization via clock-driven processes and sequential and combinational logic elements."
