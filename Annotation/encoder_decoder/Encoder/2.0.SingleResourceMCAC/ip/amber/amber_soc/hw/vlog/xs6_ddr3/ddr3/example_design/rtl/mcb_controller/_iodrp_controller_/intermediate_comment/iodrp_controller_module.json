    "module": "Module-level comment: The `iodrp_controller` module handles data transactions via a DRP, supporting both read and write operations using a synchronous clock (`DRP_CLK`). It processes commands based on input signals (`memcell_address`, `write_data`, `rd_not_write`, `cmd_valid`) through an FSM with multiple states (e.g., `READY`, `DECIDE`, `ADDR_PHASE`). Outputs like `read_data` and DRP controls (`DRP_CS`, `DRP_ADD`, `DRP_BKST`) are managed dynamically. Internal signals and registers ensure data is correctly serialized and handled per the current operation phase."
