    "spec": "Module name: a25_alu.  \nModule specification: The a25_alu module functions as an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed to compute a variety of arithmetic and logical operations using two 32-bit operands (`i_a_in`, `i_b_in`), along with several control signals (`i_function`, `i_barrel_shift_carry`, `i_status_bits_carry`). The operations include addition, bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR), and extension operations (sign and zero extensions). Results are outputted as a 32-bit value (`o_out`) and flags (`o_flags` indicating zero, carry, overflow, and sign). Internally, the module leverages a selection of wires (`a`, `b`, `b_not`) to manage operands, handling swaps and bitwise negations based on the control input (`i_function`). It employs a carry calculation mechanism (`carry_in`, `carry_out`) and a 33-bit adder/subtractor for arithmetic operations, whose outputs are selectively routed to the output port via a multiplexer configured by `i_function`. Conditional compilation for Xilinx FPGAs (Spartan-6, Virtex-6) introduces specific hardware modules for better performance in these targets. General logic is encapsulated in sections dealing with input selection, arithmetic operations, conditional configuration for FPGA variants, selections for the output result based on the requested operation, and generation of flags depending on the output of selected operations. This comprehensive structure ensures modularity and flexibility to function across different hardware environments and operation requirements.",

                    "text": "Module name: a25_alu.  \nModule specification: The a25_alu module functions as an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed to compute a variety of arithmetic and logical operations using two 32-bit operands (`i_a_in`, `i_b_in`), along with several control signals (`i_function`, `i_barrel_shift_carry`, `i_status_bits_carry`). The operations include addition, bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR), and extension operations (sign and zero extensions). Results are outputted as a 32-bit value (`o_out`) and flags (`o_flags` indicating zero, carry, overflow, and sign). Internally, the module leverages a selection of wires (`a`, `b`, `b_not`) to manage operands, handling swaps and bitwise negations based on the control input (`i_function`). It employs a carry calculation mechanism (`carry_in`, `carry_out`) and a 33-bit adder/subtractor for arithmetic operations, whose outputs are selectively routed to the output port via a multiplexer configured by `i_function`. Conditional compilation for Xilinx FPGAs (Spartan-6, Virtex-6) introduces specific hardware modules for better performance in these targets. General logic is encapsulated in sections dealing with input selection, arithmetic operations, conditional configuration for FPGA variants, selections for the output result based on the requested operation, and generation of flags depending on the output of selected operations. This comprehensive structure ensures modularity and flexibility to function across different hardware environments and operation requirements."
