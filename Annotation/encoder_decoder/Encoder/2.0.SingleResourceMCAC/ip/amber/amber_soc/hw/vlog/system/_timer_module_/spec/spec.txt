Module name: timer_module. 

Module specification: The `timer_module` is a Verilog-based hardware module designed for managing three independent timers, each capable of counting down from a set value to generate interrupts, handle auto-reload functionality, and control countdown rates with different prescaler settings. It interfaces with a Wishbone bus to perform read and write operations on timer control and value registers. Input ports include `i_clk` (system clock), Wishbone address (`i_wb_adr`), byte select (`i_wb_sel`), write enable (`i_wb_we`), data bus input for writes (`i_wb_dat`), cycle input (`i_wb_cyc`), and strobe input (`i_wb_stb`). Output ports comprise Wishbone data bus output for reads (`o_wb_dat`), acknowledge signal (`o_wb_ack`), error signal (`o_wb_err`) always set to zero, and timer interrupts (`o_timer_int`) for the three timers. Internal control signals like `wb_start_write` and `wb_start_read` initiate write or read operations, and `wb_wdata32` and `wb_rdata32` handle data preparation for these transactions. The primary code sections include initialization of timer values and control registers, data bus interface handling using conditional compilation for different data width configurations (32-bit or 128-bit), timer countdown logic, interrupt management, and diagnostic outputs for debugging purposes. Each section is methodically designed to interact efficiently to control timer operations and communicate with the system's Wishbone bus, facilitating effective time-based event management in hardware systems.
