Module name: eth_transmitcontrol. 
Module specification: The `eth_transmitcontrol` module is designed for managing the control frame transmission in Ethernet systems, operating synchronously with the transmission clock (MTxClk). It integrates various input signals such as TxReset, TxUsedDataIn, TxAbortIn, TxStartFrmIn, TPauseRq, TxFlow, TxUsedDataOutDetected, and DlyCrcEn to dynamically adjust outputs that include TxCtrlStartFrm, TxCtrlEndFrm, and BlockTxDone for control frame management. Internal signals such as SendingCtrlFrm, CtrlMux, ByteCnt, and ControlEnd are used to maintain the state and progression of frame construction and transmission. The code is structured into blocks handling initialization, control frame start and end signaling, multiplexer control, and data processing based on conditions like DlyCrcCnt and ByteCnt. This module ensures that control frames are constructed and transmitted correctly considering the current state and network conditions, governed by a comprehensive set of rules embedded within the logic blocks for condition checking and signal assignment.
