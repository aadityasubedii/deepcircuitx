It includes functionalities for different types of input clock configurations (either differential or single-ended), generating multiple clock outputs with varying frequencies and phases using an advanced phase-locked loop (PLL_ADV). The module also manages reset synchronization and buffering outputs to ensure stable operation through reset conditions and clock multiplications. It is parameterized to accept different configurations for clock handling and includes mechanisms to generate a stable reset signal and maintain synchronization of internal state with the clock signals.

They provide the primary clock source to the module when the module is configured to use a differential clock input.\n- `sys_clk`: This input is used when the module is configured to support a single-ended clock input. It serves as an alternative to the differential pair for providing the clock source.\n- `sys_rst_i`: This is the system reset input, which is used to reset the internal states and outputs of the module, ensuring the system starts in a known state.\n\n**Output Ports:** `clk0, rst0, async_rst, sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, mcb_drp_clk, pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, pll_lock`\n**Explanation:** \n- `clk0`: This is a buffered and perhaps frequency-divided version of the input clock, serving as a primary clock output for downstream logic.\n- `rst0`: This is the primary reset output which is synchronized to `clk0`. It ensures that connected modules or components are also reset synchronously with the clock.\n- `async_rst`: Asynchronous reset signal, derived from system reset and PLL lock status, used to reset components that do not necessarily align with the synchronous system clock.\n- `sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180`: These are high-frequency versions of the system clock, output at twice the frequency of the original system clock and their inverted phase, respectively. Useful for operations requiring faster clock speeds or phase-shifted clocks.\n- `mcb_drp_clk`: This clock output is specifically used for memory controller block (MCB) operations, typically involving higher speeds and requiring stable and reliable clocking.\n- `pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90`: These outputs are control or enable signals for phase-locked loop operations, potentially aligning with clock outputs or for enabling specific clock-driven functionalities at zero or 90-degree phase shifts.\n- `pll_lock`: A signal indicating whether the PLL has successfully locked onto the input clock signal, providing a status output for health and stability checking of the clock generation system."
