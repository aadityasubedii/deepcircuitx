They are used to feed other components such as the BUFPLL_MCB for further processing.\n- clk0_bufg: This is the main clock signal, buffered for use throughout the system. It originates from clk0_bufg_in after being buffered to ensure it meets the driving requirements across the chip.\n- clk0_bufg_in: It is a direct output from the PLL, which is then buffered by BUFG to become clk0_bufg.\n- mcb_drp_clk_bufg_in: Output from the PLL that is used to drive the mcb_drp_clk after being buffered.\n- clkfbout_clkfbin: It represents the feedback path of the clock from the output to the input of the PLL, crucial for maintaining the stability and adjustment of the PLL\u2019s output frequency.\n- locked: This signal indicates that the PLL has successfully locked onto the provided clock input, ensuring the stability of the output clocks.\n- rst0_sync_r: A shift register for implementing the synchronization of the reset signal to the clk0 domain, helping prevent metastability issues in the digital system.\n- rst_tmp: A temporary signal used to combine different reset conditions (system reset and pll lock status) to control the synchronized reset process.\n- powerup_pll_locked: It is a control signal used to indicate the status after the power-up sequence concerning the PLL lock. It assists in managing system behavior during initial power-up stages.\n- syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked: Similar to powerup_pll_locked, but specifically synchronized to the clk0 domain.\n- sys_rst: This is a conditioned system reset signal that accounts for whether the reset is active high or low, based on the configuration.\n- bufpll_mcb_locked: Indicates the locking status of the buffer PLL connected to the Memory Controller Block, which is crucial for the stability of clocks related to memory operations.\n- sys_clk_ibufg: Buffered version of the system clock, which can be either a differential or single-ended input based on the module configuration, used as the primary clock input to the PLL."

It utilizes input ports such as 'sys_clk_p' and 'sys_clk_n' for differential clock sources, 'sys_clk' for single-ended sources, and 'sys_rst_i' for receiving reset signals. Output ports include 'clk0' for the main clock, 'rst0' for the synchronized reset signal, 'async_rst' for the asynchronous reset, 'sysclk_2x' and 'sysclk_2x_180' for high-frequency clock outputs, 'mcb_drp_clk' for Memory Controller Block operations, 'pll_ce_0' and 'pll_ce_90' for serialization strobes, and 'pll_lock' to indicate PLL stability. Within the module, internal signals such as 'clk_2x_0', 'clk_2x_180', and 'clk0_bufg' handle different phases and buffering of clock signals, while signals like 'locked' indicate the PLL\u2019s status, and 'rst0_sync_r' and 'syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked' manage reset synchronization and power-up sequences. The module's code is structured into several blocks: clock inputs handling based on the type, PLL configuration for various outputs, synchronization of reset conditions, and usage of BUFPLL_MCB for specific output requirements, ensuring robust and versatile clock management suitable for various digital applications."
