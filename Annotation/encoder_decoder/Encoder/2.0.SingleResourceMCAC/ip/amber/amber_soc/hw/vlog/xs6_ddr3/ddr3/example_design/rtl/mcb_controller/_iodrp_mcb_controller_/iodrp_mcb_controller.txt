Module-level comment: The `iodrp_mcb_controller` module manages dynamic memory cell operations, facilitating read and write access. It uses input signals for configuring operation modes, addressing, and command validation, and outputs signals indicating operational states and data. A Finite State Machine (FSM) controls the flow through various states, handling address setup, data transfer, and signaling. The module operates under specific clock signals, dependently managing data through shift registers and multiplexers based on the current FSM state for precise control over memory interfacing.
