Module name: afifo. 
Module specification: The 'afifo' module is a parameterized asynchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer designed to manage data buffering across two different clock domains using gray code counters for read and write pointers. It handles write operations with the 'wr_clk' and read operations with the 'rd_clk'. The module has six input ports: 'wr_clk' (write clock), 'rst' (reset), 'wr_en' (write enable), 'wr_data' (write data bus), 'rd_en' (read enable), and 'rd_clk' (read clock). The outputs include 'rd_data' (read data bus), 'full' (FIFO is full), 'empty' (FIFO is empty), and 'almost_full' (FIFO is almost full). Internally, the module uses registers like 'mem' for storing FIFO data, 'rd_gray' and 'wr_gray' for managing synchronized read and write pointers in gray code, among others. Key blocks in the code handle synchronization (using the 'SYNC' parameter), write and read operations, update of pointers, and status signal generation (full, empty, almost_full). The synchronization blocks ensure safe data transfer between the differing clock domains, and pointers management utilizes gray coding to maintain coherence and minimize errors during asynchronous operations.
