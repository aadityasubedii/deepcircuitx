Module name: a25_dcache. Module specification: This module implements a configurable data cache for a processor, supporting multiple cache ways (2, 3, 4, or 8). It handles read/write operations, cache hits/misses, and cache line fills to improve memory access performance. The module has input ports for clock, request signals, write data, addresses, cache control, and write buffer interactions, and output ports for read data, stall signals, and write buffer requests. Internal signals manage cache state, way selection, tag and data memory access, and exclusive access operations. The module is divided into sections for cache initialization, state machine control, tag and data memory management, cache hit detection, way selection logic, and read/write operations. It includes features for exclusive access, cache flushing, and write-through operations. The design uses parameterized values for cache configuration and includes debug support. The module's complex state machine handles various cache
