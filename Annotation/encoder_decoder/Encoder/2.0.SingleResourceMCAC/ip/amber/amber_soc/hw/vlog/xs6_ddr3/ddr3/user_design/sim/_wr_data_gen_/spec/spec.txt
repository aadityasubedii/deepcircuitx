Module name: `wr_data_gen`.
Module specification: The `wr_data_gen` module is designed to generate write data for memory operations tailored for FPGA families like SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6. The module's functionality is governed mainly by input conditions and parameters controlling data pattern generation, synchronization signals, and interaction with external FIFOs for memory operations. Input ports include `clk_i` (clock signal), `rst_i` (reset signal), `prbs_fseed_i` (seed for pseudo-random data generation), `data_mode_i` (controls the type of data pattern), command signals (`cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_validB_i`, `cmd_validC_i`), `fixed_data_i` (source for fixed data patterns), `addr_i` (memory address), `bl_i` (burst length), and `data_rdy_i` (input signifying FIFO can accept data). Output ports include `cmd_rdy_o` (module's readiness for new commands), `last_word_o` (indicates processing of the last word in a burst), `data_valid_o` (validity of the output data), `data_o` (actual data output), and `data_wr_end_o` (indicates completion of data write operation). Internal signals such as `data`, `w3data` (data registers), `cmd_rdy` and related flags (command readiness indications), `user_burst_cnt` (tracks data words in a burst), and `fifo_not_full` (indicates if the FIFO can accept more data) help manage operations and state transitions. The module includes conditional generate blocks defining specific configurations for each supported FPGA family, ensuring tailored operations like data generation and end condition handling based on the family-specific characteristics. These blocks use specific instances of `sp6_data_gen` or `v6_data_gen` submodules depending on the parameterized FAMILY, promoting modularity and reuse in different hardware configurations.
