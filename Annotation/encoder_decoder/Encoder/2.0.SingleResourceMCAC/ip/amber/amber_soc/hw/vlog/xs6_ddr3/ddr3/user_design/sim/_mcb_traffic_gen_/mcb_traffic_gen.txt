 * mcb_traffic_gen: Memory Controller Block (MCB) Traffic Generator
 * Generates configurable memory access patterns for testing and simulation.
 * Implements command generation, data path control, and error checking.
 * Supports various modes (read/write/bi-directional) and patterns.
 * Uses PRBS for address/data generation, FIFOs for flow control,
 * and separate read/write data paths for flexible operation.
 * Interfaces with MCB for comprehensive memory subsystem verification.
