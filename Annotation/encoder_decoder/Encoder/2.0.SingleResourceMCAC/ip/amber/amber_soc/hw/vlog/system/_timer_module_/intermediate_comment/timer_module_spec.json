    "spec": "Module name: timer_module. \n\nModule specification: The `timer_module` is a Verilog-based hardware module designed for managing three independent timers, each capable of counting down from a set value to generate interrupts, handle auto-reload functionality, and control countdown rates with different prescaler settings. It interfaces with a Wishbone bus to perform read and write operations on timer control and value registers. Input ports include `i_clk` (system clock), Wishbone address (`i_wb_adr`), byte select (`i_wb_sel`), write enable (`i_wb_we`), data bus input for writes (`i_wb_dat`), cycle input (`i_wb_cyc`), and strobe input (`i_wb_stb`). Output ports comprise Wishbone data bus output for reads (`o_wb_dat`), acknowledge signal (`o_wb_ack`), error signal (`o_wb_err`) always set to zero, and timer interrupts (`o_timer_int`) for the three timers. Internal control signals like `wb_start_write` and `wb_start_read` initiate write or read operations, and `wb_wdata32` and `wb_rdata32` handle data preparation for these transactions. The primary code sections include initialization of timer values and control registers, data bus interface handling using conditional compilation for different data width configurations (32-bit or 128-bit), timer countdown logic, interrupt management, and diagnostic outputs for debugging purposes. Each section is methodically designed to interact efficiently to control timer operations and communicate with the system's Wishbone bus, facilitating effective time-based event management in hardware systems.",

It interacts with a Wishbone bus to allow data transactions. The module handles reading and writing operations to timer control and value registers through the bus. Each timer operates by counting down from a set value, capable of generating interrupts when the count reaches zero, optionally auto-reloading, and varying the countdown rate via prescaler settings. The module helps in coordinating timed events and actions based on the system's requirements, and the outputs of timer interrupts can be used for managing timing critical tasks in the system."

It is asserted when the Wishbone strobe (`i_wb_stb`) and write enable (`i_wb_we`) are active, and the previous read operation is acknowledged (or not pending).\n- `wb_start_read`: This signal is used to initiate a read operation on the Wishbone bus. It becomes active when the Wishbone strobe (`i_wb_stb`) is active, write enable (`i_wb_we`) is low (indicating a read operation), and there's no current acknowledgement signal (`o_wb_ack` indicates no pending acknowledgment).\n- `wb_start_read_d1`: This signal is a delayed version of `wb_start_read`. It's introduced by registering `wb_start_read` with the system clock (`i_clk`). The delayed version helps to manage timing and control sequences more effectively by considering the data setup time and ensuring the correct sequencing of read operations.\n- `wb_wdata32`: This signal holds the data that is written to the module via the Wishbone bus for both 128-bit and 32-bit data width configurations. It is selectively assigned based on the part of the data bus (`i_wb_dat`) specified by the address (`i_wb_adr`) during the write operation.\n- `wb_rdata32`: This reg holds the data to be sent back to the Wishbone master during read operations. Depending on the address specified (`i_wb_adr`), it retrieves values like timer control settings, timer load values, or timer current values, formatted appropriately as per the require data width.\n\nThese internal signals help in managing the data flow and control logic of the timer module interfacing with the Wishbone protocol, coordinating reads and writes to the timer controls and providing data as required."

It interfaces with a Wishbone bus to perform read and write operations on timer control and value registers. Input ports include `i_clk` (system clock), Wishbone address (`i_wb_adr`), byte select (`i_wb_sel`), write enable (`i_wb_we`), data bus input for writes (`i_wb_dat`), cycle input (`i_wb_cyc`), and strobe input (`i_wb_stb`). Output ports comprise Wishbone data bus output for reads (`o_wb_dat`), acknowledge signal (`o_wb_ack`), error signal (`o_wb_err`) always set to zero, and timer interrupts (`o_timer_int`) for the three timers. Internal control signals like `wb_start_write` and `wb_start_read` initiate write or read operations, and `wb_wdata32` and `wb_rdata32` handle data preparation for these transactions. The primary code sections include initialization of timer values and control registers, data bus interface handling using conditional compilation for different data width configurations (32-bit or 128-bit), timer countdown logic, interrupt management, and diagnostic outputs for debugging purposes. Each section is methodically designed to interact efficiently to control timer operations and communicate with the system's Wishbone bus, facilitating effective time-based event management in hardware systems."

It interacts with a Wishbone bus to allow data transactions. The module handles reading and writing operations to timer control and value registers through the bus. Each timer operates by counting down from a set value, capable of generating interrupts when the count reaches zero, optionally auto-reloading, and varying the countdown rate via prescaler settings. The module helps in coordinating timed events and actions based on the system's requirements, and the outputs of timer interrupts can be used for managing timing critical tasks in the system."

It is asserted when the Wishbone strobe (`i_wb_stb`) and write enable (`i_wb_we`) are active, and the previous read operation is acknowledged (or not pending).\n- `wb_start_read`: This signal is used to initiate a read operation on the Wishbone bus. It becomes active when the Wishbone strobe (`i_wb_stb`) is active, write enable (`i_wb_we`) is low (indicating a read operation), and there's no current acknowledgement signal (`o_wb_ack` indicates no pending acknowledgment).\n- `wb_start_read_d1`: This signal is a delayed version of `wb_start_read`. It's introduced by registering `wb_start_read` with the system clock (`i_clk`). The delayed version helps to manage timing and control sequences more effectively by considering the data setup time and ensuring the correct sequencing of read operations.\n- `wb_wdata32`: This signal holds the data that is written to the module via the Wishbone bus for both 128-bit and 32-bit data width configurations. It is selectively assigned based on the part of the data bus (`i_wb_dat`) specified by the address (`i_wb_adr`) during the write operation.\n- `wb_rdata32`: This reg holds the data to be sent back to the Wishbone master during read operations. Depending on the address specified (`i_wb_adr`), it retrieves values like timer control settings, timer load values, or timer current values, formatted appropriately as per the require data width.\n\nThese internal signals help in managing the data flow and control logic of the timer module interfacing with the Wishbone protocol, coordinating reads and writes to the timer controls and providing data as required."

It interfaces with a Wishbone bus to perform read and write operations on timer control and value registers. Input ports include `i_clk` (system clock), Wishbone address (`i_wb_adr`), byte select (`i_wb_sel`), write enable (`i_wb_we`), data bus input for writes (`i_wb_dat`), cycle input (`i_wb_cyc`), and strobe input (`i_wb_stb`). Output ports comprise Wishbone data bus output for reads (`o_wb_dat`), acknowledge signal (`o_wb_ack`), error signal (`o_wb_err`) always set to zero, and timer interrupts (`o_timer_int`) for the three timers. Internal control signals like `wb_start_write` and `wb_start_read` initiate write or read operations, and `wb_wdata32` and `wb_rdata32` handle data preparation for these transactions. The primary code sections include initialization of timer values and control registers, data bus interface handling using conditional compilation for different data width configurations (32-bit or 128-bit), timer countdown logic, interrupt management, and diagnostic outputs for debugging purposes. Each section is methodically designed to interact efficiently to control timer operations and communicate with the system's Wishbone bus, facilitating effective time-based event management in hardware systems."
