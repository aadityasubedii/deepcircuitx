Module name: ddr3. Module specification: The ddr3 module is a DDR3 memory controller interface that manages interactions with DDR3 SDRAM. It supports multiple command, write, and read ports (p0-p5) for data transfer operations. The module takes inputs such as system clock (c3_sys_clk), reset (c3_sys_rst_i), and various command, write, and read signals for each port. It outputs memory interface signals (mcb3_dram_*) for communication with the DDR3 SDRAM device, as well as status signals for each port. Internal signals include clock management signals (c3_sysclk_2x, c3_pll_ce_0), reset control (c3_async_rst), and debug-related signals (c3_cmp_error, c3_vio_modify_enable). The module
