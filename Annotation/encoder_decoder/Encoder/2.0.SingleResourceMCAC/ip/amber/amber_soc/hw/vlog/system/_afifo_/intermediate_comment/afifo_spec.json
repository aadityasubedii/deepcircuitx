    "spec": "Module name: afifo. Module specification: The `afifo` module represents an asynchronous FIFO buffer with a parameterizable data width, using separate write (`wr_clk`) and read (`rd_clk`) clocks to manage independent operations. It facilitates data transfer using two main input ports: `i_data` for incoming data and `i_push` to signal a write operation, and two output ports: `o_data` for the data read from the FIFO and `i_pop` to signal a read operation. The FIFO's status is indicated by two outputs: `o_full` and `o_empty`, signifying whether the FIFO is fully occupied or empty, respectively. Internally, the module utilizes pointers (`wr_pointer`, `rd_pointer`) along with their delayed versions (`wr_pointer_d1`, `rd_pointer_d1`, `wr_pointer_d2`, `rd_pointer_d2`) to manage and synchronize the writing and reading processes in different clock domains, using Gray code conversion functions (`gray8`, `ungray8`) to properly transfer these pointers across the clock domains. The main functional blocks include: Data write and pointer incrementation triggered by the write clock when `i_push` and not `o_full`, pointer updates synchronized in the write clock domain, Data read and pointer incrementation triggered by the read clock when `i_pop` and not `o_empty`, and pointer updates synchronized in the read clock domain. These functions ensure stable, synced operations of the FIFO across asynchronous clock boundaries, utilizing a simple four-byte depth data storage array.\n",

The FIFO uses gray code for safely transferring the read and write pointers between the clock domains to avoid synchronization issues. It allows pushing data (`i_data`) into the FIFO when not full (`o_full` is low) and popping data (`o_data`) from the FIFO when not empty (`o_empty` is low). The FIFO handles the data with a parameterizable width `D_WIDTH` and uses a depth of 4 for storage.

Width is defined by `D_WIDTH`.\n- `i_push`: Signal to trigger writing/storing data into the FIFO.\n- `i_pop`: Signal to trigger reading/removing data from the FIFO.\n\nExplanation:\n- `wr_clk` and `rd_clk` manage the timing of write and read operations respectively, allowing asynchronous operation between the read and write sides.\n- `i_data` carries the data that needs to be pushed to the FIFO. Its size can be adjusted based on the parameter 'D_WIDTH'.\n- `i_push` is a control signal used to insert data into the FIFO. Data is written to the FIFO when `i_push` is asserted (high) and the FIFO is not full.\n- `i_pop` is a control signal used to extract data from the FIFO. Data is read from the FIFO when `i_pop` is asserted (high) and the FIFO is not empty.\n\nOutput ports: \n- `o_data`: Data output from the FIFO, carries the data that has been read.\n- `o_full`: Indicates when the FIFO is full, i.e., no more data can be written.\n- `o_empty`: Indicates when the FIFO is empty, i.e., no more data can be read.\n\nExplanation:\n- `o_data` presents the data that has been popped from the FIFO when `i_pop` is active and the FIFO is not empty. The width of `o_data` matches `D_WIDTH`.\n- `o_full` is a status signal indicating that the FIFO has reached its capacity and cannot accept new data until space is freed.\n- `o_empty` is a status signal indicating that there are no data elements left in the FIFO to read."
