Module-level comment: The 'a25_register_bank' module manages multiple register sets and the program counter for different processor modes (User, Supervisor, IRQ, FIQ). It selectively reads and writes register values, updates the program counter, and handles mode-based register selection. Internal logic, conditioned on mode flags and stall signals, directs data flow and operational state changes, efficiently managing register operations and context switching essential for CPU execution stages.
