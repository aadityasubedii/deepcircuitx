Module name: xs6_sram_4096x32_byte_en. Module specification: This module implements a 4096x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality for Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGAs. It uses 8 RAMB16BWER primitives to create a dual-bank memory structure, supporting 32-bit read and write operations with byte-level write enables. The module has five input ports: i_clk (clock), i_write_data (32-bit data input), i_write_enable (write enable), i_address (12-bit address), and i_byte_enable (4-bit byte enable); and one output port: o_read_data (32-bit data output). Internal signals include wea_b0 and wea_b1 (write enable signals for each bank), data_out_b0
