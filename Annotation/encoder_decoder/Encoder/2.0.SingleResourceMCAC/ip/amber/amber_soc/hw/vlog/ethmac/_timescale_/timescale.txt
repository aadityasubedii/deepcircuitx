Module-level comment: This Verilog code snippet does not define a module; it solely contains a `timescale directive (`timescale 1ns / 1ps), used to set the time unit and precision for simulations. The directive ensures the simulation environment accurately manages and measures time-based events, although it does not participate in any module-specific functionality or signal processing.
