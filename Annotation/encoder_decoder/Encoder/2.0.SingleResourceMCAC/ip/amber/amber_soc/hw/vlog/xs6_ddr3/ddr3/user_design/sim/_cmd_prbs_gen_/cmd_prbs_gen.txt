Module-level comment: The 'cmd_prbs_gen' module generates configurable pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) using Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs). It adapts to different configurations through parameters such as type and width of PRBS, influenced by the 'PRBS_CMD' value. It efficiently handles initialization, clock gating, and varied sequence generation through generate blocks that implement specific tap and feedback setups, tailored for different FPGA families and sequence requirements.
