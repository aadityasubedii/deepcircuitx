Module name: eth_maccontrol. Module specification: The 'eth_maccontrol' module is crucial for managing the control aspects of Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) layer operations, particularly focusing on the transmission and reception process synchronization and control. It comprises a variety of input and output ports: Inputs include clocks (MTxClk, MRxClk for transmission and reception), reset signals (TxReset, RxReset), data signals (TxDataIn, RxData), and control signals (TPauseRq, RxValid, etc.), which govern the flow and integrity of data. Outputs like TxDataOut and TxAbortOut influence the external interfacing with other modules and hardware and handle data forwarding, frame completion, and transmission abortion. Internally, the module leverages signals such as TxUsedDataOutDetected and MuxedAbort to track data usage and manage conditional signal paths, respectively. The module integrates submodules like 'eth_receivecontrol' and 'eth_transmitcontrol' to handle detailed tasks of receiving and transmitting Ethernet frames, such as pausing operations and control frame handling. These submodules work alongside internal logic, structured into blocks managed by sequential and combinational processes, forming a coherent system that ensures robust Ethernet MAC layer communication.
