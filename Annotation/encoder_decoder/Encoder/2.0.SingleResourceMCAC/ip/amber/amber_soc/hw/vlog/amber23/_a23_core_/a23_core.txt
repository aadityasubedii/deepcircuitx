Module-level comment: The `a23_core` module functions as a CPU core in embedded systems, interfacing with the Wishbone bus for memory operations. It includes four sub-modules: `a23_fetch` for instruction fetching, `a23_decode` for instruction decoding, `a23_execute` for executing operations, and `a23_coprocessor` for handling coprocessor interactions and caching. The module processes interrupts, manages system states, and controls data transfer and execution flow through internal signals and input/output ports.
