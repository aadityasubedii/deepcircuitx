Module name: eth_register. Module specification: The `eth_register` is a Verilog module designed to function as a parameterizable data register primarily used for storing and updating data synchronized by clock signals and conditioned by reset and write enable signals. It features input ports including `DataIn`, a data input accepting bit-width specified data to be written into the register; `Write`, a control signal enabling data writing when high; `Clk`, a clock signal to synchronize data writing; `Reset`, an asynchronous reset that immediately sets the output to a `RESET_VALUE`; and `SyncReset`, a synchronous reset that sets the output to `RESET_VALUE` on the next clock edge. The only output port is `DataOut`, which outputs the current data stored in the register. Internally, `DataOut` is defined as a register with a width governed by the `WIDTH` parameter and serves the dual purpose of holding data and being resettable under specific conditions. Within the code, the primary operational logic is encapsulated in an always block triggered by the positive edge of `Clk` or a positive edge of `Reset`. This block prioritizes the asynchronous and synchronous reset conditions before handling data writing when the `Write` signal is active, following the synchronous nature of typical digital hardware designs. This setup ensures that data integrity and deterministic reset behavior are maintained under various operating conditions.
