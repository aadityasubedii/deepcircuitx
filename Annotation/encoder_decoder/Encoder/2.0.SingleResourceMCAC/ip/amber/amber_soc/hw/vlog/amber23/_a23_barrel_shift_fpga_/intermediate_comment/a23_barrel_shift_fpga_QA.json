The operations supported are logical shift left (LSL), logical shift right (LSR), arithmetic shift right (ASR), and rotate right (ROR) which are determined by the `i_function` input. The module also includes functionality to manage specific cases such as shifts by zero and shifts larger than the word size (which is 32-bit in this case), and provides an option to set the shift amount directly to zero through `i_shift_imm_zero`. The output is the resultant 32-bit shifted data (`o_out`) and a carry out signal (`o_carry_out`) which could be used for chained or cascaded shift operations in larger computations."

It provides the binary data that needs to be manipulated according to the specified shifting function.\n- **i_carry_in**: This input is used as part of the rotate right (ROR) operation to fill in the bit that is rotated from the last to the first position, depending on the condition.\n- **i_shift_amount**: Determines the number of positions the bits of `i_in` are shifted. The amount by which to shift is specified by this 8-bit input.\n- **i_shift_imm_zero**: This is a control signal that when set, forces the shift amount to zero in specific conditions. It overrides normal shift operations under certain circumstances for logical or arithmetic shifts.\n- **i_function**: Decides the type of bit-shifting operation to be performed on `i_in`. It selects between logical shift left (LSL), logical shift right (LSR), arithmetic shift right (ASR), and rotate right (ROR).\n\nOutput ports: \n- o_out: 32-bit output\n- o_carry_out: Carry output\n\nExplanation:\n- **o_out**: This is the 32-bit output which holds the result of the bit-shifting operation performed on `i_in`. Depending on the function and shift amount specified, the bits in `i_in` are shifted accordingly, and the result is captured in this output.\n- **o_carry_out**: Provides a carry output that may result from the shift operations. This can be used as a status signal or for further chained operations in larger arithmetic computations. It might represent a bit lost during a shift or the last bit of the original input when a rotation operation is performed."
