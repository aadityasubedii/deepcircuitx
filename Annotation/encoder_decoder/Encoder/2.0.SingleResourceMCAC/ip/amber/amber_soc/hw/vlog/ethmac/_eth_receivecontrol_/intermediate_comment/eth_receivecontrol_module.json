    "module": "Module-level comment: The `eth_receivecontrol` module manages Ethernet frame reception, focusing on control logic for frame boundaries, pause frames, and address validation. It utilizes clocks for synchronization, processes signals for real-time status, and employs internal logic for detecting frame attributes and managing timers. Key operations include address matching, type/length validation, pause frame detection, and flow control, facilitated by structured signal checks and timer manipulations across multiple always blocks synchronized to receiving and transmission clocks."
