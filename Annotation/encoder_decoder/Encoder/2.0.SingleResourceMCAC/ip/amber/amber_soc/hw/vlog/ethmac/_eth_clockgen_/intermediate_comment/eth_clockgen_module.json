    "module": "Module-level comment: The `eth_clockgen` module generates a management data clock (Mdc) for Ethernet hardware, driven by an input clock (`Clk`) and divisor (`Divider`). It features a reset (`Reset`) and produces Mdc along with enable signals `MdcEn` and `MdcEn_n` based on a counter that periodically resets based on `Divider`. The internal logic adjusts Divider values, ensuring Mdc frequency is adequately scaled and utilizes conditional logic for synchronization and reset functionalities."
