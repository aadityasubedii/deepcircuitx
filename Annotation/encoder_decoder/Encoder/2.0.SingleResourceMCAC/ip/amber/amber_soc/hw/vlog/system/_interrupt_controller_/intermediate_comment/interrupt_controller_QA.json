            "content": "Name of the module and its functionality is as follows: \nModule name: interrupt_controller.\n\nExplanation: The `interrupt_controller` module manages interrupt and fast interrupt request (IRQ and FIRQ) signals for a system. It processes inputs from various sources such as UARTs, an Ethernet MAC, and timers, and based on enable registers and software triggered interrupts, it determines the active IRQs and FIRQs. The module interfaces with a Wishbone bus to read and write control registers that configure which interrupts are enabled or disabled, and to handle software-triggered interrupts. It provides outputs indicating active IRQ and FIRQ conditions, allowing other system components to respond to these events appropriately. Additionally, it handles data operations based on the bus width specified by the `WB_DWIDTH` parameter. The module interacts with the Wishbone bus for register accesses, acknowledging read and write operations. Thus, it serves as a critical component in managing and responding to system interrupts in a configurable manner."
