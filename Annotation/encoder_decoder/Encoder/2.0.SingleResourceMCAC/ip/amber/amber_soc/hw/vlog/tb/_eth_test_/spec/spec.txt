Module name: eth_test. 
Module specification: The 'eth_test' module is designed for simulating Ethernet transmission and reception functionalities within an FPGA or ASIC environment, specifically targeting packet management for testing purposes. The module is equipped with input ports including `mdc_i` (Master Clock Input for MDIO interface), `mtx_clk_i` (transmit clock input for synchronizing transmission-related operations), `mrxd_i` (4-bit received data from the Ethernet interface), and `mrxdv_i` (signal indicating validity of received data `mrxd_i`). The output ports comprise `mtxerr_o` (transmit error signal), `mtxdv_o` (transmit data valid signal), `mtxd_o` (4-bit output for transmitting data), and `md_io` (bi-directional MDIO data interface for PHY configuration). Internally, the module utilizes numerous signals such as `state_r`, `md_state_r`, and `rx_state_r` to manage different state machines associated with Ethernet packet transmission, MDIO interface operation, and packet reception respectively. The code is structured into blocks that manage transmission and reception processes, incorporate CRC checking, and interface with MDIO for PHY configuration. Functions like `print_pkt` for logging packet information and tasks for MDIO control (`MD_IDLE`, `MD_READ0`, etc.) are included to facilitate testing and debugging. This module is pivotal for testing Ethernet-based designs by simulating real-world network data movements and interactions.
