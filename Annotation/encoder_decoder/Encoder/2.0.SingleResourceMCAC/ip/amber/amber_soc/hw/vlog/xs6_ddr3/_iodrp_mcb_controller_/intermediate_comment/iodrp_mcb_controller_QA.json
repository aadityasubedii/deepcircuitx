It processes write and read instructions based on the inputs provided such as memory cell address, write data, and several control signals. The module uses a finite state machine (FSM) to navigate through different states like READY, ADDR_PHASE, DATA_PHASE, and various intermediate stages to handle the transitions and data manipulations necessary for DRP interactions. Additionally, the module handles synchronization and data expansion tasks as part of its operation. This involves communicating with the DRP through specific I/O operations and computing data outputs based on the current address within the DRP's domain."
