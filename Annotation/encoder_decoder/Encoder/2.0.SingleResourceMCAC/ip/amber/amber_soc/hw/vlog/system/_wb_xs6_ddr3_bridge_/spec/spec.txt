Module name: wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge. 

Module specification: The `wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge` module forms a connection interface between a Wishbone bus and a DDR3 memory controller, effectively handling memory reads and writes, command issuing to the DDR3 controller, and data buffering. The module has numerous input and output ports such as `i_clk` (the clock signal), `i_wb_adr` (Wishbone address), and `o_wb_dat` (Wishbone data output), among others, to facilitate these operations. Command and data flow depend significantly on internal signals like `write_request`, `read_request`, and various buffer control signals (`write_buf_r`, `wb_sel_buf_r` etc.), which manage the timing and conditions under which reads or writes are executed or queued. The module is divided into several functional blocks: command queuing and control, write and read data buffering, and Wishbone response handling. In the command control section, addresses are calculated and commands initiated based on the Wishbone bus commands and DDR3 status flags like `i_cmd_full`. The buffering sections temporarily store data and configurations when the DDR3 write interface or command queue is full. The data transfer implementation varies slightly depending on whether the data width parameter (`WB_DWIDTH`) is set to 32 or 128, optimizing memory access and alignment. Finally, the module assesses and acknowledges completed read and write operations to the Wishbone bus, ensuring robust data transactions across the interfaces.
