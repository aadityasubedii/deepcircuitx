    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"init_mem_pattern_ctr\" module initializes and tests memory patterns in FPGA devices, supporting various operations like read, write, and error checks based on different input configurations. It utilizes a state machine to manage transitions between states like IDLE, INIT_MEM_WRITE, and TEST_MEM, handling input commands and configurations to execute memory operations efficiently. This module dynamically adjusts testing conditions through input controls, enabling flexible memory testing suitable for multiple FPGA families."
