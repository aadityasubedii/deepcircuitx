    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'generic_sram_byte_en' module serves as a byte-enable SRAM. It uses a clock (`i_clk`) for synchronized read/write operations. It features inputs for data (`i_write_data`), write control (`i_write_enable`), address (`i_address`), and byte enablement (`i_byte_enable`). Internally, it employs a memory array (`mem`) and an indexing loop for selectively updating bytes per the enable signal. This design allows flexible and efficient memory updates specific to byte-level changes."
