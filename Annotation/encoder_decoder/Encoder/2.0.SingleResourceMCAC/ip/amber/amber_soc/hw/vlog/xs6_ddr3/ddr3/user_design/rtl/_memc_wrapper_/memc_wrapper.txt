/*
 * Memory Controller Wrapper (memc_wrapper)
 * 
 * This module wraps a memory controller interface, supporting up to 6 ports for 
 * command, write, and read operations, and 6 AXI slave interfaces. It handles 
 * DDR3 memory operations, including calibration and arbitration. The module 
 * interfaces with external memory using standard DDR3 signals and provides 
 * multiple ports for other system components to access memory. It uses PLL 
 * signals for timing and implements various memory timing parameters.
