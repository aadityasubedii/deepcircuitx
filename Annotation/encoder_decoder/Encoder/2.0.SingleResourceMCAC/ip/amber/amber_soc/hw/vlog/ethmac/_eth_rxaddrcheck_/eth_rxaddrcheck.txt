Module-level comment: The eth_rxaddrcheck module compares Ethernet frame addresses to verify authorization, featuring inputs for frame data, broadcast, multicast, and MAC addresses. It checks addresses using unicast, multicast hash tables, and broadcast validation. Outputs signal address mismatches or invalid frames, managing various scenarios, such as end-of-frame or frame abort conditions. Internal logic includes conditions and hashes, processed in sync with the Ethernet clock and module states, to effectively filter network traffic.
