Module name: tg_status. 

Module specification: The 'tg_status' module is designed to function as an error detection and status reporting component within larger systems. It monitors a data error input (`data_error_i`) and compares incoming data signals (`cmp_data_i` and `rd_data_i`) to detect mismatches. This module uses a clock input (`clk_i`) for synchronization, a reset input (`rst_i`) for clearing internal states, and a manual clear input (`manual_clear_error`) for manually clearing error states. The operations related to memory control are indicated through signals like memory controller command full (`mcb_cmd_full_i`), write full (`mcb_wr_full_i`), and read empty (`mcb_rd_empty_i`). The outputs of the module include an error status register (`error_status`) that logs detailed error-related data and an error output signal (`error`) that indicates an active error condition. Internally, the module uses two signals: `data_error_r` for delaying the error input signal by one clock cycle to detect rising edge events, and `error_set` as a flag to indicate and manage the active error state. The Verilog code is structured into blocks handling the error detection based on input conditions, resetting error states, and updating the error status register with relevant details such as error data, address, and command queue statuses. This organized approach ensures proper error logging and status reporting essential for diagnostic and operational purposes in systems relying on precise data handling and memory management.
