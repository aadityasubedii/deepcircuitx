    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a DDR3 memory controller interface, managing interactions with DDR3 SDRAM. It instantiates infrastructure and memory controller wrapper modules, providing multiple command, write, and read ports (p0-p5) for data transfer operations. The module handles clock management, reset control, and memory-related signals, supporting various configuration parameters for memory timings, port settings, and calibration. It interfaces with the DDR3 SDRAM device through address, control, and data lines, while also providing status and error signals for each port."
