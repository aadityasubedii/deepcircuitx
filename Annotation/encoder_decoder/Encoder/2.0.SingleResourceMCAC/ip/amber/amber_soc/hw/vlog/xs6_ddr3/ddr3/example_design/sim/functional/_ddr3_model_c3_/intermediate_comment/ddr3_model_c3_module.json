    "module": "Module-level comment: This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM device, modeling its timing characteristics and functionality. It implements memory read/write operations, command decoding, and extensive timing checks. The module uses a combination of always blocks and tasks to handle clock edges, command processing, data input/output, and timing violations. It simulates various DDR3 features including initialization sequence, refresh operations, power-down modes, and on-die termination. The module also incorporates DLL locking, write leveling, and multipurpose register functionality to accurately represent DDR3 behavior."
