Module-level comment: The `rd_data_gen` module generates read data for memory interfaces tailored to "SPARTAN6" or "VIRTEX6" FPGAs. It processes inputs like command validity and burst length, and outputs data readiness status and the data itself. Key functionalities are implemented through internal registers for state management and conditional handling, and data generation is specifically managed by FPGA family-oriented sub-modules (`sp6_data_gen` or `v6_data_gen`), providing flexibility and efficiency in handling different data patterns and burst lengths.
