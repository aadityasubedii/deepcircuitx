Module name: a25_wishbone. Module specification: The 'a25_wishbone' module is designed for managing data transfers and arbitration on a shared bus in a multi-master bus configuration using the Wishbone protocol. 

This module synchronizes operations using an input clock (`i_clk`) and can be reset (`i_reset`). It handles bus access requests from three ports (`i_port0_req`, `i_port1_req`, `i_port2_req`), including read and write operations specified by (`i_port0_write`, `i_port1_write`, `i_port2_write`). Data, byte enables, and addresses for these operations are input through `i_port0_wdata`, `i_port1_wdata`, `i_port2_wdata`, `i_port0_be`, `i_port1_be`, `i_port2_be`, and `i_port0_addr`, `i_port1_addr`, `i_port2_addr` respectively. The responses to these requests are managed and sent as output through `o_port0_ack`, `o_port1_ack`, `o_port2_ack` for acknowledgments and `o_port0_rdata`, `o_port1_rdata`, `o_port2_rdata` for read data.

Internally, the module uses arrays of signals like `wbuf_valid`, `wbuf_accepted`, `wbuf_write`, `wbuf_wdata`, `wbuf_be`, `wbuf_addr`, and `wbuf_rdata_valid` to manage buffer states, validate data transactions, and control data transfers corresponding to each port. The operation of deciding which buffer's data to transfer is managed through `new_access` and `serving_port` signals.

The code is structured into several blocks, first initializing and interfacing with storage buffers (`a25_wishbone_buf` instances) for all three ports. These buffers handle the data staging and signal conditioning for each port's bus access. Then, conditional statements within an always block decide which port's request to serve based on buffer validations. The bus transaction signals such as `o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_cyc`, and `o_wb_stb` are allocated and managed based on the active port determined by the `serving_port`. The module processes Wishbone bus responses and manages internal read data validations synchronously.

This modular and systemic approach ensures that the a25_wishbone module efficiently coordinates the concurrency inherent in a multi-master bus system, optimizing for data integrity and orderly communication.
