Module name: system. Module specification: The system module is a top-level design for a system-on-chip (SoC) that integrates various components including an Amber processor core, memory controllers, UART interfaces, Ethernet MAC, timers, and interrupt controllers using a Wishbone bus architecture. It handles clock generation, reset management, and interfaces with external DDR3 memory and Ethernet PHY. The module has input ports for board reset, clocks, UART, and Ethernet signals, and output ports for UART, DDR3 memory, Ethernet, and LEDs. Internal signals include system clock, reset, and various interrupt and control signals. The module is organized into several blocks: clock and reset management, Amber core, Ethernet interface, boot memory, UART controllers, test module, timer module, interrupt controller, DDR3 memory interface (for Xilinx FPGAs), and a
