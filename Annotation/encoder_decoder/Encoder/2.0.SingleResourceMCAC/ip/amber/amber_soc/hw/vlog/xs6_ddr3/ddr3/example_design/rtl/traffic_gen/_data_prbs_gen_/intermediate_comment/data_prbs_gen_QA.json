The user can define parameters such as the width of the PRBS and the seed width, as well as initialize values for the seed through inputs. This module is controlled by a clock input (`clk_i`) and a reset input (`rst_i`). It supports enabling the clock (`clk_en`) and initializing the seed (`prbs_seed_init`). A conditional initial seed setting is also possible, which is adjusted by the parameters `prbs_seed_i`, `prbs_fseed_i`, and a predefined pattern. The behavior of the seed initialization is further modified depending on whether eye testing (`EYE_TEST`) is enabled or not. The sequential logic updates the LFSR states and the output gives the current state of the PRBS."

All sequential logic operations are synchronized to the rising edge of this clock.  \n- clk_en: Clock enable signal. It controls the updating process of the internal LFSR state. Only when this signal is high (`1`), the internal LFSR updates its state based on the BGalois feedback.\n- rst_i: Reset input. Active-high reset pulse that initializes or resets the internal states and LFSR when high (`1`).\n- prbs_fseed_i: A 32-bit input used for modifying the seed value. This value is added to `prbs_seed_i` during the seed initialization phase.\n- prbs_seed_init: Seed initialization trigger. When high (`1`), it enables the initialization of the LFSR with a new seed value derived from `prbs_seed_i` and `prbs_fseed_i`.\n- prbs_seed_i: An input provided to load a new seed value into the LFSR. The width of this input is defined by `PRBS_WIDTH`, which is a configurable parameter.\n\nOutput ports: prbs_o.  \nExplanation:  \n- prbs_o: This is the output port of the module which provides the current state of the pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) generated by the module. The width of this output is determined by the parameter `PRBS_WIDTH`. This output reflects the pseudo-random sequence generated based on the LFSR states and is updated on every clock cycle when enabled."
