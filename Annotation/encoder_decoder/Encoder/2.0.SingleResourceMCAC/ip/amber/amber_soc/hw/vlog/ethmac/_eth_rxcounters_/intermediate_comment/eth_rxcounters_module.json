    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'eth_rxcounters' module manages byte and Inter-Frame Gap (IFG) counting in an Ethernet receiver. It processes inputs corresponding to data validity and frame reception states to control counter operations, utilizing internal signals for conditionally resetting and incrementing byte and IFG counters. Outputs indicate specific byte counts and IFG conditions, assisting in frame management and error checking. Counters are managed through synchronous logic blocks responding to clock and reset signals, ensuring correct timing and operational accuracy in high-speed data environments."
