    "spec": "Module name: a23_coprocessor. Module specification: The a23_coprocessor is a Verilog module designed to manage cache control and fault handling within a computing system. Functionally, it synchronizes with the CPU's operations to control caching behaviors and handle errors, based only on the status of input and output conditions to avoid fetch stalls. The module is equipped with input ports such as i_clk (clock signal), i_fetch_stall (fetch data stall indicator), i_copro_opcode1 and i_copro_opcode2 (operation codes), i_copro_crn, i_copro_crm, i_copro_num (coprocessor register identifiers), i_copro_operation (operation type indicator), i_copro_write_data (data for register writes), i_fault (fault presence indicator), i_fault_status and i_fault_address (fault details). The output ports include o_copro_read_data (data read from registers), o_cache_enable (cache enable signal), o_cache_flush (cache flush signal), and o_cacheable_area (cacheable memory area designation). Internal signals like cache_control, cacheable_area, updateable_area, disruptive_area, fault_status, fault_address, copro15_reg1_write, and delay-registers copro_operation_d1, copro_crn_d1 manage internal state and behavior, ensuring accurate operation and diagnostics under various conditions. The module contains several conditional blocks handling updates and outputs based on these signals and is structured to execute operation conditionally, based on the absence of a fetch stall, enhancing performance synchronization. Debug messaging is included to provide feedback during development or potential error conditions, controlled by conditional compilation flags to enhance the module's utility during testing and debugging phases.",

                    "text": "Module name: a23_coprocessor. Module specification: The a23_coprocessor is a Verilog module designed to manage cache control and fault handling within a computing system. Functionally, it synchronizes with the CPU's operations to control caching behaviors and handle errors, based only on the status of input and output conditions to avoid fetch stalls. The module is equipped with input ports such as i_clk (clock signal), i_fetch_stall (fetch data stall indicator), i_copro_opcode1 and i_copro_opcode2 (operation codes), i_copro_crn, i_copro_crm, i_copro_num (coprocessor register identifiers), i_copro_operation (operation type indicator), i_copro_write_data (data for register writes), i_fault (fault presence indicator), i_fault_status and i_fault_address (fault details). The output ports include o_copro_read_data (data read from registers), o_cache_enable (cache enable signal), o_cache_flush (cache flush signal), and o_cacheable_area (cacheable memory area designation). Internal signals like cache_control, cacheable_area, updateable_area, disruptive_area, fault_status, fault_address, copro15_reg1_write, and delay-registers copro_operation_d1, copro_crn_d1 manage internal state and behavior, ensuring accurate operation and diagnostics under various conditions. The module contains several conditional blocks handling updates and outputs based on these signals and is structured to execute operation conditionally, based on the absence of a fetch stall, enhancing performance synchronization. Debug messaging is included to provide feedback during development or potential error conditions, controlled by conditional compilation flags to enhance the module's utility during testing and debugging phases."
