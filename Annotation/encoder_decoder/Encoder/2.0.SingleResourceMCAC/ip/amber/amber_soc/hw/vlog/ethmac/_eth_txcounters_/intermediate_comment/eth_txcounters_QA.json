It primarily keeps track of byte and nibble counts throughout the different states of frame transmission, such as preamble, inter-packet gap (IPG), data, padding (PAD), frame check sequence (FCS), jam sequence, and back-off states. The module also handles conditional counter resets and increments based on the states and conditions such as excessive defer situations and start signals for defer, IPG, FCS, and jam states. Additionally, it computes certain conditions like reaching a minimum frame length or maximum frame size, and manages a delay CRC count used in specific transmission states."
