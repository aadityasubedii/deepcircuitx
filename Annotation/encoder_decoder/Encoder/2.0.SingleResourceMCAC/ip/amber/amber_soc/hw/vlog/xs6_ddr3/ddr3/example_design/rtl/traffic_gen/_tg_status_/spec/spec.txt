Module name: tg_status. 
Module specification: The `tg_status` module is designed to monitor and report errors within a system, capturing data mismatches or buffer condition errors. It operates with a clock input signal `clk_i`, and engages reset and manual error clearing functionalities through `rst_i` and `manual_clear_error` ports respectively. The module inputs include `data_error_i`, which signals data discrepancies, `cmp_data_i` and `rd_data_i` for comparison, `cmp_addr_i` and `cmp_bl_i` providing address and block length information, and buffer status signals `mcb_cmd_full_i`, `mcb_wr_full_i`, `mcb_rd_empty_i`. The outputs are an `error_status` register detailing the error context, and an `error` flag indicating error existence. Internally, the module utilizes the `data_error_r` signal to capture the edge of `data_error_i`, ensuring that errors are noted only upon their first occurrence, and `error_set` to maintain error state until cleared. The module logic includes two primary sequential processing blocks: one handling the detection and recording of new errors based on input conditions and edge detection, and another for resetting error flags and statuses based on reset or manual clear conditions. This structured approach allows the module to effectively capture and maintain critical error information until appropriate corrective actions are taken.
