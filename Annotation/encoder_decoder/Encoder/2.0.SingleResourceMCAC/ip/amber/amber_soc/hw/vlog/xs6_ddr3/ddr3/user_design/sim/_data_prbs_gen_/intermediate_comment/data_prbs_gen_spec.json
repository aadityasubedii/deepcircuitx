It uses a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) mechanism to generate the sequence. The PRBS generation can be initialized with either a default seed or a combination of a seed input `prbs_seed_i` and a forced seed `prbs_fseed_i`, modified by a preset constant. The generator supports optional enable and reset functionalities. The sequence generation process can be influenced by an eye test condition, `EYE_TEST`, to potentially adjust its operation for testing purposes.

If low, the LFSR contents are not updated, effectively pausing the PRBS generation.\n- `rst_i`: Reset input which, when asserted high, initializes the LFSR state with a seed combination or resets it to a fixed state based on the `EYE_TEST` setting.\n- `prbs_fseed_i`: Input for a forced seed value, typically used to forcibly alter the seed of the LFSR at initialization or during an eye test condition.\n- `prbs_seed_init`: Signal to initialize the seed of the LFSR. When high, it triggers the LFSR to load with a specified seed or a combination of specified and forced seeds.\n- `prbs_seed_i`: Input seed provided typically during initialization, which can be either used alone or modified by the forced seed based on the module\u2019s configuration.\n\nOutput ports: prbs_o.\n\nExplanation:\n- `prbs_o`: Output port that provides the pseudo-random binary sequence generated by the module.
