Module-level comment: The `ethmac_wb` module interfaces an Ethernet MAC with a Wishbone bus, adapting signals between master and slave sides. It supports variable widths (32 or 128 bits) and endianness adjustments through generate blocks, routing bus signals based on `WB_DWIDTH`. Direct port connections and conditional configurations ensure compatible bus communication in network applications.
