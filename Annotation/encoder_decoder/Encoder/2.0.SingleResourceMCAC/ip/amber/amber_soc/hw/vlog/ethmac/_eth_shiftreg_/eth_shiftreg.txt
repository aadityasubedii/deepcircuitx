Module-level comment: The 'eth_shiftreg' module acts as a shift register tailored for Ethernet PHY interface operations, managing MDIO serial data transactions for PHY register access. It uses inputs like Clk, Reset, and MdcEn_n, processing serial/parallel data via an 8-bit ShiftReg based on ByteSelect control. Outputs include ShiftedBit for serial data, Prsd for parallel formatted data, and LinkFail to indicate link issues. Operations are controlled by clock-triggered sequences in an always block, integrating conditions for data loading, shifting, and status signaling.
