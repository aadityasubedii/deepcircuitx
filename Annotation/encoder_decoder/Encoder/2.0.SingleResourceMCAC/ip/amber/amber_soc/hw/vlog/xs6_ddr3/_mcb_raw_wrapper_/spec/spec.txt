Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: This module is a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) designed to interface with various types of DDR memory (DDR, DDR2, DDR3, LPDDR). It handles the low-level signaling and timing requirements for memory operations, including address and data management, command generation, and I/O buffering. The module supports multiple port configurations, different memory widths, and various memory-specific features. Input ports include clock signals, reset, command inputs for multiple ports, write and read data signals, and calibration signals. Output ports provide status information for each port, memory interface signals, and calibration outputs. Internal signals are used for reset management, clock control, calibration, and self-refresh operations. The code is organized into sections for port configuration, address mapping, I/O buffer instantiation, and IODRP2 (I/O Digital
