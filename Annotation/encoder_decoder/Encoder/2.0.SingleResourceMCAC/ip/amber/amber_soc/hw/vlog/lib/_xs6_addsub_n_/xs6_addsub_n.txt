Module-level comment: The 'xs6_addsub_n' module performs addition or subtraction on inputs 'i_a' and 'i_b', controlled by 'i_sub'. When 'i_sub' is high, it subtracts; otherwise, it adds, considering an input carry-in 'i_cin'. The DSP48A1 block, configured through 'opmode', 'in_a', and 'in_b', processes the arithmetic based on extended 48-bit signals. Outputs include the operation result 'o_sum' and carry-out 'o_co'.
