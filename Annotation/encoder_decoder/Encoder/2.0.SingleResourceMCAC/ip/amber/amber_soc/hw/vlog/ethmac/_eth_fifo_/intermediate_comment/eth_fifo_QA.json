The functionality is controlled by inputs such as 'clk' (clock), 'reset', 'write', 'read', and 'clear' which manage the data flow through the FIFO. The module is parameterized by `DATA_WIDTH`, `DEPTH`, and `CNT_WIDTH` to adjust its size and operation depth according to the needs. This FIFO has outputs such as 'data_out', 'almost_full', 'full', 'almost_empty', and 'empty' to signal its current state, alongside a counter 'cnt' that keeps track of the number of elements in the FIFO. Depending on whether it is implemented on a specific FPGA platform (like Xilinx Spartan-6) or not, the actual data storage might use distributed RAM or an array of registers. The module ensures data is correctly written or read from the FIFO based on the write and read pointers, managing proper data flow for Ethernet applications."

When activated, it sets the internal pointers and counters to their initial states.\n- `write`: Activated when data is to be written to the FIFO. If FIFO is not full, data from `data_in` will be written into the FIFO at the position indicated by the write pointer.\n- `read`: Activated when data is to be read from the FIFO. It controls the read operation based on the state of the FIFO and the read pointer position.\n- `clear`: Used to reset the FIFO content by setting both the read and write pointers to their initial state and clearing the data.\n- `data_in` (Data Input): The actual data to be stored in the FIFO when a write operation occurs. The width of the data is defined by the `DATA_WIDTH` parameter.\n\nOutput ports: data_out, almost_full, full, almost_empty, empty, cnt.\nExplanation:\n- `data_out` (Data Output): The data output of the FIFO, representing the data read from the FIFO based on the read pointer.\n- `almost_full`: A status flag that indicates the FIFO is almost full and can potentially only accept few more data entries.\n- `full`: Signals when the FIFO is completely full, and no further data can be written without overwriting existing data.\n- `almost_empty`: A status flag indicating that the FIFO currently holds just one element or is close to being empty.\n- `empty`: Indicates that the FIFO is completely empty with no data to be read.\n- `cnt` (Count): Maintains a count of how many data elements are currently stored in the FIFO, useful for determining the next state of the FIFO and controlling the read and write operations effectively."
