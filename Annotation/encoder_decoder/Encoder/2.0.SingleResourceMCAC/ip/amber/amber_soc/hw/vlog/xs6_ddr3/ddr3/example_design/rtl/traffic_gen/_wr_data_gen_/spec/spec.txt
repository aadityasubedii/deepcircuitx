Module name: wr_data_gen.
Module specification: The `wr_data_gen` module is designed for generating write data in memory interfaces and it is tailored for compatibility with different FPGA families, like SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6, considering various data bus and address widths. The module operates based on parameters such as databus width and burst length, and utilizes sub-modules specific to FPGA family for optimized data generation. **Input ports** include `clk_i` (clock input), `rst_i` (reset input), `prbs_fseed_i` (seed for pseudo-random data patterns), `data_mode_i` (specifies the data operation mode), `cmd_valid_i, cmd_validB_i, cmd_validC_i` (command valid inputs for various stages), `fixed_data_i` (input for fixed data patterns), `addr_i` (memory address for operations), `bl_i` (burst length), and `data_rdy_i` (indicates readiness of data buffer). **Output ports** are `cmd_rdy_o` (indicates module's readiness for a new command), `last_word_o` (signals the last word in a data burst), `data_valid_o` (flags that the data output is valid), `data_o` (data output), and `data_wr_end_o` (signals completion of a data write operation). **Internal signals** utilized include registers such as `data` for holding data temporarily, `cmd_rdy` series for command readiness across various conditions, `cmd_start` series for indicating command start points, `user_burst_cnt` for counting data bursts, and control-related signals like `burst_count_reached2` and `u_bcount_2`. Moreover, operational controls using flags like `fifo_not_full` derived from `data_rdy_i` helps in flow control. The module is structured into several blocks including initialization, handling of command readiness, command start, burst counting, and signaling of last word and data validity, with special sub-modules like `sp6_data_gen` or `v6_data_gen` based on configurations to handle specific family features and optimize operations, effectively making it versatile for handling complex memory interfacing tasks in varying FPGA configurations.
