    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"eth_rxethmac\" module handles Ethernet frame reception for MAC layers, processing incoming data for errors, frame boundary detection, and address validation. It uses internal logic blocks: state management (`eth_rxstatem`), byte counting (`eth_rxcounters`), address checking (`eth_rxaddrcheck`), and CRC calculation (`eth_crc`). These components work together, controlled by input signals and internal flags, to ensure data integrity and correct frame reception in Ethernet-based systems."
