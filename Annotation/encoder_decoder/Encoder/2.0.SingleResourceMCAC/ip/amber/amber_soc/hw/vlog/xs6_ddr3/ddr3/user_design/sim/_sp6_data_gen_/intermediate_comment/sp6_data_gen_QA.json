The data patterns that can be generated are determined by various parameter settings such as data width (DWIDTH), the type of pattern (DATA_PATTERN), and number of data pins (NUM_DQ_PINS). The module handles different data modes and outputs corresponding data patterns, which might include fixed data, walking ones/zeros, address-based data, PRBS (Pseudo Random Binary Sequence), and hammer patterns. The generated data is conditioned on flags such as command starts, data ready, and FIFO readiness. This functionality is key for simulating and testing memory interfaces or data path elements that require specific data patterns to verify their operation."

It drives the timing for the operations within the module, synchronizing data processing and pattern generation.\n- `rst_i`: Reset input. It resets the internal state and output of the module to ensure clean start-up circumstances.\n- `prbs_fseed_i`: PRBS (Pseudo Random Binary Sequence) seed input. This 32-bit input initializes the seed for PRBS data pattern generation.\n- `data_mode_i`: Data mode selection input. A 4-bit input that controls the type of data pattern to be output based on its value.\n- `data_rdy_i`: Data ready input. A flag to indicate that the module can generate and send new data, based on readiness of the consuming device or system.\n- `cmd_startA`, `cmd_startB`, `cmd_startC`, `cmd_startD`, `cmd_startE`: Command start inputs. These control lines trigger different operational start commands within the module, driving how data patterns are initiated and managed.\n- `fixed_data_i`: Fixed data input. This data width (DWIDTH)-bit input provides a constant value when fixed data pattern mode is selected.\n- `addr_i`: Address input. Used for generating address-based data patterns. The width of this input is defined by `ADDR_WIDTH`.\n- `user_burst_cnt`: User burst count input. A 7-bit input specifying the number of data bursts required, influencing operations like PRBS or walking patterns activations.\n- `fifo_rdy_i`: FIFO ready input. Indicates whether the FIFO (First-In, First-Out memory queue) in the associated systems is ready to accept data, enabling data pattern outputs when true.\n\n**Output ports:**\n- `data_o`: Data output. Outputs the generated data pattern, with a width defined by `DWIDTH`. It variably reflects one of the generated or selected data patterns according to the mode settings, input commands, and conditions applied throughout the module operations.\n\nThese ports collectively enable the `sp6_data_gen` module to generate test data patterns dynamically in response to inputs and internal configurations, providing essential test functionality for system verification and validation."
