Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module performs soft calibration for a Memory Controller Block (MCB), handling initialization, termination calibration, and dynamic calibration of DQS signals. It takes inputs such as UI_CLK (user interface clock), RST (reset), PLL_LOCK (PLL lock signal), and various MCB-related signals. Outputs include DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL (calibration completion), SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ (self-refresh request), and numerous MCB control signals. Internal signals like STATE (calibration state machine), P_Term and N_Term (termination values), and DQS_DELAY (DQS delay value) are used to manage the calibration process. The module implements a complex state machine that progresses through various calibration stages, including RZQ and ZIO termination adjustment, DQ
