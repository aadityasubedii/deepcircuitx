Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: This module serves as a wrapper for a memory controller interface, specifically designed for DDR3 SDRAM. It provides a high-level interface for multiple ports (p0 to p5) to perform command, write, and read operations on external memory. The module includes input ports for clock signals (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180, pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90), reset (async_rst), and various control signals for each port. Output ports include memory interface signals (mcbx_dram_*), status signals (calib_done, selfrefresh_mode), and data/status signals for each port. Internal signals handle data transfer (uo_data, uo_data_valid), command readiness (uo_cmd_ready_in), refresh operations (uo_refrsh_flag),
