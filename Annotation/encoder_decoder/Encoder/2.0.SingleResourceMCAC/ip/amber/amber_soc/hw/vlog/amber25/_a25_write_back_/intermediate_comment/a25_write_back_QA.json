It captures and holds incoming memory data, data validity, and register destination information into registers when there is no stall signal. Specifically, it stores memory read data, the validity of this data, and the corresponding register destination from inputs, and then continuously outputs these registered values. The module also captures and holds the memory address whenever there is no stall, but this captured address is not used further within the module as shown in the provided code."
