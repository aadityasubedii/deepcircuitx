Module-level comment: The 'write_data_path' module manages memory write operations, configurable for various memory settings. It integrates input control and data signals, processes these using submodule 'wr_data_gen' for data generation and synchronization, and outputs controlled, valid data for memory interfacing. Key features include handling multiple command signals, burst operations, and selective data masking. The design prioritizes modularity and parameterization, enabling flexible data handling and system integration.
