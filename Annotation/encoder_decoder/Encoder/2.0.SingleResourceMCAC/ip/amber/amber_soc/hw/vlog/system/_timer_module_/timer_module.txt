Module-level comment: The `timer_module` manages three hardware timers, interfacing via a Wishbone bus to execute timer control and monitoring. It supports writing to control registers, auto-reloading, variable countdowns with prescalers, and issuing interrupts upon countdown completion. Internal logic includes signal handling for read/write operations, data formatting based on bus width (32 or 128-bit), and debugging support for transaction tracing and timer event alerts.
