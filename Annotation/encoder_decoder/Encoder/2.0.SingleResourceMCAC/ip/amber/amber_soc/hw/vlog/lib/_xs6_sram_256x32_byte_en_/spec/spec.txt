Module name: xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en. Module specification: The "xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en" module represents a dual-port Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) with a 256x32 dimension (256 words of 32 bits each) and byte enable functionality for selective byte-level manipulation during write operations. This Verilog module utilizes input ports including: `i_clk` (clock signal), `i_write_data` (32-bit input data for writing), `i_write_enable` (control signal to enable writing when high), `i_address` (8-bit address for accessing specific memory locations), and `i_byte_enable` (4-bit control enabling specific byte writing within the 32-bit data width). It has a single output port, `o_read_data`, which outputs the 32-bit data read from the specified memory location when the write enable is low. Internally, the model utilizes a 4-bit signal `wea` derived from `i_write_enable` and `i_byte_enable` to control the writable bytes at the targeted address; the module also declares but does not connect several unused signals (nc31, nc32, nc33, nc22). The Verilog code details a RAMB8BWER instance configuring a dual-port RAM with specific read and write modes, variously parameterized signals, including clocks, addresses, data, and operational flags, for both read and write operations through separate channels, and provides initial checks for parameter correctness (DATA_WIDTH and ADDRESS_WIDTH). The module is tailored for applications requiring detailed control over which bytes within a 32-bit word are updated, enhancing the flexibility in memory operations.
