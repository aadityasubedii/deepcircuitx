Module-level comment: The 'eth_crc' module computes a 32-bit CRC for Ethernet frames, critical for ensuring data integrity during network communications. It processes a 4-bit input data stream, controlled by clock, reset, enable, and initialize signals. The CRC value is dynamically updated each clock cycle via internal logic involving XOR and conditional operations configured in the CrcNext assignments, and managed in an always block that depends on the state of reset or initialization. The module detects errors by comparing the resultant CRC against a standard predefined value.
