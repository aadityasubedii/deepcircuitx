    "module": "Module-level comment: This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM device, implementing timing checks, command decoding, and memory operations. It models DDR3 functionality including initialization, mode register settings, refresh operations, and various commands (activate, read, write, precharge). The module uses tasks for command processing, data handling, and timing verification, simulating DDR3 behavior with respect to clock edges, data strobes, and internal states. It incorporates parameters for timing constraints and configuration settings to accurately represent DDR3 SDRAM characteristics and performance."
