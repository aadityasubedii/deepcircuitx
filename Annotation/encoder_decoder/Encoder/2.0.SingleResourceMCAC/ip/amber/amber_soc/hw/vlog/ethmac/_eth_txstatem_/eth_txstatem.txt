Module-level comment: The "eth_txstatem" Verilog module acts as a state machine for an Ethernet transmitter, managing states like Idle, IPG, Preamble, Data, PAD, FCS, Jam, BackOff, and Defer based on network conditions and frame requirements. It processes inputs such as MTxClk, Reset, and network signals to control transitions and outputs state status and transition triggers. Internal signals and conditional logic within always blocks facilitate accurate state transitions, ensuring the transmitter adheres to Ethernet protocols efficiently.
