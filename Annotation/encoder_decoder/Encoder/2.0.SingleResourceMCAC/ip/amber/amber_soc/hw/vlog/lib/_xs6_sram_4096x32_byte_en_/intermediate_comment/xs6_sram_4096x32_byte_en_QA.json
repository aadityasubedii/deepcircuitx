It uses 8 RAMB16BWER primitives from Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA to create the memory. The module supports 32-bit read and write operations with byte-level write enables. It has a 12-bit address input, allowing for 4096 memory locations. The memory is split into two banks (b0 and b1) to accommodate the full address range. The module also includes initialization parameters for each SRAM block, allowing pre-loading of memory contents."
