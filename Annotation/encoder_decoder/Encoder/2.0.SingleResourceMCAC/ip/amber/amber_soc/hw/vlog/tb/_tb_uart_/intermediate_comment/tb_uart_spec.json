    "spec": "Module name: tb_uart. Module specification: The `tb_uart` module is primarily designed for simulating a UART interface which is crucial for testing the transmission and reception functionalities of UART protocols in systems. It includes both input and output ports: `i_uart_cts_n` (input, Clear to Send, active low, enabling data transmission when low), `i_uart_rxd` (input, UART Receive Data, which receives serial data to be processed), `o_uart_txd` (output, UART Transmit Data, which carries the serial data sent by the module), and `o_uart_rts_n` (output, Request to Send, active low, constantly indicating readiness to receive data). Internally, the module utilizes a variety of signals such as `clk_uart` (clock signal for UART operations), `rx_bit_count` (counter for number of bits received for the current byte), and `tx_bit_start` (signal indicating the start of data bit transmission), amongst others, to manage data transmission states, receptions, and UART clock operations. The code is sectioned into several blocks: initialization of clock and reset signals, receiver logic to manage incoming data, transmitter control for data output handling, and FIFO buffer management for queuing data before transmission. These blocks work cohesively to simulate a UART device that interacts with UART-enabled hardware, providing an executable testing environment that supports loopback testing to check internal data transfers without needing external transfers.",

Module specification: The `tb_uart` module is primarily designed for simulating a UART interface which is crucial for testing the transmission and reception functionalities of UART protocols in systems. It includes both input and output ports: `i_uart_cts_n` (input, Clear to Send, active low, enabling data transmission when low), `i_uart_rxd` (input, UART Receive Data, which receives serial data to be processed), `o_uart_txd` (output, UART Transmit Data, which carries the serial data sent by the module), and `o_uart_rts_n` (output, Request to Send, active low, constantly indicating readiness to receive data). Internally, the module utilizes a variety of signals such as `clk_uart` (clock signal for UART operations), `rx_bit_count` (counter for number of bits received for the current byte), and `tx_bit_start` (signal indicating the start of data bit transmission), amongst others, to manage data transmission states, receptions, and UART clock operations. The code is sectioned into several blocks: initialization of clock and reset signals, receiver logic to manage incoming data, transmitter control for data output handling, and FIFO buffer management for queuing data before transmission. These blocks work cohesively to simulate a UART device that interacts with UART-enabled hardware, providing an executable testing environment that supports loopback testing to check internal data transfers without needing external transfers."
