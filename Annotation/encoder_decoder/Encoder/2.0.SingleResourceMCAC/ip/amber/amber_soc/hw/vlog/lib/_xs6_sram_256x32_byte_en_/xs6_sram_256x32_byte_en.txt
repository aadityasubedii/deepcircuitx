Module-level comment: The module xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en implements a 256x32 dual-port SRAM with byte-enable functionality, allowing selective byte writing. It uses a RAMB8BWER block for memory operations, controlled by inputs like i_write_data, i_write_enable, i_address, i_byte_enable, and output o_read_data. Internal signal `wea` enables byte-level writing control, facilitating precise data manipulation within the memory.
