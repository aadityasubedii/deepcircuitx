    "spec": "Module name: eth_random. \nModule specification: The `eth_random` Verilog module is designed for pseudo-random number generation tailored for Ethernet applications, specifically handling collision and retransmission scenarios. It operates based on a main clock signal `MTxClk` and includes an asynchronous `Reset` to initialize internal states. The input ports are `StateJam` and `StateJam_q`, which determine the latching of the random number; `RetryCnt`, `NibCnt`, and `ByteCnt` which further tailor the randomness for network conditions. The outputs are `RandomEq0` and `RandomEqByteCnt`, which are key signals for network collision resolution strategies, indicating specific conditions about the random number. Internally, the module employs a 10-bit shift register `x` controlled by a feedback mechanism (`Feedback`) derived from XOR-ing specific bits of `x` to generate the random sequence. The `Random` signal is masked based on `RetryCnt` and the final value is latched into `RandomLatched` under specific conditions determined by `StateJam` and `StateJam_q`. The code is structured into two main `always` blocks for updating the shift register and managing the latching mechanism, and several `assign` statements for signal assignments and outputs. This configuration ensures that the random number generation is both deterministic and sensitive to the current state and history of network interactions, making it suitable for sophisticated Ethernet networking functionalities.",

It is used as the input bit for the shift register operation in 'x', serving as the key element of the linear feedback shift register (LFSR) mechanism used to generate the pseudo-random numbers.\n- x: This is a 10-bit shift register implemented to generate the pseudo-random sequence. On each clock edge, dependent upon the Reset condition, it shifts in the Feedback bit to its least significant bit position while the rest of the bits shift left, effectively updating its value based on the LFSR algorithm.\n- Random: This 10-bit wire is assigned conditionally based on the RetryCnt and the bits of 'x'. Each bit of 'Random' (from 0 to 9) is either set to a corresponding bit from 'x' or to 0 depending on the RetryCnt value. This serves to mask portions of the random sequence based on the number of retries, adapting the randomness to the collision/retransmission context.\n- RandomLatched: This register holds the value of 'Random' once it's latched when both StateJam and StateJam_q conditions are true. The latched value is then used to determine output conditions regarding the equality checks against 0 and the ByteCnt."
