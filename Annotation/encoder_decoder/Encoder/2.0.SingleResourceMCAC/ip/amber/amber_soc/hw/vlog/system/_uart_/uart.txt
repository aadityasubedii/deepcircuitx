Module-level comment: This UART module implements a configurable serial interface with TX/RX capabilities and FIFO buffers. It interfaces with a Wishbone bus for control and data transfer. The module uses separate TX and RX state machines, FIFO management for both directions, and supports features like flow control and programmable baud rates. It includes register interfaces for configuration and status monitoring, and handles interrupt generation for efficient communication.
