Module name: infrastructure. 
Module specification: The 'infrastructure' module is crafted for managing clock operations in digital circuits, focusing on clock generation, distribution, and reset functionalities. It utilizes input ports such as 'sys_clk_p' and 'sys_clk_n' for differential clock sources, 'sys_clk' for single-ended sources, and 'sys_rst_i' for receiving reset signals. Output ports include 'clk0' for the main clock, 'rst0' for the synchronized reset signal, 'async_rst' for the asynchronous reset, 'sysclk_2x' and 'sysclk_2x_180' for high-frequency clock outputs, 'mcb_drp_clk' for Memory Controller Block operations, 'pll_ce_0' and 'pll_ce_90' for serialization strobes, and 'pll_lock' to indicate PLL stability. Within the module, internal signals such as 'clk_2x_0', 'clk_2x_180', and 'clk0_bufg' handle different phases and buffering of clock signals, while signals like 'locked' indicate the PLLâ€™s status, and 'rst0_sync_r' and 'syn_clk0_powerup_pll_locked' manage reset synchronization and power-up sequences. The module's code is structured into several blocks: clock inputs handling based on the type, PLL configuration for various outputs, synchronization of reset conditions, and usage of BUFPLL_MCB for specific output requirements, ensuring robust and versatile clock management suitable for various digital applications.
