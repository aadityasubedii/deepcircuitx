    "spec": "Module name: write_data_path.\n\nModule specification: The 'write_data_path' module is specifically designed for managing memory write operations within a configurable system. It handles robust data generation and control logic tailored to various memory configurations. The main input ports include clk_i (clock input), rst_i (reset input with 10-bit width), various command validity inputs (cmd_valid_i, cmd_validB_i, cmd_validC_i) signaling the readiness of new commands, prbs_fseed_i for pseudo-random sequence generation, data_mode_i for selecting data operation modes, fixed_data_i providing the actual data for memory writes, addr_i for memory address specification, bl_i indicating burst length, and data_rdy_i indicating the readiness of incoming data. The output ports comprise cmd_rdy_o indicating module readiness for new commands, data_valid_o signaling valid data output aligned as per configuration, last_word_wr_o marking the last word in a burst, data_o serving as the bus for output data, data_mask_o which masks data lanes, and data_wr_end_o indicating the end of a write operation. Internally, the module utilizes two main signals: data_valid, an interconnecting signal from submodule wr_data_gen to manage output data validation, and cmd_rdy, a register managing the command ready output signal indicating the module\u2019s readiness for new commands. The Verilog code includes instantiation of a submodule wr_data_gen, tasked with generating the write data and controlling the burst operations, signaling, and interfacing with the main module to ensure integrated and coherent memory write operations. The code structure follows typical design patterns for modularity and clarity, prioritizing robust parameterization and flexible interfacing to cater to diverse system requirements.",

The output ports comprise cmd_rdy_o indicating module readiness for new commands, data_valid_o signaling valid data output aligned as per configuration, last_word_wr_o marking the last word in a burst, data_o serving as the bus for output data, data_mask_o which masks data lanes, and data_wr_end_o indicating the end of a write operation. Internally, the module utilizes two main signals: data_valid, an interconnecting signal from submodule wr_data_gen to manage output data validation, and cmd_rdy, a register managing the command ready output signal indicating the module\u2019s readiness for new commands. The Verilog code includes instantiation of a submodule wr_data_gen, tasked with generating the write data and controlling the burst operations, signaling, and interfacing with the main module to ensure integrated and coherent memory write operations. The code structure follows typical design patterns for modularity and clarity, prioritizing robust parameterization and flexible interfacing to cater to diverse system requirements."
