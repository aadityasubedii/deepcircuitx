Module name: mcb_traffic_gen. Module specification: The mcb_traffic_gen module is designed to simulate traffic for memory controllers in various configurations. It generates memory commands, manages write and read data flow, and handles addressing for a memory system. The module supports both simulation and actual hardware execution, controlled by the "SIMULATION" parameter. Key inputs include clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), configuration signals for address, instruction, and data modes, and memory controller status signals. Outputs consist of memory command signals, write and read data paths, and error tracking information. Internal signals manage data flow, error handling, and synchronization between operational stages. The module is structured into several main blocks: a command generator (cmd_gen), a flow control unit (mcb_flow_control), read and write data paths, and a status tracking component (tg_status). It incorporates configurable parameters for flexibility in simulating various memory traffic
