Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), handling initialization, termination calibration, and dynamic calibration of DQS signals. It uses input signals like UI_CLK, RST, PLL_LOCK, and various MCB signals to control the calibration process. Output signals include DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL, SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ, and numerous MCB control signals. Internal signals such as STATE, P_Term, N_Term, and DQS_DELAY manage the calibration state machine and various calibration parameters. The module is divided into several blocks: initialization, RZQ/ZIO calibration, MCB broadcast, DQS delay adjustment, and dynamic calibration. It implements a state machine to control the calibration process, adjusting termination values and DQS delays to
