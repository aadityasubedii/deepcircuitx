Module name: afifo. Module specification: The 'afifo' module is designed to implement an asynchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer, suitable for managing data across different clock domains, an aspect made configurable by the SYNC parameter. The module operates with several input ports including 'wr_clk' (write clock), 'rst' (reset), 'wr_en' (write enable), 'wr_data' (write data), 'rd_en' (read enable), and 'rd_clk' (read clock). The output ports consist of 'rd_data' (read data output), along with status indicators 'full', 'empty', and 'almost_full'. Internally, the module utilizes signals such as 'mem' (memory storage), 'rd_gray' and 'wr_gray' (gray code pointers for read and write), as well as 'rd_ptr' and 'wr_ptr' (read and write pointers). Various code blocks manage pointer synchronization (SYNC blocks), data writing and reading (buffer operations), and status flag updates to help in signaling buffer states. This segregation of operations allows the FIFO to efficiently handle data transfers and maintain synchronization between different operating clock domains.
