Module-level comment: 
/**
 * This module implements a 2048x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using
 * four Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA block RAM primitives (RAMB16BWER). It supports read
 * and write operations with byte-level granularity. The module uses four 2048x8-bit
 * SRAM blocks, each handling one byte of the 32-bit data. Write operations are
 * controlled by both write enable and byte enable signals, allowing selective
 * writing to individual bytes within a 32-bit word.
