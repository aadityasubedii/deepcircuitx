Module name: eth_receivecontrol.

Module specification: The `eth_receivecontrol` module is designed for managing the reception control logic of Ethernet frames in an Ethernet-based communication system. It handles various aspects such as frame boundary detection, pause frame recognition, and address validation. The primary input ports include clocks (`MTxClk`, `MRxClk`), reset signals (`TxReset`, `RxReset`), data and data control signals (`RxData`, `RxValid`, `RxStartFrm`, `RxEndFrm`), along with configuration and state tracking signals like `MAC`, `DlyCrcEn`, etc. The output ports consist of signals like `Pause`, `ReceivedPauseFrm`, `AddressOK`, and `SetPauseTimer` indicating system status related to pause control and address matching status. Internal signals like `ReservedMulticast`, `TypeLength`, and `ByteCntEq0` to `ByteCntEq18` help in identifying specific frame types and positions within received data streams. The code is logically divided into sections handling different functionalities: initialization and reset conditions, byte count and address checking in the received frames, validation of type/length and operational codes, pause frame detection, timer assembly for managing pause intervals, pause control logic, and signal synchronization. Major functionalities include checking the alignment of incoming frames with reserved multicast or specific MAC addresses, modifying timers for flow control, and signaling the status of ongoing data transmission processes.
