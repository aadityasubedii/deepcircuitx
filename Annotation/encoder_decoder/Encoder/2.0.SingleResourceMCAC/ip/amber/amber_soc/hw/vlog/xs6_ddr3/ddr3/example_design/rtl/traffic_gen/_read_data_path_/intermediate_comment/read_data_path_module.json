    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'read_data_path' module facilitates data read operations in FPGA memory systems, crucial for testing memory interfaces. It manages command validation, burst handling, and error detection using sub-modules like FIFOs for command queuing ('read_posted_fifo'), data pattern generation ('rd_data_gen'), and buffering ('afifo'). These internal blocks, alongside various input/output ports and internal signals, ensure robust data management, synchronization, and response to different memory configurations and access sequences."
