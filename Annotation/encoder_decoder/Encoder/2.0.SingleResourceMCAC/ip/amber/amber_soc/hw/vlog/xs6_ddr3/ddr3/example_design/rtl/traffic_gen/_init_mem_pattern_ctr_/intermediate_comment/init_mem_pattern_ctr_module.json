    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"init_mem_pattern_ctr\" module initializes and tests memory configurations for FPGAs, handling various operational modes. It incorporates a state machine transitioning through states like IDLE, INIT_MEM_WRITE, and TEST_MEM based on input controls and parameters affecting burst lengths, address, and data modes. Ports control and internal state monitoring manage memory operations effectively, adapting to different FPGA families, ensuring robust memory setup and operation testing."
