    "module": "Module-level comment: The `a25_multiply` module performs 32-bit multiplication and optional accumulation of inputs `i_a_in` and `i_b_in`. It operates synchronized with `i_clk` and handles stalls using `i_core_stall`. The module toggles processing with `i_execute` and uses Booth's algorithm for multiplication. Conditional compilation supports specific FPGA optimizations (Xilinx Spartan-6 or Virtex-6), using dedicated adder/subtractor blocks. Outputs include the product/result, status flags, and a completion indicator. Adjustments through internal signals and sequential counting ensure robust step-by-step computation."
