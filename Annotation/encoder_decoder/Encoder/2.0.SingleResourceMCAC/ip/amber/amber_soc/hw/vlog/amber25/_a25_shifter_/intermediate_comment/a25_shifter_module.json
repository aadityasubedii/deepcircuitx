    "module": "Module-level comment: The a25_shifter module performs various bit-shifting operations (LSL, LSR, ASR, ROR) on a 32-bit input. It leverages internal 33-bit signals (lsl_out, lsr_out, asr_out, ror_out) to handle shifts, manage overflows, and maintain bit integrity. The functionality is configurable for full barrel or quick modes via the FULL_BARREL parameter, optimizing for complexity or performance. Final output is determined by a multiplexer based on the shift function."
