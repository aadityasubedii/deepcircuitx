    "module": "Module-level comment: The mcb_soft_calibration_top module orchestrates soft calibration for DDR memory controllers. It manages memory synchronization and calibration using signals like UI_CLK for timing, RST for reset initialization, and various status and control inputs and outputs to adjust memory operation parameters. Internally, the module uses IOBUF and IODRP2 blocks for bi-directional pin management and utilizes internal registers and signals for precise control. Calibration settings are adjustable via parameters, catering to different memory types and simulation needs."
