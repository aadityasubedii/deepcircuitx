Module name: memc_tb_top. Module specification: The memc_tb_top module is a testbench top-level module for a memory controller (MEMC) design, supporting up to six ports with configurable modes. It instantiates and connects multiple traffic generators (TGs) for different ports, simulating various memory read and write operations. The module features parameterizable port configurations, data widths, and addressing modes. Input ports include clock, reset, calibration status, VIO control signals, and various status signals from the memory controller for each port. Output ports consist of control signals for each port, such as command enable, instruction, burst length, address, write enable, write mask, write data, and read enable, as well as comparison-related outputs and error signals. Internal signals control traffic generation, address ranges, seeds, and mode settings for each port. The module is divided into sections for each port, including traffic generator instant
