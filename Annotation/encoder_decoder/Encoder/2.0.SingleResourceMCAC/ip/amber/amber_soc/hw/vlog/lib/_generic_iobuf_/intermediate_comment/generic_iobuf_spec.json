    "spec": "Module name: generic_iobuf.\nModule specification: The 'generic_iobuf' module functions as a generic bidirectional input/output buffer, managing a single I/O pin named 'IO'. The module includes two input ports: 'I' and 'T'. 'I' is a data input used to drive the 'IO' pin when the tri-state control 'T' is low, allowing the pin to output the value given at 'I'. The 'T' input determines the mode of the 'IO' pin, setting it to high impedance (Z) when 'T' is high, thus allowing external devices to drive the pin. There is one output port, 'O', which mirrors the current level of the 'IO' pin, making it possible to monitor external signals entering the module through 'IO'. The module lacks internal signals, relying solely on direct connections and assignments between these external ports. In the Verilog implementation, the 'O' port is directly assigned the value of 'IO', and 'IO' is conditionally assigned either a high impedance state or the value of 'I' based on the status of 'T'. This straightforward design facilitates the implementation of versatile, reconfigurable single-pin I/O interfaces typically used in various digital systems.",
