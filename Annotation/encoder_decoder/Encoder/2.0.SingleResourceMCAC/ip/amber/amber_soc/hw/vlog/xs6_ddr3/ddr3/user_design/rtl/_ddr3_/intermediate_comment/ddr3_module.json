    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a DDR3 memory controller interface, instantiating a memory controller core to interact with external DDR3 SDRAM. It manages clock generation, reset logic, and multiple command/data ports (p0-p5). The module uses an infrastructure block for clock management and a memory controller wrapper to configure and operate the DDR3 interface, handling various timing parameters, port configurations, and memory operations."
