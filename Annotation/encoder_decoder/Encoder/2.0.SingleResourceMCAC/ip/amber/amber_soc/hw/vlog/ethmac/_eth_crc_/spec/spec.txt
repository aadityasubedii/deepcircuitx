Module name: eth_crc. 

Module specification: The 'eth_crc' module is responsible for calculating a 32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) value for Ethernet frames, aiding in data integrity checks during network communications. It operates with a 4-bit input data stream under the control of various signals. The input ports include `Clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `Reset` (resets CRC to an initial value), `Data` (4-bit input data for CRC computation), `Enable` (enables CRC calculation), and `Initialize` (re-initializes the CRC value). The output ports are `Crc` (the computed 32-bit CRC value) and `CrcError` (indicates mismatch against a predefined CRC value). Internally, the module uses the `CrcNext` signal array, which holds the next calculated state of the CRC and is determined based on the current CRC value and the input data under logical operations including XOR and AND. The Verilog implementation is segmented into blocks, including assignments for `CrcNext` based on enabled operations and logical conditions, an always block for updating `Crc` depending on the clock, reset, and initialization conditions, and the CRC error checking which compares computed CRC against a set standard. This organized structure ensures reliable CRC computation and the detection of transmission errors effectively.
