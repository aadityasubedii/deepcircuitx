Module name: eth_txcounters.
Module specification: The `eth_txcounters` module is designed for managing various transmission counters in an Ethernet environment, tracking byte and nibble counts across different states and conditions of frame transmission. It operates synchronously with the primary transmit clock (`MTxClk`) with a capability to reset through the `Reset` input. `StatePreamble`, `StateIPG`, `StateData`, `StatePAD`, `StateFCS`, `StateJam`, `StateBackOff`, `StateDefer`, `StateIdle`, and `StateSFD` are input signals denoting the current state of frame transmission. Initiation signals like `StartDefer`, `StartIPG`, `StartFCS`, `StartJam`, and `StartBackoff` trigger specific counting operations including resets. Outputs of the module include `ByteCnt` and `NibCnt` that represent the byte and nibble counts, respectively. Additional outputs like `ExcessiveDefer`, `NibCntEq7`, `NibCntEq15`, `MaxFrame`, and `NibbleMinFl` indicate specific conditions reached during transmission, such as excessive defer conditions or specific nibble counts reached. The `DlyCrcCnt` output manages the count of delayed CRC operations during data transmission. Internal signals include `ExcessiveDeferCnt`, `ResetNibCnt`, `IncrementNibCnt`, `ResetByteCnt`, `IncrementByteCnt`, and `ByteCntMax`, each governing specific operations such as detecting excessive defer conditions, enabling resets, and controlling counter increments in various transmission states. The code is structured around several always blocks and assignments, managing the stateful count logic and conditional checks driven by the current state and transitional events such as the start of frame or completion of packet transmission, ensuring robust transmission counter management.
