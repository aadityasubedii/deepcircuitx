Module-level comment: The 'a23_register_bank' module manages CPU register operations across different modes (USR, SVC, IRQ, FIRQ). It synchronizes register updates to the system clock and manages conditional data transfers based on mode-specific flags and selectors (`i_rm_sel`, `i_rds_sel`, `i_rn_sel`). Internal registers store state for various modes, and control logic determines output based on the active CPU mode and input selectors. This design ensures efficient and accurate register handling for CPU operations.
