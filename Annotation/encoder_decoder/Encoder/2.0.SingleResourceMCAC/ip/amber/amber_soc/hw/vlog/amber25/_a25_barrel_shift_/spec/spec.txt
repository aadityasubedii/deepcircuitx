Module name: a25_barrel_shift. Module specification: The a25_barrel_shift module is designed to implement a versatile barrel shifter that can select between a quick and a full-barrel shifting mechanism, depending on the shifting requirements specified by the input parameters. It accepts a 32-bit input (`i_in`) and shifts it according to an 8-bit shift amount (`i_shift_amount`) under control of additional input signals including a carry input (`i_carry_in`), an immediate zero shift control (`i_shift_imm_zero`), and a 2-bit function code (`i_function`) that dictates the type of shift operation. The outputs of the module are the 32-bit shifted data (`o_out`), a carry output (`o_carry_out`), and a stall signal (`o_stall`) which indicates whether the shift operation required the full shifter. Internal signals include `quick_out`, `quick_carry_out`, `full_out`, `full_carry_out`, and registers `full_out_r`, `full_carry_out_r`, `use_quick_r` to manage and store states between clock cycles. The module incorporates two instances of a25_shifter submodules configured respectively for quick and full barrel operations, influencing the overall shift functionality. The design handles synchronization and decision-making processes based on the shift requirements, optimally choosing between quick and extensive full shifting methods, updating its internal state registers every positive clock edge to provide seamless operation and accurate output signals.
