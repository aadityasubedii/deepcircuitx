Module name: ethmac_wb

Module specification: The `ethmac_wb` module functions as an interface component in an Ethernet MAC subsystem, linking the master and slave sections of a Wishbone bus. It supports configurable data widths of 32 or 128 bits. The module handles various input and output ports - `i_m_wb_*` inputs connect to the master side and include signals like address (`adr`), data (`wdat`), control (`cyc`, `stb`, `we`), and feedback (`ack`, `err`). Correspondingly, `o_m_wb_*` outputs interface back to the master side. Likewise, `i_s_wb_*` inputs and `o_s_wb_*` outputs connect to and from the slave side, respectively, transferring similar kinds of data and control signals. The module doesnâ€™t utilize explicit internal signals for internal storage or data manipulation; instead, it directly manipulates and routes these inputs to outputs through conditional checks and assignments. The Verilog code includes two main generate blocks: `wbm128` and `wbm32` for the master, and `wbs128` and `wbs32` for the slave interfaces, handling data width adaptation, endianness conversion, and signal alignment based on the `WB_DWIDTH` parameter. These generate blocks conditionally format outputs primarily concerning data width and endian corrections using helper functions from an included file `system_functions.vh`, illustrating a dynamic and reconfigurable design approach suitable for variable bus configurations in network applications.
