Module name: xs6_sram_256x128_byte_en.

Module specification: The "xs6_sram_256x128_byte_en" module is designed to interface with a byte-addressable SRAM, enabling selective memory access with byte enable signals for byte-wise read and write operations. It operates based on the following ports: 'i_clk' a clock input for synchronization; 'i_write_data', a 128-bit input carrying data to be written to the memory; 'i_write_enable', a control signal allowing memory write operations when high; 'i_address', an 8-bit address signal indicating SRAM location for operations; and 'i_byte_enable', a 16-bit input as a mask for determining active bytes in data operations. Output is facilitated through 'o_read_data', a 128-bit signal presenting the data read from SRAM. Internally, 'byte_write_enable' is crucial, computed by ANDing 'i_write_enable' with 'i_byte_enable' to govern the byte-specific writing. The code structure includes parameter checks for 'DATA_WIDTH' and 'ADDRESS_WIDTH', ensuring they are set to 128 and 8, respectively. Instantiation of four memory blocks (instances of RAMB8BWER) in a generate block configures specific settings for dual-port operation, handling separate read and write processes for efficient memory management.
