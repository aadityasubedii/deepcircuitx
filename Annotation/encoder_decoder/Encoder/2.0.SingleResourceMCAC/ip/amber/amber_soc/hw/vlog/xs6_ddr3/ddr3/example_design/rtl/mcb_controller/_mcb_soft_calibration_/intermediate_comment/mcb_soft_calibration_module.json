    "module": "Module-level comment: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), including initialization, termination calibration, and dynamic DQS signal calibration. It uses a state machine to control the calibration process, adjusting RZQ/ZIO termination values and DQS delays. The module handles various calibration stages, including P-term and N-term adjustments, DQS delay calibration, and self-refresh operations. It interfaces with the MCB and IODRPs to optimize memory interface performance and signal integrity."
