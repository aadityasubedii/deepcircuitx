It determines whether the incoming frames are valid by comparing the destination address in each frame with predefined addresses and conditions determined by the logic in the module. Specifically, it outputs signals indicating an abort of the frame reception (RxAbort) or an address mismatch (AddressMiss) based on checks such as broadcast address checks, multicast checks using hash tables (HASH0, HASH1), and direct comparison for unicast addresses with the MAC address. The module also handles resets and updates its state based on the end of the frame or abort conditions. This is crucial for establishing whether a frame should be processed or dropped, enhancing network security and filtering."
