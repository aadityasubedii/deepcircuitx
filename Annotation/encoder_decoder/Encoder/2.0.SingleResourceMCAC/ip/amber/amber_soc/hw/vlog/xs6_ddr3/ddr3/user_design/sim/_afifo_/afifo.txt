Module-level comment: The 'afifo' module is a parameterized asynchronous FIFO that buffers data between different clock domains using 'wr_clk' for writes and 'rd_clk' for reads. It employs gray code counters for pointers to ensure synchronization and safe data handling across domains. The module uses internal memory for storage and implements synchronization, pointer management, and status indications (full, empty, almost_full) through dedicated logic blocks within different clock phases.
