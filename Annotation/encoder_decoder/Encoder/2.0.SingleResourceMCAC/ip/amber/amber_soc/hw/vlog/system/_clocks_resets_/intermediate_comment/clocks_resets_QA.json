It takes differential board clock signals (i_brd_clk_n, i_brd_clk_p), a board reset signal (i_brd_rst), and a calibration completion signal (i_ddr_calib_done) as inputs. It produces three outputs: a system reset signal (o_sys_rst), a system clock signal (o_sys_clk), and another clock signal (o_clk_200). The module includes conditional checks to either use dedicated FPGA blocks like IBUFGDS, PLL_ADV, or MMCM_ADV for clock management, depending on the type of FPGA (Xilinx Spartan-6 or Virtex-6). The functionality includes generating the system reset signal based on calibration completion and reset synchronization, and generating the system clock based on PLL or MMCM configurations specific to the FPGA type. The outputs reflect system synchronization and reliability via the combined management of clocks and resets."

It integrates the board reset and pll_locked status to manage the conditional reset behavior aligned with PLL locking.\n- `pll_clk`: The clock signal generated by the PLL or MMCM, which is used as the primary system clock (`o_sys_clk`) after buffering. It drives the internal logic and operations aligned with system requirements.\n- `brd_clk_ibufg`: This signal is the output of an input buffer that conditions the incoming differential clock signals (`i_brd_clk_n`, `i_brd_clk_p`) to be suitable for internal use, primarily utilized within PLL/ MMCM for generating other required clocks.
