    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/*\nThis module implements a 1024x128-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using 8 RAMB16BWER blocks in a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. It provides a 128-bit data width with a 10-bit address space, split into two 512-entry banks. The module supports read and write operations with byte-level granularity, controlled by a 16-bit byte enable signal. It allows for memory initialization through parameters and handles bank selection based on the most significant address bit.\n*/"
