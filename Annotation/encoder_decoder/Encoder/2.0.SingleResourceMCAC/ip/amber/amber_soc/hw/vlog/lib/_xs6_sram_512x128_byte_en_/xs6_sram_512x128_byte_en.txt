Module-level comment: This module implements a 512x128-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality for Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGAs. It uses four RAMB16BWER primitives to create a 128-bit wide data interface, allowing for byte-level write operations through a 16-bit byte enable signal. The module provides separate read and write ports, with a 9-bit address input and supports memory initialization via parameters.
