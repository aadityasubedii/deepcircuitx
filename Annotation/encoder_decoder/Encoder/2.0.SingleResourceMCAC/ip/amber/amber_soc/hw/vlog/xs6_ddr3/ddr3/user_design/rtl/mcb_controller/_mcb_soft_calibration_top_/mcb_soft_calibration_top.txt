Module-level comment: The 'mcb_soft_calibration_top' module oversees software-based and hardware-level calibrations for DDR memories in memory controllers. It utilizes input and output ports to manage calibration signals, control self-refresh functionalities, and interface with memory controller settings. Internally, it leverages specific signals for dynamic reconfiguration and impedance adjustments through DRP. The module implements serial data interfaces and calibration sequence management to ensure accurate and stable memory operations.
