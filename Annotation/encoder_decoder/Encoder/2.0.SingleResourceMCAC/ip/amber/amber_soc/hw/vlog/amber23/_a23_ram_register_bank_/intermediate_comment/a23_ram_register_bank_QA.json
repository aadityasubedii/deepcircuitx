This module performs several functions:\n1. It manages registers which includes storing and providing access to multiple registers (`reg_ram_n`, `reg_ram_m`, `reg_ram_ds`).\n2. It deals with different modes of execution as captured through inputs `i_mode_exec`, `i_mode_exec_nxt`, `i_mode_rds_exec`, and manipulates register data accordingly.\n3. It allows updates and access to the program counter (`r15`), which also involves handling status bits and flags related to interrupt handling and control.\n4. The register bank supports conditional access to a special register (R15/PC) based on whether certain conditions (`rm_15`, `rds_15`, `rn_15`) are true.\n5. It handles writing to registers with consideration to different modes and index selection, using a function `reg_addr` to compute memory addresses.\nThe module effectively maintains and updates the CPU's state by providing mechanisms to read from and write to marks, accommodating different operational modes, and handling special functionality related to the program counter and interrupt status."
