Module name: eth_wishbone. Module specification: This module implements a Wishbone interface for an Ethernet controller, managing communication between the Ethernet MAC and the system bus. It handles transmit and receive operations, including buffer management, status handling, and interrupt generation. Key input ports include clock signals (WB_CLK_I, MTxClk, MRxClk), Wishbone bus signals (WB_DAT_I, WB_ADR_I, WB_WE_I), and various Ethernet control signals. Output ports consist of Wishbone response signals (WB_DAT_O, WB_ACK_O), master Wishbone signals (m_wb_*), and Ethernet transmit/receive control signals. Internal signals like TxBDReady, RxBDReady, TxLength, and RxLength manage buffer descriptors and frame lengths.
