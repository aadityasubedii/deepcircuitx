Module-level comment: 
/**
 * This module generates various data patterns for memory testing, including PRBS, address-based, 
 * walking 1's/0's, neighbor, and fixed patterns. It supports different data widths and burst lengths.
 * The module uses a PRBS generator, address counters, and pattern-specific logic to create complex
 * test data. It selects the appropriate pattern based on input mode and parameters, allowing for
 * comprehensive memory interface testing, including eye testing and various data stress patterns.
