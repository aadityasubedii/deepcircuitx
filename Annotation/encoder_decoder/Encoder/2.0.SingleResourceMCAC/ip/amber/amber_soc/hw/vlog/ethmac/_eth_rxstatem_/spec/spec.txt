Module name: eth_rxstatem. Module specification: The 'eth_rxstatem' module is designed to manage the state transitions in an Ethernet receiver's state machine. It operates by monitoring input signals such as MRxDV (Data Valid) and controlling outputs that represent different machine states. The inputs include MRxClk (the clock signal), Reset (reset signal), MRxDV (data validity indicator), ByteCntEq0 (byte count equals zero), ByteCntGreat2 (byte count greater than two), MRxDEq5 (received data equals hexadecimal 5), Transmitting (transmission indicator), MRxDEqD (received data equals hexadecimal D), IFGCounterEq24 (inter-frame gap counter equals 24), and ByteCntMaxFrame (byte count reaches the maximum frame size). The outputs are two-bit StateData (indicating data reception states), StateIdle (idle state), StatePreamble (preamble detection), StateSFD (Start Frame Delimiter detection), and StateDrop (frame drop condition). Internally, the module uses signals like StartIdle, StartDrop, StartData0, StartData1, StartPreamble, and StartSFD to manage state transitions based on conditions deduced from the inputs. The code is structured around a sequential block triggered by the positive edge of MRxClk or a positive edge of Reset, managing state assignments with conditional checks for starting or stopping various states. An operational flow is established through signal conditioning and state determination logic to ensure correct state transitions responding to incoming frame data and conditions, effectively guiding the Ethernet frame reception and error handling process.
