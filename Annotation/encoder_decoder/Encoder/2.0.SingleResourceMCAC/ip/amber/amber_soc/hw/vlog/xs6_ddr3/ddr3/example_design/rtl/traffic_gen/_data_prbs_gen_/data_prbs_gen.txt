Module-level comment: The 'data_prbs_gen' module generates pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). It is driven by a clock (`clk_i`), and selectively updates state based on a clock enable signal (`clk_en`) and a reset (`rst_i`). Seed values can be set and modified via inputs (`prbs_seed_i`, `prbs_fseed_i`), controlling LFSR initialization. The LFSR state is output through `prbs_o`, reflecting the PRBS.
