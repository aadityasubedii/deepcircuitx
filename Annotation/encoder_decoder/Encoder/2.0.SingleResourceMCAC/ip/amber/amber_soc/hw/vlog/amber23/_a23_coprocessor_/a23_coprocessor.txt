Module-level comment: The a23_coprocessor module manages caching and fault handling in a computing system, reacting to control inputs and fault signals. It synchronizes with the CPU via the i_fetch_stall signal to ensure updates occur without disrupting ongoing fetch operations. The module processes input operations and registers, controlling outputs like cache enabling and area specifications. It uses registers and conditional logic for state management and debugging, facilitating efficient and error-resilient operations.
