Module name: wishbone_arbiter.
Module specification: The "wishbone_arbiter" is a critical module tailored to arbitrate access to a shared Wishbone bus among multiple master devices, ensuring efficient and orderly communication between the masters and various slave devices. The module utilizes a set of input and output ports such as `i_wb_clk` (clock signal), `i_m0_wb_adr`, `i_m1_wb_adr` (address inputs for master 0 and master 1), and corresponding byte select, write enable, data, cycle, and strobe signals to handle read and write operations. Output ports include `o_m0_wb_dat`, `o_m1_wb_dat` (data outputs to masters), along with respective acknowledgment and error signals, plus slave addressing and control outputs (`o_s0_wb_adr` to `o_s7_wb_adr`). Internal signals like `m0_wb_hold_r`, `m1_wb_hold_r` (hold registers), `current_master`, `select_master`, `next_master` (master control), and `current_slave` (slave selector) manage the state and control flow within the module. Code blocks within the module are dedicated to determining master and slave selection based on current bus statuses and requests (`current_master`, `select_master`), routing master commands to appropriate slave devices (`master_adr`, `master_sel`, etc.), and directing responses back to the initiating masters (`master_rdat`, `master_ack`, `master_err`). The configuration for memory mapping and device addressing is integrated via an included VH file (`memory_configuration.vh`). This module ensures that the bus system maintains integrity and operates efficiently under the protocol constraints of the Wishbone specification, accommodating simultaneous requests and controlling access rights.
