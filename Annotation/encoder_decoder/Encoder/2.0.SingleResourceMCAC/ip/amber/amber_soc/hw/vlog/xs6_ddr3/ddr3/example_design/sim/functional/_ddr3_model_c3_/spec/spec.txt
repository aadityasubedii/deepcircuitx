Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module is a behavioral model of a DDR3 SDRAM device, simulating its functionality and timing characteristics. It has input ports for clock (ck, ck_n), control signals (cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address and bank selection (addr, ba), data mask (dm_tdqs), data bus (dq), data strobe (dqs, dqs_n), and on-die termination control (odt). The only output port is tdqs_n for termination data strobe. The module uses internal signals for timing calculations (e.g., tck_avg, tck_sample), jitter analysis (e.g., tjit_per_rtime), and maintaining clock-related information (e.g., tm_ck_pos, tm_
