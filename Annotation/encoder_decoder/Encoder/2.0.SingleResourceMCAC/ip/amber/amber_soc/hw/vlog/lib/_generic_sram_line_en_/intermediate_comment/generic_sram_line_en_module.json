    "module": "Module-level comment: The `generic_sram_line_en` module simulates an SRAM with enable, parameterized by `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDRESS_WIDTH`. It writes data on `i_write_enable` high or outputs data on low, synchronized to `i_clk`. Memory `mem` is optionally initialized to zero controlled by `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO`. The operation is encapsulated within an always block managing data writes or reads based on the control signal."
