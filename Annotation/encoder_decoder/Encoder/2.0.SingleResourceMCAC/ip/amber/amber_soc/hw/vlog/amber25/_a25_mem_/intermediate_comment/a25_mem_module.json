    "module": "Module-level comment: The a25_mem module manages memory access in computing systems, handling both cached and uncached data transactions. It processes input signals for address validity, write operations, and stall conditions, and controls output signals for managing data flow and system responsiveness. Internally, it uses conditional logic to select between caching mechanisms or direct memory access, integrates a subcomponent for cache management, and employs various internal signals for operational control like data fetching, stalling, and data integrity assurance."
