Module name: ddr3. Module specification: The ddr3 module is a DDR3 memory controller interface that instantiates and configures a memory controller core to interface with external DDR3 SDRAM. It handles clock generation, reset logic, and connects external DDR3 SDRAM signals to the internal memory controller core. The module has input ports for system clock (c3_sys_clk), reset (c3_sys_rst_i), and multiple command, write, and read ports (p0 to p5) for memory operations. Output ports include DDR3 SDRAM interface signals (mcb3_dram_*), calibration status (c3_calib_done), and status signals for each port. Internal signals manage clock distribution, reset handling, and debugging. The module is divided into two main blocks: an infrastructure block for clock management and a memory controller wrapper (memc_
