Module-level comment: The 'iodrp_controller' module manages memory transactions for read and write operations, triggered by a clock signal (DRP_CLK). It employs an FSM to transition through various states, handling data and address phases using internal registers and a shift register. Input controls dictate transaction types and valid commands, while outputs include transaction data and status indicators. Efficient state management enables precise coordination during memory interactions.
