These operations include logical left shift (LSL), logical right shift (LSR), arithmetic right shift (ASR), and rotate right (ROR) based on the provided shift amount. The module takes a 32-bit input, a carry-in bit, a shift amount (0-255), a flag to indicate if the shift amount is zero, and a function code to specify the type of shift. Outputs include the 32-bit result and a carry-out bit. The operation is determined by the function code, and the shifting includes handling carry-ins and carry-outs appropriately to support operations like rotate through carry."

The extra bit is used to handle the carry-out from the shift operation.\n- **lsr_out**: Similar to `lsl_out`, this 33-bit internal wire signal holds the result of the logical right shift (LSR) operation.

Arithmetic shifts preserve the sign of the data, and this signal includes handling the sign extension properly.\n- **ror_out**: This 33-bit signal holds the result of the rotate right (ROR) operation.
