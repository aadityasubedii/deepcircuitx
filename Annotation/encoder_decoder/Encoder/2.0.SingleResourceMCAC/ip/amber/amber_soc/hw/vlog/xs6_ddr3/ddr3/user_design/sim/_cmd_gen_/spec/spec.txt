Module name: cmd_gen. Module specification: The cmd_gen module is a command generator for memory controllers, specifically designed for Xilinx FPGAs (Spartan-6 and Virtex-6 families). It generates memory commands (read, write, refresh) with various addressing modes (fixed, sequential, PRBS) and burst lengths. The module takes inputs such as clk_i (system clock), rst_i (reset), run_traffic_i (enables command generation), rd_buff_avail_i (read buffer availability), and various configuration signals for address, data, and instruction modes. It outputs addr_o (generated address), instr_o (generated instruction), bl_o (burst length), and cmd_o_vld (command validity). Internally, it uses signals like addr_counts (address counter), prbs_addr (PRBS-generated address), and instr_out
