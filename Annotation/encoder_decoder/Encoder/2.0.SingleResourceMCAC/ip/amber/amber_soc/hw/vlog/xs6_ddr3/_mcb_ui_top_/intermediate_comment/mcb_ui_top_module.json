    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a top-level interface for a memory controller block (MCB) supporting multiple ports and AXI interfaces. It integrates arbitration, command handling, read/write operations, and AXI-to-MCB conversion. The module uses a raw wrapper for the MCB core, BUFPLL for clock management, and configurable AXI interfaces. It supports various memory types, port configurations, and arbitration algorithms, handling clock management, calibration, and data transfer between AXI and MCB interfaces."
