It features parametrizable data width and address size. When the input `i_write_enable` is active, the module writes data from `i_write_data` into a memory location specified by `i_address`. If `i_write_enable` is inactive, the module outputs data from the memory location specified by `i_address` through `o_read_data`. Additionally, there is an option to initialize all memory locations to zero at startup if the `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO` parameter is set to 1. The memory write operation is clocked, occurring at the rising edge of `i_clk`."

The operations within the module (e.g., reading and writing to memory) are synchronized to the rising edge of this clock signal.\n- **i_write_data**: This input provides the data that should be written into the memory. The data width is defined by the parameter `DATA_WIDTH`. This data is written to the memory location specified by `i_address` when `i_write_enable` is active.\n- **i_write_enable**: This input is a control signal that enables writing to the memory. When this signal is high (`1`), the data from `i_write_data` is written to the memory at the location specified by `i_address`. When low (`0`), the memory write operation is disabled, and the module outputs data from the specified memory location instead.\n- **i_address**: This port specifies the memory address for the read or write operation. The address width is defined by the parameter `ADDRESS_WIDTH`.\n\nOutput ports: o_read_data.\nExplanation:\n- **o_read_data**: This output port holds the data read from the memory. If `i_write_enable` is low, the data from the memory location addressed by `i_address` is placed on this output. The data width of the output matches `DATA_WIDTH`. If `i_write_enable` is high, during the write operation, this output will return a zero value across `DATA_WIDTH` bits."

The memory serves as the storage element in the module, where data is written to or read from based on the address specified by `i_address`.
