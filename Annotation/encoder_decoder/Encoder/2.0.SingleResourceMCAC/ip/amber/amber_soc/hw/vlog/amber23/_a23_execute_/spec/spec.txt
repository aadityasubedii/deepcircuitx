Module name: a23_execute. Module specification: The a23_execute module is a critical component of an ARM processor, responsible for the execution stage of the pipeline. It performs arithmetic and logical operations, handles data accesses, and manages processor state updates. The module takes input signals including clock, data, status flags, and control signals, and produces outputs such as write data, addresses, and updated status flags. Key input ports include i_clk (clock), i_read_data (data input), i_condition (execution condition), and various control signals. Output ports include o_write_data (data output), o_address (memory address), and o_status_bits (processor status). Internal signals like alu_out, barrel_shift_out, and status_bits_flags are used for intermediate calculations and state management. The module is structured into several functional blocks: a barrel shifter, an ALU, a multiplier, and a register
