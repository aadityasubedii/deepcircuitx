Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: This module serves as a top-level interface for a memory controller block (MCB) with support for multiple ports and AXI interfaces. It integrates various components including arbitration, command handling, read/write operations, and AXI-to-MCB conversion. The module can be configured with different parameters to support various memory types, port configurations, and AXI interfaces. It handles clock management, calibration, and provides options for different arbitration algorithms. The module has numerous input and output ports, including clock and reset signals, port-specific control signals, calibration inputs, user interface signals, and AXI interface signals for up to six AXI ports. Internal signals are used for interfacing between external ports and internal logic, handling commands, read/write operations, and status information. The module is divided into several main blocks: a raw wrapper for the memory controller, BUFP
