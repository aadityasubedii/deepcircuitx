Module-level comment: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), including input termination and DQS signal dynamic calibration. It uses a state machine to control the process, adjusting P-term, N-term values, and DQS delays. The module interfaces with IODRP controllers to read/write calibration values, broadcasts parameters, and manages self-refresh operations. It adapts to varying operating conditions to optimize signal integrity and timing for memory operations.
