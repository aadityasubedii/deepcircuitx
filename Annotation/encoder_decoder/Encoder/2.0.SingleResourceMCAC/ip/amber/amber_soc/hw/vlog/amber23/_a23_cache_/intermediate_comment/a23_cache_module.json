    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable cache memory system for a processor. It manages multiple cache lines with configurable words per line and associativity levels. The cache handles data storage, retrieval, exclusive access, write/read operations, and refills from backing memory. It uses separate tag and data RAMs for each way, implements hit detection logic, and employs a state machine for controlling operations. The module interfaces with the CPU core and a bus for data transactions, supporting features like write-back, cache flushing, and stall handling to maintain data coherency and performance."
