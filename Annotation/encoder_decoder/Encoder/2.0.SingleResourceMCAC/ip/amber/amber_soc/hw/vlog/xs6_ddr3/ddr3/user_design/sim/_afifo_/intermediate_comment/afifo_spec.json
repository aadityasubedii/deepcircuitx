    "spec": "Module name: afifo. \nModule specification: The 'afifo' module is a parameterized asynchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer designed to manage data buffering across two different clock domains using gray code counters for read and write pointers. It handles write operations with the 'wr_clk' and read operations with the 'rd_clk'. The module has six input ports: 'wr_clk' (write clock), 'rst' (reset), 'wr_en' (write enable), 'wr_data' (write data bus), 'rd_en' (read enable), and 'rd_clk' (read clock). The outputs include 'rd_data' (read data bus), 'full' (FIFO is full), 'empty' (FIFO is empty), and 'almost_full' (FIFO is almost full). Internally, the module uses registers like 'mem' for storing FIFO data, 'rd_gray' and 'wr_gray' for managing synchronized read and write pointers in gray code, among others. Key blocks in the code handle synchronization (using the 'SYNC' parameter), write and read operations, update of pointers, and status signal generation (full, empty, almost_full). The synchronization blocks ensure safe data transfer between the differing clock domains, and pointers management utilizes gray coding to maintain coherence and minimize errors during asynchronous operations.",

It is designed to handle data buffering between two different clock domains, specifically handling writes on a 'wr_clk' and reads on a 'rd_clk'. The FIFO uses gray code counters to manage read and write pointers, which helps to safely handle the asynchronous nature of the read and write processes. It includes controls for checking when the FIFO is full, empty, or almost full. The FIFO accepts input data ('wr_data') on write operations enabled by 'wr_en', and outputs data ('rd_data') on read operations enabled by 'rd_en'. The module also integrates safety mechanisms to avoid race conditions through synchronization blocks controlled by the 'SYNC' parameter."

When high, it allows data on the `wr_data` bus to be written into the FIFO.\n- `wr_data`: Write data bus. Holds the data to be written into the FIFO when `wr_en` is asserted.\n- `rd_en`: Read enable signal. When high, it allows data to be read from the FIFO.\n- `rd_clk`: Read clock input. Used to clock all read operations from the FIFO.\n\nOutput ports: [rd_data, full, empty, almost_full].\nExplanation: \n- `rd_data`: Read data bus.

It is high when FIFO reaches its maximum storage capacity.\n- `empty`: Indicates that the FIFO is empty and contains no data to read.

It handles write operations with the 'wr_clk' and read operations with the 'rd_clk'. The module has six input ports: 'wr_clk' (write clock), 'rst' (reset), 'wr_en' (write enable), 'wr_data' (write data bus), 'rd_en' (read enable), and 'rd_clk' (read clock). The outputs include 'rd_data' (read data bus), 'full' (FIFO is full), 'empty' (FIFO is empty), and 'almost_full' (FIFO is almost full). Internally, the module uses registers like 'mem' for storing FIFO data, 'rd_gray' and 'wr_gray' for managing synchronized read and write pointers in gray code, among others. Key blocks in the code handle synchronization (using the 'SYNC' parameter), write and read operations, update of pointers, and status signal generation (full, empty, almost_full). The synchronization blocks ensure safe data transfer between the differing clock domains, and pointers management utilizes gray coding to maintain coherence and minimize errors during asynchronous operations."
