The Divider input sets the frequency of the Mdc relative to the input Clk. The module ensures that the Mdc has a frequency which is less than or equal to half of the frequency dictated by Divider, by adjusting Divider values less than 2 to 2. The module outputs Mdc, MdcEn, and MdcEn_n signals; Mdc indicates the management clock, MdcEn is active when Mdc is low, and MdcEn_n is active when Mdc is high, both only during CountEq0 condition (i.e., when the internal Counter reaches zero). If the Reset is active, it initializes the Mdc to an inactive state and sets the Counter base value to ensure proper timing post-reset."

It provides the timing reference for the operation of the module, particularly for the synchronization of the management data clock (Mdc) and internal counters.\n- `Reset`: This is the reset input, which is used to reset the internal state and outputs of the module to defined initial conditions. When active, it initializes the counter and sets Mdc to a low state.\n- `Divider`: This is an 8-bit input that determines the frequency division factor for the generated Mdc relative to the Clk input. It sets the period of the Mdc, which is adjusted to be equal to or lesser than half the frequency specified by the Divider value.\n\nOutput ports: Mdc, MdcEn, MdcEn_n.\nExplanation:\n- `Mdc`: This is the output management data clock, which is generated based on the Divider input and internal counter state. The Mdc frequency is set to be half or less of the frequency indicated by the Divider value.\n- `MdcEn`: This output signal is active (logic high) when the Mdc signal is low and the counter equals zero (CountEq0 condition); it is typically used to enable external circuits or logic that require synchronization with the Mdc toggle disadvantaged by the Mdc low phase.\n- `MdcEn_n`: This output is the inverse of MdcEn, active (logic high) when Mdc is high and the counter equals zero. It signals the opposite phase of MdcEn, potentially serving complementary control purposes in external interfacing or control logic."

It is crucial for toggling the management data clock (Mdc) and controlling the MdcEn and MdcEn_n outputs.\n- `CounterPreset`: This wire holds the preset value for `Counter`. The value is derived from the adjusted Divider input (`TempDivider`), specifically it is half the value of `TempDivider` subtracted by one. This preset determines how many clock cycles (of `Clk`) the Counter will count down from before reaching zero.\n- `TempDivider`: This wire adjusts the input `Divider` value to ensure that the Mdc frequency is half or less of the frequency specified by the Divider. If the original Divider value is less than 2, it sets TempDivider to 2, maintaining a minimum counting sequence.\n- `Counter`: This is a register that counts down from `CounterPreset` to zero based on the Clk cycles. It is reset to `CounterPreset` whenever it reaches zero or when the Reset signal is active. The count state of this register directly influences the Mdc output and the activation of MdcEn and MdcEn_n outputs."
