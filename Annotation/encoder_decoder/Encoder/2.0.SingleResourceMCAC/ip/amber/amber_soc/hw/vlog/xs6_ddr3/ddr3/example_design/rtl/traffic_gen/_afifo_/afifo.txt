Module-level comment: The 'afifo' module implements an asynchronous FIFO buffer, transferring data across different clock domains. It utilizes dual clock domains for reading ('rd_clk') and writing ('wr_clk'), with internal memory 'mem' and Gray code pointers for synchronization. Key functionalities include handling read/write operations, pointer updates, and buffer state monitoring through status flags 'full', 'empty', and 'almost_full'.
