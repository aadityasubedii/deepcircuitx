Module-level comment: The `iodrp_controller` module interfaces with memory/IO devices, supporting read/write operations controlled by input commands. It employs a finite state machine (FSM) for managing operations like addressing, data handling, and signaling, synchronized by a `DRP_CLK` clock. Internal registers stabilize inputs and maintain operation states, while output signals indicate operational status and data exchanges, facilitating effective device communication and data manipulation.
