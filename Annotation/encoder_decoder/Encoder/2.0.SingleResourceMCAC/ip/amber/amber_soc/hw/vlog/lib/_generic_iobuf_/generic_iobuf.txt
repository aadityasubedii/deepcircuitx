Module-level comment: The 'generic_iobuf' module manages a bidirectional I/O pin 'IO'. It features input ports 'I' (data input) and 'T' (tri-state control). When 'T' is low, 'IO' outputs the value of 'I'. When 'T' is high, 'IO' is in high impedance, allowing external control. The output 'O' mirrors the state of 'IO', enabling external signal monitoring. This setup supports versatile single-pin I/O applications.
