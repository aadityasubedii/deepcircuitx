Module name: xs6_sram_256x128_byte_en. Module specification: The xs6_sram_256x128_byte_en module implements a synchronous static RAM (SRAM) with a customizable data width of 128 bits and supports 256 memory addresses (using an 8-bit address). It offers byte-enable functionality, enabling selective byte-level writing within the data width. Input ports include i_clk for synchronizing operations, i_write_data for the 128-bit data input, i_write_enable as a control signal to enable writing, i_address to pinpoint the memory address for data access, and i_byte_enable to specify which bytes of the i_write_data to actually write based on a 16-bit mask. The single output port, o_read_data, outputs the 128-bit data read from the specified address. Internally, the module uses a signal, byte_write_enable, which is calculated by bitwise AND operation between the write enable signal and the byte enable mask for byte-level write control. The core of the module uses a parametric generate block to instantiate four RAMB8BWER components configured for Simple Dual Port (SDP) operation, providing independent read and write abilities. The configuration of each RAM block supports 36-bit data width, read-first operation mode, and excludes collision checks in simulation for 'X' states. The module also includes an initial block for parameter validation, ensuring DATA_WIDTH is set to 128 and ADDRESS_WIDTH to 8, reporting any mismatches. This design enables efficient and selective data handling in applications such as caching, buffering, or other systems requiring flexible and fast memory access with byte-level manipulation capabilities.
