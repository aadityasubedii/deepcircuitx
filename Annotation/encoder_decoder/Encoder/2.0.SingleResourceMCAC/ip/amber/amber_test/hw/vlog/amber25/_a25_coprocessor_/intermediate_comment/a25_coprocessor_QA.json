It processes inputs such as operation codes, data for writing, and various control signals to manage operations like cache enabling, flushing, and defining cacheable areas. The module also handles writing and reading specific processor controls and registers related to cache and fault management based on the operations specified. Furthermore, it maintains the state of fault status and fault address registers upon detection of faults, ensuring the system can appropriately respond to such events."
