    "module": "This module serves as a testbench top-level for a memory controller, supporting up to six configurable ports. It generates and manages test traffic for each enabled port using traffic generators and memory pattern controllers. The module instantiates port-specific logic based on enabled ports and their modes, handles data generation, comparison, and error reporting. It interfaces with the memory controller through various control signals and data buses, mapping command fields between ports when necessary to ensure proper data flow and test coverage across different port configurations."
