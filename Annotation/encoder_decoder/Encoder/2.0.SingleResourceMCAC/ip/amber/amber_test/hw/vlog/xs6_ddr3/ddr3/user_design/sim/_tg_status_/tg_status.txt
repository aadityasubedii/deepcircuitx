Module-level comment: The `tg_status` module monitors and reports data processing errors by checking discrepancies in data inputs. It utilizes internal signals `data_error_r` for edge detection and `error_set` to maintain errors until cleared. The module captures and outputs detailed error statuses based on comparison and read data discrepancies, reacting to input conditions through synchronized logic blocks that manage status updates, error detection, and reset operations efficiently.
