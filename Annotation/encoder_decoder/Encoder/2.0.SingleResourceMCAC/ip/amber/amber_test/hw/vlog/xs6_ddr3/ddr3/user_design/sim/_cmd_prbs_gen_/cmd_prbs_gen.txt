Module-level comment: The `cmd_prbs_gen` module generates pseudo-random binary sequences using configurable LFSR setups, aiding in memory tests and data pattern generation. It accepts initialization and control inputs to manage sequence generation, adapting to different FPGA families and modes through parameterized settings. PRBS sequence is outputted based on internal logic blocks that handle 32-bit or 64-bit configurations and family-specific address masking.
