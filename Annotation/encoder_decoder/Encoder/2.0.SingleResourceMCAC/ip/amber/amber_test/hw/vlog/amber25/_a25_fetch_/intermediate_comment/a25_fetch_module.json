    "module": "Module-level comment: The a25_fetch module manages instruction fetching in a pipelined microprocessor, interfacing with cache/memory based on instruction cachability and control signals. It handles input/output for instruction addresses, system readiness, and stall conditions, using internal mechanisms to align and select data, manage cache interactions, and coordinate with the wishbone bus for external fetches. This yields efficient instruction pipeline management under varying operational scenarios."
