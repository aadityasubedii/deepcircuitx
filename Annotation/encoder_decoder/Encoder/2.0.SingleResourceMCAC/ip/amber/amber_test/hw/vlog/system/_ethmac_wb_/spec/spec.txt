Module name: ethmac_wb. Module specification: The `ethmac_wb` is a Verilog module designed primarily to interface with Wishbone-compliant systems, adapting between different data widths (32 and 128 bits) for Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) transactions. It accommodates the handling of address, data, control, and status signals across both master and slave interfaces. The module processes input ports such as `i_m_wb_adr`, `i_m_wb_sel`, `i_m_wb_we` (for the master) and `i_s_wb_adr`, `i_s_wb_sel`, `i_s_wb_we` (for the slave), which include address, select, and write enable signals respectively. Corresponding outputs like `o_m_wb_rdat`, `o_m_wb_ack`, and `o_m_wb_err` give feedback such as read data, acknowledgments, and error states. Internal signals `wbm128`, `wbm32`, `wbs128`, `wbs32` are used to manage data adaptations specific to 32-bit or 128-bit operations, ensuring appropriate data formatting and alignment. The code structure includes several generate blocks that conditionally instantiate logic based on data width, enhancing flexibility in handling varied operations between master and slave interfaces. These blocks are crucial for endianess conversion and byte alignment in data transfers, reflecting a sophisticated design aimed at robust and adaptable data interfacing in a heterogeneous system environment.
