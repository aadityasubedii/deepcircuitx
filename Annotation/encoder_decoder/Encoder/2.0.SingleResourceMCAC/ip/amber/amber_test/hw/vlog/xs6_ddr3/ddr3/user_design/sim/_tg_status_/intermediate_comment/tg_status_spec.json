It takes input signals such as data error indicators, comparison data, read data, and command status from memory control buffers. When a data error is detected at a clock edge and it hasn't been previously acknowledged or set, the module captures various statuses including memory addresses, block length, memory buffer statuses, and the actual data values involved in the error. The error status is held until a reset or manual clear operation is performed.
