    "spec": "Module name: ethmac_wb. Module specification: The `ethmac_wb` is a Verilog module designed primarily to interface with Wishbone-compliant systems, adapting between different data widths (32 and 128 bits) for Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) transactions. It accommodates the handling of address, data, control, and status signals across both master and slave interfaces. The module processes input ports such as `i_m_wb_adr`, `i_m_wb_sel`, `i_m_wb_we` (for the master) and `i_s_wb_adr`, `i_s_wb_sel`, `i_s_wb_we` (for the slave), which include address, select, and write enable signals respectively. Corresponding outputs like `o_m_wb_rdat`, `o_m_wb_ack`, and `o_m_wb_err` give feedback such as read data, acknowledgments, and error states. Internal signals `wbm128`, `wbm32`, `wbs128`, `wbs32` are used to manage data adaptations specific to 32-bit or 128-bit operations, ensuring appropriate data formatting and alignment. The code structure includes several generate blocks that conditionally instantiate logic based on data width, enhancing flexibility in handling varied operations between master and slave interfaces. These blocks are crucial for endianess conversion and byte alignment in data transfers, reflecting a sophisticated design aimed at robust and adaptable data interfacing in a heterogeneous system environment.",

This logic includes adapting data, byte selection, and data write formats to match 128-bit operations.\n- `wbm32`: A generate block label for when the data width (WB_DWIDTH) is set to 32 bits for the master interface. It simplifies the connections for 32-bit data by directly assigning endian conversion functions without additional bit slicing.\n- `wbs128`: Similarly to `wbm128`, this is a label for a generate block used for slave interface conditions with a 128-bit data width. This block handles the appropriate selection and formatting of data based on the provided address offset within 128-bit boundaries.\n- `wbs32`: Used for the slave interface when operating with a 32-bit data width, this generate block label handles straightforward assignments between input and output ports without additional data manipulation, assuming a simpler interface due to the smaller data width."

Module specification: The `ethmac_wb` is a Verilog module designed primarily to interface with Wishbone-compliant systems, adapting between different data widths (32 and 128 bits) for Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) transactions. It accommodates the handling of address, data, control, and status signals across both master and slave interfaces. The module processes input ports such as `i_m_wb_adr`, `i_m_wb_sel`, `i_m_wb_we` (for the master) and `i_s_wb_adr`, `i_s_wb_sel`, `i_s_wb_we` (for the slave), which include address, select, and write enable signals respectively. Corresponding outputs like `o_m_wb_rdat`, `o_m_wb_ack`, and `o_m_wb_err` give feedback such as read data, acknowledgments, and error states. Internal signals `wbm128`, `wbm32`, `wbs128`, `wbs32` are used to manage data adaptations specific to 32-bit or 128-bit operations, ensuring appropriate data formatting and alignment. The code structure includes several generate blocks that conditionally instantiate logic based on data width, enhancing flexibility in handling varied operations between master and slave interfaces. These blocks are crucial for endianess conversion and byte alignment in data transfers, reflecting a sophisticated design aimed at robust and adaptable data interfacing in a heterogeneous system environment."
