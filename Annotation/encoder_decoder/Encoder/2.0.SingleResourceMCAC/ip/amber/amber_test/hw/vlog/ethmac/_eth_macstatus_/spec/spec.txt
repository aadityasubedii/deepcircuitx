Module name: eth_macstatus. 

Module specification: The "eth_macstatus" module is crafted to monitor and manage the status of Ethernet MAC during packet reception and transmission. It leverages input signals like 'MRxClk' (receive clock), 'Reset' (module reset), 'MRxDV' (data valid), among others to determine the conditions of ongoing data transactions â€” noting issues such as CRC errors via 'RxCrcError', signaling the end of a packet reception through 'ReceiveEnd', and several state flags delineating reception states, like 'RxStateSFD' for detecting the start frame delimiter. The module outputs various flags such as 'ReceivedPacketGood', 'ReceiveEnd', indicating the quality and state of packets processed. Internally, it uses signals like 'TakeSample' to decide when to capture the status based on data reception conditions and 'SetInvalidSymbol' to detect invalid symbols during reception. The code is organized into sections handling error latching (for CRC and reception errors), packet reception handling (determining packet size and collision presence), and managing transmission features like retry count and collision occurrences. This structured approach ensures the module effectively supports Ethernet standards for reliable data communications.
