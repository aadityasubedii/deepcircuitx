    "module": "Module-level comment: The clocks_resets module generates system clocks and reset signals based on FPGA-specific configurations. It processes differential board clocks and a reset signal, using PLL/MMCM for clock stabilization and synchronization logic to manage reset propagation based on DDR calibration status. Supports both Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6 setups, and addresses different operational scenarios using conditional compilation and behavioral simulation for non-Xilinx environments."
