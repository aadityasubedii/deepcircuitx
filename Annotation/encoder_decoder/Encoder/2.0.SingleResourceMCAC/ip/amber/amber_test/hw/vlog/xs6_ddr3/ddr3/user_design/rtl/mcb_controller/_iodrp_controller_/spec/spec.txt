Module name: iodrp_controller. Module specification: The `iodrp_controller` is a Verilog module designed for managing Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) communication with a memory cell, offering both read and write capabilities. It coordinates operations based on input signals through a defined protocol involving address and data phases controlled by a finite state machine (FSM). The input ports include `memcell_address` (8-bit address of the memory cell), `write_data` (8-bit data for write operations), `rd_not_write` (signal to select read or write), `cmd_valid` (command validity signal), `use_broadcast` (broadcast mode signal), `sync_rst` (synchronous reset), `DRP_CLK` (clock signal), and `DRP_SDO` (input data bit from DRP). The output ports are `read_data` (8-bit data from the memory), `rdy_busy_n` (controller busy status), `DRP_CS` (DRP chip select), `DRP_SDI` (serial data input to memory), `DRP_ADD` (address phase indicator), and `DRP_BKST` (broadcast mode status). Internal signals such as `memcell_addr_reg`, `data_reg`, `shift_through_reg`, `load_shift_n`, `addr_data_sel_n`, `bit_cnt`, `rd_not_write_reg`, `AddressPhase`, `state`, `nextstate`, and `DRP_SDI_pre` facilitate data handling, operation mode setting, and state transitions. Key blocks include: state initialization and transition logic, data shift handling, FSM state assignments, read data capture, and DRP line control, each orchestrated to carefully manage the communication between the controller and the memory cell in various operations under the guidance of `DRP_CLK`.
