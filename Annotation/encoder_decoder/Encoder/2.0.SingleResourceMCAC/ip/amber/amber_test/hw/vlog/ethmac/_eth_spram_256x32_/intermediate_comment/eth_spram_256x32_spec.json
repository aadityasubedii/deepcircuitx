    "spec": "Module name: eth_spram_256x32.\nModule specification: The eth_spram_256x32 module is a synchronous RAM designed for FPGA implementations, specifically targeting Xilinx Spartan-6, Virtex-6, or using a generic model otherwise. This module facilitates both read and write operations across 256 addresses, each capable of holding a 32-bit value. It operates synchronously with the provided clock input (clk) and performs operations based on the state of the reset (rst), chip enable (ce), write enable (we), and output enable (oe). The write enable is a 4-bit input allowing byte-wise control during write operations. The module uses an address input (addr) to select the specific location, and a data input (di) for writing data. The output (do) provides the data read from the specified address. Internally, a 'write_enable' wire signal is derived from the logical combination of 'ce' and an OR reduction of 'we' to ensure writing is enabled appropriately. The code structurally branches into different RAM configurations based on compile-time flags, allowing optimal adaptation for different FPGA targets, each configuration corresponding to a specific FPGA implementation, all utilizing a sub-module instantiation with standardized signal connections for clock, reset, data handling, and control signals. This parameterized approach encapsulates the RAM functionality comprehensively for versatility across different hardware platforms.",

The signals include a clock (clk), reset (rst), chip enable (ce), write enable (we), output enable (oe), address (addr), data input (di), and data output (do).
