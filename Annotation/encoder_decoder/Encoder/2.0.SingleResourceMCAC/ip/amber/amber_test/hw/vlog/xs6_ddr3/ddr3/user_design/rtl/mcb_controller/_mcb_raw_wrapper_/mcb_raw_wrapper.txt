This module implements a Memory Controller Block (MCB) wrapper for interfacing with various DRAM types. It manages memory operations by handling address and data signals, generating commands, and controlling I/O buffers. The module supports multiple port configurations, calibration, and DQS management. It utilizes OSERDES2 and IODRP2_MCB primitives for I/O operations, implements timing parameters, and includes soft calibration logic. The wrapper coordinates between user interface signals and physical memory signals, managing complex timing requirements for different DRAM interfaces.
