It handles aspects such as reading and writing data, handling different states like ready, read, write, command wait, and refresh states, and manages valid signals for data paths based on the status of commands and the readiness of data paths. This module ensures the synchronization and timing of memory operations using various state transitions and condition checks, ensuring data integrity and timely command execution. It operates based on input commands, addresses, burst lengths, and handles full command queues by stalling or enabling commands accordingly."

Resets the module, initializing or resetting internal states depending on the specific bit triggered.\n- `cmd_valid_i`: Command valid input. Indicates that the command on `cmd_i` is valid and should be considered for processing.\n- `cmd_i`: Command input (3-bits). Determines the type of command executed (e.g., read, write, refresh).\n- `addr_i`: Address input (32-bits).
