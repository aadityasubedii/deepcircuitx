Module name: eth_rxaddrcheck. 
Module specification: The 'eth_rxaddrcheck' module is designed for address validation in received Ethernet frames, determining if a frame should continue being processed or aborted based on unicast, multicast, and broadcast criteria. It takes several inputs including the receive clock (MRxClk), a reset signal (Reset), the received data byte (RxData), broadcast and multicast indicators, a MAC address (MAC), byte count positions (ByteCntEq2 to ByteCntEq7), hashed values (HASH0, HASH1), a CRC hash (CrcHash) and its validity (CrcHashGood), control frame correctness (ControlFrmAddressOK), and other control signals. The module produces two primary outputs: RxAbort, which signals to abort frame processing if checks fail; and AddressMiss, which indicates a failure to match the received address against valid addresses. Internally, the module uses several signals: BroadcastOK to confirm broadcast alignment with settings, RxAddressInvalid for checking overall address validity, MulticastOK and UnicastOK to validate multicast and unicast addresses respectively, and several hash-related signals (HashBit, IntHash, ByteHash) for hash computations and comparisons. The code is arranged into blocks handling initialization and reset conditions, address checking logic which involves comparisons at different byte positions, and hash processing for multicast validation. This structured approach allows the module to efficiently manage various address validation scenarios essential for correct Ethernet frame reception and handling.
