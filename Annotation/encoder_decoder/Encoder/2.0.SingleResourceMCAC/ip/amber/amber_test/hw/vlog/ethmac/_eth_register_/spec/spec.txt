Module name: eth_register. 
Module specification: The `eth_register` module is tasked with storing and managing 8-bit data through a variety of control signals. It supports writing data, as well as both synchronous and asynchronous resetting. The input ports include `DataIn`, an 8-bit data input; `Write`, a control signal that enables data writing upon activation; `Clk`, a clock signal for timing data operations; `Reset`, an asynchronous reset that immediately sets the output to `RESET_VALUE` when activated; and `SyncReset`, a synchronous reset that sets the output to `RESET_VALUE` on the next clock edge. The sole output port, `DataOut`, outputs the stored or reset data. Internally, `DataOut` functions as a register holding the module's current data state. The code's primary functional block, the always block, responds to the positive edges of the `Clk` and `Reset` signals to conditionally either reset or update `DataOut` based on the states of the `Reset`, `SyncReset`, and `Write` inputs. This structure ensures appropriate response to input signal changes, thereby maintaining the registerâ€™s data integrity under various control conditions.
