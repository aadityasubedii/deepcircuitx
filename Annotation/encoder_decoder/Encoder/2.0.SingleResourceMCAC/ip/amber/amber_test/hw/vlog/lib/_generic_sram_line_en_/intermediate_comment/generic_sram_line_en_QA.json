It supports basic read and write operations with additional capabilities for handling multiple scan inputs and outputs which are used in test modes (e.g., for scan chains in silicon testing). Upon a reset signal, the SRAM can be initialized with zeros or ones based on the parameter `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO`. During normal operation, data can be written to a specified address if the write enable signal is active. Simultaneously, data from the memory can be read out asynchronously based on the address provided. The module utilizes parameterization for data and address width, allowing flexibility for varying memory configuration needs."

The data is updated on each positive clock edge when write operations are not being performed."

The `mem` array acts as the storage component of the SRAM, where `mem[i_address]` corresponds to memory contents at a particular address. It is used for both reading and writing data based on the address specified by `i_address`.\n- `i`: An integer used as a loop counter in the reset condition when the memory needs to be initialized. It iterates over the addresses from 0 to `2**ADDRESS_WIDTH - 1`, setting each address block to either all zeros or all ones depending on the `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO` parameter.
