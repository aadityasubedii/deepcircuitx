Module name: wr_data_gen.

Module specification: The "wr_data_gen" module is tailored for data generation during memory write operations, specifically designed for FPGA platforms like SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6. It supports configurability in data and address widths, burst lengths, and data generation patterns, enhancing adaptability to various memory configurations. Key inputs include `clk_i` (clock), `rst_i` (reset), `prbs_fseed_i` (seed for pseudo-random data generation), `data_mode_i` (data generation mode), `cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_validB_i`, `cmd_validC_i` (command validation signals), `fixed_data_i` (fixed data when required), `addr_i` (address for memory operations), `bl_i` (burst length), and `data_rdy_i` (downstream data ready signal). Outputs primarily consist of `cmd_rdy_o` (command readiness signal), `last_word_o` (indicates the last word in a data burst), `data_valid_o` (validity of output data), `data_o` (data output), and `data_wr_end_o` (signal for the completion of a data write operation). Internally, the module utilizes multiple registers and signals like `data`, `cmd_rdy`, `cmd_start`, `burst_count_reached2`, and `user_burst_cnt` to manage data storage, command interaction, burst counting, and flow control. It features distinct blocks for handling configurations specified for SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6 through the use of conditional compilation (`generate` blocks), enabling specific functionalities like memory interfacing and data handling to adhere to the requirements of the corresponding FPGA family. The module robustly manages synchronous operations, burst counting, and ensures consistent data delivery in alignment with the provided constraints and external command readiness, making it suitable for intricate memory handling tasks in high-end FPGA applications.
