Module name: a25_barrel_shift. 
Module specification: The 'a25_barrel_shift' module is designed to perform various barrel shifting operations on a 32-bit input data signal ('i_in'), influenced by the type of shift ('i_function') and the shift magnitude ('i_shift_amount'). It operates in either a quick or full mode, which is determined by the shift amount and internal control logic. Input ports include 'clk' (for synchronizing operations), 'reset' (to initialize module states), 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' (for testing purposes), 'i_in' (32-bit input data), 'i_carry_in' (input carry), 'i_shift_amount', 'i_shift_imm_zero' (a control signal), and 'i_function' (shift type). Output ports consist of 'o_out' (output data), 'o_carry_out' (output carry), and 'o_stall' (indicates stall condition). Internal signals are 'quick_out' and 'quick_carry_out' (fast mode outputs), 'full_out' and 'full_carry_out' (full mode outputs), with 'full_out_r' and 'full_carry_out_r' serving as registers to store these values under certain conditions, and 'use_quick_r' (a control signal to select between quick and full modes). The module contains instances of 'a25_shifter' configured differently for quick and full operations. The outputs and operational mode are controlled through sequential logic based on the clock or reset conditions, enabling efficient data handling and processing based on the operational needs and stall status.
