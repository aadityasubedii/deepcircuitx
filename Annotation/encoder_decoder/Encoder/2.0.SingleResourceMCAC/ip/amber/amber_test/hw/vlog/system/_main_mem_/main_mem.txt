Module-level comment: The `main_mem` module serves as a main memory unit interfaced via Wishbone bus protocol, supporting selectable 32-bit or 128-bit data operations through `WB_DWIDTH`. It handles read and write transactions based on bus control signals, using an internal RAM array and specific logic paths for data handling. Operations are managed through internal signals for starting reads/writes, address mapping, and data masking according to bus specifications. The module utilizes generate blocks for conditional logic based on data width, ensuring adaptability and correct sequencing in memory operations.
