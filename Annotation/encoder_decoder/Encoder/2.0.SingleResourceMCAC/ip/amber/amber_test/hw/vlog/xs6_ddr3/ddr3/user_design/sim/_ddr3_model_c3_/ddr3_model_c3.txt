Module-level comment: This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM memory device, implementing key features such as initialization, mode register settings, refresh operations, and power-down modes. It processes input commands, manages internal states, performs data read/write operations, and enforces timing constraints. The module uses pipeline structures for command processing, implements detailed timing checks, and simulates the behavior of various DDR3 SDRAM components, including DQ/DQS handling and ODT functionality.
