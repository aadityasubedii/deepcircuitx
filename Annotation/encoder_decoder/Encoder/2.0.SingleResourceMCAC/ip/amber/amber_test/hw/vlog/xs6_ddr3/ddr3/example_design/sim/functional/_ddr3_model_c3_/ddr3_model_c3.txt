This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM device, modeling its functionality and timing characteristics. It implements command decoding, data read/write operations, and extensive timing checks. The module uses input ports for clock, control signals, address, and data, with output and inout ports for data transfer. Internal signals manage timing parameters, mode registers, bank status, and various counters. The implementation includes tasks for command processing, data handling, and timing verification, ensuring accurate simulation of DDR3 memory behavior including initialization, read/write operations, refresh cycles, and power-down modes.
