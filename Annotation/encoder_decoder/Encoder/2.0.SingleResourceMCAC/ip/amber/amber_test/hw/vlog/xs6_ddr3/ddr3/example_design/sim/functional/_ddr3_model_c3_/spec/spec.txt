Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module is a behavioral model of a DDR3 SDRAM (Double Data Rate 3 Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory) device. It simulates the functionality and timing characteristics of a DDR3 memory, including command decoding, data read/write operations, and various timing checks. The module has input ports for clock (ck, ck_n), control signals (cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address and bank selection (ba, addr), data (dq), and data strobe (dqs, dqs_n) signals. Output ports include tdqs_n, while dm_tdqs, dq, dqs, and dqs_n are inout ports for bidirectional data transfer. Internal signals manage timing parameters, mode register settings, bank status, and various counters
