    "spec": "Module name: eth_shiftreg.\nModule specification: The `eth_shiftreg` module serves as a shift register for Ethernet applications, specifically handling data manipulations based on the MDC/MDIO interface requirements. The module accepts various inputs such as a clock signal (`Clk`), reset (`Reset`), and Medium Dependent Interface Clock Enable (`MdcEn_n`), alongside data (`Mdi`), PHY address (`Fiad`), register address (`Rgad`), control data (`CtrlData`), and operational control signals (`WriteOp`, `ByteSelect`, `LatchByte`). The outputs generated include the shifted bit (`ShiftedBit`), processed data (`Prsd`), and a link failure indicator (`LinkFail`). Internally, the module utilizes a shift register (`ShiftReg`) for transitional data storage and shifting, a processed data register (`Prsd`) for holding the final shift data output, and a link failure signal (`LinkFail`) to denote errors. The operations within the module are structured primarily around the clock edge-based block, which checks for resets, manages data shifting based on byte selection or serial input, and conditionally updates the processed data outputs and error flags based on specific conditions and control signals. This arrangement ensures a structured, conditional operation flow ideal for real-time data processing tasks required in Ethernet-based applications.",

It takes various control signals, data inputs, and operational flags to manage the flow of data for operations such as configuration and status reporting. The register primarily manipulates and shifts data based on byte selections and latching controls, with the ability to respond to operational commands or failure states through the generation of processed data (`Prsd`) and a link failure indication (`LinkFail`). It supports conditional data shifting and storage based on the clock (`Clk`) and reset (`Reset`) signals, adjusting its operations according to the Ethernet Medium Dependent Interface (MDC) enable signal (`MdcEn_n`), and inputs from the Management Data Input (`Mdi`). This is particularly useful in network hardware where real-time data manipulation and error handling are critical."

It plays a central role in data manipulation within the module.\n- **Prsd**: A 16-bit register named \"Processed data\", used to store the results of the data shifts after being processed according to various control signals like LatchByte. It can selectively store the upper or lower 8 bits of data, based on the latching control.\n- **LinkFail**: A single bit signal used to indicate a failure in the link, determined by specific conditions involving register contents (like specific bits of ShiftReg when reading certain register addresses).
