It takes input signals such as data error indicators, comparison data, read data, and command status from memory control buffers. When a data error is detected at a clock edge and it hasn't been previously acknowledged or set, the module captures various statuses including memory addresses, block length, memory buffer statuses, and the actual data values involved in the error. The error status is held until a reset or manual clear operation is performed. The main functionality is to provide an output signal indicating an error and to maintain a detailed error status for further diagnosis."

This is the primary trigger for recording an error status.\n- cmp_data_i: Comparison data input; this data is stored in the error status when an error is detected.\n- rd_data_i: Read data input from a memory buffer, stored in the error status upon an error occurrence.\n- cmp_addr_i: Address of the data where the error was detected; recorded within the error status.\n- cmp_bl_i: Block length of data being compared and/or read, logged in the error status on detecting an error.\n- mcb_cmd_full_i: Memory command buffer full signal, indicating memory controller status, recorded during error detection.\n- mcb_wr_full_i: Memory write buffer full signal, indicating memory controller status, recorded during error detection.\n- mcb_rd_empty_i: Memory read buffer empty signal, indicating memory controller status, captured when an error is recorded.\n\nOutput ports: error_status, error.\nExplanation:\n- error_status: A multi-bit output registering the specific details of the error detected, including data involved, associated addresses, memory buffer status, and other relevant information.\n- error: A binary output that signals whether any error has been set within the current cycle and remains active until reset or manually cleared. This can be used to trigger further error handling or logging mechanisms externally."
