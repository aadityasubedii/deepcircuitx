    "module": "Module-level comment: The a25_coprocessor module manages cache operations and fault handling in compute systems. It uses input signals to control cache enabling, flushing, and cacheable area definitions, and manages fault statuses and addresses upon fault detection. Its implementation includes registers for cache and fault management, and several conditional logic blocks handling operations based on core stall and reset conditions, synchronized on rising clock edges or resets. Debug sections aid in testing by monitoring state changes in the control paths."
