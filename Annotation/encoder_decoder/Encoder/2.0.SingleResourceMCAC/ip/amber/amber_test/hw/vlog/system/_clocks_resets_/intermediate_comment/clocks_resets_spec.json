    "spec": "Module name: clocks_resets.\n\nModule specification: The clocks_resets module is designed to manage the generation of system clocks and reset signals for an FPGA-based system using inputs from board clock signals and a board reset signal. The module has several input and output ports. Input ports include: i_brd_rst (a board reset signal for initiating system-wide reset), i_brd_clk_n and i_brd_clk_p (differential clock inputs to provide the main operation clock), and i_ddr_calib_done (indicating the completion of DDR calibration). The output ports include: o_sys_rst (the system reset signal), o_sys_clk (the main system clock), and o_clk_200 (an additional clock output). Internally, the module utilizes various signals such as calib_done_33mhz (synchronized DDR calibration completion signal), rst0 (primary internal reset signal), pll_locked (status of PLL lock), and pll_clk (clock signal from PLL). The module's code is divided into sections based on FPGA families (Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6) to handle specific configurations and uses constructs like PLL_ADV and MMCM_ADV for generating system clocks. The code includes synchronization logic and conditional assignments to manage the resets and clocks effectively across different operational phases and conditions. It also contains simulation-specific blocks to mock behavior in non-Xilinx environments, handling clock creation and reset logic behaviorally.",

The module reads the input board clock signals (differential inputs i_brd_clk_p and i_brd_clk_n) and a board reset signal (i_brd_rst). It uses configuration specific to different FPGA families (like Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6) to create respective PLL configurations which generate output clocks such as o_clk_200 and the system clock o_sys_clk. It also generates a system reset signal (o_sys_rst) which is conditioned on both the input reset and the calibration completion signal (i_ddr_calib_done). The module contains synchronization logic to manage reset propagation and handling of DDR calibration done signal across clock domains to ensure system stability."

            "content": "Input and output ports and their explanation is as follows: \nInput ports: i_brd_rst, i_brd_clk_n, i_brd_clk_p, i_ddr_calib_done.\nExplanation:\n- i_brd_rst: This is the board reset input. It is used to initiate a system-wide reset, clearing all internal states and starting many processes from an initial state.\n- i_brd_clk_n and i_brd_clk_p: These are differential clock inputs from the board providing the main operation clock for the module. They are typically used to generate stable internal clock signals after being processed through clock buffers and/or PLLs/MCMs.\n- i_ddr_calib_done: This signal indicates whether the DDR calibration process has completed successfully. It is used to conditionally release part of the system from reset.\n\nOutput ports: o_sys_rst, o_sys_clk, o_clk_200.\nExplanation:\n- o_sys_rst: The system reset output, which is generated based on the input reset condition combined with the DDR calibration completion status. This reset ensures that system components start operation only after essential configurations are accomplished.\n- o_sys_clk: The main system clock output derived from the PLL/MCM generated clock. This is used to drive synchronous logic within the system ensuring coherent operation across various system components.\n- o_clk_200: An auxiliary or additional output clock generated for specific operational needs within the system, derived directly from the boarded clock processed through differential signaling."

It is used to determine the release of the system reset signal.\n- rst0: This wire signal serves as the primary system reset indicator internally in the module. It is the output of a register array (rst0_sync_r) and is used to generate the final system reset (o_sys_rst).\n- pll_locked: This wire signal indicates whether the PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) or MMCM (Mixed-Mode Clock Manager) used for clock generation is locked and stable. This signal is essential for determining the validity of the clock outputs and is used in reset synchronization.\n- clkfbout_clkfbin: This wire forms a feedback loop in the PLL/MMCM, necessary for maintaining the stability and the desired frequency of the generated clocks.\n- rst0_sync_r: This register array is used for synchronizing the reset signal to the system clock domain, thereby delaying the assertion of system reset to ensure stable reset behavior across the system.\n- ddr_calib_done_sync_r: Similar to rst0_sync_r, this register array synchronizes the DDR calibration done signal to the system clock domain, ensuring that signals from different clock domains are properly aligned.\n- rst_tmp: This wire acts as an intermediary reset condition that combines the board reset input (i_brd_rst) and the PLL/MMCM lock status (pll_locked). It is used in creating a reset synchronization logic.\n- pll_clk: This wire carries the clock signal generated by the PLL or MMCM, tailored for the system's operational requirements. It is used as the source for the system clock (o_sys_clk).\n- brd_clk_ibufg: This wire is the output of a differential clock buffer (IBUFGDS) which processes the incoming differential clock signals (i_brd_clk_n, i_brd_clk_p) to create a single-ended clock used for further clock management and PLL/MMCM input."

The module has several input and output ports. Input ports include: i_brd_rst (a board reset signal for initiating system-wide reset), i_brd_clk_n and i_brd_clk_p (differential clock inputs to provide the main operation clock), and i_ddr_calib_done (indicating the completion of DDR calibration). The output ports include: o_sys_rst (the system reset signal), o_sys_clk (the main system clock), and o_clk_200 (an additional clock output). Internally, the module utilizes various signals such as calib_done_33mhz (synchronized DDR calibration completion signal), rst0 (primary internal reset signal), pll_locked (status of PLL lock), and pll_clk (clock signal from PLL). The module's code is divided into sections based on FPGA families (Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6) to handle specific configurations and uses constructs like PLL_ADV and MMCM_ADV for generating system clocks. The code includes synchronization logic and conditional assignments to manage the resets and clocks effectively across different operational phases and conditions. It also contains simulation-specific blocks to mock behavior in non-Xilinx environments, handling clock creation and reset logic behaviorally."

The module reads the input board clock signals (differential inputs i_brd_clk_p and i_brd_clk_n) and a board reset signal (i_brd_rst). It uses configuration specific to different FPGA families (like Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6) to create respective PLL configurations which generate output clocks such as o_clk_200 and the system clock o_sys_clk. It also generates a system reset signal (o_sys_rst) which is conditioned on both the input reset and the calibration completion signal (i_ddr_calib_done). The module contains synchronization logic to manage reset propagation and handling of DDR calibration done signal across clock domains to ensure system stability."

It is used to initiate a system-wide reset, clearing all internal states and starting many processes from an initial state.\n- i_brd_clk_n and i_brd_clk_p: These are differential clock inputs from the board providing the main operation clock for the module. They are typically used to generate stable internal clock signals after being processed through clock buffers and/or PLLs/MCMs.\n- i_ddr_calib_done: This signal indicates whether the DDR calibration process has completed successfully. It is used to conditionally release part of the system from reset.\n\nOutput ports: o_sys_rst, o_sys_clk, o_clk_200.\nExplanation:\n- o_sys_rst: The system reset output, which is generated based on the input reset condition combined with the DDR calibration completion status. This reset ensures that system components start operation only after essential configurations are accomplished.\n- o_sys_clk: The main system clock output derived from the PLL/MCM generated clock. This is used to drive synchronous logic within the system ensuring coherent operation across various system components.\n- o_clk_200: An auxiliary or additional output clock generated for specific operational needs within the system, derived directly from the boarded clock processed through differential signaling."

It is used to determine the release of the system reset signal.\n- rst0: This wire signal serves as the primary system reset indicator internally in the module. It is the output of a register array (rst0_sync_r) and is used to generate the final system reset (o_sys_rst).\n- pll_locked: This wire signal indicates whether the PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) or MMCM (Mixed-Mode Clock Manager) used for clock generation is locked and stable. This signal is essential for determining the validity of the clock outputs and is used in reset synchronization.\n- clkfbout_clkfbin: This wire forms a feedback loop in the PLL/MMCM, necessary for maintaining the stability and the desired frequency of the generated clocks.\n- rst0_sync_r: This register array is used for synchronizing the reset signal to the system clock domain, thereby delaying the assertion of system reset to ensure stable reset behavior across the system.\n- ddr_calib_done_sync_r: Similar to rst0_sync_r, this register array synchronizes the DDR calibration done signal to the system clock domain, ensuring that signals from different clock domains are properly aligned.\n- rst_tmp: This wire acts as an intermediary reset condition that combines the board reset input (i_brd_rst) and the PLL/MMCM lock status (pll_locked). It is used in creating a reset synchronization logic.\n- pll_clk: This wire carries the clock signal generated by the PLL or MMCM, tailored for the system's operational requirements. It is used as the source for the system clock (o_sys_clk).\n- brd_clk_ibufg: This wire is the output of a differential clock buffer (IBUFGDS) which processes the incoming differential clock signals (i_brd_clk_n, i_brd_clk_p) to create a single-ended clock used for further clock management and PLL/MMCM input."

The module has several input and output ports. Input ports include: i_brd_rst (a board reset signal for initiating system-wide reset), i_brd_clk_n and i_brd_clk_p (differential clock inputs to provide the main operation clock), and i_ddr_calib_done (indicating the completion of DDR calibration). The output ports include: o_sys_rst (the system reset signal), o_sys_clk (the main system clock), and o_clk_200 (an additional clock output). Internally, the module utilizes various signals such as calib_done_33mhz (synchronized DDR calibration completion signal), rst0 (primary internal reset signal), pll_locked (status of PLL lock), and pll_clk (clock signal from PLL). The module's code is divided into sections based on FPGA families (Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6) to handle specific configurations and uses constructs like PLL_ADV and MMCM_ADV for generating system clocks. The code includes synchronization logic and conditional assignments to manage the resets and clocks effectively across different operational phases and conditions. It also contains simulation-specific blocks to mock behavior in non-Xilinx environments, handling clock creation and reset logic behaviorally."
