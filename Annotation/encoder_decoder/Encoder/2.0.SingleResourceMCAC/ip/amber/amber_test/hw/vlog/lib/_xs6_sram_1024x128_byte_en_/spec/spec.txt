Module name: xs6_sram_1024x128_byte_en. Module specification: This module implements a 1024x128-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA block RAM resources. It consists of 8 RAMB16BWER primitives, each handling 32 bits of the 128-bit data width. The module has input ports for clock (i_clk), write data (i_write_data), write enable (i_write_enable), address (i_address), and byte enable (i_byte_enable), and an output port for read data (o_read_data). Internal signals include write enable signals for the lower and upper halves of the memory (wea_b0, wea_b1), read data signals for both halves (read_data_b0, read_data_b
