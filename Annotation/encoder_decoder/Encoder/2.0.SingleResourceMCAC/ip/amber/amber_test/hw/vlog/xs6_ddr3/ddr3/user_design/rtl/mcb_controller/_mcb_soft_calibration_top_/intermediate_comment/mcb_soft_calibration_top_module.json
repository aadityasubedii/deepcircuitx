    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"mcb_soft_calibration_top\" module manages the calibration processes for FPGA memory controllers, compatible with different DDR types. It integrates key input signals for synchronization and control, outputting calibration and operation status. Internally, it uses DRP for dynamic parameter configuration and IOBUFs for bidirectional pin management. Calibration is executed through instantiated sub-modules and conditional logic, ensuring adaptability and precision in memory interface calibration."
