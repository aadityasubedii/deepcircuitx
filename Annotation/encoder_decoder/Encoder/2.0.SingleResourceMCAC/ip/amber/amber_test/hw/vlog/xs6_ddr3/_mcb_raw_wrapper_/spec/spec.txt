Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: This module is a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) interface, providing a configurable interface to various types of DDR memory (DDR, DDR2, DDR3, MDDR). It handles low-level signaling and timing requirements for communicating with memory, including address, data, and control signals. The module supports multiple data widths (4, 8, or 16 bits) and includes features like calibration, initialization, and various memory-specific settings. Input ports include clock signals, control signals, command interfaces, and data write/read interfaces for multiple ports (p0 to p5). Output ports include status signals for command and data interfaces, memory interface signals, and user output signals for calibration and status information. Internal signals manage clock and reset operations, calibration and training, DRP (Dynamic Reconfiguration Port) functions, data and str
