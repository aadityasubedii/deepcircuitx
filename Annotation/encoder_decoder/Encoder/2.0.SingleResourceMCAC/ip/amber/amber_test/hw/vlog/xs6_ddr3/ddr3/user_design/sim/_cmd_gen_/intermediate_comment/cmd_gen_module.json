    "module": "This module generates memory commands (read, write, refresh) for a memory interface, supporting various addressing modes and burst lengths. It implements address generation using sequential, PRBS, fixed, or BRAM methods, creates instructions based on different modes, calculates burst lengths, and manages command timing. The module handles buffer availability, refresh requirements, and supports different FPGA families (Spartan-6 and Virtex-6). It uses internal counters, PRBS generators, and control flags to manage command flow and timing, outputting address, instruction, and burst length signals for memory operations."
