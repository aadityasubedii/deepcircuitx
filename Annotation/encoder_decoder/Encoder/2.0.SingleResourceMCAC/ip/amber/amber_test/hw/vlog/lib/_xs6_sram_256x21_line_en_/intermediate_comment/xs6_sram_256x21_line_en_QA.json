It supports a 21-bit data interface over an 8-bit address space. The module takes an input clock signal (i_clk), input data (i_write_data), a write enable signal (i_write_enable), and an address (i_address). It outputs data (o_read_data) read from the desired address. This memory interface allows data writing and reading operations based on the write enable signal, organizing data into high and low parts for storage and retrieval, while ensuring that warning messages are displayed if data width or address width parameters are incorrectly set."

Explanation: \n- i_clk: This is the clock input used to synchronize all operations in the module, including data writing and reading.\n- i_write_data: This 21-bit input carries the data to be written into the memory.\n- i_write_enable: This signal determines the operation mode; when high, it enables the writing of data to the memory, and when low, it enables reading from the memory.\n- i_address: This 8-bit input specifies the address in the memory where data needs to be written or read.\n\nOutput ports: [o_read_data]. Explanation: \n- o_read_data: This 21-bit output port provides the data read from the memory location specified by the address input.
