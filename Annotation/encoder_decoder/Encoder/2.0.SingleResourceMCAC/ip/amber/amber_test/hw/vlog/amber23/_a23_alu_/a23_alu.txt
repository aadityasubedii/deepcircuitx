Module-level comment: The a23_alu module serves as an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) tailored for Xilinx FPGA platforms. It computes 32-bit results from two operands based on a function selector which determines the operation (arithmetic or logical) and command behaviors (operand swapping, negation, etc.). Implementations involve conditionally compiled specific adder units for optimized FPGA operations. It outputs calculated results and flags indicating operation characteristics such as sign and overflow.
