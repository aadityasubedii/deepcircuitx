Module-level comment: 
/* This module generates test data patterns for memory interface testing.
   It supports various patterns including PRBS, address-based, walking 1's/0's,
   neighbor, and fixed patterns. The module uses configurable parameters for
   data width and burst length, and implements different generation algorithms
   for each pattern type. It selects and outputs the appropriate data pattern
   based on input control signals and configuration parameters. */
