Module name: eth_rxethmac. 

Module specification: The "eth_rxethmac" module is responsible for the reception and processing of Ethernet frames. It operates under the clock signal MRxClk, and utilizes a range of input signals such as MRxDV for data validity, MRxD for incoming data, and Reset for initialization. It also handles transmission state indication through Transmitting, frame size limits with MaxFL, and address filtering inputs like MAC, r_Bro, and r_Pro. The module outputs processed data through the RxData port, with validation and framing indicators RxValid, RxStartFrm, and RxEndFrm. The ByteCnt outputs and related flags indicate byte count and frame size conditions. CrcError signals any issues detected by CRC checks, which handle data integrity.

Internally, the module uses signals like MRxDEqD and MRxDEq5 to identify frame start conditions (Preamble and Start Frame Delimiter), and various ByteCntEqx (where x ranges from 1 to 7) and ByteCntSmall7 signals for specific byte counting logic in frame processing. State indicators like StateIdle and StateData aid in controlling the state machine transitions.

The module is structured around major functional blocks which include CRC calculations, state management with `eth_rxstatem`, byte counting and management through `eth_rxcounters`, and address checking with `eth_rxaddrcheck`. Each block contributes to handling specific aspects of frame reception such as initiation, data validation, frame alignment, address filtering, and error handling, ensuring adherence to Ethernet protocol standards and effective data communication.
