    "spec": "**Module name:** wishbone_arbiter\n\n**Module specification:** The 'wishbone_arbiter' module is designed to control and manage access to a Wishbone bus interface among multiple master devices. The module ensures that only one master can access the bus at a time to prevent bus contention. It manages bus transactions by dynamically selecting which master device should control the bus based on ongoing transactions and request statuses. The module operates with two master devices and eight slave devices, exchanging data, address, and control signals through input and output ports. Key input ports include clock (`i_wb_clk`), addresses (`i_m0_wb_adr`, `i_m1_wb_adr`), data inputs (`i_m0_wb_dat`, `i_m1_wb_dat`), and control signals like write enable and strobe signals. Corresponding output ports provide data, acknowledge, and error signals to master devices along with address and control signals to slave devices. Internally, the module uses several signals such as `current_master`, `next_master`, and hold registers (`m0_wb_hold_r`, `m1_wb_hold_r`) to manage which master controls the bus, along with `master_adr`, `master_sel`, and other routing signals that direct the transaction parameters from the active master to the selected slave. The Verilog code is organized into sections handling the initialization of parameters, assignments of current and next masters based on the bus cycle status, various signal assignments for slave selection, data handling, and error management. This structured approach ensures synchronized and error-free data management amongst multiple masters and slaves within a hardware system.",

The arbiter dynamically selects which master has control of the bus based on a set of rules defined in the code, ensuring that no two masters access the bus simultaneously, thus avoiding bus contention. It handles the transactions by assigning the bus signals to the appropriate master and routing data, address, and control signals between masters and the designated slave devices. The module supports input-handling from two masters and output management to eight slave devices, with operations structured around clock edges to ensure timing and synchronization."

            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \n**Internal Signals:**\n- `m0_wb_hold_r`, `m1_wb_hold_r`: These are internal registers holding the state of transaction strobe signals for Master 0 and Master 1.\n- `current_master`: This wire signal determines which master is currently controlling the bus.\n- `current_master_r`: This register holds the state of the `current_master` across clock cycles.\n- `next_master`: Wire signal that suggests which master should be the next controlling master.\n- `select_master`: Signal used to decide if current master should switch based on the state of hold registers.\n- `current_slave`: A 4-bit signal determining which slave is currently being accessed based on the address.\n- `master_adr`, `master_sel`, `master_we`, `master_wdat`: These signals route the address, select, write enable, and data signals respectively from the active master to the slave.\n- `master_cyc`, `master_stb`: These carry the transaction presence and validation signals respectively from the active master.\n- `master_rdat`, `master_ack`, `master_err`: These signals route the data, acknowledge, and error signals from the active slave back to the master.\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `m0_wb_hold_r`, `m1_wb_hold_r`: They keep track of whether a master needs to hold control of the bus due to unacknowledged transactions, aiding in sequencing control.\n- `current_master`: Essential for arbitrating which master is currently allowed to access the bus resources by outputting the active master ID.\n- `current_master_r`: Maintains the master control consistency from one clock cycle to the next to ensure transaction integrity.\n- `next_master`: Decides logically which master should be prioritized for the next bus cycle in scenarios when multiple masters request bus access.\n- `select_master`: Based on the status of transactions (acknowledged or not), it helps in deciding if the master should be switched.\n- `current_slave`: Determines which slave to route the transaction to based on input address from the master.\n- `master_adr`, `master_sel`, `master_we`, `master_wdat`: These are crucial for directing the transaction parameters from the decided active master to the selected slave device.\n- `master_cyc`, `master_stb`: Indicate the presence and validity of a transaction cycle from the master, ensuring synchronized operations.\n- `master_rdat`, `master_ack`, `master_err`: Deliver the data and status back from the slave devices to the master, completing the transaction loop.\n\nThese internal signals are fundamental to managing and directing bus access and transactions dynamically between multiple masters and slaves in a synchronous, controlled manner."

The module ensures that only one master can access the bus at a time to prevent bus contention. It manages bus transactions by dynamically selecting which master device should control the bus based on ongoing transactions and request statuses. The module operates with two master devices and eight slave devices, exchanging data, address, and control signals through input and output ports. Key input ports include clock (`i_wb_clk`), addresses (`i_m0_wb_adr`, `i_m1_wb_adr`), data inputs (`i_m0_wb_dat`, `i_m1_wb_dat`), and control signals like write enable and strobe signals. Corresponding output ports provide data, acknowledge, and error signals to master devices along with address and control signals to slave devices. Internally, the module uses several signals such as `current_master`, `next_master`, and hold registers (`m0_wb_hold_r`, `m1_wb_hold_r`) to manage which master controls the bus, along with `master_adr`, `master_sel`, and other routing signals that direct the transaction parameters from the active master to the selected slave. The Verilog code is organized into sections handling the initialization of parameters, assignments of current and next masters based on the bus cycle status, various signal assignments for slave selection, data handling, and error management. This structured approach ensures synchronized and error-free data management amongst multiple masters and slaves within a hardware system."

The arbiter dynamically selects which master has control of the bus based on a set of rules defined in the code, ensuring that no two masters access the bus simultaneously, thus avoiding bus contention. It handles the transactions by assigning the bus signals to the appropriate master and routing data, address, and control signals between masters and the designated slave devices. The module supports input-handling from two masters and output management to eight slave devices, with operations structured around clock edges to ensure timing and synchronization."

                    "text": "**Module name:** wishbone_arbiter\n\n**Module specification:** The 'wishbone_arbiter' module is designed to control and manage access to a Wishbone bus interface among multiple master devices. The module ensures that only one master can access the bus at a time to prevent bus contention. It manages bus transactions by dynamically selecting which master device should control the bus based on ongoing transactions and request statuses. The module operates with two master devices and eight slave devices, exchanging data, address, and control signals through input and output ports. Key input ports include clock (`i_wb_clk`), addresses (`i_m0_wb_adr`, `i_m1_wb_adr`), data inputs (`i_m0_wb_dat`, `i_m1_wb_dat`), and control signals like write enable and strobe signals. Corresponding output ports provide data, acknowledge, and error signals to master devices along with address and control signals to slave devices. Internally, the module uses several signals such as `current_master`, `next_master`, and hold registers (`m0_wb_hold_r`, `m1_wb_hold_r`) to manage which master controls the bus, along with `master_adr`, `master_sel`, and other routing signals that direct the transaction parameters from the active master to the selected slave. The Verilog code is organized into sections handling the initialization of parameters, assignments of current and next masters based on the bus cycle status, various signal assignments for slave selection, data handling, and error management. This structured approach ensures synchronized and error-free data management amongst multiple masters and slaves within a hardware system."
