Module-level comment: The "infrastructure" module manages clocking and reset functionalities for FPGA systems, adapting to differential or single-ended clock inputs. Utilizing a PLL, it generates multiple output clocks and ensures system stability through synchronized and asynchronous resets. Incorporating buffers and specialized logic, it handles clock multiplication, phase adjustments, and reset synchronization efficiently, supporting stable system operations post-initialization or reset conditions.
