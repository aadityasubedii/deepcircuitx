Module name: eth_txstatem. 
Module specification: The 'eth_txstatem' module acts as a state machine controller for an Ethernet transmission system, managing various state transitions essential for packet transmission. This includes handling idle times, inter-packet gaps (IPG), preamble, data transmission, padding (PAD), frame check sequence (FCS), collision jam, and backoff timing. The module takes multiple input signals such as `MTxClk` (clock input for synchronization), `Reset` (system reset), network and transmission status flags like `ExcessiveDefer`, `CarrierSense`, `TxStartFrm`, and others to determine state transitions based on current network conditions and frame statuses. Output signals include state indicators like `StateIdle`, `StateData`, and control signals such as `StartFCS`, `StartJam`, signaling transitions into different states. Internal signals like `StartIdle` and `StartPAD` control transitions into 'Idle' and 'PAD' states, respectively, enhancing robustness in timing management across different transmission scenarios. The logic in the module is organized into blocks where state transitions are managed based on inputs and internal conditions; an 'always' block manages state updates on clock edges and resets, while another block updates internal rules like `Rule1` which impacts timing decisions related to duplex operations. This structured approach ensures that packet transmissions adhere to Ethernet standards and respond effectively to network dynamics.
