It interfaces with the Wishbone bus to handle memory-mapped I/O operations and supports configurable data widths. Interrupt sources like UARTs, Ethernet MAC, and timers can trigger either normal interrupts (IRQ) or fast interrupts (FIRQ). The module manages these inputs and allows for software setting and clearing interrupts through memory-mapped registers. The interrupts can be individually enabled or disabled. The output interrupt signals are generated based on the aggregation of these configurations and current interrupt status, potentially triggering further system responses."

It is essential for the operation of synchronous logic inside the module, including registers and sequential logic.\n- `i_wb_adr`: This input port is the Wishbone address bus. It is used to specify the addresses for reading or writing data through the Wishbone interface.\n- `i_wb_sel`: This input port indicates which byte lanes to operate on during Wishbone data transfers, allowing sub-word access if the bus supports it.\n- `i_wb_we`: This input port is the Wishbone write enable signal, indicating whether the current Wishbone cycle is a write operation.\n- `i_wb_dat`: This input port carries data from the master to the slave on write operations on the Wishbone bus.\n- `i_wb_cyc`: This input indicates the start and duration of a Wishbone bus cycle, signaling that a transaction is taking place.\n- `i_wb_stb`: This input is the Wishbone strobe signal. It indicates an active transfer and should be asserted along with `i_wb_cyc`.\n- `i_uart0_int`, `i_uart1_int`: These inputs represent interrupt signals from UART modules. They indicate that an interrupt request has occurred from either UART0 or UART1.\n- `i_ethmac_int`: This is the interrupt input from an Ethernet MAC, signaling an interrupt request from the Ethernet interface.\n- `i_test_reg_irq`, `i_test_reg_firq`: These inputs are used for testing interrupt and fast interrupt registers within the module.\n- `i_tm_timer_int[2:0]`: These inputs are timer interrupt signals, potentially from different timer modules, indicating that timer-related interrupts have been triggered.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `o_wb_dat`: This output port carries data from the slave to the master during read operations on the Wishbone bus.\n- `o_wb_ack`: This output is the Wishbone acknowledge signal. It indicates that the transaction has been successfully completed.\n- `o_wb_err`: This output is the Wishbone error signal. It indicates some form of error in the transaction, typically used for exception handling in the system.\n- `o_irq`, `o_firq`: These are the output interrupt request signals. `o_irq` represents the regular interrupt request, while `o_firq` stands for the fast interrupt request. They are aggregated signals derived from various sources and conditions set within the module, used to notify the central processor or another controller of critical events requiring attention.\n\nThese inputs and outputs enable the `interrupt_controller` module to interface effectively with system components for managing and controlling interrupt signals based on system needs and configurations."
