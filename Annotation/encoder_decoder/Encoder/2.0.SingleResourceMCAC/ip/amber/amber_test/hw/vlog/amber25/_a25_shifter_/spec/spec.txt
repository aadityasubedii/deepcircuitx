Module name: a25_shifter. Module specification: The `a25_shifter` is a Verilog module designed to perform various bit shifting operations on a 32-bit input based on the shift type specified. It supports logical shift left (LSL), logical shift right (LSR), arithmetic shift right (ASR), and rotate right (ROR) operations. Input ports include `i_in` (32-bit input data), `i_carry_in` (carry input for certain shift operations), `i_shift_amount` (8-bit value that specifies the shift distance), `i_shift_imm_zero` (control signal affecting the shift operation), and `i_function` (2-bit input determining the shift type). Output ports are `o_out` (32-bit result of the shift operation) and `o_carry_out` (carry out resulting from the shift). Internal signals such as `lsl_out`, `lsr_out`, `asr_out`, and `ror_out` store the intermediate results of the respective shift mechanisms. The module includes multiple `generate` blocks to handle different shift operations, each adapting to settings like the shift amount or the choice of quick or full-barrel mechanisms controlled by the `FULL_BARREL` parameter. These blocks dynamically adjust the output based on the selected operation mode and specific conditions such as whether immediate zero is set. The final output is decided by multiplexing the outputs of the internal signals based on the current operation type indicated by `i_function`.
