Module name: xs6_sram_4096x32_byte_en. Module specification: This module implements a 4096x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA block RAM resources. It consists of 8 RAMB16BWER primitives, organized into two banks (b0 and b1) to accommodate the full 4096-word depth. The module has input ports for clock (i_clk), write data (i_write_data), write enable (i_write_enable), address (i_address), and byte enable (i_byte_enable), and an output port for read data (o_read_data). Internal signals include write enable signals for each bank (wea_b0, wea_b1), data output arrays for each primitive (data_out_b0, data_out_b
