Module-level comment: The `xs6_addsub_n` module performs addition or subtraction on two WIDTH-bit operands using FPGA's DSP48A1 slice. It selects operation mode via `i_sub` and `i_cin`, and uses human-understandable signals for DSP configuration (`opmode`, `in_a`, `in_b`). Outputs include the operation result (`o_sum`) and carry-out (`o_co`). Achieves efficient FPGA arithmetic handling by tailored operand extension and DSP slice management.
