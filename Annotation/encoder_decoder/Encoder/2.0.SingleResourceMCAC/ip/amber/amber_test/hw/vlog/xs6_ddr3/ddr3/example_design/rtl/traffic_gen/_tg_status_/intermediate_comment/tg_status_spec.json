This module operates with the following ports: 'clk_i' (clock input for triggering operations), 'rst_i' (reset input for initializing internal states), 'manual_clear_error' (external input to reset error status), 'data_error_i' (flag for data errors), 'cmp_data_i' and 'rd_data_i' (expected and read data respectively for comparison), 'cmp_addr_i' (address of current data), 'cmp_bl_i' (block length of current data), 'mcb_cmd_full_i', 'mcb_wr_full_i', and 'mcb_rd_empty_i' (status flags from the memory controller's buffers).

It monitors data mismatches or errors during data comparison and captures relevant error states when a new error is detected. When either manually cleared or reset, it resets error flags and statuses. The module captures the error condition based on data error flag transitions from low to high without being reset and stores information such as the address, block length, data read and expected, alongside command, write, and read full/empty flags related to the memory interface, thus helping in debugging and analyzing the failure or inconsistencies in data handling in the system."

This signal is used to detect a rising edge on the `data_error_i` input, which indicates a new error has occurred.\n- `error_set`: This signal is used to indicate whether an error has been detected and captured. Once set, it remains asserted until manually cleared or reset. This flag is used to control the transmission and maintenance of the error status, ensuring that once an error is detected and registered, it doesn't get overwritten by subsequent operations until appropriately managed.
