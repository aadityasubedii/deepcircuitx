Module name: afifo. Module specification: The afifo module is a Verilog implementation of an asynchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer designed to provide stable data communication between two clock domains operating at different frequencies. The module facilitates data transfers using dual-port RAM, supported by input signals 'wr_clk' and 'rd_clk', which are write and read clock inputs respectively. Data is written to the FIFO when the input signal 'i_push' is active and the FIFO is not full, signaled by the 'o_full' output. Conversely, data is read when the 'i_pop' input is active and the FIFO is not empty, as indicated by the 'o_empty' output. Data width is defined by the parameter `D_WIDTH`. Internal signals include binary counters `wr_pointer` and `rd_pointer` for tracking write and read positions, and registers `wr_pointer_d1`, `rd_pointer_d1`, `wr_pointer_d2`, `rd_pointer_d2` for gray code conversion and synchronization stability. The FIFO operations involve gray code and binary conversions managed by function blocks `gray8` and `ungray8` to maintain data integrity across different clock domains. Data is stored in an array `data`, and the module checks and signals if the FIFO is full or empty based on the pointer comparisons. This module efficiently manages asynchronous data transfer with dual-clock domain support ensuring pointer synchronization and data coherency.
