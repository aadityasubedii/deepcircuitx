Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: The mcb_ui_top module is a top-level interface for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) supporting multiple ports and AXI interfaces. It integrates various components including a raw MCB wrapper, AXI interfaces, and port configurations. The module handles memory operations, arbitration between multiple ports, and provides interfaces for both native MCB and AXI protocols. It supports up to 6 ports, which can be configured as either native MCB interfaces or AXI interfaces. The module includes numerous input and output ports for clock management, port-specific control and data signals, memory interface signals, and AXI interface signals. Internal signals are used to connect the mcb_raw_wrapper instance with either the native MCB interface or the AXI interface, depending on the configuration. The module consists of several main blocks: a BUFPLL_MCB component for clock
