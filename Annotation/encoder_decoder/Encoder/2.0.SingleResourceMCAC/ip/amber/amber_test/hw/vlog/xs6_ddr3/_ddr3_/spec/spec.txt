Module name: ddr3. Module specification: The ddr3 module is a DDR3 memory controller interface designed to interface with DDR3 SDRAM, providing a 128-bit bi-directional port for data transfer. It includes configurable parameters for clock periods, memory specifications, and port configurations. The module has input ports for DDR3 data lines (mcb3_dram_dq), system clock (c3_sys_clk), reset (c3_sys_rst_i), and multiple ports (p0 to p5) for command, write, and read operations. Output ports include DDR3 control signals, address lines, status signals for calibration and clocking, and status/data signals for memory operations. Internal signals are used for clock management, reset control, and PLL operations. The module consists of two main blocks: an infrastructure module for clock and reset management, and a memory
