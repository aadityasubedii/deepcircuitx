Module-level comment: The `eth_random` module generates pseudorandom numbers for Ethernet collision handling using a 10-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). It operates based on input conditions including the transmission clock, retry count, and data size metrics. The module shifts the register `x` on each clock edge, generates conditional random numbers influenced by `RetryCnt`, latches these during specific protocol states, and provides outputs indicating match conditions with zero or masked byte counts for transmission control.
