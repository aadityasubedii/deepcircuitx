Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: This module serves as a wrapper for a memory controller (MCB) interface, providing a configurable interface to interact with external memory, likely DDR3 SDRAM. It supports multiple ports (up to 6) for memory access, each with command, write, and read interfaces, and includes AXI interfaces for compatibility with AXI-based systems. The module handles various input signals including clocks, reset, PLL control, and memory command/data signals for up to 6 ports. Output signals include memory interface signals, calibration status, and status/data signals for each port. Internal signals manage memory controller calibration settings, AXI interface operations, and clock/PLL-related functions. The code is structured into sections for parameter definitions, port declarations, internal signal declarations, and the instantiation of the core memory controller logic (mcb_ui_top). This wrapper provides a
