Module name: infrastructure. Module specification: The 'infrastructure' module is a vital component in a digital system that primarily focuses on clock and reset management utilizing a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL). This module can accept either differential (via 'sys_clk_p' and 'sys_clk_n') or single-ended ('sys_clk') clock inputs depending on the configuration set by 'C_INPUT_CLK_TYPE'. It outputs various clock signals ('clk0', 'sysclk_2x', and 'sysclk_2x_180') and reset signals ('rst0' and 'async_rst') to ensure synchronous operation throughout the system. Crucial internal signals include 'clk0_bufg', 'clk_2x_0', and 'locked', which handle tasks such as buffering and indicating the stability of the PLL respectively. The module is structured around several key blocks: clock buffers (e.g., 'BUFG' and 'BUFPLL_MCB'), the PLL setup ('PLL_ADV'), and reset synchronization logic that safely manages reset conditions across asynchronously and synchronously reset domains. It leverages conditions like 'sys_rst', combined with 'locked' feedback, to control the timing of output strobes ('pll_ce_0' and 'pll_ce_90') and clocks required for Memory Controller Block operations. The module architecture is designed to provide stability and flexibility in handling different clocking and resetting scenarios for robust digital system functionality.
