    "module": "Module-level comment: The `eth_txethmac` module serves as the transmission part of an Ethernet MAC, managing data frame transitions by following Ethernet protocols. It leverages input controls such as the transmit clock and frame status signals to dictate data handling, from initiating transmissions to managing errors and collisions. Outputs reflect the transmission status and control flow. Internally, it utilizes state machines, counters, CRC operations, and random backoff calculations to efficiently sequence operations and ensure data integrity, accommodating both standard and exceptional network conditions."
