Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: This module serves as a wrapper for a memory controller interface, providing an interface between multiple AXI and custom port interfaces to a memory controller block, likely for DDR memory. It handles various memory timings, arbitration between ports, and configuration parameters for different memory types (DDR3, DDR2, etc.). The module has numerous input and output ports, including clock signals (e.g., sysclk_2x, pll_ce_0), reset signals, and multiple sets of command, write, and read interfaces for up to 6 ports (p0-p5). It also includes memory interface signals such as address, control, and data lines. Internal signals include configuration parameters (e.g., C_MC_CALIBRATION_CLK_DIV, C_MEM_TZQINIT_MAXCNT) and status signals (e.g.,
