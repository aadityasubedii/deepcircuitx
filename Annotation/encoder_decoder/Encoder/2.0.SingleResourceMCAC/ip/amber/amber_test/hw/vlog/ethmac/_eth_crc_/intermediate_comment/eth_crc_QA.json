The CRC is computed based on input data with each positive edge of the clock or when reset. The module features parameters and signals to initialize the CRC value, provide the current CRC value, and indicate any CRC errors. The CRC calculation applies to both incoming data and the current CRC value, updating according to specific polynomial equations defined in the module. A CRC error signal indicates whether there is a mismatch between the calculated CRC and the expected known value. This functionality helps ensure data integrity over Ethernet communications."

Each bit of CrcNext is derived by combining specific bits of the Data input and the current CRC value (Crc) following the Ethernet CRC calculation rules.
