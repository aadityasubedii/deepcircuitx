    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements an Ethernet Wishbone interface controller, managing communication between the Ethernet MAC and Wishbone bus. It handles Tx and Rx operations, including buffer management, status handling, and interrupt generation. The module utilizes separate clock domains for Rx, Tx, and Wishbone operations, employs FIFOs for data buffering, and implements state machines for controlling data flow and BD operations. It also provides status monitoring and error handling for Ethernet frame processing."
