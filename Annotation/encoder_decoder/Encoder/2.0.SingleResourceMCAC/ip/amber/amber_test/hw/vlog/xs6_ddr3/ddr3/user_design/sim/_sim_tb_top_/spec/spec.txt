Module name: sim_tb_top. Module specification: This module is a testbench for simulating a DDR3 memory controller. It sets up the simulation environment, including clock generation, reset logic, and instantiation of the DDR3 controller (ddr3) and memory model (ddr3_model_c3). The testbench has no external input or output ports, as it generates all necessary stimuli internally and reports results through console output. Key internal signals include c3_sys_clk (system clock), c3_sys_rst (reset), c3_calib_done (calibration completion), c3_error (error indicator), and various DRAM interface signals (mcb3_dram_*). The module consists of several main blocks: clock generation, reset logic, DDR3 controller instantiation, memory model instantiation, and a memc_tb_top instance for test pattern generation
