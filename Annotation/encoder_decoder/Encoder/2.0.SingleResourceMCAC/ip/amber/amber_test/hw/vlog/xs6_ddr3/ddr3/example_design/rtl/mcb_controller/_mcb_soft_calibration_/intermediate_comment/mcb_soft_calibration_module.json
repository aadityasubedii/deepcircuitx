    "module": "Module-level comment: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), including initialization, termination calibration, and dynamic DQS signal calibration. It implements a state machine that progresses through various stages: setting termination values, adjusting DQS delays, and fine-tuning based on measured values. The module interfaces with IODRP controllers to adjust termination and delay settings, adapting to variations in operating conditions to optimize signal integrity and timing for memory operations."
