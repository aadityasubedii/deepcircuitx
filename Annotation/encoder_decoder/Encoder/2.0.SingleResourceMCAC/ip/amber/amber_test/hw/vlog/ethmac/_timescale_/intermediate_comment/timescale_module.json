    "module": "Module-level comment: This Verilog snippet specifies simulation time settings using a `timescale directive. It sets the time unit to 1 nanosecond and precision to 1 picosecond, facilitating accurate timing behavior in simulations. No actual module or computational functionality is defined, as the code solely sets these simulation parameters."
