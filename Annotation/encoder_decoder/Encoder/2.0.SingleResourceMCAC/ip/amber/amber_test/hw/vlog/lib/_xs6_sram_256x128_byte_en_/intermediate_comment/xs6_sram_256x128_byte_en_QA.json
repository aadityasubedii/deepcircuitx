It features byte-enable functionality, allowing selective writing of byte-sized segments within the data width. The module uses a parametric design approach, enabling customization of data and address widths. It utilizes RAMB8BWER components configured for a Simple Dual Port (SDP) operation, supporting independent read and write operations on the same clock. Byte-level write enable is controlled by a combination of a global write enable and per-byte masks. It also contains internal checks to validate specified parameter values for data and address widths."
