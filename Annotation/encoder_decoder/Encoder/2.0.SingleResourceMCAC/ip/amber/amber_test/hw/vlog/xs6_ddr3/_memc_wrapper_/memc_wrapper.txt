Module-level comment: 
/*
 * Memory Controller Wrapper (memc_wrapper)
 * 
 * This module wraps a Memory Controller Block (MCB) interface, providing:
 * - Multiple ports (p0-p5) for command, write, and read operations
 * - AXI interfaces (s0-s5) for system component communication
 * - Configurable parameters for memory timing, calibration, and interface settings
 * 
 * It handles memory signals, clock management, and data transfer between 
 * the MCB and external interfaces, encapsulating complex memory operations
 * behind a standardized interface for easier system integration.
