Module-level comment: The "sim_tb_top" module simulates a DDR3 memory interface. It controls system clock and reset, initializes DDR configurations, and monitors calibration and errors through internal signals and submodules. It drives the example_top entity to simulate memory interactions, using parameterized settings for flexibility in memory operations. The module employs procedural blocks for dynamic signal generation and conditions-based logging to evaluate the simulation outcomes effectively.
