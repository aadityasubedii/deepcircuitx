    "module": "Module-level comment: The eth_crc module calculates CRC for Ethernet transmissions, validating data integrity. It uses synchronization signals (Clk, Reset), data inputs (Data), and control signals (Enable, Initialize) to compute and update the CRC continuously based on Ethernet polynomial equations. The module outputs the CRC result and a flag indicating any discrepancies, managed asynchronously based on clock and reset triggers."
