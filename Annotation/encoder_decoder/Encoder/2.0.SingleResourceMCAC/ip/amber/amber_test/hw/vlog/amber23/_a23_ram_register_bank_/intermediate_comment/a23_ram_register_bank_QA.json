It handles various modes of operation (e.g., user or IRQ), selection inputs to specify registers, and different functionalities such as PC (Program Counter) updates, status bits, and conditional register updates based on the mode of execution and status flags. The module uses separate register banks reg_ram_n, reg_ram_m, and reg_ram_ds to store register values and updates outputs accordingly, facilitating multiple execution modes and fast context switching essential in ARM processors. The outputs are selectively driven by either direct register values or special function values (like flags in r15), depending on the control logic."

The output ports provide access to the data held within the register bank, serving as operands for the processor's execution unit or reflecting the current state or position in the program (e.g., `o_pc` as the current Program Counter).
