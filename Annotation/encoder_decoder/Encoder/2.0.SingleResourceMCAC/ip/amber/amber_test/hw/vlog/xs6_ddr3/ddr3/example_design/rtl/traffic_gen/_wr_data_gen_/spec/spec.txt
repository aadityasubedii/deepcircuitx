Module name: wr_data_gen. 

Module specification: The "wr_data_gen" module is tailored for generating write data for memory write operations in FPGA applications, specifically targeting "SPARTAN6" and "VIRTEX6" families. It accommodates various configurations such as burst length, data width, and address width, and supports different data patterns like pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) and fixed data. The key inputs include a clock signal (`clk_i`), reset (`rst_i`), PRBS seed (`prbs_fseed_i`), data mode (`data_mode_i`), fixed data (`fixed_data_i`), address (`addr_i`), and burst length (`bl_i`), alongside multiple command validity signals. It outputs signals indicating command readiness (`cmd_rdy_o`), the validity of the data (`data_valid_o`), the data itself (`data_o`), and flags for the last word in a burst (`last_word_o`) and the end of data writing (`data_wr_end_o`). Internal signals such as various command readiness and start flags, user burst count, and a FIFO fullness check facilitate the control flow and orchestration of the data generation and output processes. The module contains generative blocks for handling specific FPGA family features and conditional instantiations of family-specific data generation submodules (`sp6_data_gen` and `v6_data_gen`). These sections are responsive to configurations and operate in concert with the primary logic to manage data sequencing, synchronization with external controls, and adherence to configured data patterns and operational modes.
