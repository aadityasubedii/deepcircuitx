    "module": "Module-level comment: The `boot_mem32` module interfaces with Wishbone protocol for 32-bit memory read and write operations, integrated into systems with conditional compilation for debugging and FPGA-specific features. It utilizes input signals for synchronization and data management while employing internal logic to control operational timing and data flow, such as initiating transactions and managing debug sequences. Outputs confirm operational status. Temporary storage and address manipulation are managed by internal registers, ensuring correct data handling during I/O operations."
