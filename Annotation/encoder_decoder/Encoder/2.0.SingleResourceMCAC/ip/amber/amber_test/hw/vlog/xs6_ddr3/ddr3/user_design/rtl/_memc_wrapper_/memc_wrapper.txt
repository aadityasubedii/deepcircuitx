Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements a configurable memory controller wrapper for DDR3 SDRAM interfaces.
It supports up to 6 ports for memory access, each with command, write, and read interfaces.
The module integrates AXI interfaces and handles clock, reset, and PLL signals.
It instantiates an mcb_ui_top core for memory control logic and provides status signals.
The wrapper allows flexible configuration of memory parameters and port settings.
