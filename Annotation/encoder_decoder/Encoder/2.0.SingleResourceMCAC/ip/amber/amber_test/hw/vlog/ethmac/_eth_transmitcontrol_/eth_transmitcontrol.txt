Module-level comment: The 'eth_transmitcontrol' module controls Ethernet control frame transmission, starting and ending them based on network signals. It uses input signals like MTxClk for synchronization, TxReset for initialization, and multiple control signals to manage the flow and timing of frame transmissions. Internally, it employs registers and logic states, such as SendingCtrlFrm and ByteCnt, to handle data multiplexing and ensure the aligned and sequential sending of control data according to Ethernet protocols. This module is central to managing network congestion and transmission efficiency in Ethernet communications.
