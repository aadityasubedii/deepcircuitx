    "module": "Module-level comment: This module generates various data patterns for memory testing. It supports PRBS, address-based, walking 1's/0's, neighbor, and fixed data patterns. The module uses configurable parameters for data width and burst length, and implements different generation logic based on the selected mode. It employs generate blocks to handle various data widths and includes a PRBS generator sub-module. The module processes input signals like clock, reset, and control signals to produce the desired data patterns on the output port."
