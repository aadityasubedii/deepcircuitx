Module name: xs6_sram_2048x32_byte_en. Module specification: This module implements a 2048x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA block RAM primitives (RAMB16BWER). It consists of four 2048x8-bit RAM blocks, each handling one byte of the 32-bit data width. The module supports read and write operations with byte-level write enables, allowing selective writing to individual bytes within a 32-bit word. Input ports include i_clk (clock input), i_write_data (32-bit input data), i_write_enable (write enable signal), i_address (11-bit address input), and i_byte_enable (4-bit byte enable input). The output port o_read_data provides the 32-bit read data. Internal signals include
