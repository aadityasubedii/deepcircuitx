Module-level comment: The 'wishbone_arbiter' module arbitrates access to a Wishbone bus among multiple masters, ensuring one master at a time controls the bus, preventing contention. It dynamically selects the controlling master based on active bus transactions and employs internal signals like `current_master` and hold registers to manage bus control transitions. The module interfaces with two masters and eight slaves, routing data, address, and control signals appropriately to facilitate synchronized and controlled data exchanges.
