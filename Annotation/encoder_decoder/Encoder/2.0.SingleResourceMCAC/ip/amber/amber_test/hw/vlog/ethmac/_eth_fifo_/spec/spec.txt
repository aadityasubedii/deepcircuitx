Module name: eth_fifo. Module specification: The 'eth_fifo' module is a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer specifically tailored for Ethernet data management, facilitating the handling of data under various operational modes such as writing, reading, and clearing of data. It uses 'clk' (clock signal) for synchronization, 'reset' to initialize the internal states, ‘write’ and ‘read’ signals for data manipulation, and ‘clear’ for resetting internal counters and pointers. The ‘data_in’ signal is the input data bus, and the module outputs include ‘data_out’ (the data fetched from the FIFO), status indicators ‘almost_full’, ‘full’, ‘almost_empty’, and ‘empty’, and a ‘cnt’ output reflecting the count of items in the FIFO. Internal signals include FIFO data storage (implemented as either a Verilog array or mapped to hardware specific distributed RAM), data_out register, and cnt, read_pointer, and write_pointer counters for tracking data storage and retrieval positions. The code is structured with conditional blocks for reset and clear operations, manipulating pointers and counters based on the FIFO's state, and data movement conditioned on full or empty states. Depending on the compilation target (generic FPGA or Xilinx Spartan-6), the FIFO storage utilizes different hardware resources, either registers or specialized memory blocks, respectively. This structuring ensures adaptable and efficient data flow management suitable for embedded systems handling Ethernet transmissions.
