Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), handling initialization, dynamic calibration, and termination calibration for DDR memory interfaces. It adjusts timing parameters and termination impedances to optimize memory performance and signal integrity. The module has numerous input and output ports, including clock (UI_CLK), reset (RST), PLL lock (PLL_LOCK), self-refresh signals, and various MCB interface signals. Internal signals include state variables, termination values, counters, and flags for tracking calibration progress. The module implements a complex state machine that progresses through several stages: initialization, RZQ/ZIO calibration, input termination, DQS delay adjustment, and dynamic calibration. It interacts with IODRP (I/O Device, Register, Port) controllers to configure I/O settings and communicates with
