Module-level comment: The tg_status module serves as an error status generator in a test system, identifying and capturing error states during data comparisons. It employs input signals like data mismatch flags and memory buffer statuses, together with internal signals to detect new errors and maintain error integrity. Essential tasks include edge detection on error flags, conditional error logging in registers, and responsive status output based on internal conditions. This facilitates system debugging and ensures accurate data handling analysis.
