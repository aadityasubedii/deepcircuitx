Module name: ETH_DEFINES. Module specification: The ETH_DEFINES is not a conventional Verilog module but a configuration file composed of `define` directives used in Ethernet-related modules for Verilog design. This file crucially does not contain any input or output ports nor does it define internal signals, adhering strictly to providing constants, default values, and macro definitions to aid address mapping and control parameter setups across different parts of an Ethernet system. The code incorporates multiple blocks defining address values for various control registers (`ETH_*_ADR`), default values for these registers (`ETH_*_DEF_*`), and specific width values for bitfields within the registers (`ETH_*_WIDTH_*`). Additionally, operational configurations like FIFO buffers and burst lengths are specified (`ETH_TX_FIFO_CNT_WIDTH`, `ETH_BURST_LENGTH`), offering a decentralized way to manage configurations across various modules of the Ethernet system. Macros like `M1_ADDRESSED_S1` and `M2_ADDRESSED_S1` leverage these definitions to facilitate memory-mapped I/O, thus providing a streamlined approach to memory address mapping within the system design. The design ensures that essential parameters are centralized, making the modules easier to configure and enhancing the maintainability of the Ethernet communication setup.
