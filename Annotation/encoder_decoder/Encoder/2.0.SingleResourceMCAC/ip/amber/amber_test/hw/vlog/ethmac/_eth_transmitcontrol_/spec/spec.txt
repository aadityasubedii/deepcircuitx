Module name: eth_transmitcontrol.

Module specification: The 'eth_transmitcontrol' module is designed for managing the transmission of Ethernet control frames in a network interface. It controls frame initiation, timing, and multiplexing based on various input signals. The module operates with numerous input ports such as MTxClk (main transmission clock), TxReset (reset signal), TxUsedDataIn (data usage flag), and others like TxDoneIn (completed transmission signal), TxAbortIn (abort signal), and TxStartFrmIn (start frame transmission signal). Moreover, the module communicates through output ports including TxCtrlStartFrm (start control frame signal), TxCtrlEndFrm (end of control frame signal), and ControlData (control data being sent). Internal signals such as SendingCtrlFrm (indicates active control frame transmission), CtrlMux (data pathway selector based on transmission requirements), and ByteCnt (byte counter for frame alignment) facilitate internal operations. The code includes blocks handling reset conditions, control frame starting and ending sequences, and signal multiplexing for data control. Through logical conditions and state machines, this module ensures synchronous and efficient control data handling as per Ethernet standards.
