    "module": "Module-level comment: The `mcb_soft_calibration_top` module orchestrates the calibration process for memory control blocks interfacing with different DDR memory types. It facilitates initial and dynamic calibrations using input clocks (`UI_CLK`, `IOCLK`) and reset (`RST`), controlling calibration sequences through signals like `PLL_LOCK` and `SELFREFRESH_REQ`. Outputs manage complete calibration states and memory operations. Internal signals configure the IODRP block for precise timing adjustments. The implementation leverages parameterized instances, IO buffers, and conditional configurations to support various memory setups, ensuring optimized memory performance."
