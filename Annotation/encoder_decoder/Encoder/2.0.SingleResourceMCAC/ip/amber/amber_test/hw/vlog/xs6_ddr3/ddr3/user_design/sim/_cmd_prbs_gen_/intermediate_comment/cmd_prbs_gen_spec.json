This module accommodates configurable parameters like `PRBS_CMD` and `PRBS_WIDTH`, facilitating customization across different FPGA families and operational modes. Inputs to the module include `clk_i` (clock input), `prbs_seed_init` (initializer for the PRBS generator when high), `clk_en` (clock enable for controlled updating of the generator), and `prbs_seed_i` (initial seed for the PRBS generation). The output from the module is `prbs_o`, which carries the generated PRBS sequence. Internally, the module employs signals such as `ZEROS` (a zero-initialized wire), `prbs` (a register storing the current PRBS value), and `lfsr_q` (the shift register implementing LFSR logic). The module's operation is delineated into different generate blocks, handling distinct logic and tap configurations based on `PRBS_CMD` and `PRBS_WIDTH`. These blocks handle initialization, state updates, and specialized configurations (like address masking based on device family) to produce the desired PRBS output effectively.",

This module accommodates configurable parameters like `PRBS_CMD` and `PRBS_WIDTH`, facilitating customization across different FPGA families and operational modes. Inputs to the module include `clk_i` (clock input), `prbs_seed_init` (initializer for the PRBS generator when high), `clk_en` (clock enable for controlled updating of the generator), and `prbs_seed_i` (initial seed for the PRBS generation). The output from the module is `prbs_o`, which carries the generated PRBS sequence. Internally, the module employs signals such as `ZEROS` (a zero-initialized wire), `prbs` (a register storing the current PRBS value), and `lfsr_q` (the shift register implementing LFSR logic). The module's operation is delineated into different generate blocks, handling distinct logic and tap configurations based on `PRBS_CMD` and `PRBS_WIDTH`. These blocks handle initialization, state updates, and specialized configurations (like address masking based on device family) to produce the desired PRBS output effectively."
