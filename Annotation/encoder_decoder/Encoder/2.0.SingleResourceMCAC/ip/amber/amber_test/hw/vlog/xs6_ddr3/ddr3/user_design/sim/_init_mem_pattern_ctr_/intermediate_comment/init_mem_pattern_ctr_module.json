    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"init_mem_pattern_ctr\" module manages memory test patterns for initialization, testing, and comparison. It coordinates inputs like clock, resets, command addresses, and dynamic mode settings through a finite state machine. Outputs control memory traffic and operational modes. Internally, it uses registers and logic to handle state transitions, address comparisons, and parameter configurations. This supports adaptable memory operations suitable for various FPGA families and test scenarios."
