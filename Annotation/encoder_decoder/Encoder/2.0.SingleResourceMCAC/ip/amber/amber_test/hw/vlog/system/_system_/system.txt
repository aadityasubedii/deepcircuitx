Module-level comment: 
/* 
This top-level system module integrates an embedded processor (A23/A25) with memory 
interfaces, peripherals, and a Wishbone bus for inter-module communication. It implements 
clock/reset management, memory controllers (including DDR3 for FPGAs), UART and Ethernet 
interfaces, timers, and an interrupt controller. The module uses conditional compilation 
for FPGA-specific features and supports various I/O interfaces for system integration.
