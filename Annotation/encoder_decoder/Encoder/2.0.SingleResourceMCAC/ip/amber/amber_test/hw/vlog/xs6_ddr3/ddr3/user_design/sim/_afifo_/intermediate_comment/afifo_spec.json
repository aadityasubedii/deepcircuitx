    "spec": "Module name: afifo.\nModule specification: The 'afifo' module is a parameterized, synchronously or asynchronously functioning FIFO buffer designed to handle data of variable sizes and depths efficiently across different clock domains. It operates with input ports such as `wr_clk` (write clock), `rst` (reset), `wr_en` (write enable), `wr_data` (write data), `rd_en` (read enable), and `rd_clk` (read clock). The outputs include `rd_data` (read data), along with flags such as `full`, `empty`, and `almost_full`, signaling the state of the FIFO. Internally, the module employs signals like `rd_gray`, `wr_gray` (Gray coded read/write pointers) and `rd_ptr`, `wr_ptr` (read/write pointers) to manage data integrity and synchronization. The code is divided into sections handling pointer calculations, memory management (read and write operations), and status flag updates. Each section uses process blocks triggered by clock edges or reset conditions to maintain FIFO operations, ensuring robust data storage and retrieval as per FIFO principles. The module strategically utilizes Gray coding to minimize synchronization errors when operating across different clock domains, making it suitable for high-reliability data transfer applications.",

It operates with input ports such as `wr_clk` (write clock), `rst` (reset), `wr_en` (write enable), `wr_data` (write data), `rd_en` (read enable), and `rd_clk` (read clock). The outputs include `rd_data` (read data), along with flags such as `full`, `empty`, and `almost_full`, signaling the state of the FIFO. Internally, the module employs signals like `rd_gray`, `wr_gray` (Gray coded read/write pointers) and `rd_ptr`, `wr_ptr` (read/write pointers) to manage data integrity and synchronization. The code is divided into sections handling pointer calculations, memory management (read and write operations), and status flag updates. Each section uses process blocks triggered by clock edges or reset conditions to maintain FIFO operations, ensuring robust data storage and retrieval as per FIFO principles. The module strategically utilizes Gray coding to minimize synchronization errors when operating across different clock domains, making it suitable for high-reliability data transfer applications."
