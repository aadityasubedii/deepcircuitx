    "module": "Module-level comment: The `eth_rxcounters` module is designed for managing counters in Ethernet frame reception, incorporating byte counts, CRC delay counters, and IFG handling based on frame and reception states. It uses input signals for synchronization and state control, and outputs counter states and conditions. Internally, it employs control signals for counting operations and conditional processing within sequential logic blocks, ensuring proper data and timing management throughout Ethernet frame processing."
