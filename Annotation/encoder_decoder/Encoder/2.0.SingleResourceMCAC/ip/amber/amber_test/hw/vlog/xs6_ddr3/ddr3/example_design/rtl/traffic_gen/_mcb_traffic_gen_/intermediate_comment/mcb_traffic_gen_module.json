    "module": "Module-level comment: This module generates traffic patterns for testing a memory controller block (MCB). It supports various configurations for read/write operations, including data patterns, command patterns, burst lengths, and address modes. The module uses a command generator, flow control, and separate read/write data paths to create and manage traffic. It also includes error checking and status reporting functionalities. The design allows for flexible testing scenarios and supports different memory interfaces through configurable parameters."
