    "spec": "Module name: data_prbs_gen.\nModule specification: The `data_prbs_gen` module in Verilog is designed to generate a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) utilizing a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) mechanism. This module operates on the positive edge of an input clock (`clk_i`) and offers configurability through parameters including the width of the PRBS and seed, as well as a test mode via the `EYE_TEST`. The inputs to this module comprise the clock signal (`clk_i`), a clock enable (`clk_en`), a reset signal (`rst_i`), a fixed 32-bit seed (`prbs_fseed_i`), a seed initialization trigger (`prbs_seed_init`), and a parameterizable seed input (`prbs_seed_i`). The output (`prbs_o`) delivers the PRBS generated by the module. Internal to the module, the `prbs` signal holds the sequence to be output, and `lfsr_q` acts as the shift register where bits are shifted and updated based on feedback logic defined by the LFSR algorithm. The primary procedural blocks include one for handling seed initialization and register reset operations, which conditionally loads values into the LFSR based on either the reset signal or the seed initialization trigger, and another for managing periodic updates to create the LFSR sequence when the clock enable signal is active. An additional always block responds to changes in the LFSR to update the PRBS output. This module facilitates controlled generation of pseudo-random sequences for testing and other applications requiring stochastic characteristics.",

It takes parameters such as PRBS and SEED widths, a seed initialization trigger, a fixed seed, and an optional seed from the input. It operates upon the positive edge of an input clock signal. If a reset signal or seed initialization is active, the LFSR is initialized with a value derived from the provided seeds and a fixed pattern.

The output of the module is this PRBS sequence."

Its width is parameterizable and defined by PRBS_WIDTH.\n\nOutput ports: prbs_o.\nExplanation:\n- **prbs_o**: This is the output of the module, providing the pseudo-random binary sequence generated by the LFSR.

This internal signal is crucial as it represents the ongoing state of the LFSR's output that is accessible externally from the module.\n\n- **lfsr_q**: This signal is a shift register with one bit more than the PRBS_WIDTH (PRBS_WIDTH:1). It is the core of the LFSR implementation where the shifting and feedback operations that generate the pseudo-random sequence occur. The new state of this register is calculated based on both the feedback from its own bits and the initial values derived from seed inputs when triggered by reset or initialization conditions.\n\n- **i**: The signal `i` is an integer used conventionally for indexing in loops within procedural blocks.
