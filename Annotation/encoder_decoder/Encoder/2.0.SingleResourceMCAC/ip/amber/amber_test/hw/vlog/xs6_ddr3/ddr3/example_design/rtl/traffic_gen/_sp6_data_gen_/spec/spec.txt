Module name: sp6_data_gen. Module specification: The sp6_data_gen module is designed to generate various data patterns for memory interface testing or simulation. It supports multiple data generation modes, including fixed value, walking ones/zeros, address-driven, PRBS (Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence), and hammer patterns. The module accepts input signals such as clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), PRBS seed (prbs_fseed_i), data mode (data_mode_i), and various control signals (cmd_startA-E, fixed_data_i, addr_i, user_burst_cnt, fifo_rdy_i) to configure and control its operation. It outputs generated data through the data_o port. Internally, it uses signals like prbs_data, adata, hdata, ndata, and w1data to store different pattern types, and emplo
