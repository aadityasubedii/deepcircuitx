It has an 8-bit data input and output interface. The data within the module can be reset either asynchronously using an external `Reset` signal or synchronously with a `SyncReset` during the positive clock edge. If the `Write` signal is high during a clock edge, the input data (`DataIn`) is written into the register (`DataOut`).
