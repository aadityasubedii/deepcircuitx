It supports both differential and single-ended input clock types, based on the specified parameters. The module adapts the input clock to multiple output clocks, each with various divides, phases, and duty cycles. It also generates reset signals synchronized to the system's operational clock, which are essential for ensuring stable start-up conditions for other parts of the system. Additionally, there are built-in mechanisms to handle asynchronous reset conditions and maintain system stability via PLL lock signals."

They are used when the clock type is set to \"DIFFERENTIAL\" to provide the base clock signal for the PLL.\n   - `sys_clk`: This is the single-ended clock input. It is used when the clock type is set to \"SINGLE_ENDED\" to provide the base clock signal for the PLL.\n   - `sys_rst_i`: System reset input. This is used to initiate a hardware reset of the PLL and synchronization logic. The reset behavior (active-low or active-high) is determined by the parameter `C_RST_ACT_LOW`.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `clk0`, `rst0`, `async_rst`, `sysclk_2x`, `sysclk_2x_180`, `mcb_drp_clk`, `pll_ce_0`, `pll_ce_90`, `pll_lock`.\nExplanation:\n   - `clk0`: A buffered clock output derived from the PLL which typically serves as one of the main operational clocks for the system.\n   - `rst0`: Synchronized reset output intended to be used with `clk0`. This signal ensures that the entire system is reset properly, avoiding metastability issues post-reset.\n   - `async_rst`: Asynchronous reset output that responds quickly to a failure in PLL lock or an external reset command, ensuring the entire system is reset independently from the regular clock synchronization.\n   - `sysclk_2x`, `sysclk_2x_180`: Fast clock outputs generated from the PLL, where `sysclk_2x_180` has a 180-degree phase shift relative to `sysclk_2x`. These can be used for high-speed operations or double data rate (DDR) interfaces.\n   - `mcb_drp_clk`: A gated version of one of the PLL outputs used specifically for memory controller block (MCB) operations, gated by the PLL lock status.\n   - `pll_ce_0`, `pll_ce_90`: Output strobe signals for SERDES operations, with `pll_ce_90` exhibiting a 90-degree phase shift relative to `pll_ce_0`, providing timing controls for serial data transmission.\n   - `pll_lock`: Indicates the lock status of the PLL. When high, it indicates that the PLL has locked onto the input clock, and its outputs are stable. This is critical for reliable system operation."
