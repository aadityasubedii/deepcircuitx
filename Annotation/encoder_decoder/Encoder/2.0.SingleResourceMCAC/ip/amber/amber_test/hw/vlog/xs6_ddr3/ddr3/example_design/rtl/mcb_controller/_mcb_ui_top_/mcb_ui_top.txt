This module implements a Memory Controller Block (MCB) User Interface (UI) top-level wrapper, supporting multiple ports with MCB or AXI interfaces. It manages memory operations, arbitration, and provides command, write, and read interfaces. The implementation includes clock management, port configuration, and AXI integration. It utilizes internal signals to connect MCB and AXI interfaces, handles various memory operations, and supports different memory types and configurations. The module incorporates calibration and initialization logic, as well as support for different port configurations and arbitration algorithms.
