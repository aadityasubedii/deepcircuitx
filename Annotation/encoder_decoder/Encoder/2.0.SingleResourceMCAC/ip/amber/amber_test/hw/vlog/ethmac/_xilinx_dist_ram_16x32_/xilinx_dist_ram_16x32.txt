Module-level comment: The xilinx_dist_ram_16x32 is a Verilog module implementing a 16x32 distributed RAM with dual-port capability on Xilinx FPGA using 32 RAM16X1D primitives. It features write and read operations managed by separate address signals, waddr and raddr, directly reflecting input ports for parallel processing capabilities at individual bit level. This allows simultaneous reads and writes to different memory locations, enhancing performance and utilization for FPGA-based applications.
