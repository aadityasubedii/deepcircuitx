    "module": "Module-level comment: The timer_module manages three independent timers, interfaced via a Wishbone bus with configurable 32 or 128-bit data widths. It processes read and write operations, provides interrupt signals upon timer expiries, and supports reloading or stopping timers at zero counts. The module implements registers for timer control, values, and load settings, handling data transactions and timer countdowns efficiently within separate blocks, guided by state signals and conditional paths."
