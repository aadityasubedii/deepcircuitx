Module name: tb_uart. 

Module specification: The tb_uart module is a testbench designed for verifying the Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) communication interface. It handles simulation for the transmitting and receiving processes, including checking for errors and maintaining correct synchronization using a clock signal. The module uses input ports: `i_uart_cts_n` (Clear to Send, active low, indicates if the receiver is ready to accept data) and `i_uart_rxd` (Receive Data, carries data to the module from an external transmitter). Output ports include: `o_uart_txd` (Transmit Data, outputs data serially from this module) and `o_uart_rts_n` (Request to Send, active low, signals external receiver readiness for data). Internal signals such as `clk_uart` (UART clock signal), `rx_state` (reception state), `tx_state` (transmission state), and FIFO buffers (`tx_fifo` with write and read pointers `txfifo_wp`, `txfifo_rp`) facilitate the operations. The module is segmented into initialization blocks to set up clock signals, transmission control to manage sending of data respecting buffer status and Clear to Send signal, reception control to manage data receiving and byte assembly, and loopback testing setups for internal data route back simulation. This structured approach ensures efficient testing of UART functionalities under different scenarios.
