    "module": "Module-level comment: The `write_data_path` manages memory write operations using input signals like commands and data patterns, synchronizing via `clk_i`. Embedding a `wr_data_gen` submodule, it processes and validates data readiness (`data_rdy_i`), commands (`cmd_valid_i` series), and addresses (`addr_i`), outputting status (`data_valid_o`, `cmd_rdy_o`) and completion signals (`last_word_wr_o`, `data_wr_end_o`). Data mask is hardcoded to zero for simplified handling."
