    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a Memory Controller Block (MCB) wrapper for DDR memory interfaces. It handles address translation, data transfer, and control signals between user logic and physical memory. The module supports multiple port configurations, memory widths, and timings. It uses IODRP2_MCB blocks for I/O calibration, OSERDES2 blocks for data serialization, and various IOBUF/OBUFT components for physical interface. The wrapper incorporates logic for input/output buffers, delay lines, and dynamic reconfiguration to optimize memory performance across different DDR types and configurations."
