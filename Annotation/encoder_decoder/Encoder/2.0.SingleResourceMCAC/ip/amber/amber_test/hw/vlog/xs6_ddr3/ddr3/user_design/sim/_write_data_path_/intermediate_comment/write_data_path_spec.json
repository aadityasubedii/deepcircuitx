    "spec": "Module name: write_data_path. \nModule specification: The \"write_data_path\" is a Verilog module designed for controlling and managing the data writing operations to memory in hardware systems such as SPARTAN6 FPGAs. It synchronizes via a system clock (`clk_i`) and handles system resets with a 10-bit wide reset signal (`rst_i`). This module is crucial in the command processing and data transition for memory write operations, featuring a variety of inputs for commands (`cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_validB_i`, `cmd_validC_i`), data modes (`data_mode_i`), fixed data (`fixed_data_i`), target memory addresses (`addr_i`), burst lengths (`bl_i`), and readiness signals (`data_rdy_i`). Outputs from the module indicate command readiness (`cmd_rdy_o`), data validity (`data_valid_o`), last word in write operation (`last_word_wr_o`), data to be written (`data_o`), data masks (`data_mask_o`), and end of write signals (`data_wr_end_o`). Internally, the signal `data_valid` ensures data is ready for outputting by verifying both internal data generation readiness and external path acceptability, while the register `cmd_rdy` manages command ready conditions. The module incorporates a \"wr_data_gen\" sub-module handling detailed data generation and transaction sequences, aiding in customizable data patterns, and structural management. This setup supports flexibility in terms of data width, memory burst length, and additional parameters crucial for tailoring to specific design needs and memory configurations.",

The module interfaces with a data generation sub-module named \"wr_data_gen\", which generates data sequences based on configured patterns and burst lengths. The main functions of the \"write_data_path\" include handling command readiness signals, computing data validity by combining incoming valid signals and readiness signals, and controlling data transactions by issuing last word indications, data masks, and end-of-write signals. The module operates within a highly parameterizable design, which allows it to adapt to different memory configurations, data widths, and testing conditions specific to hardware designs like SPARTAN6 FPGAs."

It synchronizes via a system clock (`clk_i`) and handles system resets with a 10-bit wide reset signal (`rst_i`). This module is crucial in the command processing and data transition for memory write operations, featuring a variety of inputs for commands (`cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_validB_i`, `cmd_validC_i`), data modes (`data_mode_i`), fixed data (`fixed_data_i`), target memory addresses (`addr_i`), burst lengths (`bl_i`), and readiness signals (`data_rdy_i`). Outputs from the module indicate command readiness (`cmd_rdy_o`), data validity (`data_valid_o`), last word in write operation (`last_word_wr_o`), data to be written (`data_o`), data masks (`data_mask_o`), and end of write signals (`data_wr_end_o`). Internally, the signal `data_valid` ensures data is ready for outputting by verifying both internal data generation readiness and external path acceptability, while the register `cmd_rdy` manages command ready conditions. The module incorporates a \"wr_data_gen\" sub-module handling detailed data generation and transaction sequences, aiding in customizable data patterns, and structural management. This setup supports flexibility in terms of data width, memory burst length, and additional parameters crucial for tailoring to specific design needs and memory configurations."
