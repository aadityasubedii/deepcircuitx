Module name: write_data_path. Module specification: The `write_data_path` module is designed to facilitate memory write operations, specifically in memory-related applications requiring robust data handling and command readiness features. It contains input ports such as `clk_i` (clock input), `rst_i` (reset vector with multiple reset signals), `cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_validB_i`, `cmd_validC_i` (command validation signals), `prbs_fseed_i` (seed for PRBS), `data_mode_i` (mode of data operation), `fixed_data_i` (fixed data for writing), `addr_i` (memory address), and `bl_i` (burst length). The output ports are `cmd_rdy_o` (command readiness), `data_valid_o` (data validity status), `last_word_wr_o` (indicator for last word written in a burst), `data_o` (data output), `data_mask_o` (mask for data handling, hardcoded to zero), and `data_wr_end_o` (signal for end of the write operation). Internal workings include the `data_valid` signal, indicating the validity of data from the `wr_data_gen` submodule, and the `cmd_rdy` register, tracking command readiness internally. The module encapsulates the `wr_data_gen` submodule that handles detailed data generation and command processing based on multiple input stimuli, producing the required outputs and processing the internal signals to maintain the flow of data in synchronization with external requests. The overall code structure ensures synchronicity, command processing, and efficient data management suitable for testing environments or advanced memory controllers.
