It provides a 128-bit wide data interface with 512 addressable locations. The module supports byte-level write operations through a 16-bit byte enable signal. It allows for initialization of the SRAM contents using parameters and provides both read and write capabilities. The design is specifically tailored for Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGAs."
