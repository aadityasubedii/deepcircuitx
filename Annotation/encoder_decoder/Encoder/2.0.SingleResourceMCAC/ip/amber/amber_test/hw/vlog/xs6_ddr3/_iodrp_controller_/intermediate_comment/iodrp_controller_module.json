    "module": "Module-level comment: The `iodrp_controller` module manages memory read/write operations via a serial interface. It uses input signals to control operation modes and data flow, operating under a finite state machine (FSM) with states for readiness, decision-making, address handling, and data transfer. The FSM, steered by a clock input, synchronously resets and transitions through stages based on command validation and operational mode, coordinating serial data output and state readiness efficiently."
