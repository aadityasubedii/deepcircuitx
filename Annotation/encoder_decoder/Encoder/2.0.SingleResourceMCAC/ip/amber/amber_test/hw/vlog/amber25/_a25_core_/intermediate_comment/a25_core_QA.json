It connects various functional units like fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back stages that are typical in a pipelined CPU architecture. The module interfaces with external components through the Wishbone bus, handling both instruction fetching and data processing. This is indicated by the presence of sub-modules for handling different stages of instruction and data processing, and by interfacing with coprocessors and cache operations. It handles standard CPU functionalities including interrupt handling, status flag updates, and execution of different types of instructions, essentially orchestrating the entire operation of the CPU."
