    "module": "This module serves as a wrapper for a memory controller interface, providing connectivity between multiple AXI and custom port interfaces to a DDR memory controller. It manages memory timings, arbitration, and configuration for various DDR types. The implementation includes multiple clock domains, reset handling, and up to 6 configurable ports with separate command, write, and read interfaces. It instantiates an mcb_ui_top module to handle the core memory controller functionality, while providing a flexible interface for different system configurations and memory types. The module also includes calibration logic, status reporting, and supports both standard and AXI interfaces for memory access."
