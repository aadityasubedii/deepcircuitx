Module name: clocks_resets.

Module specification: The clocks_resets module is designed to manage the generation of system clocks and reset signals for an FPGA-based system using inputs from board clock signals and a board reset signal. The module has several input and output ports. Input ports include: i_brd_rst (a board reset signal for initiating system-wide reset), i_brd_clk_n and i_brd_clk_p (differential clock inputs to provide the main operation clock), and i_ddr_calib_done (indicating the completion of DDR calibration). The output ports include: o_sys_rst (the system reset signal), o_sys_clk (the main system clock), and o_clk_200 (an additional clock output). Internally, the module utilizes various signals such as calib_done_33mhz (synchronized DDR calibration completion signal), rst0 (primary internal reset signal), pll_locked (status of PLL lock), and pll_clk (clock signal from PLL). The module's code is divided into sections based on FPGA families (Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6) to handle specific configurations and uses constructs like PLL_ADV and MMCM_ADV for generating system clocks. The code includes synchronization logic and conditional assignments to manage the resets and clocks effectively across different operational phases and conditions. It also contains simulation-specific blocks to mock behavior in non-Xilinx environments, handling clock creation and reset logic behaviorally.
