Module name: rd_data_gen. 

Module specification: The 'rd_data_gen' is a configurable Verilog module designed for generating and managing data transactions in synchronization with incoming commands based on different parameters set for various FPGA families like 'SPARTAN6' and 'VIRTEX6'. This module integrates with data command interfaces, producing data conditioned on command validation, readiness, and burst length requirements. It features input ports such as clk_i (clock input for synchronization), rst_i (reset signal), prbs_fseed_i (seed for pseudo-random data sequence generation), data_mode_i (specifies data operation mode), cmd_valid_i (indicates a valid incoming command), fixed_data_i (specific fixed data value for certain data modes), addr_i (address input for data transactions), bl_i (specifies the burst length for the transaction), data_rdy_i (indicates readiness to accept data), and rd_mdata_en (enable signal for read and modify operation). Its output ports include cmd_rdy_o (indicates readiness for new commands), last_word_o (signals the end of a data transaction), user_bl_cnt_is_1_o (indicates when the internal burst length counter is one), data_valid_o (shows the validity of the output data), and data_o (the generated data output). Internal signals like prbs_data, cmd_start, and data control the data generation and handshaking mechanism to properly time data outputs respecting module's current state. The module operates with distinct internal blocks for managing command initiation, data generation, readiness, and transaction completion including special generate blocks adapting the data handling logic based on the FPGA family, which is specified in the 'FAMILY' parameter. These blocks coordinate to process incoming data transactions and distribute the processed data while ensuring that the implementation effectively meets memory or data transaction system requirements within specified FPGA configurations.
