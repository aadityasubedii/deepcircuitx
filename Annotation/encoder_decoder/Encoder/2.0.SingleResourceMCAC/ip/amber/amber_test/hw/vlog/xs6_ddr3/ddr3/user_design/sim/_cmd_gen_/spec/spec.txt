Module name: cmd_gen. Module specification: The cmd_gen module generates memory commands (read, write, refresh) for a memory interface. It supports various addressing modes (sequential, PRBS, fixed, BRAM) and burst lengths. The module takes inputs such as clk_i (clock), rst_i (reset), run_traffic_i (enable signal), rd_buff_avail_i (read buffer availability), and various mode selection signals. It outputs addr_o (generated address), instr_o (generated instruction), bl_o (burst length), and cmd_o_vld (command valid signal). Internal signals include address counters, PRBS generators, and control flags. The module is divided into sections for address generation, instruction creation, burst length calculation, and command timing management. It handles different instruction types, controls read/write operations based on buffer availability, and manages refresh commands. The module supports both Spar
