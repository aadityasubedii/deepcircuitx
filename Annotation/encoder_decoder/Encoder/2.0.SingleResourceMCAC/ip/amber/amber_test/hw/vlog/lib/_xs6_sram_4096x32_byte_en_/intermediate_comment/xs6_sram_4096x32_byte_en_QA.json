It consists of 8 RAMB16BWER primitives, each handling 8 bits of the 32-bit data width. The module supports read and write operations with byte-level write enables, allowing selective writes to individual bytes within a 32-bit word. The SRAM is organized into two banks (b0 and b1) to accommodate the full 4096-word depth. The module also includes parameters for initializing the SRAM contents."
