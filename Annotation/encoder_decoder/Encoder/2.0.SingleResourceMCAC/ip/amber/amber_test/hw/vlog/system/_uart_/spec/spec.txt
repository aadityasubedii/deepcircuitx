Module name: uart. Module specification: This module implements a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) interface with configurable baud rates, FIFO buffers, and Wishbone interface support. It handles both transmitting and receiving data serially, with features including interrupt generation, flow control (CTS/RTS), and configurable parameters like data bits and stop bits. The module has input ports for clock, Wishbone interface signals, UART CTS, and RXD, and output ports for Wishbone interface responses, UART interrupt, TXD, and RTS. Internal signals manage FIFO operations, transmit and receive state machines, and various control registers. The code is organized into sections for FIFO management, transmit and receive operations, register access, and interrupt handling. It supports both FIFO and non-FIFO modes, implements transmit and receive state machines, and includes
