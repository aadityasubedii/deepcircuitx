It takes an input clock signal and generates a modified clock (Mdc) based on the specified divider value. The divider is adjustable, allowing the frequency of the generated clock to be set as needed. The module includes mechanisms for synchronously resetting, and outputs both the modified clock (Mdc) and enable signals (MdcEn, MdcEn_n) indicating the active edge of the Mdc signal. The functionality primarily involves counting down from a predetermined value derived from the divider and toggling the Mdc signal when the counter reaches zero."

This signal is used as a clock for other parts of the Ethernet MAC.\n- MdcEn: An enable signal that is high when the Mdc output toggles from high to low (falling edge). It is used to indicate a valid clock edge where certain operations in the MAC can be performed.\n- MdcEn_n: An enable signal that is high when the Mdc output toggles from low to high (rising edge). This signal complements MdcEn and may be used for operations that should occur on the opposite edge of the Mdc signal."

It is used as a condition for toggling the Mdc signal and for setting the MdcEn and MdcEn_n output signals.\n- CounterPreset: An 8-bit wire that establishes the initial count value for the Counter.
