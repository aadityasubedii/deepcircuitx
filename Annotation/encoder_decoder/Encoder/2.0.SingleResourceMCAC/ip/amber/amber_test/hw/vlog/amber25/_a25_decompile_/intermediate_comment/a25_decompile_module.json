    "module": "Module-level comment: This module decompiles ARM25 instructions for debugging purposes. It processes input signals including instruction, address, and execution status, decodes various instruction types, and generates human-readable representations. The module uses combinational logic for instruction decoding and sequential logic for tracking execution and interrupts. Decompiled instructions are formatted and written to a file, providing a detailed trace of program execution and facilitating analysis of ARM25 assembly code."
