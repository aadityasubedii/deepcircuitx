    "module": "Module-level comment: The a23_ram_register_bank is a register bank module for ARM processors, handling register read/write operations based on execution modes, register selection, and status flags. It synchronizes with an input clock and uses separate register banks (reg_ram_n, reg_ram_m, reg_ram_ds) for storing data. Output values are driven by direct register values or functions of PC and status flags, controlled by multiplexing logic based on mode-specific addresses and selector inputs, facilitating dynamic register management and fast context switching."
