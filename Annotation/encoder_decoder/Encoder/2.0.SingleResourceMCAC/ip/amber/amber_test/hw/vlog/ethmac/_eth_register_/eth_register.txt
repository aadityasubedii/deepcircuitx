Module-level comment: The `eth_register` module implements an 8-bit data storage with writing and reset capabilities. It updates the `DataOut` register on each positive `Clk` edge based on the `Write`, `Reset`, and `SyncReset` conditions, utilizing asynchronous and synchronous reset mechanisms to maintain data integrity and responsiveness to control inputs.
