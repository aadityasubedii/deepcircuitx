Module name: sim_tb_top.
Module specification: The "sim_tb_top" is a testbench Verilog module primarily designed for simulating a DDR3 memory interface. This module initializes and controls system clock (`c3_sys_clk`) and reset (`c3_sys_rst`) signals, alongside managing the DDR3 memory configurations. It includes various input ports such as the system clock (`c3_sys_clk`) for driving the memory interface, and the system reset (`c3_sys_rst`) for initializing the module to a known state. The output ports of the module are 'error', which indicates any operational faults, and 'calib_done', signaling the completion of the memory interface calibration. Key internal signals include `c3_sys_clk_p` and `c3_sys_clk_n` derived from the main clock for interfacing with DDR memory, along with various control signals for managing memory operations (`mcb3_dram_*`). The module is structured into several blocks: initialization of clock and reset signals, instantiation of the "example_top" module with memory interface specific configurations and calibration handling, and a DDR3 memory model for simulating actual memory operations. Additionally, there are procedural blocks aimed at monitoring the test status to log and display simulation results, and conditional checks for calibration completion and error management, culminating in successful or failed test outcomes.
