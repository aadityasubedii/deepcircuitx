    "module": "Module-level comment: The eth_spram_256x32 is a synchronous RAM module built for FPGAs, supporting 256 32-bit words, operable through clock-synchronized reads and writes. It leverages compile-time flags to select between Xilinx Spartan-6, Virtex-6, or a generic RAM model, using input signals like chip and write enables for controlled access, and includes internal write logic for byte-wise data writing."
