Module name: example_top. Module specification: The example_top module is a top-level design for a DDR3 memory controller interface. It integrates a memory controller wrapper (memc3_wrapper_inst) and a test bench top module (memc3_tb_top_inst) to implement and test a DDR3 memory controller in an FPGA design. The module has input ports for system clock (c3_sys_clk) and reset (c3_sys_rst_i), output ports for various DDR3 SDRAM interface signals (mcb3_dram_*), and inout ports for bidirectional data and strobe signals. Internal signals include clock management (c3_clk0, c3_sysclk_2x), reset control (c3_rst0, c3_async_rst), and memory controller status signals (c3_calib_done
