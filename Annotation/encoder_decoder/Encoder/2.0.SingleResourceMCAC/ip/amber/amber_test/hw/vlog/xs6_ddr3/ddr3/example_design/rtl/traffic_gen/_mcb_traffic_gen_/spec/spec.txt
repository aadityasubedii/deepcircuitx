Module name: mcb_traffic_gen. Module specification: The mcb_traffic_gen module is designed to generate traffic patterns for testing a memory controller block (MCB). It supports various configurations including data patterns, command patterns, burst lengths, and address modes for both read and write operations. The module has numerous input ports for configuration and control, such as clk_i (clock input), rst_i (reset input), run_traffic_i (start/stop traffic generation), and various mode and seed inputs. Output ports include mcb_cmd_en_o (command enable), mcb_cmd_instr_o (command instruction), mcb_cmd_addr_o (command address), and mcb_wr_data_o (write data). Internal signals like cmd2flow_valid, cmd2flow_cmd, and wr_addr are used for managing command flow and addressing. The module is composed of several key blocks:
