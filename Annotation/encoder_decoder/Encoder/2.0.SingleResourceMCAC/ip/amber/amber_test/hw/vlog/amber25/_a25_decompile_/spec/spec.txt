Module name: a25_decompile. Module specification: This module is an ARM25 instruction decompiler designed for debugging and analysis purposes. It takes various input signals related to instruction execution, including the 32-bit instruction, address, execution status, and interrupt information. The module decodes and decompiles ARM25 instructions, providing a human-readable representation of the executed assembly code. It handles different instruction types (e.g., REGOP, TRANS, BRANCH) and formats them accordingly. The decompiled instructions are written to a file specified by the A25_DECOMPILE_FILE macro. Key internal signals include instruction components (e.g., opcode, condition, registers), execution flags, and formatting variables. The module is organized into several blocks: input signal processing, instruction decoding, decompilation tasks for different instruction types, and output formatting. It also tracks and reports on interrupts and jumps in program execution
