Module name: xs6_sram_256x21_line_en. Module specification: The xs6_sram_256x21_line_en module emulates an SRAM interface using a Xilinx RAMB8BWER configured for SDP mode. It supports reading and writing operation over a 21-bit data width with an 8-bit address space in alignment with a clock signal (`i_clk`). The input ports include `i_clk` for synchronizing operations, `i_write_data` for carrying 21-bit data to be written into memory, `i_write_enable` to determine writing or reading mode, and `i_address` defining the target memory address. The output port, `o_read_data`, provides the 21-bit data read from memory, constructed from the lower and higher parts of the memory block. Internal signals, `read_data_lo` and `read_data_hi`, temporarily hold the lower and higher parts of the data extracted for processing. A crucial block in the code is the RAMB8BWER instantiation which manages data writing and reading based on the addressing and enable inputs, concatenating segments of data for the output. Initial blocks verify the correct parameter settings for data and address widths, issuing warnings if mismatches occur.
