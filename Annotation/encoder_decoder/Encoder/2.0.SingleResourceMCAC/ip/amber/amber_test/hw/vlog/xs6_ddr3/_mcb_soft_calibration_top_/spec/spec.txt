Module name: mcb_soft_calibration_top. 
Module specification: The 'mcb_soft_calibration_top' module is responsible for managing the soft calibration processes within a Memory Controller Block (MCB), primarily targeting DDR memory types. The module utilizes input signals like UI_CLK for synchronization, RST for resets, IOCLK specifically for I/O operations, and additional signals like PLL_LOCK, SELFREFRESH_REQ, etc., to align the controllerâ€™s state with external conditions. Output signals from the module include DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL, which indicates the completion of calibration processes, and several others like MCB_UIADDR, MCB_UICMDEN, which facilitate direct control over the memory operations and calibration processes. Internal signals, such as IODRP_ADD and IODRP_SDI, are used for configuring the I/O Delay Reconfiguration Programmable (IODRP) related to different pin calibrations and setup. The module integrates multiple blocks, such as the mcb_soft_calibration instantiation handling the core calibration logic, various IODRP configurations for pin management, and IOBUF components to control bi-directional pins ZIO and RZQ. This structured approach ensures the module efficiently manages the MCB for optimal memory performance and stability under various operational conditions.
