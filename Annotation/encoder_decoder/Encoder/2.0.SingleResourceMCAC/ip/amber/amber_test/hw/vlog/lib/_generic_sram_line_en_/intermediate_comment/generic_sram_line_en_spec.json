It supports basic read and write operations with additional capabilities for handling multiple scan inputs and outputs which are used in test modes (e.g., for scan chains in silicon testing). Upon a reset signal, the SRAM can be initialized with zeros or ones based on the parameter `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO`. During normal operation, data can be written to a specified address if the write enable signal is active. Simultaneously, data from the memory can be read out asynchronously based on the address provided.
