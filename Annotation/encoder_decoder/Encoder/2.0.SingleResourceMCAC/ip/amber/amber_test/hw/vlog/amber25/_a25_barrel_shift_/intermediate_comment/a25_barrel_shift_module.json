    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'a25_barrel_shift' module performs barrel shifting on a 32-bit input using two shifting mechanisms (quick and full) based on the shift amount and control logic. It manages outputs and mode selection dynamically with internal registers and conditional logic, ensuring responsiveness to inputs such as shift type, amount, and operational mode, and uses instances of 'a25_shifter' for the shifting operations."
