    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'eth_outputcontrol' module manages Ethernet output data signals Mdo and MdoEn based on operational conditions. It uses inputs like WriteOp, InProgress, ShiftedBit, and BitCounter, evaluated via internal signals such as SerialEn, to determine output enablement. Implementing register stages and logic conditions within always blocks triggered by Clk or Reset, the module effectively serializes data outputs synchronized to specific operational phases."
