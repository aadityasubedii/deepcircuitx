Module-level comment: The 'mcb_soft_calibration_top' manages soft calibration for DDR memory types within MCBs, ensuring stability and performance through UI_CLK-synchronized internal operations and I/O-specific clock management. The module receives control signals to manage calibration states, broadcasts outputs regarding calibration completion, and interfaces with IODRP components for pin management, handled via IOBUF for reversible I/O operations and parameterized configurations to accommodate various memory and calibration modes.
