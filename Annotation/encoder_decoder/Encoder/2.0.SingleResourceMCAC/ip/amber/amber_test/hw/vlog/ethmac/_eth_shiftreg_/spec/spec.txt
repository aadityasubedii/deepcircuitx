Module name: eth_shiftreg.
Module specification: The `eth_shiftreg` module serves as a shift register for Ethernet applications, specifically handling data manipulations based on the MDC/MDIO interface requirements. The module accepts various inputs such as a clock signal (`Clk`), reset (`Reset`), and Medium Dependent Interface Clock Enable (`MdcEn_n`), alongside data (`Mdi`), PHY address (`Fiad`), register address (`Rgad`), control data (`CtrlData`), and operational control signals (`WriteOp`, `ByteSelect`, `LatchByte`). The outputs generated include the shifted bit (`ShiftedBit`), processed data (`Prsd`), and a link failure indicator (`LinkFail`). Internally, the module utilizes a shift register (`ShiftReg`) for transitional data storage and shifting, a processed data register (`Prsd`) for holding the final shift data output, and a link failure signal (`LinkFail`) to denote errors. The operations within the module are structured primarily around the clock edge-based block, which checks for resets, manages data shifting based on byte selection or serial input, and conditionally updates the processed data outputs and error flags based on specific conditions and control signals. This arrangement ensures a structured, conditional operation flow ideal for real-time data processing tasks required in Ethernet-based applications.
