It takes in various input signals related to instruction execution, including the instruction itself, address, and execution status. The module then decodes and decompiles the instructions, providing a human-readable representation of the executed ARM25 assembly code. It handles different instruction types (e.g., REGOP, TRANS, BRANCH, etc.) and formats them accordingly. The decompiled instructions are written to a file for debugging or analysis purposes. The module also tracks and reports on interrupts and jumps in the program execution."
