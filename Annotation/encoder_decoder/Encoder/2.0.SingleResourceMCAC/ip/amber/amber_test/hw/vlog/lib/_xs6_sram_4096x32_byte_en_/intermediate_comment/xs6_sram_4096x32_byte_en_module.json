    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a 4096x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using 8 RAMB16BWER primitives on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. It's organized into two banks, each handling 2048 words, to achieve the full depth. The module supports read and write operations with byte-level write enables, allowing selective writes to individual bytes within a 32-bit word. It includes parameters for initializing SRAM contents and uses multiplexing to select the appropriate bank for read operations."
