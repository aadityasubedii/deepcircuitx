Module name: tg_status. 
Module specification: The `tg_status` module is intended for monitoring and reporting error conditions in data processing, particularly focusing on detecting data discrepancies across diverse inputs. It takes various input signals such as `data_error_i`, `cmp_data_i`, `rd_data_i`, `cmp_addr_i`, `cmp_bl_i`, `mcb_cmd_full_i`, `mcb_wr_full_i`, and `mcb_rd_empty_i`, each related to data and memory buffer statuses. The primary functionality includes capturing and outputting error statuses when discrepancies between comparison and read data are found at specific points, signaled via the `data_error_i`. The outputs of the module are `error_status`, which records specific details including data values, involved addresses, and memory buffer statuses, and `error`, a flag that indicates the presence of an error. Internally, the module utilizes `data_error_r`, a registered version of the `data_error_i` signal to detect rising edges, and `error_set`, which maintains the state of error until reset or cleared manually. The code operates mainly in two always blocks - the first handles the signal registration and error condition response, reset, and clearing mechanisms, while the second block controls the updates and defaults of the `error_status` output under different conditions, ensuring robust monitoring and detailed error logging critical for troubleshooting and system analysis.
