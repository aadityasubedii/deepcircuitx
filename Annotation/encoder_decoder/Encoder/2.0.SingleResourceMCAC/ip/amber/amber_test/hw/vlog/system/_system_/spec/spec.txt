Module name: system. Module specification: The system module is the top-level design for an embedded system, integrating various components including a processor core (A23 or A25), memory interfaces (boot and main memory/DDR3), peripherals (UART, Ethernet MAC, timers), and an interrupt controller. It uses a Wishbone bus architecture for inter-module communication. The module has numerous input and output ports, including board-level reset and clock inputs, test and scan chain signals, UART and Ethernet interfaces, and DDR3 memory connections. Key internal signals include system clock and reset, Wishbone bus signals for masters and slaves, and interrupt signals from various peripherals. The module is structured into several main blocks: clock and reset management, processor core, memory interfaces (including DDR3 controller for FPGA implementations), peripherals (UART, Ethernet MAC, timers), interrupt controller, and a Wish
