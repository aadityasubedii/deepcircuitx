    "module": "This module implements an ARM-based CPU core (a25_core) with a pipelined architecture. It processes instructions and data through fetch, decode, execute, memory, and write-back stages, interfacing with external components via a Wishbone bus. The core manages interrupts, handles memory operations, and interacts with coprocessors. Implementation includes dedicated sub-modules for each pipeline stage, a Wishbone interface for external communication, and a coprocessor module for extended functionality, all orchestrated to provide efficient instruction execution and data processing."
