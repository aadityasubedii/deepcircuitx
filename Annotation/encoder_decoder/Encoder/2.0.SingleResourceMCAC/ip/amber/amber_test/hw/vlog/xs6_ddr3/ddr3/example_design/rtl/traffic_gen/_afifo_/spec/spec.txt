Module name: afifo.
Module specification: The 'afifo' module in Verilog is an asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer designed to safely handle data transfer between different clock domains using separate write (`wr_clk`) and read (`rd_clk`) clocks. The FIFO can hold data of size specified by `DSIZE` and has a configurable depth `FIFO_DEPTH`. Input ports include `wr_clk` and `rd_clk` to synchronize write and read operations respectively, `rst` for initializing internal states, `wr_en` to enable writing data, and `rd_data` as the write data bus. Output ports comprise `rd_data` for outputting read data, and flags `full`, `empty`, and `almost_full` indicating the fullness status. Internal signals involve memory arrays `mem` for data storage, read and write pointers `rd_ptr`, `wr_ptr` in Gray code for safe synchronization, and calculated next pointer states. The code structure includes generate blocks for synchronizing read and write pointers, and always blocks managing FIFO operations such as data writing and reading based on the FIFO filling status and clock triggers. It efficiently addresses common issues in clock domain crossing by using Gray coding to minimize synchronization errors in asynchronous environments.
