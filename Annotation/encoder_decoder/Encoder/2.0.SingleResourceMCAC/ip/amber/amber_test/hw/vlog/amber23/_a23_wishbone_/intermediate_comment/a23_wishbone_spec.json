    "spec": "Module name: a23_wishbone.  \nModule specification: The a23_wishbone module orchestrates data transactions over the Wishbone bus protocol, managing core-to-peripheral communication with functionalities for both data caching and exclusive access handling. The input ports include i_clk (system clock), i_select (activate module for bus requests), i_write_data (data for writing operations), i_write_enable (enables write operation), i_byte_enable (activates specific data bytes), i_data_access, i_exclusive (exclusive access control), i_address (memory or resource address), and i_cache_req (indicates cache controller requests), along with Wishbone status signals i_wb_dat, i_wb_ack, and i_wb_err. The output ports include o_stall (signals processing halt for ongoing bus operations), o_wb_adr (target address on the Wishbone bus), o_wb_sel (active data byte selector), o_wb_we (write operation enabler on the bus), o_wb_dat (data to the bus), o_wb_cyc (indicates active bus cycle), and o_wb_stb (signals active bus data transfer). Internally, the module leverages signals such as wishbone_st (state control), core/cache read/write requests, start_access (initiates bus access), servicing_cache, byte_enable, exclusive_access, read_ack, wait_write_ack, wb_wait, and buffer registers wbuf_addr_r, wbuf_sel_r, wbuf_busy_r, managing transactions and buffering outputs. The code architecture reflects a state machine handling various states including idle, burst phases, wait for acknowledgment, modulated via core/cache interactions and buffer controls, effectively synchronizing and managing transitions and data integrity across operations. The comprehensive utilization of state-dependent controls, buffering schemes, and request/response handling ensures effective and robust data management over the Wishbone bus.",

It handles various types of data operations, including read and write exchanges and exclusive access requests. The module operates through different states to manage bus cycles, acknowledge signals, and handle exclusive and burst transfers, ensuring proper data management and communication over the Wishbone bus. Additionally, it provides support for caching mechanisms, verifying and controlling data exchanges based on cache needs. The Wishbone state machine within the module transitions through stages, such as idle, burst transfers, and a waiting state for acknowledgements, to effectively manage and synchronize data transfers according to the protocol requirements."

The input ports include i_clk (system clock), i_select (activate module for bus requests), i_write_data (data for writing operations), i_write_enable (enables write operation), i_byte_enable (activates specific data bytes), i_data_access, i_exclusive (exclusive access control), i_address (memory or resource address), and i_cache_req (indicates cache controller requests), along with Wishbone status signals i_wb_dat, i_wb_ack, and i_wb_err. The output ports include o_stall (signals processing halt for ongoing bus operations), o_wb_adr (target address on the Wishbone bus), o_wb_sel (active data byte selector), o_wb_we (write operation enabler on the bus), o_wb_dat (data to the bus), o_wb_cyc (indicates active bus cycle), and o_wb_stb (signals active bus data transfer). Internally, the module leverages signals such as wishbone_st (state control), core/cache read/write requests, start_access (initiates bus access), servicing_cache, byte_enable, exclusive_access, read_ack, wait_write_ack, wb_wait, and buffer registers wbuf_addr_r, wbuf_sel_r, wbuf_busy_r, managing transactions and buffering outputs. The code architecture reflects a state machine handling various states including idle, burst phases, wait for acknowledgment, modulated via core/cache interactions and buffer controls, effectively synchronizing and managing transitions and data integrity across operations. The comprehensive utilization of state-dependent controls, buffering schemes, and request/response handling ensures effective and robust data management over the Wishbone bus."

It handles various types of data operations, including read and write exchanges and exclusive access requests. The module operates through different states to manage bus cycles, acknowledge signals, and handle exclusive and burst transfers, ensuring proper data management and communication over the Wishbone bus. Additionally, it provides support for caching mechanisms, verifying and controlling data exchanges based on cache needs. The Wishbone state machine within the module transitions through stages, such as idle, burst transfers, and a waiting state for acknowledgements, to effectively manage and synchronize data transfers according to the protocol requirements."

The input ports include i_clk (system clock), i_select (activate module for bus requests), i_write_data (data for writing operations), i_write_enable (enables write operation), i_byte_enable (activates specific data bytes), i_data_access, i_exclusive (exclusive access control), i_address (memory or resource address), and i_cache_req (indicates cache controller requests), along with Wishbone status signals i_wb_dat, i_wb_ack, and i_wb_err. The output ports include o_stall (signals processing halt for ongoing bus operations), o_wb_adr (target address on the Wishbone bus), o_wb_sel (active data byte selector), o_wb_we (write operation enabler on the bus), o_wb_dat (data to the bus), o_wb_cyc (indicates active bus cycle), and o_wb_stb (signals active bus data transfer). Internally, the module leverages signals such as wishbone_st (state control), core/cache read/write requests, start_access (initiates bus access), servicing_cache, byte_enable, exclusive_access, read_ack, wait_write_ack, wb_wait, and buffer registers wbuf_addr_r, wbuf_sel_r, wbuf_busy_r, managing transactions and buffering outputs. The code architecture reflects a state machine handling various states including idle, burst phases, wait for acknowledgment, modulated via core/cache interactions and buffer controls, effectively synchronizing and managing transitions and data integrity across operations. The comprehensive utilization of state-dependent controls, buffering schemes, and request/response handling ensures effective and robust data management over the Wishbone bus."
