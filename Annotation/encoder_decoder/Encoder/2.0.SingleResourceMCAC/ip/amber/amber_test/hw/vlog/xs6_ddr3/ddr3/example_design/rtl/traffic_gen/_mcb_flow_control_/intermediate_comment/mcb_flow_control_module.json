    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'mcb_flow_control' module manages command and data flows for a memory controller by synchronizing operations using a Finite State Machine (FSM). It processes input commands, addresses, and burst lengths, and generates appropriate control signals based on the command queue status and data path readiness. Internal states are handled through carefully designed state transitions in the FSM, ensuring effective read, write, and command wait operations in synchronization with memory demands."
