Module name: a25_fetch.

Module specification: The a25_fetch module is an integral part of a pipelined microprocessor architecture, specifically designed to handle the instruction fetch process. It interfaces with both instruction cache and external memory system to fetch instructions based on cachability, validity, and other control signals. The input ports include clk (clock signal for synchronization), reset (asynchronous reset), scan_enable and test_mode (for testing and debugging), stall signals (i_mem_stall, i_exec_stall, i_conflict) indicating various stalling conditions, i_system_rdy (system readiness), i_iaddress and i_iaddress_nxt (current and next instruction addresses), i_iaddress_valid (validity of the current instruction address), and cache-related signals (i_cache_enable, i_cache_flush, i_cacheable_area). The output ports are o_fetch_stall (indicating fetch process is stalled), o_fetch_instruction (fetched instruction ready for execution), o_wb_req (request signal for the wishbone bus), and o_wb_address (address signal for the wishbone bus). Key internal signals include core_stall (overall stall condition), cache_stall (stall signal from the cache module), cache_read_data128 and cache_read_data (128-bit and selected 32-bit data from cache), sel_cache (selection signal for fetching from cache), uncached_instruction_read (control for direct memory fetch), address_cachable (flag for address cachability), icache_wb_req (wishbone request due to cache miss), wait_wb (waiting for wishbone bus readiness), wb_req_r (registered wishbone request), and wb_rdata32 (aligned 32-bit data fetched from wishbone bus). The module encompasses several functional blocks: address checking and cachability determination, cache interaction logic, direct memory access handling when bypassing cache, and synchronization mechanism with external wishbone bus. The module effectively manages instruction fetching under various operational conditions ensuring smooth execution flow in the microprocessor pipeline.
