Module-level comment: /*
This module implements a complete Ethernet MAC, integrating MIIM, flow control, TX/RX processing, and Wishbone interfaces. It manages frame transmission/reception, flow control, address filtering, and status reporting. The design incorporates sub-modules for specific functions, uses clock domain crossing techniques, and supports various Ethernet features like full-duplex operation, pause frames, and programmable inter-frame gap.
