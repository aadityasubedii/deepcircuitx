Module-level comment: 
/*
 * This module implements a top-level wrapper for a memory controller block (MCB) interface.
 * It integrates AXI interfaces, MCB raw wrapper, and clock management components to support
 * up to 6 configurable ports. The module handles address translation, arbitration, and data
 * transfer between user interfaces and memory controller. It uses internal signals to connect
 * inputs/outputs with submodules and implements AXI-to-MCB conversion for enabled AXI ports.
