Module name: a23_cache. Module specification: The a23_cache module is a configurable cache memory system designed for CPU architectures. It manages data reading, writing, and exclusive access operations while interfacing with a wider memory system. The module features input ports for clock (i_clk), cache control signals (i_select, i_exclusive, i_cache_enable, i_cache_flush), data and address inputs (i_write_data, i_address, i_address_nxt), and Wishbone bus interface signals (i_wb_address, i_wb_read_data, i_wb_stall). Output ports include read data (o_read_data), stall signals (o_stall), and Wishbone bus request (o_wb_req). Internally, it utilizes signals for state management (c_state, source_sel), cache line handling (tag_rdata_
