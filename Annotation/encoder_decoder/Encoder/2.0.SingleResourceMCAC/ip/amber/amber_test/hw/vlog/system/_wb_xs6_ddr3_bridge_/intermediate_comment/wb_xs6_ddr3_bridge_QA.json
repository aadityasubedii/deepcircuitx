It manages data read/write transactions, ensuring proper data alignment and generation of necessary control signals. This bridge handles bus requests either write or read, prepares data for writing, or retrieves data for reading based on Wishbone transactions. It supports dynamic data width handling through parameterized inputs and manages synchronization and buffering procedures to cater to full or empty command and data queues respectively."
