It utilizes a DSP48A1 slice, commonly found in FPGA architectures, to efficiently execute these arithmetic operations. The output `o_sum` provides the result of the addition or subtraction, and `o_co` represents the carry-out from the operation. The configuration ensures scalability by accommodating different operand widths through the parameter `WIDTH`."

It is a bit-vector with a width defined by the parameter `WIDTH`.\n- i_b: This input port is the second operand, having the same width as `i_a` and serving a similar purpose in the arithmetic operations.\n- i_cin: Carry-in input, which is particularly utilized when performing chained arithmetic operations that require a carry input from a previous calculation.\n- i_sub: A control signal input that determines the operation mode. When high (logic 1), the circuit performs subtraction; when low (logic 0), it performs addition.\n\nOutput ports: [o_sum, o_co]. \nExplanation: \n- o_sum: The output sum port, which either holds the result of the addition of `i_a` and `i_b` (with potential carry-in) or the result of their subtraction, depending on the state of `i_sub`.

It combines the subtraction control signal `i_sub`, carry-in `i_cin`, and fixed values that determine how the DSP processes the inputs and generates the output. Specifically, it manages the arithmetic logic dependent on whether addition or subtraction is required, and it aids in deciding how carry-in and carry-out are handled.\n- in_a: This signal represents the extended input `i_a`. Since DSP slices typically operate on fixed-width data, `in_a` pads `i_a` to match the DSP slice's width of 48 bits, filling the upper bits with zeros if `WIDTH` is less than 48.\n- in_b: Similar to `in_a`, `in_b` extends the input `i_b` to 48 bits to be compatible with the expected width of the DSP slice operations. It follows the same padding methodology.\n- out: This signal receives the result of the DSP slice operation, which is then used to generate the module's respective outputs, `o_sum` and `o_co`. `out` carries the arithmetic results which include both the sum/subtraction result and any additional flags such as carry-out."
