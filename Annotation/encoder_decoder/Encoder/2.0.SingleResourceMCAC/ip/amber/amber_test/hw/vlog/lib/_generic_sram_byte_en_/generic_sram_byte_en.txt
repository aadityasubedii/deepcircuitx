Module-level comment: The "generic_sram_byte_en" module simulates a synchronous SRAM with byte-enable functionality, allowing selective byte writing or full data retrieval. It includes input handling for reset, clock, write control, data addressing, and byte masking. Internally, it uses an array, 'mem', with loop controls for initialization and byte-wise write iterations. Parameterizability enables flexible data and address sizing.
