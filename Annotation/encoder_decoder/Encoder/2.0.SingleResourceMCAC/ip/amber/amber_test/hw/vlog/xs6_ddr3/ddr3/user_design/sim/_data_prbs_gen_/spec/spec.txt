Module name: data_prbs_gen. 
Module specification: The "data_prbs_gen" module is designed to generate a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) mechanism. It consumes a clock input (`clk_i`), a clock enable signal (`clk_en`), a reset input (`rst_i`), a 32-bit fixed seed (`prbs_fseed_i`), a seed initialization trigger (`prbs_seed_init`), and a programmable seed (`prbs_seed_i`) that typically matches the width specified by `PRBS_WIDTH`. The generated PRBS, which is the current state of the LFSR, is output through `prbs_o`. Internally, the module employs a shift register (`lfsr_q`) to hold and manipulate the binary sequence, and a register (`prbs`) to store the PRBS output. The module operates in two main phases controlled by blocks of procedural code: initialization, triggered either by a reset or a seed initialization condition, and normal operation, which involves shifting and xoring the register bits when enabled by `clk_en`. These operations are all sensitive to the positive edge of the clock. An assignment statement links the internal state of the LFSR to the output port directly, ensuring the output always reflects the latest PRBS state without intermediary operations. With parameters allowing the customization of test conditions (`EYE_TEST`), propagation delay (`TCQ`), and seed widths, the module is well-suited for testing environments where the generation of random data patterns can verify digital circuit robustness and functionality.
