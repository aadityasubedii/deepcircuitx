Module name: iodrp_mcb_controller.

Module specification: The `iodrp_mcb_controller` module is designed to interface with a Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) and a memory cell block to control read and write operations. Input ports include an 8-bit `memcell_address` for determining the memory cell address, an 8-bit `write_data` for data to be written, a bit signal `rd_not_write` to choose between read or write mode, and a `cmd_valid` signal to initiate operations. It also includes a `use_broadcast` bit, a 5-bit `drp_ioi_addr` for DRP address, a synchronous reset `sync_rst`, and clock `DRP_CLK`. The outputs are an 8-bit `read_data` for the data read from the memory, a `rdy_busy_n` indicating module readiness, `DRP_CS` for DRP chip select, `DRP_SDI` for serial data input, `DRP_ADD` for address phase signaling, `DRP_BKST` related to broadcast operations, and `MCB_UIREAD` indicating a User Interface read operation. Internal signals include several registers like `memcell_addr_reg`, `data_reg`, and `shift_through_reg` for storing addresses, data, and aiding in data transfer operations respectively, among others such as `bit_cnt` for bit tracking, `state` and `nextstate` for FSM control. The module employs a finite state machine (FSM) to manage its operational states from ready to different phases of addressing and data handling, and it uses various tasks and conditional constructs to handle data shifts, expansions, and the DRP interfacing logic. This organized structure facilitates efficient memory interfacing within a DRP context including operations like selective shifts based on DRP addresses, synchronous reset management, and appropriate signaling during read/write phases.
