Module name: generic_sram_byte_en. 

Module specification: The "generic_sram_byte_en" is a Verilog module designed to simulate a generic synchronous Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) with byte-enable functionality. The core functionality of this module is to allow selective writing to specific bytes within a data word, controlled via the `i_byte_enable` signal. When the `i_write_enable` signal is high, the module writes the provided `i_write_data` into the addressed location specified by `i_address`, considering which bytes to update based on the `i_byte_enable` mask. If writing is not enabled, the current data at `i_address` is output to `o_read_data`. Input ports include `reset` for resetting the module, `clk` for clocking operations, `test_mode` and `scan_enable` along with `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` for potential future test purposes, and data-related signals `i_write_data`, `i_write_enable`, `i_address`, and `i_byte_enable`. The output ports consist of `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` for scan-based outputs and `o_read_data` for outputting SRAM data. Internal signals include the `mem` array to store SRAM data and integer loop variables `i` and `j` for managing byte-wise write operations and initialization, respectively. The code contains several blocks, primarily an `always` block sensitive to positive clock edges or the reset signal, which handles initialization, read, and byte-enabled write operations. This module is parameterizable by data width, address width, and initialization values, enhancing its adaptiveness to different data sizes and initial conditions.
