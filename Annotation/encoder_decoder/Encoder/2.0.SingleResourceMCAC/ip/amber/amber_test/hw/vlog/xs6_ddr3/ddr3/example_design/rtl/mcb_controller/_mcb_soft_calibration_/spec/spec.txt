Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), including initialization, termination calibration, and dynamic calibration of DQS signals. It implements a state machine that progresses through various calibration stages, such as setting termination values, adjusting DQS delays, and fine-tuning based on measured values. The module takes inputs like UI_CLK (clock), RST (reset), PLL_LOCK (PLL status), and various signals from the MCB and I/O devices. It outputs calibration status (DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL), control signals for I/O devices and MCB, and commands for adjusting DQS delays. Internal signals include STATE (current state of the calibration state machine), P_Term and N_Term (termination values), DQS_DELAY (current DQS
