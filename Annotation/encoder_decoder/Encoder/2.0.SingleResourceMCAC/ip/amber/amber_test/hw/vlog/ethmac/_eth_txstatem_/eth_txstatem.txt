Module-level comment: The 'eth_txstatem' module functions as a state machine for Ethernet packet transmission, controlling states like idle, IPG, preamble, data, PAD, FCS, jam, and backoff. It utilizes input signals related to network conditions and frame statuses to manage transitions between these states. Outputs indicate current states or trigger new state transitions. Internal logic ensures synchronization and compliance with Ethernet standards through careful state management and timing rules, reacting dynamically to network events and operational modes.
