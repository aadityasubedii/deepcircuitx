Module-level comment: The `a23_core` module serves as the central processing unit for managing instructions, memory, and interrupts within an embedded system. It integrates several submodules: `a23_fetch` for data fetching, `a23_decode` for instruction decoding, `a23_execute` for instruction execution, and `a23_coprocessor` for enhanced coprocessing and cache control. The module utilizes internal signals for data handling and state management and interfaces with the Wishbone bus for external communications, ensuring synchronized and effective system operations.
