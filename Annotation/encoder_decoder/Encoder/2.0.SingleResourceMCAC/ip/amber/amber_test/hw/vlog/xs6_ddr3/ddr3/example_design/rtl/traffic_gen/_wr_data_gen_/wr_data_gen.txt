Module-level comment: The "wr_data_gen" module generates data for memory write operations in FPGA configurations, particularly for "SPARTAN6" and "VIRTEX6". It supports variable data patterns (PRBS or fixed), configurable burst lengths, and address widths. Through conditional blocks and internal registers, this module sequences data outputs, synchronizing them with command readiness signals and FIFO control statuses. It utilizes specific submodules for FPGA families to ensure optimal performance tailored to the device characteristics.
