    "module": "Module-level comment: The `a25_register_bank` module manages register operations for different processor modes (User, IRQ, FIQ, etc.). It handles conditional data writes/reads, dynamically controls register content based on modes, and deals with system stalls. Using multiple input selectors and status flags, it determines the appropriate register outputs in real-time, adapting to execution and decoding states (like managing program counters and status registers). Functions are segmented into data handling, mode setting, and output assignments, clearly orchestrating complex register interactions efficiently."
