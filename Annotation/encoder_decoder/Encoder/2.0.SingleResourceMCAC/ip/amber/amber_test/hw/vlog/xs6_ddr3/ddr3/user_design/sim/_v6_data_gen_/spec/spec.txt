Module name: v6_data_gen. Module specification: This module generates data patterns for memory testing, supporting multiple modes including PRBS, address-based, walking 1's/0's, neighbor patterns, and fixed data. It takes inputs such as clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), PRBS seed (prbs_fseed_i), data mode selection (data_mode_i), and various control signals (e.g., cmd_start signals, addresses). The module outputs generated data (data_o) based on the selected mode and configuration. Internally, it uses signals like prbs_data for PRBS generation, acounts for address-based patterns, and various data registers (e.g., hdata, ndata, w1data) for different pattern types. The module is divided into sections for different data generation modes, implemented using generate blocks for various data widths. It includes logic for walking
