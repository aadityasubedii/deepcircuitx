    "spec": "Module name: boot_mem32. \n\nModule specification: The `boot_mem32` module is designed for memory handling interfacing through the Wishbone protocol, particularly for 32-bit data transactions which include data reading and writing operations. It supports configurable memory address widths and integrates both debugging and Xilinx-specific enhancements by conditional compilation flags. The module's input ports include `i_wb_clk` (clock synchronization), `i_wb_adr` (memory address specification), `i_wb_sel` (byte selection within the word), `i_wb_we` (write enable control), `i_wb_dat` (data for memory write operations), `i_wb_cyc` (representation of bus cycle progression), and `i_wb_stb` (strobe validation). The output ports are `o_wb_dat` (output data from memory reads), `o_wb_ack` (acknowledge signal for operation completion), and `o_wb_err` (error indication, static `0` as no error logic is incorporated). Internally, several signals such as `start_write`, `start_read`, `jitter_r`, `start_read_r`, `read_data`, `write_data`, `byte_enable`, and `address` govern operations like initiating reads/writes, debugging delays, data holding, and memory addressing. The Verilog code is split into blocks for configuring write and read initiations, debugging adjustments, error output configuration, memory I/O set up via sub-modules based on FPGA type, and under conditional scenarios, inclusion of particular configuration files. These combined elements make the `boot_mem32` module both a versatile and robust component within a hardware design, particularly for systems incorporating Wishbone-compatible memory management.",

This module manages data transactions with an external SRAM (either a specialized Xilinx FPGA SRAM or a generic SRAM depending on the conditional compilation flags present). It has parameters to specify the data width, selection width, and memory address width, and provides outputs indicating operation success or error. Debugging features are included to monitor and control operations like reads and writes, enhancing the visibility and reactivity to the bus states in real-time or simulation scenarios. Notably, the module is highly configurable based on the defined macros and includes special debugging and FPGA-specific configurations."

                    "text": "Module name: boot_mem32. \n\nModule specification: The `boot_mem32` module is designed for memory handling interfacing through the Wishbone protocol, particularly for 32-bit data transactions which include data reading and writing operations. It supports configurable memory address widths and integrates both debugging and Xilinx-specific enhancements by conditional compilation flags. The module's input ports include `i_wb_clk` (clock synchronization), `i_wb_adr` (memory address specification), `i_wb_sel` (byte selection within the word), `i_wb_we` (write enable control), `i_wb_dat` (data for memory write operations), `i_wb_cyc` (representation of bus cycle progression), and `i_wb_stb` (strobe validation). The output ports are `o_wb_dat` (output data from memory reads), `o_wb_ack` (acknowledge signal for operation completion), and `o_wb_err` (error indication, static `0` as no error logic is incorporated). Internally, several signals such as `start_write`, `start_read`, `jitter_r`, `start_read_r`, `read_data`, `write_data`, `byte_enable`, and `address` govern operations like initiating reads/writes, debugging delays, data holding, and memory addressing. The Verilog code is split into blocks for configuring write and read initiations, debugging adjustments, error output configuration, memory I/O set up via sub-modules based on FPGA type, and under conditional scenarios, inclusion of particular configuration files. These combined elements make the `boot_mem32` module both a versatile and robust component within a hardware design, particularly for systems incorporating Wishbone-compatible memory management."
