Module name: data_prbs_gen.
Module specification: The `data_prbs_gen` module in Verilog is designed to generate a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) utilizing a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) mechanism. This module operates on the positive edge of an input clock (`clk_i`) and offers configurability through parameters including the width of the PRBS and seed, as well as a test mode via the `EYE_TEST`. The inputs to this module comprise the clock signal (`clk_i`), a clock enable (`clk_en`), a reset signal (`rst_i`), a fixed 32-bit seed (`prbs_fseed_i`), a seed initialization trigger (`prbs_seed_init`), and a parameterizable seed input (`prbs_seed_i`). The output (`prbs_o`) delivers the PRBS generated by the module. Internal to the module, the `prbs` signal holds the sequence to be output, and `lfsr_q` acts as the shift register where bits are shifted and updated based on feedback logic defined by the LFSR algorithm. The primary procedural blocks include one for handling seed initialization and register reset operations, which conditionally loads values into the LFSR based on either the reset signal or the seed initialization trigger, and another for managing periodic updates to create the LFSR sequence when the clock enable signal is active. An additional always block responds to changes in the LFSR to update the PRBS output. This module facilitates controlled generation of pseudo-random sequences for testing and other applications requiring stochastic characteristics.
