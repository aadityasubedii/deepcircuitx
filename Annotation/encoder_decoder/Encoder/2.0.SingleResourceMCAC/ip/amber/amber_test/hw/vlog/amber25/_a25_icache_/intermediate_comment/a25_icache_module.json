    "module": "This module implements a configurable instruction cache for a processor, enhancing access speeds by storing frequently used instruction data. It manages cache operations including hit/miss detection, flushing, and refilling from a write buffer. The implementation uses parameterized cache ways, lines, and words per line, with separate tag and data RAMs for each way. It employs a state machine to control cache operations, handles cache misses by initiating refills, and uses a pseudo-random replacement policy when all ways are valid. The module also includes logic for address decoding, tag comparison, and data selection based on hit status."
