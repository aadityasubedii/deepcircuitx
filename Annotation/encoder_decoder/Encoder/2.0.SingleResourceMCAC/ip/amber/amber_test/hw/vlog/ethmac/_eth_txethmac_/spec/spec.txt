Module name: eth_txethmac. Module specification: The eth_txethmac module is designed as a transmitter component for an Ethernet MAC, handling the transmission and control of Ethernet frames with features such as error checking and collision handling. It takes multiple input signals such as MTxClk (transmit clock), Reset (reset signal), TxStartFrm (start of frame transmission signal), and TxData (data to be transmitted), among others, to control its operation according to the Ethernet protocol requirements. The outputs include MTxD (transmitted data), MTxEn (transmit enable signal), and various status indicators like TxDone (frame transmission completed) and TxRetry (retry transmission due to collision). Internally, the module uses signals like ExcessiveDeferOccurred, StartIPG, and StateIdle to manage different transmission states and sequence the process correctly. The module comprises different sections including state machines (eth_txstatem for handling various transmission states), counters (eth_txcounters for managing counts related to frame lengths and conditions), and functional blocks for CRC handling (eth_crc) and random backoff calculation (eth_random). Each section plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity and efficiency of data transmission, managing errors, and ensuring protocol adherence, facilitating a robust Ethernet communication environment.
