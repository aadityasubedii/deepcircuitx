It supports different configurations depending on the parameters such as `PRBS_CMD` and `PRBS_WIDTH`. The module outputs a PRBS sequence which can be used for various purposes including memory testing or data pattern generation in digital systems. It accommodates various operational modes by checking the input parameters and uses conditional compiling (`generate` blocks) to instantiate the appropriate LFSR architecture (e.g., for 32-bit or 64-bit widths). The module can be customized for different FPGA families and addresses through a set of parameterizable options."

When this signal is high, the PRBS generation process starts with the provided seed value `prbs_seed_i`.\n- `clk_en`: This is the clock enable signal. It allows the PRBS generator to update its state only when high, adding an additional control to pause the PRBS generation.\n- `prbs_seed_i`: This input port provides the initial seed value for the PRBS generator. The width of this input is defined by the `SEED_WIDTH` parameter.\n\nOutput ports: prbs_o.\nExplanation:\n- `prbs_o`: This is the output port where the PRBS sequence is available. The sequence is generated based on the LFSR configuration and its current state. The width of this output is equal to the `SEED_WIDTH` parameter."

The width of this register is defined by the `PRBS_WIDTH` parameter plus an extra bit to handle different configurations easily.
