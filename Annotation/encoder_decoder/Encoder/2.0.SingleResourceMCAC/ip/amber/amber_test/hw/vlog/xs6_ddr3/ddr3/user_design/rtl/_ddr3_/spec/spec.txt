Module name: ddr3. Module specification: The ddr3 module is a DDR3 memory controller interface designed to manage and interface with external DDR3 SDRAM. It supports multiple command, write, and read ports (labeled p0 through p5) for concurrent memory access operations. The module's input ports include system clock (c3_sys_clk), reset (c3_sys_rst_i), and command, write, and read interfaces for each port. Output ports consist of DDR3 address and control signals, data and data strobe signals, calibration status, and status signals for each port. Internal signals are used for clock management, reset control, and additional port interfaces. The module is structured with two main components: an infrastructure block for clock generation and management, and a memory controller wrapper (memc_wrapper) that handles the core DDR3 interface functionality. The memc_wrapper instantiates
