Module-level comment: The tb_uart module simulates a UART interface for data transmission and reception, checking for synchronization and errors. It uses input and output signals, internal state machines for transmit and receive logic, FIFO buffers for data storage, and clock signal operations. The module also supports loopback testing to validate internal data flows during simulation.
