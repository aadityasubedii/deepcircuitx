    "module": "This module implements a 1024x128-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA block RAM resources. It utilizes 8 RAMB16BWER primitives, each handling 32 bits of the 128-bit data width. The module supports read and write operations with a 10-bit address input, 128-bit data input/output, and 16-bit byte enable. It allows initialization of the SRAM contents through parameters and provides separate write enable signals for the upper and lower halves of the memory. The implementation uses a registered version of the 9th address bit to select between the two memory halves for read operations, matching the BRAM read latency."
