Module name: a23_coprocessor. Module specification: The `a23_coprocessor` module handles operations related to cache control and fault management for a computing system. It responds to input signals that dictate operations such as cache enabling/disabling, flushing, and defining cacheable areas, and it manages fault statuses and addresses when faults occur. Inputs include `i_clk` for synchronization, `i_fetch_stall` for operation pausing, operation code signals `i_copro_opcode1` and `i_copro_opcode2`, coprocessor-specific address and data signals like `i_copro_crn`, `i_copro_crm`, `i_copro_num`, `i_copro_operation`, and `i_copro_write_data`, and fault indication signals `i_fault`, `i_fault_status`, and `i_fault_address`. Outputs from the module are `o_copro_read_data` for coprocessor read operations, `o_cache_enable` for enabling the cache, `o_cache_flush` for cache flush control, and `o_cacheable_area` reflecting defined cacheable areas. Internally, the module employs several registers such as `cache_control` to manage cache settings, `cacheable_area` for areas where caching is allowed, and tracking registers like `fault_status` and `fault_address` for fault management. Critical to its operation, calculations and updates to internal states occur on the positive edge of `i_clk`, avoiding updates during fetch stalls. The module also includes detailed debug messages under a conditional compilation flag `A23_COPRO15_DEBUG`, which outlines step-by-step operations using display functions for tracing and verification purposes in development environments. This well-segmented design ensures modular and clear handling of various coprocessor functions effectively within a computing system.
