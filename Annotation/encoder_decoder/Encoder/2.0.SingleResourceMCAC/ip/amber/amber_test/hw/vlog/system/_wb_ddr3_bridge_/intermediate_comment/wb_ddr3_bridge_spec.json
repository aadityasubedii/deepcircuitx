The output ports are `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_ack`, `o_wb_err`, `o_cmd_en`, `o_cmd_instr`, `o_cmd_byte_addr`, `o_wr_en`, `o_wr_mask`, and `o_wr_data`, furnishing data to the Wishbone bus, transaction completion signals, and DDR3 command and data handling interfaces. Internal signals such as `start_write`, `start_read`, `start_write_d1`, `start_read_d1`, `start_read_hold`, `wb_adr_d1`, `ddr3_busy`, `read_ack`, and `read_ready` manage transaction initiations, synchronization, and status monitoring. The code includes multiple always blocks that function to synchronize and activate DDR3 commands, handle data writing with consideration to FPGA architecture specifics, manage read data synchronization, and maintain transaction integrity. Additionally, debug-only blocks provide insight into data handling during write and read operations for development and troubleshooting purposes.

The input ports include `i_clk`, `i_wb_adr`, `i_wb_sel`, `i_wb_we`, `i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_cyc`, `i_wb_stb`, `i_cmd_full`, `i_wr_full`, `i_rd_data`, and `i_rd_empty`, which provide the clock signal, address bus, byte select signals, write enable indicator, data inputs, transaction signals, and DDR3 memory status signals respectively. The output ports are `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_ack`, `o_wb_err`, `o_cmd_en`, `o_cmd_instr`, `o_cmd_byte_addr`, `o_wr_en`, `o_wr_mask`, and `o_wr_data`, furnishing data to the Wishbone bus, transaction completion signals, and DDR3 command and data handling interfaces. Internal signals such as `start_write`, `start_read`, `start_write_d1`, `start_read_d1`, `start_read_hold`, `wb_adr_d1`, `ddr3_busy`, `read_ack`, and `read_ready` manage transaction initiations, synchronization, and status monitoring. The code includes multiple always blocks that function to synchronize and activate DDR3 commands, handle data writing with consideration to FPGA architecture specifics, manage read data synchronization, and maintain transaction integrity. Additionally, debug-only blocks provide insight into data handling during write and read operations for development and troubleshooting purposes. This comprehensive design ensures robust interfacing and reliable data management between the Wishbone bus and DDR3 memory."
