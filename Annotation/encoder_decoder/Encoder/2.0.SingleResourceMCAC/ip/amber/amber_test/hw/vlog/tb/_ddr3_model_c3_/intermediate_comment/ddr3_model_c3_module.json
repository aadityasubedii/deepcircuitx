    "module": "Module-level comment: This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM memory device, implementing timing checks, command processing, and data read/write operations. It models the behavior of a DDR3 memory, including initialization, mode register settings, bank operations, and data transfer. The module uses internal pipelines and state trackers to manage commands, addresses, and data, while adhering to DDR3 timing specifications. It handles various DDR3 features such as burst operations, ODT, and power-down modes, providing a comprehensive simulation of DDR3 memory functionality."
