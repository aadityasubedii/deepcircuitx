Module name: test_module. Module specification: The "test_module" is a Verilog-based hardware block designed to interface with embedded systems using a Wishbone bus protocol, facilitating controlled, modular testing and interfacing. It supports interfacing through inputs such as i_clk (clock signal for synchronization), i_wb_adr (address bus for data targeting), i_wb_sel (byte lane selection), i_wb_we (write operation indicator), i_wb_dat (data bus for incoming data), i_wb_cyc (bus cycle indicator), and i_wb_stb (transfer validation signal). The outputs include o_irq (interrupt request), o_firq (fast interrupt request), o_mem_ctrl (memory control signal), o_wb_dat (output data bus), o_wb_ack (operation acknowledge), o_wb_err (error indicator), o_led (LED status output), and o_phy_rst_n (physical device reset). Internally, the module utilizes several registers and counters like firq_timer and irq_timer for interrupt management, random_num for RNG operations, and various others for UART control, memory control, test status, and simulation control. The design incorporates conditionally compiling blocks that handle data assignment based on the bus width and includes multiple always blocks that manage the logical operations, such as setting and clearing of timers, handling UART operations, random number generation, and state updates based on specific address-mapped write operations and triggers reflected by the address bus. This comprehensive setup allows for effective testing and operational flexibility within embedded system environments equipped with Wishbone compliance.
