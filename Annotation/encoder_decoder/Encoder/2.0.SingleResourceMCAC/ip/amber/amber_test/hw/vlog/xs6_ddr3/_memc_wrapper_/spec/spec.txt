Module name: memc_wrapper. Module specification: This module is a wrapper for a memory controller (MCB) interface, providing multiple ports (p0-p5) for command, write, and read operations to interact with memory. It also includes AXI interfaces (s0-s5) for communication with other system components. The module has numerous input ports including clock signals (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), reset (async_rst), and port-specific signals for command, write, and read operations. Output ports include memory interface signals (mcbx_dram_*), calibration status (calib_done), and port-specific status signals. Internal signals are used for configuration (C_MC_CALIBRATION_CLK_DIV, C_MEM_TZQINIT_MAXCNT), AXI interface parameters (C_S[0-5]_
