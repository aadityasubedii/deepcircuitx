    "module": "Module-level comment: The `eth_shiftreg` module functions as a shift register tailored for Ethernet interfacing, crucial for PHY configuration and data management. It utilizes input signals such as `Clk`, `Reset`, and `MdcEn_n` to control internal data shifting based on command flags like `ByteSelect` and `LatchByte`. This allows selective loading and shifting of data, with outputs that include the current shifted bit, processed data, and link failure status, effectively handling operations like data latching and error indication on edge-triggered conditions."
