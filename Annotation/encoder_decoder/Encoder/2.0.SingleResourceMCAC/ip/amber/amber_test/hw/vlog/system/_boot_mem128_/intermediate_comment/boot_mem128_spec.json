    "spec": "Module name: boot_mem128. Module specification: The `boot_mem128` module serves as a memory interface tailored for interfacing with a Wishbone bus, focusing on data transfers. This module supports read and write operations with an input clock (`i_wb_clk`), reset (`i_wb_rst`), address (`i_wb_adr`), byte selection signals (`i_wb_sel`), write enable (`i_wb_we`), data input (`i_wb_dat`), bus cycle (`i_wb_cyc`), and strobe (`i_wb_stb`). It outputs data (`o_wb_dat`), an acknowledgment signal (`o_wb_ack`), and a static error signal (`o_wb_err`, always set to 0 indicating no error handling). Internally, the module uses signals like `start_write` and `start_read` to control memory operations, utilizes `byte_enable` for selective data writing, and `address` to handle specific memory addressing. In debugging modes, `jitter_r` and `start_read_r` introduce artificial timing variations or delays. Configurable sections adapt the module for specific hardware or operational parameters. The memory is either an FPGA-specific configuration or a more generic setup, controlled through conditional compilation blocks. These blocks ensure flexibility across different hardware setups, such as Xilinx and generic FPGAs, supporting variations in memory configurations through included parameter files.",

It supports configurable data and address widths and has functionality to handle reads and writes to memory. The module implements support for byte enable signals, which allows for selective writing to specific bytes of the data bus. It also includes optional debug features that can introduce artificial delays (jitter) to simulate real-world conditions. Various conditional compilation blocks (`ifdef`) suggest that the module can be configured for different FPGA targets and setups, such as Xilinx FPGAs or using different boot memory parameters. The logic in the module handles the necessary handshaking and acknowledgment signals required for correctly interfacing with Wishbone compliant master devices."

It controls the timing of all operations within the module.\n- `i_wb_rst`: This is the reset signal. When asserted, it initializes or resets the module's internal state to a known state.\n- `i_wb_adr`: This is the Wishbone address bus input. It specifies the address for read or write operations.\n- `i_wb_sel`: These are the byte select inputs, used to specify which bytes of the data bus are active during a data transfer.\n- `i_wb_we`: This is the write enable signal. When high, it indicates a write operation; when low, a read operation.\n- `i_wb_dat`: This is the input data bus used for write operations to the memory.\n- `i_wb_cyc`: This is the cycle valid input. It indicates that a valid bus cycle is in progress.\n- `i_wb_stb`: This is the strobe input. It acts as a chip select indicating that the slave must respond to a data transfer.\n\nOutput ports:\n- o_wb_dat\n- o_wb_ack\n- o_wb_err\n\nExplanation:\n- `o_wb_dat`: This is the output data bus. It holds the data read from memory during read operations.\n- `o_wb_ack`: This is the acknowledge output. It indicates the successful completion of a read or write operation.\n- `o_wb_err`: This is the error output. It indicates an error occurred during the bus cycle. In the provided code, it is constantly set to 0, suggesting no error detection is implemented in this version of the module."

It is asserted when the Wishbone strobe signal (`i_wb_stb`) and write enable signal (`i_wb_we`) are active, and no read operation is currently underway.\n- `start_read`: This signal initiates a read operation from the memory. It is asserted when the Wishbone strobe signal (`i_wb_stb`) is active, the write enable signal (`i_wb_we`) is inactive, and no ongoing read operation signal (`start_read_r`) is active.\n- `read_data`: This signal holds data that has been read from the memory. It is driven by the memory module connect to the output data bus (`o_wb_dat`).\n- `write_data`: This signal holds data to be written into the memory. It carries the data present on the input data bus (`i_wb_dat`).\n- `byte_enable`: This signal is used to enable specific bytes of the data bus during a write operation, based on the `i_wb_sel` input.\n- `address`: The signal that holds the memory address derived from the address bus input (`i_wb_adr`). It is adjusted to match the memory address width.\n- `start_read_r`: This is a delayed or registered version of `start_read`. It is used to handle read acknowledgments properly, providing temporal control over read operations under normal and debugging modes.\n- `jitter_r`: Used only in debug mode, this signal introduces artificial timing variations, simulating jitter in read operations to test robustness or for debug purposes. Under debug configurations, this register cycles through pseudo-random values to alter the read operation timing."

Module specification: The `boot_mem128` module serves as a memory interface tailored for interfacing with a Wishbone bus, focusing on data transfers. This module supports read and write operations with an input clock (`i_wb_clk`), reset (`i_wb_rst`), address (`i_wb_adr`), byte selection signals (`i_wb_sel`), write enable (`i_wb_we`), data input (`i_wb_dat`), bus cycle (`i_wb_cyc`), and strobe (`i_wb_stb`). It outputs data (`o_wb_dat`), an acknowledgment signal (`o_wb_ack`), and a static error signal (`o_wb_err`, always set to 0 indicating no error handling). Internally, the module uses signals like `start_write` and `start_read` to control memory operations, utilizes `byte_enable` for selective data writing, and `address` to handle specific memory addressing. In debugging modes, `jitter_r` and `start_read_r` introduce artificial timing variations or delays. Configurable sections adapt the module for specific hardware or operational parameters. The memory is either an FPGA-specific configuration or a more generic setup, controlled through conditional compilation blocks. These blocks ensure flexibility across different hardware setups, such as Xilinx and generic FPGAs, supporting variations in memory configurations through included parameter files."
