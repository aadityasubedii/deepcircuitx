    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"eth_rxethmac\" module processes Ethernet frames based on incoming data (MRxD) synchronized by MRxClk. It checks data integrity using CRC, considering control inputs like MaxFL for frame size and MAC for address filtering. It operates through functional blocks such as state management ('eth_rxstatem'), byte counting ('eth_rxcounters'), and address validation ('eth_rxaddrcheck'), effectively managing frame reception, alignment, and error checking, crucial for reliable network data communication."
