    "spec": "Module name: generic_sram_byte_en. \n\nModule specification: The \"generic_sram_byte_en\" is a Verilog module designed to simulate a generic synchronous Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) with byte-enable functionality. The core functionality of this module is to allow selective writing to specific bytes within a data word, controlled via the `i_byte_enable` signal. When the `i_write_enable` signal is high, the module writes the provided `i_write_data` into the addressed location specified by `i_address`, considering which bytes to update based on the `i_byte_enable` mask. If writing is not enabled, the current data at `i_address` is output to `o_read_data`. Input ports include `reset` for resetting the module, `clk` for clocking operations, `test_mode` and `scan_enable` along with `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` for potential future test purposes, and data-related signals `i_write_data`, `i_write_enable`, `i_address`, and `i_byte_enable`. The output ports consist of `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` for scan-based outputs and `o_read_data` for outputting SRAM data. Internal signals include the `mem` array to store SRAM data and integer loop variables `i` and `j` for managing byte-wise write operations and initialization, respectively. The code contains several blocks, primarily an `always` block sensitive to positive clock edges or the reset signal, which handles initialization, read, and byte-enabled write operations. This module is parameterizable by data width, address width, and initialization values, enhancing its adaptiveness to different data sizes and initial conditions.",

It allows for selective writing to specific bytes within a data word based on the `i_byte_enable` signal. When a write enable (`i_write_enable`) is signaled, the module updates specific bytes of the memory at the address `i_address` with the data from `i_write_data` corresponding to the enabled bytes. The bytes that are enabled for writing are determined by the `i_byte_enable` mask. If writing is not enabled, the module outputs the current data stored at the address `i_address` to `o_read_data`. Additionally, there's functionality to reset the memory content to all zeros or all ones, which can be controlled through the `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO` parameter."

It is provided in the port list but not used in the current implementation.\n- `scan_enable`: Used for scan-based testing, enabling the scan chain mechanism.\n- `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`: Input scan chain signals, likely used for test purposes such as shifting in test data or control bits.\n- `i_write_data`: Data to be written into the SRAM.\n- `i_write_enable`: Enable signal to allow writing to the SRAM.

Each address in this memory can store a bit-width equal to `DATA_WIDTH`, and it can be selectively modified by byte based on the `i_byte_enable` signal during write operations.\n  \n- `i`: A loop variable used in the sequential logic to cycle through each byte segment of the data word (`DATA_WIDTH/8`) when handling byte-enabled write operations. It helps in iterating over byte-sized segments to apply individual byte enable logic.\n  \n- `j`: A loop variable used primarily during the reset condition when the entire `mem` array needs to be initialized.

If writing is not enabled, the current data at `i_address` is output to `o_read_data`. Input ports include `reset` for resetting the module, `clk` for clocking operations, `test_mode` and `scan_enable` along with `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` for potential future test purposes, and data-related signals `i_write_data`, `i_write_enable`, `i_address`, and `i_byte_enable`. The output ports consist of `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` for scan-based outputs and `o_read_data` for outputting SRAM data. Internal signals include the `mem` array to store SRAM data and integer loop variables `i` and `j` for managing byte-wise write operations and initialization, respectively. The code contains several blocks, primarily an `always` block sensitive to positive clock edges or the reset signal, which handles initialization, read, and byte-enabled write operations. This module is parameterizable by data width, address width, and initialization values, enhancing its adaptiveness to different data sizes and initial conditions."
