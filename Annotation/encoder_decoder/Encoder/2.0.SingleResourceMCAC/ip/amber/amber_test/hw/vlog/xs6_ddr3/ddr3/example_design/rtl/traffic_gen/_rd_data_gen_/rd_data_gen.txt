Module-level comment: The 'rd_data_gen' module automates data transactions synced with command input for various FPGA families. It processes commands based on their validity, fixed data inputs, addressing, and burst requirements, utilizing internal logic and registers to manage data flow and transaction timings. Its architecture is adaptable via parameterization to support different data patterns and operational modes, optimized for 'SPARTAN6' and 'VIRTEX6' families, ensuring efficient data generation and handling as per system demands.
