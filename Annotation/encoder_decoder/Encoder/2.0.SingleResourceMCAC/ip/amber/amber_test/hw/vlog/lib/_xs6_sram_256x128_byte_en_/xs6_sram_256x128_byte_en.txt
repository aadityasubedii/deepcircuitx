Module-level comment: The xs6_sram_256x128_byte_en module is a 128-bit wide, 256-entry SRAM with byte-level write enable functionality. It uses synchronous operation with i_clk, handling reads and writes via distinct signals and data paths. Internally, it employs four RAMB8BWER blocks configured for dual-port operation to enable selective byte updates and read operations, ensuring flexible and efficient data management. The initial block verifies parameter settings to maintain design integrity.
