Module name: a25_dcache. Module specification: The a25_dcache module implements a configurable data cache for a processor, supporting multiple ways (2, 3, 4, or 8) and handling read/write operations, cache misses, cache fills, and exclusive accesses. It uses a random replacement policy when all ways are valid. The module has input ports for clock, reset, cache control signals, memory requests, and write-back data, and output ports for read data, stall signals, and write-back requests. Internal signals manage cache state, way selection, tag and data memory access, hit detection, and cache operations. The module is organized into several blocks, including cache initialization, core access handling, cache fill operations, write-hit processing, and exclusive access management. It utilizes tag and data RAM blocks for each way, implements a finite state machine for cache control, and includes logic for address decoding, data selection,
