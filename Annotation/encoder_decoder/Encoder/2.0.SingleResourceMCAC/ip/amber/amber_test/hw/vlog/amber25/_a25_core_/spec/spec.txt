Module name: a25_core. 
Module specification: The 'a25_core' module represents the central processing unit (CPU) core of an ARM architecture designed to handle instruction and data processing through a pipelined architecture. This module interfaces with external components using the Wishbone bus protocol, managing instructions and data transactions. The input ports include 'clk' (clock signal for synchronization), 'reset' (system reset), scanning inputs ('scan_in0' to 'scan_in4'), scan and test controls ('scan_enable', 'test_mode'), interrupt requests ('i_irq', 'i_firq'), system readiness ('i_system_rdy'), and Wishbone data input ('i_wb_dat'). The output ports consist of scan outputs ('scan_out0' to 'scan_out4'), Wishbone bus signals like address ('o_wb_adr'), select signal ('o_wb_sel'), write enable ('o_wb_we'), data output ('o_wb_dat'), cycle signal ('o_wb_cyc'), and strobe signal ('o_wb_stb'). Internal signals, prominently used for managing data flow and control within the CPU operations, include fetch, decode, execute addresses and control flags, status bits, multiplexer selectors, and signals for interaction with coprocessors and cache management. The module is segmented into several sub-modules including fetching ('a25_fetch'), decoding ('a25_decode'), execution ('a25_execute'), memory access ('a25_mem'), write-back stage ('a25_write_back'), Wishbone interface handling ('a25_wishbone'), and coprocessor interactions ('a25_coprocessor'), each responsible for distinct stages of the pipeline and specialized operations crucial for the processor's effective function and management of interrupts, data transactions, and execution states. This structured approach enables efficient data processing, control flow management, and interaction with peripheral devices completing the architecture of a robust CPU core in a system-on-chip (SoC).
