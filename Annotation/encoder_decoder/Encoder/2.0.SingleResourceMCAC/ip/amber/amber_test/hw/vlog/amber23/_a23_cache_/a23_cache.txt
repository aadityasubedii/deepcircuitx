Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable cache memory system for CPU architectures. It manages data reading, writing, and exclusive access operations using a state machine. The cache supports multiple ways, hit/miss detection, and cache line replacement. It interfaces with a Wishbone bus for memory transactions and includes parameterizable cache size, line width, and number of ways. The module handles cache initialization, flushing, and maintains cache coherence through various states and control signals.
