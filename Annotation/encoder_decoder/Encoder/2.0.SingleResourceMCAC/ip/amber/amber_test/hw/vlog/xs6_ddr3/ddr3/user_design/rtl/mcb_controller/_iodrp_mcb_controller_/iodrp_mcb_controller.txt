Module-level comment: The `iodrp_mcb_controller` module manages read and write operations to a DRP and memory cell block using an FSM. It handles different phases of memory access through a series of input and output ports, internal registers, and conditional constructs. Key operations include data address selection, bit tracking, conditional DRP interfacing, and state transitions based on inputs like `cmd_valid` and `sync_rst`, ensuring efficient and synchronized data transactions.
