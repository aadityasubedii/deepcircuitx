    "module": "Module-level comment: The `dumpvcd` module manages VCD data for Amber processor simulations, focusing on selective debugging. It lacks input/output ports, functioning with internal signals `U_DECOMPILE.clk_count` and `U_DECOMPILE.i_clk` for operational timing. Initial blocks setup VCD parameters and files under conditional compilation, while always blocks, triggered on clock edges, control VCD logging at specified simulation times, also handling possible simulation termination based on predefined conditions."
