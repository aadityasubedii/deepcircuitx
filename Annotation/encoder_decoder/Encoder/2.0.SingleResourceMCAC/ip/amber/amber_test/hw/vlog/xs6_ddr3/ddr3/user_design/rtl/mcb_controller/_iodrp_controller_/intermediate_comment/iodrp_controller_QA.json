It supports read and write operations based on the control signals provided. The controller handles address setup, data transfer, and captures read data in various states orchestrated by a finite state machine (FSM). Output signals such as DRP_CK, DRP_CS, DRP_SDI, and DRP_ADD control the timing and data flow to and from the memory cell. The module operates synchronously with a provided DRP_CLK signal and accommodates synchronization resets through the sync_rst signal. Additionally, it internally manages signaling for both address and data phases and decides the transition between ready, decide, address, and data phases dependent on command validity and operation type (read/write)."
