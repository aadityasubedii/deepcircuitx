    "module": "This module implements a top-level interface for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) supporting multiple ports and AXI interfaces. It integrates a raw MCB wrapper, AXI interfaces, and port configurations to handle memory operations and arbitration between up to 6 ports. The module uses a BUFPLL_MCB component for clock management, generates internal signals to connect the mcb_raw_wrapper with either native MCB or AXI interfaces, and includes logic for calibration and status reporting. It supports various memory types and configurations, allowing flexible integration with different system requirements."
