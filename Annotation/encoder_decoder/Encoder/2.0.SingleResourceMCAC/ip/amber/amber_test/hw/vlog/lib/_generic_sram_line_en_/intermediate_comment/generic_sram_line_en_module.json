    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'generic_sram_line_en' module implements an SRAM interface with additional scan chain and initialization functionality. It features reading and writing data operations controlled via `clk` and resettable memory based on `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO`. Supports test modes with scan inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`) and outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`). Memory operations at specific addresses are enabled by `i_write_data`, `i_write_enable`, and `i_address`. Internal `mem` array stores data, initialized and accessed through control-specific logic."
