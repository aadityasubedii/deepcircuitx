    "spec": "Module name: a25_barrel_shift. \nModule specification: The 'a25_barrel_shift' module is designed to perform various barrel shifting operations on a 32-bit input data signal ('i_in'), influenced by the type of shift ('i_function') and the shift magnitude ('i_shift_amount'). It operates in either a quick or full mode, which is determined by the shift amount and internal control logic. Input ports include 'clk' (for synchronizing operations), 'reset' (to initialize module states), 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' (for testing purposes), 'i_in' (32-bit input data), 'i_carry_in' (input carry), 'i_shift_amount', 'i_shift_imm_zero' (a control signal), and 'i_function' (shift type). Output ports consist of 'o_out' (output data), 'o_carry_out' (output carry), and 'o_stall' (indicates stall condition). Internal signals are 'quick_out' and 'quick_carry_out' (fast mode outputs), 'full_out' and 'full_carry_out' (full mode outputs), with 'full_out_r' and 'full_carry_out_r' serving as registers to store these values under certain conditions, and 'use_quick_r' (a control signal to select between quick and full modes). The module contains instances of 'a25_shifter' configured differently for quick and full operations. The outputs and operational mode are controlled through sequential logic based on the clock or reset conditions, enabling efficient data handling and processing based on the operational needs and stall status.",

It can handle various types of shifts (e.g., left, right, arithmetic, or circular shifts) determined by 'i_function'. The shift operation's amount is specified by 'i_shift_amount'. The module can operate in either a quick or full mode, selected based on shift amount and control signals. The output of the operation is given in 'o_out', and any carry-out from a shift is indicated in 'o_carry_out'. Additionally, the module can indicate a stall condition through 'o_stall', suggesting it is temporarily unable to proceed with operations, which occurs when more significant shifts are requested in quick mode. The module integrates two instances of another module 'a25_shifter', each configured differently for the full or quick operation. The appropriate result is latched and output based on the stall status and operational mode."
