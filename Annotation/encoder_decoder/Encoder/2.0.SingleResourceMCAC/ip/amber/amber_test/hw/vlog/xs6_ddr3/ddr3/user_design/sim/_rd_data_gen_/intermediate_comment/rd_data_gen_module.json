    "module": "Module-level comment: The `rd_data_gen` module generates read data for memory simulations, adaptable for FPGA families like SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6. It processes commands based on configurations such as data mode and burst length, using internal logic and submodules (`sp6_data_gen`, `v6_data_gen`) conditioned on FPGA type. Key controls include command validation, data readiness synchronization, and output data validity, managed through internal states and registers."
