Module-level comment: The `eth_maccontrol` module manages Ethernet MAC layer frame transmission and reception, synchronizing with separate transmit and receive clocks. It processes frame control signals to initiate, abort, or complete transmissions, utilizing internal logic and registers like `TxUsedDataOutDetected` and `MuxedDone`. Functionalities are divided across `eth_receivecontrol` and `eth_transmitcontrol` sub-modules for handling respective directional operations, ensuring robust and efficient frame management.
