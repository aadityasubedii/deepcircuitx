Module-level comment: The 'afifo' module is an asynchronous FIFO buffer designed for safe data transfer across different clock domains. It operates with separate read and write clocks, uses Gray code pointers to minimize synchronization errors, and handles data size and depth through configurable parameters. The FIFO provides full, empty, and almost_full flags for status monitoring, and integrates pointer synchronization and data management logic within separate clock domains.
