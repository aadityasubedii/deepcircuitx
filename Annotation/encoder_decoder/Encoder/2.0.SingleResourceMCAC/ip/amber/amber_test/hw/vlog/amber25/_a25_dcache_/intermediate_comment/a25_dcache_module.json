    "module": "This module implements a configurable data cache for a processor, supporting multiple ways and handling various cache operations. It utilizes tag and data RAM blocks for each way, implements a finite state machine for cache control, and includes logic for address decoding, data selection, and hit detection. The module manages read/write operations, cache misses, fills, and exclusive accesses, employing a random replacement policy when all ways are valid. It interfaces with the processor and memory system through input/output ports for data, control signals, and status information."
