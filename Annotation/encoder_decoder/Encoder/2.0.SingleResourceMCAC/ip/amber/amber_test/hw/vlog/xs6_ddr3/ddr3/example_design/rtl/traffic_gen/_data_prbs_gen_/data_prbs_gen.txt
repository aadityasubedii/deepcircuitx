Module-level comment: The `data_prbs_gen` module generates a pseudo-random binary sequence using a parameterizable LFSR. It operates on a clock's positive edge, handling seed initialization and resets to configure the LFSR state. Controlled by clock enable, it updates its sequence through shifting and feedback-based logic defined within the LFSR mechanism. Outputs the PRBS for use in stochastic testing environments or other applications needing random sequences.
