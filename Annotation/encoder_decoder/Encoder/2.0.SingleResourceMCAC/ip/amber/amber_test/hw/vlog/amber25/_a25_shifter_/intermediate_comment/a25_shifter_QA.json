Depending on the type of shift operation specified by `i_function`, the module can execute logical shift left (LSL), logical shift right (LSR), arithmetic shift right (ASR), or rotate right (ROR). The specific shift operation and its behavior, such as the number of positions to shift, are determined by other inputs like `i_shift_amount` and `i_shift_imm_zero`. This module supports both full-barrel and quick shift mechanisms, toggled by the `FULL_BARREL` parameter. This allows for either detailed or quick shifting, controlling the preciseness and speed of the shift operations."

It is computed based on the input `i_in`, the carry input `i_carry_in`, and the shift amount `i_shift_amount`. The carry in might be incorporated into the shifted result depending on the conditions specified by `i_shift_imm_zero` and `i_shift_amount`.\n- `lsr_out`: This is the result of the logical shift right (LSR) operation. Similar to `lsl_out`, it uses `i_in`, `i_carry_in`, and `i_shift_amount` to compute the output, potentially integrating the carry input into the MSB of the result based on the shift directive given. \n- `asr_out`: This signal captures the output from the arithmetic shift right (ASR) operation. It differs from `lsr_out` by considering the sign bit of `i_in` (MSB) to fill the vacated bit positions, thus preserving the signedness of the number during right shifts.\n- `ror_out`: This signal holds the output from the rotate right (ROR) operation. It rotates the bits of `i_in` to the right by the amount specified in `i_shift_amount`, where the bits that are shifted out on the right are reinserted on the left side, effectively creating a circular shift."
