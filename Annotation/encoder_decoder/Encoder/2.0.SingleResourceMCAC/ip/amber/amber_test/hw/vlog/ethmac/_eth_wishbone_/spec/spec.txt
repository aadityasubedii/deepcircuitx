Module name: eth_wishbone. Module specification: The eth_wishbone module is an Ethernet Wishbone interface controller that manages communication between the Ethernet MAC and the Wishbone bus for both transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) operations. It handles data flow, buffer management, and status handling for Ethernet frames. The module has numerous input ports including clocks (WB_CLK_I, MTxClk, MRxClk), data inputs (WB_DAT_I, RxData), control signals (Reset, TxRetry, RxValid), and configuration inputs (r_TxEn, r_RxEn). Output ports include data outputs (WB_DAT_O, TxData), control signals (WB_ACK_O, TxStartFrm), and interrupt signals (TxB_IRQ, RxB_IR
