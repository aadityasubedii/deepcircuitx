    "spec": "Module name: a25_write_back. \nModule specification: The 'a25_write_back' module is essential for the write-back stage of a processor pipeline, designed for capturing and registering memory read data, its validity, and the destination register address, ensuring data integrity in subsequent pipeline stages. The module has several input ports including 'clk' (clock signal for synchronization), 'reset' (asynchronous reset signal), 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' (for diagnostic purposes), 'i_mem_stall' (pipeline stall signal), 'i_mem_read_data' (data read from memory), 'i_mem_read_data_valid' (validity of the read data), 'i_mem_load_rd' (destination register for the data), 'i_daddress' (data address), and 'i_daddress_valid' (validity of the data address). The output ports are 'o_wb_read_data' (outputted memory read data), 'o_wb_read_data_valid' (validity of the outputted data), and 'o_wb_load_rd' (outputted destination register). Internally, the module uses registers like 'mem_read_data_r', 'mem_read_data_valid_r', and 'mem_load_rd_r' to hold the memory read data, its validity, and destination register respectively, across clock cycles. Additionally, 'daddress_r' is used to store the data address being accessed. The Verilog code primarily includes blocks for conditional data updates and resets, ensuring stable and accurate write-back operations in response to the 'reset', 'clk', and 'i_mem_stall' signals, facilitating efficient synchronization and data handling in the processor pipeline.",

It captures and registers memory read data, validity of the data, and the load register destination, passing these outputs to the next stage of the pipeline. Specifically, when the module is not stalled (`i_mem_stall` is low) and there is no reset, it transfers the incoming memory read data (`i_mem_read_data`), its validity (`i_mem_read_data_valid`), and the load register destination (`i_mem_load_rd`) into internal registers. These values are then outputted through `o_wb_read_data`, `o_wb_read_data_valid`, and `o_wb_load_rd` respectively. Additionally, it registers a data address (`i_daddress`) when not stalled. The functionality ensures data integrity and synchronization in the pipeline during the write-back operations."

If high, it prevents updating of internal registers with new data.\n- i_mem_read_data: The actual data read from memory, transferred to this module during the write-back phase.\n- i_mem_read_data_valid: Indicates whether the `i_mem_read_data` is valid and can be used safely.\n- i_mem_load_rd: The destination register address where `i_mem_read_data` should be stored.\n- i_daddress: Data address from which the data is being read.\n- i_daddress_valid: Indicates whether the `i_daddress` is valid.\n\nOutput ports: o_wb_read_data, o_wb_read_data_valid, o_wb_load_rd.\nExplanation:\n- o_wb_read_data: Outputs the data read from memory, which has been latched in internal registers, to be used in subsequent stages of the pipeline.\n- o_wb_read_data_valid: Indicates the validity of the data presented at `o_wb_read_data`, based on the validity of the data when it was input to the module.\n- o_wb_load_rd: Outputs the destination register address for the data provided on `o_wb_read_data`, passing it to the subsequent pipeline stage."
