It consists of four 2048x8-bit RAM blocks, each handling one byte of the 32-bit data width. The module supports read and write operations with byte-level write enables, allowing selective writing to individual bytes within a 32-bit word. The SRAM can be initialized with predefined values using the SRAM[0-3]_INIT_[0-63] parameters. The design uses a read-first write mode and operates on a single clock domain."
