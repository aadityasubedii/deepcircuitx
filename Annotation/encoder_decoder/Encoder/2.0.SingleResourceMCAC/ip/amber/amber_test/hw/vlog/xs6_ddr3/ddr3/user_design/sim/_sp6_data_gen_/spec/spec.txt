Module name: sp6_data_gen. Module specification: The sp6_data_gen module is designed to generate various data patterns for testing and verification purposes. It supports multiple data widths (32, 64, or 128 bits) and can produce patterns such as fixed data, address-based, alternating 'hammer', pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS), and 'walking' patterns. The module takes inputs including clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), data mode selector (data_mode_i), address (addr_i), and various control signals. It outputs the generated data pattern through data_o. Internal signals include registers for different pattern types (prbs_data, adata, hdata, ndata, w1data) and control flags (burst_count_reached2, data_valid). The module is divided into sections for different data widths and pattern types, using generate blocks to condit
