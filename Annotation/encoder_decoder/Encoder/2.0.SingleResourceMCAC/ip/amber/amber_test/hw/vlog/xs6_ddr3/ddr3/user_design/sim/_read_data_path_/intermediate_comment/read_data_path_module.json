    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'read_data_path' module efficiently manages data read operations for FPGA systems, adapting to configurations like VIRTEX6 and SPARTAN6. Inputs trigger data synchronization and command processing, while outputs signal command readiness and error states. Internally, it leverages structures like FIFOs for data flow management and employs comparative checks for accuracy assurance. The organized sections address command readiness, data generation, and error tracking, crucial for systems requiring precise and reliable memory management."
