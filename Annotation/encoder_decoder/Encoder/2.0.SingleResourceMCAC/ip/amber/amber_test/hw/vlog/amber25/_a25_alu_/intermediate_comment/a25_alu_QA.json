It features selectable operations such as addition, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, sign-extend, and zero-extend operations, based on the control values provided through `i_function`. The module can also handle input carries and select output carries, directly catering to operations that depend on the status of previous calculations, like chained arithmetic operations. Resulting data is output on `o_out`, and specific flags related to the output (carry out, zero, negative, overflow) are set in `o_flags`. This ALU supports conditional configurations to accommodate different FPGA architectures, such as XILINX SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6."
