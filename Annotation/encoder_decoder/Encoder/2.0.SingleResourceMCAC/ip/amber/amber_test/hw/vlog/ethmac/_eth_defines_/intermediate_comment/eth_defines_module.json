    "module": "Module-level comment: The ETH_DEFINES configuration file centralizes constants, defaults, and macros for Ethernet modules in Verilog design. It defines address mappings, control parameters, and bit widths for Ethernet settings, enabling efficient, centralized configuration and simplifying system-wide updates. Important macros facilitate the handling of memory-mapped I/O, ensuring smooth operations across various Ethernet system components without defining actual input/output ports or internal signals."
