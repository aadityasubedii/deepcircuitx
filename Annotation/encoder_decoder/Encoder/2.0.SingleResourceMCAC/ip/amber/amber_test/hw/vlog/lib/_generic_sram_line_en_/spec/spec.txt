Module name: generic_sram_line_en. 

Module specification: The 'generic_sram_line_en' is a Verilog module designed to interface with Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) incorporating additional line-enable functionality tailored for scan chain testing and initialization configurations. This module supports basic read and write operations controlled via a clock signal (`clk`) and can be reset (`reset`) to initialize memory either to all zeros or ones based on the `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO` parameter. The module handles test modes (`test_mode`) and scan chains (`scan_enable`, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`) that facilitate testing on chips with serialized data inputs and outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`). Data operations are enabled through `i_write_data` for writing data, `i_write_enable` for enabling the write operation, and `i_address` for specifying the target address. Data read operations output to `o_read_data`. Internally, the module uses a memory array `mem` for storage, which can be accessed or modified based on the `i_address` location. Also, an integer `i` is used for iterating memory addresses during initialization. The logic inside the module is driven by the clock (`clk`), where on reset, the memory is initialized as defined, while during normal operation, read and write functionalities are executed based on the input control signals.
