    "spec": "Module name: a25_coprocessor. Module specification: The a25_coprocessor is designed to act as a control unit for cache operations and fault management in a computing environment, processing various control and operation codes to manage enabling, flushing, and defining cacheable areas of the cache, while also handling processor-specific controls and registers for fault statuses and addresses. It has multiple input ports including clk (clock), reset (reinitialization), scan_enable (scan mode for testing), test_mode, i_core_stall (core operation pausing), i_copro_opcode1 & i_copro_opcode2 (operation type), i_copro_crn, i_copro_crm, i_copro_num (register identifiers), i_copro_operation (operation type), i_copro_write_data (data for registers), i_fault (fault occurrence), i_fault_status (fault type), and i_fault_address (fault location). Output ports include o_copro_read_data (data from coprocessor), o_cache_enable (cache control), o_cache_flush (cache flushing), and o_cacheable_area (definition of cacheable memory regions). Internal signals such as cache_control (cache operations), cacheable_area (memory areas that are cacheable), updateable_area, disruptive_area (special memory regions), fault_status, fault_address, and copro15_reg1_write (writing control for a specific register) support these functionalities. The Verilog code is structured into different always blocks and assigns specific to handling reset conditions, processing inputs based on stall and fault conditions, and managing cache and fault-related operations efficiently, all synchronized on the rising edge of the clock or a reset condition. Debug sections embedded within conditional compilation flags aid in tracing and monitoring operations during testing phases.",

                    "text": "Module name: a25_coprocessor. Module specification: The a25_coprocessor is designed to act as a control unit for cache operations and fault management in a computing environment, processing various control and operation codes to manage enabling, flushing, and defining cacheable areas of the cache, while also handling processor-specific controls and registers for fault statuses and addresses. It has multiple input ports including clk (clock), reset (reinitialization), scan_enable (scan mode for testing), test_mode, i_core_stall (core operation pausing), i_copro_opcode1 & i_copro_opcode2 (operation type), i_copro_crn, i_copro_crm, i_copro_num (register identifiers), i_copro_operation (operation type), i_copro_write_data (data for registers), i_fault (fault occurrence), i_fault_status (fault type), and i_fault_address (fault location). Output ports include o_copro_read_data (data from coprocessor), o_cache_enable (cache control), o_cache_flush (cache flushing), and o_cacheable_area (definition of cacheable memory regions). Internal signals such as cache_control (cache operations), cacheable_area (memory areas that are cacheable), updateable_area, disruptive_area (special memory regions), fault_status, fault_address, and copro15_reg1_write (writing control for a specific register) support these functionalities. The Verilog code is structured into different always blocks and assigns specific to handling reset conditions, processing inputs based on stall and fault conditions, and managing cache and fault-related operations efficiently, all synchronized on the rising edge of the clock or a reset condition. Debug sections embedded within conditional compilation flags aid in tracing and monitoring operations during testing phases."
