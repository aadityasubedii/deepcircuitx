Module name: cmd_prbs_gen. 

Module specification: The `cmd_prbs_gen` module is designed to generate pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) approach, configurable for various applications including address generation through parameters such as PRBS_CMD. The primary input ports include `clk_i` (the clock input), `prbs_seed_init` (a control signal for initializing the seed of the LFSR), `clk_en` (enables LFSR state update upon each clock cycle when high), and `prbs_seed_i` (the seed input for the LFSR). The output port `prbs_o` delivers the generated PRBS output. Internal signals such as `ZEROS` (a zero constant for reset states), `prbs` (the current PRBS state), and `lfsr_q` (the register embodying the shifting functionality of the LFSR) are pivotal in the moduleâ€™s operation. The module features multiple parameter-configurable generate blocks, which cater to different PRBS generation modes (like "ADDRESS", "INSTR", or "BLEN") and can handle different seed widths and PRBS length scenarios. For instance, in the "ADDRESS" mode, shift operations within `lfsr_q` are used to update `prbs` based on an exclusive OR (XOR) logic applied to selected tap positions, and the output `prbs` can be masked and adjusted depending on specific address configurations. Each different configuration leads to varied tap and feedback setups for the LFSR, ensuring flexibility in PRBS generation for different simulation requirements and hardware environments.
