    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"eth_macstatus\" module monitors the status of Ethernet MAC transactions, focusing on reception and transmission integrity. It processes input signals (e.g., data validity, errors, state flags) to manage outputs, which indicate transaction conditions such as CRC errors and collision detection. Implementation involves registers for latching errors, conditions evaluation through logic gates, and status updates based on dynamic network activity, ensuring reliable Ethernet communications by adhering to specific frame conditions and error management."
