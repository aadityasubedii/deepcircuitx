    "spec": "Module name: write_data_path. Module specification: The `write_data_path` module is designed to facilitate memory write operations, specifically in memory-related applications requiring robust data handling and command readiness features. It contains input ports such as `clk_i` (clock input), `rst_i` (reset vector with multiple reset signals), `cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_validB_i`, `cmd_validC_i` (command validation signals), `prbs_fseed_i` (seed for PRBS), `data_mode_i` (mode of data operation), `fixed_data_i` (fixed data for writing), `addr_i` (memory address), and `bl_i` (burst length). The output ports are `cmd_rdy_o` (command readiness), `data_valid_o` (data validity status), `last_word_wr_o` (indicator for last word written in a burst), `data_o` (data output), `data_mask_o` (mask for data handling, hardcoded to zero), and `data_wr_end_o` (signal for end of the write operation). Internal workings include the `data_valid` signal, indicating the validity of data from the `wr_data_gen` submodule, and the `cmd_rdy` register, tracking command readiness internally. The module encapsulates the `wr_data_gen` submodule that handles detailed data generation and command processing based on multiple input stimuli, producing the required outputs and processing the internal signals to maintain the flow of data in synchronization with external requests. The overall code structure ensures synchronicity, command processing, and efficient data management suitable for testing environments or advanced memory controllers.",

It integrates a submodule called `wr_data_gen` which generates data for writing based on a wide range of input parameters like command validation signals, a reset vector, data patterns, and others. The main module controls the readiness and validity of the output data (`data_valid_o`) triggered by an input signal indicating data readiness (`data_rdy_i`). It also manages the output data (`data_o`), determines when the last word is written (`last_word_wr_o`), and ensures proper data writing sequence via the `data_wr_end_o` signal. The data masking output is hardcoded to zero, simplifying the output data handling in scenarios where data masking isn't needed. This setup is crucial for systems that require precise and flexible data generation and handling mechanisms, such as testing environments or memory controllers."

                    "text": "Module name: write_data_path. Module specification: The `write_data_path` module is designed to facilitate memory write operations, specifically in memory-related applications requiring robust data handling and command readiness features. It contains input ports such as `clk_i` (clock input), `rst_i` (reset vector with multiple reset signals), `cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_validB_i`, `cmd_validC_i` (command validation signals), `prbs_fseed_i` (seed for PRBS), `data_mode_i` (mode of data operation), `fixed_data_i` (fixed data for writing), `addr_i` (memory address), and `bl_i` (burst length). The output ports are `cmd_rdy_o` (command readiness), `data_valid_o` (data validity status), `last_word_wr_o` (indicator for last word written in a burst), `data_o` (data output), `data_mask_o` (mask for data handling, hardcoded to zero), and `data_wr_end_o` (signal for end of the write operation). Internal workings include the `data_valid` signal, indicating the validity of data from the `wr_data_gen` submodule, and the `cmd_rdy` register, tracking command readiness internally. The module encapsulates the `wr_data_gen` submodule that handles detailed data generation and command processing based on multiple input stimuli, producing the required outputs and processing the internal signals to maintain the flow of data in synchronization with external requests. The overall code structure ensures synchronicity, command processing, and efficient data management suitable for testing environments or advanced memory controllers."
