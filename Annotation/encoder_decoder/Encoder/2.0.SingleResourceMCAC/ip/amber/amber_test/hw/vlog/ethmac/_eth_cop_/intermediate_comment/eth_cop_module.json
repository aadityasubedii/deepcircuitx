    "module": "Module-level comment: The eth_cop module is a WISHBONE-compatible interconnect multiplexer for Ethernet systems, handling data transactions between two masters (m1, m2) and two slaves (s1, s2). It arbitrates access based on requests, addresses, and control signals, ensuring correct data routing and error management. Implemented with synchronization logic, internal state tracking, and error monitoring, it maintains efficient and error-free bus operations within Ethernet environments."
