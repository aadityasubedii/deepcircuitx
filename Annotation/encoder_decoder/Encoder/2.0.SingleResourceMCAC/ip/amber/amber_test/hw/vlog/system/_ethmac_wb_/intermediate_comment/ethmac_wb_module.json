    "module": "Module-level comment: The `ethmac_wb` module interfaces with Wishbone-compliant systems, supporting conversion between 32-bit and 128-bit data widths for Ethernet MAC transactions. It uses generate blocks for conditional logic based on data width, handling master and slave data alignments, endianess conversions, and manages addresses, data and control signals effectively so that both read and write operations are streamlined across interfaces."
