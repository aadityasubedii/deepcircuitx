It supports command, write, and read operations. Commands and write data coming at the system clock (i_sys_clk) are buffered and sent out at the DDR clock (i_ddr_clk), while read data is received at the DDR clock and forwarded at the system clock. It manages full and empty conditions, ensuring data integrity and flow control between these clock domains."

Used to drive the clocks for the DDR command and read FIFOs, regulating data transfers on the DDR memory side.\n- `i_cmd_en`: Command enable signal.

It plays a critical role in flow control by informing the logic that handles command transfers from the system clock domain to the DDR clock domain. If `cmd_empty` is true (`1`), there are no commands in the FIFO waiting to be processed, which is used to control the output enable signal `o_ddr_cmd_en`.\n\n- `wr_empty`: This signal is used to indicate whether the write FIFO buffer is empty. It is essential for controlling the write data flow from the system to the DDR memory. If `wr_empty` is true (`1`), it means there are no data in the write buffer, impacting the assertion of the `o_ddr_wr_en` signal, which enables data to be written to DDR memory.\n\n- `rd_empty`: Similar to the other empty signals, `rd_empty` indicates whether the read data FIFO is empty. This signal is crucial in determining whether there is data available to be read from the FIFO and passed to the system. The output signal `o_rd_valid` uses the status of `rd_empty` to ensure that valid data is ready to be read by the system side.\n\nThese internal signals manage the status of FIFO queues and are key in ensuring data integrity and synchronization between different clock domains (system and DDR), facilitating reliable communication and operation within the module."
