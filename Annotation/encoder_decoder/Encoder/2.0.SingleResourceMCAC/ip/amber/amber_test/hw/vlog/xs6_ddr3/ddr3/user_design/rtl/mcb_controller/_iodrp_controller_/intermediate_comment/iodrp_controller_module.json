    "module": "Module-level comment: The `iodrp_controller` module manages DRP communication with memory cells, supporting read and write operations. It employs a finite state machine (FSM) to control the flow of operations based on input commands and clock signals. Internal shift registers and state control logic handle data addressing and transfers, capturing read data and managing synchronous operations effectively under various command and reset conditions."
