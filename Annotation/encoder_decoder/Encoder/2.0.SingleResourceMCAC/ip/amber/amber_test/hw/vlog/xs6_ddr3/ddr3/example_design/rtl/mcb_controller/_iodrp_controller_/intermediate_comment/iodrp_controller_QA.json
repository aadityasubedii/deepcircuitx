It handles the input commands for reading from or writing to specific memory cell addresses. The module operates as a finite state machine (FSM) with states like READY, DECIDE, ADDR_PHASE, DATA_PHASE, and others to control the sequence of operations. It uses signals for addressing, bidirectional data transfer, and control signaling to the memory. The chip select (DRP_CS), data output (DRP_SDI), and other control signals are managed based on the internal state of the FSM and the external command validity and type (read or write). The read data from the memory is captured and output based on the sequence managed through these states."
