Module name: eth_crc.
Module specification: The eth_crc is a Verilog module designed to compute the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for Ethernet frames, enhancing data integrity by detecting any transmission errors. It utilizes input ports such as Clk (Clock signal for synchronization), Reset (resets the CRC to a specified initial value), Data (a 4-bit vector for frame data), Enable (control signal for computation initiation), and Initialize (restores CRC initialization). The output ports include Crc, a 32-bit output reflecting the computed CRC, and CrcError, a signal indicating CRC computation discrepancies. Internally, CrcNext, a 32-bit wire, captures the intermediate CRC value during each positive clock edge if the Enable signal is active, ensuring dynamic updates rooted in polynomial equations consistent with Ethernet standards. The Verilog code encompasses procedural blocks for handling synchronous resets or CRC updates on clock edges, alongside combinational blocks for computing the CRCNext based on the current CRC and input data values. A subsequent error-check block determines if there is a mismatch between the computed CRC and a predefined correct value, issuing a CrcError signal accordingly. This module helps in verifying the integrity and correctness of data across Ethernet networks.
