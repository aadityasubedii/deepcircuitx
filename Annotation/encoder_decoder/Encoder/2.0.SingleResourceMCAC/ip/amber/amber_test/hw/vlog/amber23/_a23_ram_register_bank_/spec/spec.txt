Module name: a23_ram_register_bank. 
Module specification: The a23_ram_register_bank module is designed to serve as a versatile register bank for ARM architecture, managing read and write functions to registers according to control signals related to modes of execution, register selection, and status flags. It operates synchronously with a clock input **i_clk** and handles operational stalls using the **i_fetch_stall** input. The module includes various input ports such as **i_mode_exec** and **i_mode_exec_nxt** for current and next execution modes, **i_rm_sel**, **i_rds_sel**, **i_rn_sel** for register selection, and **i_pc**, **i_reg** for loading values into the Program Counter and selected registers when enabled by **i_pc_wen** and **i_reg_bank_wsel** respectively. It outputs the values from selected registers through ports **o_rm**, **o_rs**, **o_rd**, **o_rn**, and **o_pc** for execution purposes.

Internally, the module uses signals like **mode_exec** to handle current execution modes, and address lines **rm_addr**, **rds_addr**, and **rn_addr** to access specific registers. The data is stored in separate register banks **reg_ram_n**, **reg_ram_m**, **reg_ram_ds**, distinguished by use-case and accessed based on the execution context. Special function outputs like **r15_out_rm** represent modified values of the Program Counter and status flags for specific operational scenarios.

The module's code is segmented into blocks handling mode and address calculation, data fetching from register banks, output assignments, and a synchronous block for updating registers and internal states based on system clock and signals. Each section is crucial for dynamically adjusting the data retrieval and storage, facilitating efficient context switching and operational mode management in ARM processors.
