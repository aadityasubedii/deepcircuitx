It handles different types of input clocks (differential and single-ended) and uses a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to generate multiple output clocks with specific frequencies and phases. Additionally, it provides buffered and gated versions of the output clocks to drive memory blocks and other subsystems. Reset logic includes synchronous reset generation to ensure system stability during initialization and after reset conditions. The module ensures that all parts of the system receive stable and correctly phased clocks and are properly reset before operation."
