Module-level comment: The xs6_sram_256x21_line_en module simulates an SRAM interface with a 21-bit data width and 8-bit address space, utilizing a Xilinx RAMB8BWER in SDP mode. It processes write/read operations synchronized by i_clk. Inputs include data, write enable, and address; output is read data assembled from internal lower and upper data segments. This setup ensures effective memory manipulation and data integrity checks through initial parameters verification.
