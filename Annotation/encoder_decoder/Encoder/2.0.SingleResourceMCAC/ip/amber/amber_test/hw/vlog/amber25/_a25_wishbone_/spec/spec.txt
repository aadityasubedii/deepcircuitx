Module name: a25_wishbone. 

Module specification: The `a25_wishbone` module is designed for interfacing with the Wishbone bus, managing data transactions from and to three different system ports (`i_port0_req`, `i_port1_req`, `i_port2_req`). It arbitrates among requests, ensuring that only one request is processed at any given time based on a set priority. Input ports include clock (`clk`), reset (`reset`), and several data and control signals from three different system ports, such as `i_portX_req`, `i_portX_write`, `i_portX_wdata`, `i_portX_be`, and `i_portX_addr` (X being 0, 1, 2 for the respective ports) along with Wishbone inputs like `i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_ack`, and `i_wb_err`. Output ports include acknowledgment signals (`o_portX_ack`) and read data (`o_portX_rdata`) to the respective system ports, alongside several Wishbone control and data signals like `o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_cyc`, and `o_wb_stb`. Internal signals such as `wbuf_valid[X:0]`, `wbuf_accepted[X:0]`, and others help manage buffer states and control decision-making between these system ports and the bus. The module contains instances of `a25_wishbone_buf` for each port, which control the buffering and validation of input data. The operations within the module are controlled through a state machine sensitive to clock and reset signals, which manages initialization, data handling, and arbitration sequences efficiently. Additionally, signals like `new_access` and arrays `wbuf_valid`, `wbuf_accepted` ensure orderly access to the bus depending on the readiness and priority of incoming requests.
