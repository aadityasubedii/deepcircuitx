Module-level comment: The 'afifo' module is a parameterized FIFO buffer supporting synchronous or asynchronous operations across different clock domains. It handles data writes and reads with mechanisms like Gray coding for pointer synchronization and employs status flags (full, empty, almost_full) for flow control. Key internal signals manage the FIFO's pointers and storage, with dedicated logic for updating pointers and flags based on clock events and reset conditions, ensuring operational integrity and reliability.
