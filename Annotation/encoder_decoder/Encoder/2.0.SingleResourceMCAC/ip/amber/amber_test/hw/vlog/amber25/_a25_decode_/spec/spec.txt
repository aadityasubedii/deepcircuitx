Module name: a25_decode. Module specification: This module is responsible for decoding ARM instructions in an ARM processor core. It interprets incoming instructions, determines operation types, and generates control signals for various processor components. The module handles different instruction types including register operations, memory transfers, branches, and coprocessor operations. It also manages interrupt handling, pipeline stalling, and conditional execution. Key inputs include clock, reset, fetched instruction, core stall, interrupt requests, and abort signals. Outputs consist of control signals for ALU, barrel shifter, register selection, memory access, and status bits. Internal signals are used for instruction decoding, pipeline control, and conflict detection. The module is organized into several blocks, including instruction decoding logic, control state machine, interrupt handling, and various execution stages for different instruction types. It also includes logic for handling multiple register transfers, multiplication operations, and coprocessor interactions. The module plays a crucial role in the processor
