Module name: a25_write_back. 
Module specification: The 'a25_write_back' module is essential for the write-back stage of a processor pipeline, designed for capturing and registering memory read data, its validity, and the destination register address, ensuring data integrity in subsequent pipeline stages. The module has several input ports including 'clk' (clock signal for synchronization), 'reset' (asynchronous reset signal), 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' (for diagnostic purposes), 'i_mem_stall' (pipeline stall signal), 'i_mem_read_data' (data read from memory), 'i_mem_read_data_valid' (validity of the read data), 'i_mem_load_rd' (destination register for the data), 'i_daddress' (data address), and 'i_daddress_valid' (validity of the data address). The output ports are 'o_wb_read_data' (outputted memory read data), 'o_wb_read_data_valid' (validity of the outputted data), and 'o_wb_load_rd' (outputted destination register). Internally, the module uses registers like 'mem_read_data_r', 'mem_read_data_valid_r', and 'mem_load_rd_r' to hold the memory read data, its validity, and destination register respectively, across clock cycles. Additionally, 'daddress_r' is used to store the data address being accessed. The Verilog code primarily includes blocks for conditional data updates and resets, ensuring stable and accurate write-back operations in response to the 'reset', 'clk', and 'i_mem_stall' signals, facilitating efficient synchronization and data handling in the processor pipeline.
