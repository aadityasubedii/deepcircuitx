It can handle various types of shifts (e.g., left, right, arithmetic, or circular shifts) determined by 'i_function'. The shift operation's amount is specified by 'i_shift_amount'. The module can operate in either a quick or full mode, selected based on shift amount and control signals. The output of the operation is given in 'o_out', and any carry-out from a shift is indicated in 'o_carry_out'. Additionally, the module can indicate a stall condition through 'o_stall', suggesting it is temporarily unable to proceed with operations, which occurs when more significant shifts are requested in quick mode. The module integrates two instances of another module 'a25_shifter', each configured differently for the full or quick operation. The appropriate result is latched and output based on the stall status and operational mode."

This output is selected when a smaller shift amount is specified, allowing faster operation.\n- **quick_carry_out (Quick Carry Output)**: The carry output from the quick shifter.

It's indicative of any carry generated during larger shift operations.\n- **full_out_r (Full Output Register)**: This 32-bit register stores the result from the full_out signal, providing synchronization and storage across clock cycles. Used to maintain a stable output once it is computed, especially necessary when not operating in quick mode.\n- **full_carry_out_r (Full Carry Output Register)**: A register that latches the carry output from the full_carry_out signal, ensuring its availability in the subsequent clock cycle or when the module is not stalled.\n- **use_quick_r (Use Quick Register)**: A control register that determines whether the module should use the quick shifter outputs (quick_out and quick_carry_out) or the results stored in full_out_r and full_carry_out_r. This decision is made based on the shift amount and whether a stall is ongoing; if the shift can be performed quickly (i.e., no stall), the quick path may be used."
