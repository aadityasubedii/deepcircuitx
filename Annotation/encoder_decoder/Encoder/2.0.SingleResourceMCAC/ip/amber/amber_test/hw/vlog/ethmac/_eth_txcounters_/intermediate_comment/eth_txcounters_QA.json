It tracks nibble and byte counts during different states of Ethernet frame transmission, such as preamble, inter-packet gap (IPG), data, padding (PAD), frame check sequence (FCS), and collision or jam sequences. The module updates these counters based on the state of the transmission and other input signals, offering outputs that help to monitor conditions like excessive deferral, maximum frame size reached, and alignment of the frame to specific nibble boundaries. Incorporating parameters for minimum and maximum frame lengths, the module also supports functionality to determine frame boundary conditions, handle delayed CRC scenarios, and check against frame length regulations in Ethernet standards."

It helps in setting the ExcessiveDefer output.\n- **ResetNibCnt**: This wire signal determines when the nibble count (`NibCnt`) should be reset to zero. It becomes active under several conditions such as transitioning to idle states, starting defer or IPG states, or when specific nibble counts thresholds are reached that require a reset according to the state logic.\n- **IncrementNibCnt**: This wire is utilized to indicate when the nibble count should be incremented. It is active during various transmission states such as IPG, preamble, data transmission, and others, whenever the frame transmission calls for counting of nibbles.\n- **ResetByteCnt**: This wire signal controls when the byte counter (`ByteCnt`) should be reset. Resets occur at the start of a backoff condition, when the state transitions to idle while a frame starts, or when a packet finishes.\n- **IncrementByteCnt**: Determines when to increment the byte count according to current transmission conditions. It depends on higher bits of `StateData`, the maximum frame size not being reached, and specific conditions during backoff, padding, or frame check sequences.\n- **ByteCntMax**: A wire signal that indicates whether the byte counter has reached its maximum tracking capacity. This is significant for preventing overflows and for proper max frame size handling, making decisions about whether the frame has reached its specified max length."
