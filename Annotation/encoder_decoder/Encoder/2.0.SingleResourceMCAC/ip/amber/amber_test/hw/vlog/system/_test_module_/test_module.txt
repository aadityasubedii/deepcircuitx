Module-level comment: The "test_module" is a Verilog RTL designed for interface operations with a Wishbone bus in embedded systems. It handles synchronous I/O operations, IRQ generation, and device control through dynamic signal manipulation and structured bus interaction. Key operations include data reading/writing via addressable register mapping, timed interrupt control, and external device state management, ensuring flexible and efficient system integration and testing.
