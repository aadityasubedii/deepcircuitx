Module-level comment: This module implements a testbench for a DDR3 memory controller simulation. It generates clock and reset signals, instantiates the DDR3 controller and memory model, and uses a memc_tb_top instance for test pattern generation and verification. The testbench monitors calibration, performs memory operations, and reports test results through console output, providing a comprehensive validation environment for the DDR3 memory interface.
