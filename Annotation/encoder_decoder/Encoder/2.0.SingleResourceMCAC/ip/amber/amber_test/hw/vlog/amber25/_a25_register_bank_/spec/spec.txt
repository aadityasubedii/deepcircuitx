Module name: a25_register_bank. 
Module specification: The `a25_register_bank` is a Verilog module designed to handle the register operations within a processor environment, potentially for ARM-like processors dealing with different modes such as User, IRQ, and FIQ. It manages multiple register banks through inputs that control specific operating modes, selection of registers, conditional write operations, and routing results based on execution states. The primary input ports include `clk`, `reset`, `scan_enable`, `test_mode` for fundamental functionalities; mode indicators such as `i_mode_idec`, and `i_mode_exec`; selectors like `i_rm_sel`, `i_rs_sel`, `i_rn_sel`; control signals such as `i_pc_wen`, `i_reg_bank_wen`; and data inputs like `i_pc`, `i_reg`. The outputs comprise register outputs `o_rm`, `o_rs`, `o_rd`, `o_rn`, and `o_pc`, which are essential for interfacing with other modules in the system. Internally, the module uses register-specific wires like `r0_out` to `r15_out_rm`, along with mode execution wires (`usr_exec`, `svc_exec`, `irq_exec`, `firq_exec`) to adapt the processor's behavior based on current needs. It employs conditions to determine read/write enable states with signals such as `read_data_wen` and `pc_wen_c` to handle the register updates effectively. This module includes blocks for input handling, mode determinations, data forwarding based on read/write conditions, and output assignment, ensuring dynamic control over the processor's register states during varying operational conditions. This structured approach aids in flexible, state-based register management necessary for effective CPU instruction execution and interrupt handling.
