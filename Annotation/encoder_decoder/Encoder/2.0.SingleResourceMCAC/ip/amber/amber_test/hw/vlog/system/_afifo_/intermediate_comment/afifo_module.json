    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'afifo' module implements an asynchronous FIFO buffer for data transfer between different clock domains using dual-port RAM. It manages data writes on 'wr_clk' and reads on 'rd_clk', with FIFO status indicated by 'o_full' and 'o_empty' signals. Internal grey coding functions help maintain data integrity across clock domains, with pointers managed for correct FIFO operation."
