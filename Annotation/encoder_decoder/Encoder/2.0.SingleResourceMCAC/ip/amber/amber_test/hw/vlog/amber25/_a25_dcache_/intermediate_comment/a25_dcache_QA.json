It supports multiple ways (2, 3, 4, or 8) and is designed to handle read and write operations, cache misses, cache fills, and exclusive accesses. The cache uses a random replacement policy when all ways are valid. It includes logic for tag and data RAM access, hit detection, and cache state management. The module also handles write-back operations and cache flushing. Overall, it aims to improve memory access performance by providing faster access to frequently used data."
