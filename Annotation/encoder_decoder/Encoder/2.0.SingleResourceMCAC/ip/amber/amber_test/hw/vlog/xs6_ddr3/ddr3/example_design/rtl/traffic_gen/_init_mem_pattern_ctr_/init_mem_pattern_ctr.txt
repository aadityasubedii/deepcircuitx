Module-level comment: The init_mem_pattern_ctr module controls FPGA memory testing and initialization, tailored for specific FPGA families like SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6. It operates via a finite state machine handling states for memory writes, reads, and error-checking. Input signals direct memory commands and test configurations, while outputs manage memory traffic and parameter setups. Internal logic ensures adherence to memory boundaries and dynamic configurability, facilitating robust and flexible memory operations.
