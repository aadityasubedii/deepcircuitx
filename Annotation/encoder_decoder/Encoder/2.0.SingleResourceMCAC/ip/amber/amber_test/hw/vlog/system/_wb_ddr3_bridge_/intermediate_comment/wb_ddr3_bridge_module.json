    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'wb_ddr3_bridge' module interfaces between a Wishbone bus and DDR3 memory, handling read and write transactions. It implements input and output bus control, processes Wishbone signals to generate DDR3 commands, manages data transfers, and includes synchronization logic gates and buffers for efficient data flow and command execution, ensuring fidelity in communication between disparate hardware protocols."
