It consists of a 32-bit wide memory with 16 addressable locations. The module uses 32 instances of the primitive `RAM16X1D` (a 16-bit deep by 1-bit wide dual-port RAM primitive provided by Xilinx) to create a 32-bit wide dual-port memory. Inputs include `data_in` (32-bit data for writing), `write_address` and `read_address` (4-bit addresses for writing and reading), `we` (write enable signal), and `wclk` (write clock signal). The output, `data_out`, is the 32-bit data read from the specified `read_address`. Each instance of `RAM16X1D` handles a single bit of the input and output data, controlled by shared address and control signals, effectively allowing parallel read and write operations for different data bits at the addressed location."

If low, no data is written into the memory, regardless of the clock.\n- `wclk` (Write Clock): This is the clock signal for triggering write operations. Changes on this clock edge trigger a write operation if `we` is high.\n- `data_in` (Data Input): This 32-bit signal represents the data to be written into the RAM at the location specified by `write_address`.\n- `write_address` (Write Address): This 4-bit address specifies the location in the RAM where `data_in` should be written.\n- `read_address` (Read Address): This 4-bit address is used to specify which data location to read from, and the data present at this address will appear at the `data_out` port.\n\nOutput ports: [data_out].\nExplanation:\n- `data_out` (Data Output): This 32-bit output port provides the data stored in the RAM at the location specified by `read_address`.

Each bit of `waddr` is connected to the corresponding address input (`A0` to `A3`) of all RAM16X1D instances, effectively directing the `data_in` bits to the correct memory location for writing.\n- `raddr` (Read Address): Similarly, `raddr` is a 4-bit internal representation of the `read_address` input used for read operations. Each bit of `raddr` is connected to the corresponding read address input (`DPRA0` to `DPRA3`) of all RAM16X1D instances.
