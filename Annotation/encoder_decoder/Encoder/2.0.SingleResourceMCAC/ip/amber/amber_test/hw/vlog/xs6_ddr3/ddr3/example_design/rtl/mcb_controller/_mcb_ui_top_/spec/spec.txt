Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: This module serves as a Memory Controller Block (MCB) User Interface (UI) top-level wrapper, integrating memory controller functionality with AXI interface options. It supports up to 6 ports that can be configured as either standard MCB interfaces or AXI interfaces. The module handles memory operations, arbitration between ports, and provides interfaces for command, write, and read operations. Key input ports include clock and reset signals, port-specific control signals, and AXI interface signals for multiple ports. Output ports encompass buffered clock and control signals, port-specific status signals, memory interface signals, and AXI interface output signals. Internal signals are used to connect the MCB interface with the AXI interface and handle various memory operations and status indications. The module is divided into several sections, including clock management, port configuration, AXI interface integration, and memory controller operations.
