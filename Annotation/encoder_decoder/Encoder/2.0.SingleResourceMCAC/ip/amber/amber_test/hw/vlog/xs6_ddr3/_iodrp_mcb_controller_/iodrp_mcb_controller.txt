Module-level comment: The 'iodrp_mcb_controller' module interfaces memory cells with a Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP), managing both read and write operations via an FSM. It handles various input signals for addressing, command validity, broadcasting, and synchronization, leveraging internal registers and state tracking. Outputs facilitate DRP communication and data output readiness. Clock-driven transitions and specific tasks (like serial data manipulation) ensure timely and accurate data processing. This module seamlessly integrates within systems requiring robust memory and DRP interfacing capabilities.
