Module name: main_mem. Module specification: The `main_mem` module is designed to interface with a Wishbone bus protocol and emulate main memory functionality through a parameterized array `ram`. The module is configurable to support data widths of either 32-bit or 128-bit, controlled by the parameter `WB_DWIDTH`. It performs read and write operations based on Wishbone bus signals such as address (`i_wb_adr`), data (`i_wb_dat`), write enable (`i_wb_we`), and strobe (`i_wb_stb`). The module has input ports like `i_clk` for the clock signal, `i_mem_ctrl` for memory control affecting address mapping, and several others for data handling and bus control. Output ports include `o_wb_dat` for outputting data read from memory, `o_wb_ack` for acknowledging transactions, and `o_wb_err` for indicating errors during operations. Internal signals like `start_write` and `start_read` dictate when to initiate write/read operations, while `masked_wdata`, `wr_en`, and `rd_data` manage data flow and storage. The module uses `generate` blocks to create specific logic conditional upon the data width (`WB_DWIDTH`). Within these blocks, operations such as data masking, address decoding, and data storage are performed, with special debugging hooks under conditional compilation for simulations. This structured approach optimizes the module for different system configurations and ensures robust memory operations in a Wishbone-based system.
