Module name: mcb_soft_calibration_top.

Module specification: The "mcb_soft_calibration_top" module is configured to handle calibration processes for memory controller blocks essential in FPGA systems, geared towards improving interfaces between memory components like DDR and memory controllers. Key input ports include `UI_CLK`, `RST`, and `IOCLK` for synchronization; `PLL_LOCK` for clock management; and multiple MCB-specific flags and signals for memory operations such as `MCB_UOSDO` and `MCB_UODONECAL`. Output signals like `DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL` signal complete calibration, while others (`SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ`, `MCB_UIADD`, etc.) manage memory state transitions and internal operation. Internally, the module uses signals such as `IODRP_ADD` and `IODRP_SDI` for Dynamic Reconfiguration Port operations, involving addressing and data input, among others tied specifically to management of RZQ and ZIO calibration through DRP.

The code comprises several blocks - initialization and state management are handled primarily by sequential logic at the top of the module. The `mcb_soft_calibration` instantiation links directly to both input and output ports, bridging real-time incoming data and configuration feedback. Specialized DRP configurations for RZQ and ZIO calibration, controlled through `IODRP2` instances, enable dynamic calibration based on runtime conditions. Moreover, external memory interfaces are managed using `IOBUF` components allowing bidirectional data flow on calibration-specific I/O pins. Conditionally compiled sections (`generate` block) cater specifically to DDR types, ensuring applicability across different memory technologies without recalibration. The entirety of the module's function is centered on ensuring optimized calibration metrics are met before normal operation ensues, improving memory interfacing robustness and stability.
