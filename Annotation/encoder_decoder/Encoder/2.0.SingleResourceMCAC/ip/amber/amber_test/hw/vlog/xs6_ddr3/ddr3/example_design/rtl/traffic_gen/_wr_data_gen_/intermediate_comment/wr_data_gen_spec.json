    "spec": "Module name: wr_data_gen. \n\nModule specification: The \"wr_data_gen\" module is tailored for generating write data for memory write operations in FPGA applications, specifically targeting \"SPARTAN6\" and \"VIRTEX6\" families. It accommodates various configurations such as burst length, data width, and address width, and supports different data patterns like pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) and fixed data. The key inputs include a clock signal (`clk_i`), reset (`rst_i`), PRBS seed (`prbs_fseed_i`), data mode (`data_mode_i`), fixed data (`fixed_data_i`), address (`addr_i`), and burst length (`bl_i`), alongside multiple command validity signals. It outputs signals indicating command readiness (`cmd_rdy_o`), the validity of the data (`data_valid_o`), the data itself (`data_o`), and flags for the last word in a burst (`last_word_o`) and the end of data writing (`data_wr_end_o`). Internal signals such as various command readiness and start flags, user burst count, and a FIFO fullness check facilitate the control flow and orchestration of the data generation and output processes. The module contains generative blocks for handling specific FPGA family features and conditional instantiations of family-specific data generation submodules (`sp6_data_gen` and `v6_data_gen`). These sections are responsive to configurations and operate in concert with the primary logic to manage data sequencing, synchronization with external controls, and adherence to configured data patterns and operational modes.",

Explanation: Specifies the memory address associated with the data being generated.\n- bl_i: Burst length input (BL_WIDTH bits). Explanation: Specifies the length of data burst for the operation, determining how many data blocks are handled in one sequence.\n- data_rdy_i: Data ready input. Explanation: Signal from an external module (like FIFO control) indicating readiness to accept new data.\n\nOutput ports:\n- cmd_rdy_o: Command ready output. Explanation: Indicates that the module is ready to accept a new command.\n- last_word_o: Last word flag output. Explanation: Signals the end of a data burst, indicating the last word in the sequence is being processed.\n- data_valid_o: Data valid output. Explanation: The flag indicating whether the currently outputted data is valid.\n- data_o: Data output (DWIDTH bits). Explanation: The actual data output line carrying generated or passed-through data.\n- data_wr_end_o: Data write end flag output. Explanation: Flag to indicate that the data writing operation has been completed.\n\nThese ports handle various aspects of synchronous data generation, command processing, and communication with other components in a system, ensuring coordinated data transfers and operations in applications like memory write sequences."

It accommodates various configurations such as burst length, data width, and address width, and supports different data patterns like pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) and fixed data. The key inputs include a clock signal (`clk_i`), reset (`rst_i`), PRBS seed (`prbs_fseed_i`), data mode (`data_mode_i`), fixed data (`fixed_data_i`), address (`addr_i`), and burst length (`bl_i`), alongside multiple command validity signals. It outputs signals indicating command readiness (`cmd_rdy_o`), the validity of the data (`data_valid_o`), the data itself (`data_o`), and flags for the last word in a burst (`last_word_o`) and the end of data writing (`data_wr_end_o`). Internal signals such as various command readiness and start flags, user burst count, and a FIFO fullness check facilitate the control flow and orchestration of the data generation and output processes. The module contains generative blocks for handling specific FPGA family features and conditional instantiations of family-specific data generation submodules (`sp6_data_gen` and `v6_data_gen`). These sections are responsive to configurations and operate in concert with the primary logic to manage data sequencing, synchronization with external controls, and adherence to configured data patterns and operational modes."
