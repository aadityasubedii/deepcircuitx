Module name: mcb_soft_calibration. Module specification: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), implementing input termination calibration and dynamic DQS delay calibration. It uses a state machine to control the calibration process, adjusting parameters such as P_Term and N_Term for impedance matching, and DQS delay for optimal data sampling. The module has numerous input ports including UI_CLK (user interface clock), RST (reset), PLL_LOCK (PLL lock signal), and various MCB-related inputs. Output ports include DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL (calibration completion signal), SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ (self-refresh request), and multiple MCB control signals. Internal signals include STATE (current state of the calibration state machine), P_Term and N_Term (termination values), DQS_DELAY (DQ
