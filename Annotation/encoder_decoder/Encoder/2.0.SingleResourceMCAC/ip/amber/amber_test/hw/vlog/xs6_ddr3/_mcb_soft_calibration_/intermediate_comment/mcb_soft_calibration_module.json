    "module": "Module-level comment: This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), including input termination and dynamic DQS delay calibration. It uses a state machine to control the calibration process, adjusting impedance matching parameters (P_Term, N_Term) and DQS delay for optimal data sampling. The module interfaces with IODRP controllers and the MCB, managing calibration steps through various states, and handles self-refresh operations. It implements adaptive calibration based on max value readings and provides control signals for MCB operation."
