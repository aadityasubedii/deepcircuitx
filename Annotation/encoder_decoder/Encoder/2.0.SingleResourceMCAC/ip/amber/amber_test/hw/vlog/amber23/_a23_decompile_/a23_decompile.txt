/* a23_decompile: ARM-like processor decompiler for debugging and analysis.
   Decodes instructions, extracts fields (opcodes, registers, operands), and 
   generates human-readable assembly output. Processes various instruction types, 
   handles interrupts, and writes decompiled information to a file. Implements 
   instruction decoding, condition evaluation, and formatting for different 
   operation types (register, memory, branch, system). Utilizes internal signals 
   for data extraction and processing. */
