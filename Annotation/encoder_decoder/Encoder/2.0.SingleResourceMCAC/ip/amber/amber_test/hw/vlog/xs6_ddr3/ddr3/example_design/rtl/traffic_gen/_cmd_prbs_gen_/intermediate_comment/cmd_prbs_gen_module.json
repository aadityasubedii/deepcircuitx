    "module": "Module-level comment: The `cmd_prbs_gen` module generates configurable pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR). It adapts to various operational modes like \"ADDRESS\", \"INSTR\", or \"BLEN\" based on input parameters. The module initializes with a seed (`prbs_seed_i`) and updates its state via clock-driven shifts and XOR feedback mechanisms within the LFSR. Outputs are tailored to specific application needs by potentially masking and modifying the LFSR output as defined in the generate blocks, ensuring versatile PRBS generation across different use cases."
