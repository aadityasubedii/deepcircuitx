Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: This module is a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) interface, designed to handle various types of DDR memory (DDR, DDR2, DDR3, MDDR). It manages the interface between the user logic and the physical memory, handling address translation, data transfer, and control signals. The module supports multiple port configurations, different memory widths (4, 8, or 16 bits), and various memory timings and settings. Input ports include clock signals (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), control signals (pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, pll_lock, sys_rst), and multiple command and data ports (p0_cmd_clk, p0_cmd_en, p0_cmd_instr, p0_cmd_bl, p0_cmd_byte
