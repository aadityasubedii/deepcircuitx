Module name: a23_decompile. Module specification: This module is a decompiler for an ARM-like processor architecture, designed for debugging and analysis purposes. It takes various input signals related to instruction execution, including clock (i_clk), fetch stall (i_fetch_stall), instruction data (i_instruction), validity flags, interrupt signals, and program counter information. The module has no output ports, instead writing decompiled instruction information to a file. Internally, it uses signals to extract and process instruction components such as opcodes, registers, and operands. The module is divided into several functional blocks: instruction decoding, condition evaluation, register operations, memory transfers, branching, and system instructions. It processes the incoming instruction data, extracts relevant fields, and formats this information into readable assembly-like text. The decompiled output includes instruction addresses, timing information, and a trace of executed instructions. The module also handles different instruction
