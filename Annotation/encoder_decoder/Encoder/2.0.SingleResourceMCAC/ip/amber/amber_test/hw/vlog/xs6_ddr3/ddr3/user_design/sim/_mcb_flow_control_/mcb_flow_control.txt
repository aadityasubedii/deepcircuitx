Module-level comment: The `mcb_flow_control` module manages memory control commands for reading, writing, and refreshing through a state machine. It handles input commands, controls data flows based on MCB readiness and state transitions, and outputs relevant memory commands with associated addresses and burst lengths. The module operates using a combinational logic block and multiple always blocks to maintain, process, and update state based on various internal signals and I/O port conditions.
