    "spec": "Module name: infrastructure. Module specification: The 'infrastructure' module is designed for FPGA implementations to manage clock and reset signals. The module utilizes differential or single-ended input clocks specified by `C_INPUT_CLK_TYPE`, processed through a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) to generate various synchronized output clocks tailored by parameters such as divides and multipliers. Input ports include `sys_clk_p` and `sys_clk_n` for differential clock signals, `sys_clk` for a single-ended clock, and `sys_rst_i` for system reset. The output ports are `clk0` (buffered system clock), `rst0` (synchronized reset signal), `async_rst` (asynchronous reset combining system and PLL lock status), `sysclk_2x` and `sysclk_2x_180` (high-frequency clocks), `mcb_drp_clk` (memory controller clock), `pll_ce_0`, `pll_ce_90` (clock enable outputs), and `pll_lock` (PLL stability indicator). Internal signals such as `clk_2x_0`, `clk_2x_180`, `clk0_bufg`, `clkfbout_clkfbin`, `locked`, and `powerup_pll_locked` manage intermediate states, feedback, and conditions for final output generation and synchronization. The code features various blocks: differential and single-ended input conditioning, a PLL setup for frequency and phase configuration, buffer management for stable signal output, synchronization mechanisms for safe resets, and a BUFPLL_MCB for additional clock manipulation. These components work collectively to ensure stable, adaptable clock generation and robust reset handling to cater diverse system requirements.",

                    "text": "Module name: infrastructure. Module specification: The 'infrastructure' module is designed for FPGA implementations to manage clock and reset signals. The module utilizes differential or single-ended input clocks specified by `C_INPUT_CLK_TYPE`, processed through a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) to generate various synchronized output clocks tailored by parameters such as divides and multipliers. Input ports include `sys_clk_p` and `sys_clk_n` for differential clock signals, `sys_clk` for a single-ended clock, and `sys_rst_i` for system reset. The output ports are `clk0` (buffered system clock), `rst0` (synchronized reset signal), `async_rst` (asynchronous reset combining system and PLL lock status), `sysclk_2x` and `sysclk_2x_180` (high-frequency clocks), `mcb_drp_clk` (memory controller clock), `pll_ce_0`, `pll_ce_90` (clock enable outputs), and `pll_lock` (PLL stability indicator). Internal signals such as `clk_2x_0`, `clk_2x_180`, `clk0_bufg`, `clkfbout_clkfbin`, `locked`, and `powerup_pll_locked` manage intermediate states, feedback, and conditions for final output generation and synchronization. The code features various blocks: differential and single-ended input conditioning, a PLL setup for frequency and phase configuration, buffer management for stable signal output, synchronization mechanisms for safe resets, and a BUFPLL_MCB for additional clock manipulation. These components work collectively to ensure stable, adaptable clock generation and robust reset handling to cater diverse system requirements."
