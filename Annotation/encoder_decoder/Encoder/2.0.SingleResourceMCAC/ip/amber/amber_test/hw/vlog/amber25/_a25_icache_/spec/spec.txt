Module name: a25_icache. Module specification: The a25_icache module implements an instruction cache for a processor, designed to enhance access speeds by storing frequently used instruction data. It's configurable in terms of cache size, ways, and other parameters. The module handles cache operations such as stall detection, cache flush, handling cache misses, and refill operations from a write buffer. Input ports include clk (clock), reset, scan_enable, test_mode, i_core_stall (core stall indicator), i_select (cache access activator), i_address (main address input), i_address_nxt (next address), i_cache_enable, i_cache_flush, i_wb_read_data (write buffer data), and i_wb_ready (write buffer ready indicator). Output ports include o_stall (cache stall indicator), o_read_data (cache output data), an
