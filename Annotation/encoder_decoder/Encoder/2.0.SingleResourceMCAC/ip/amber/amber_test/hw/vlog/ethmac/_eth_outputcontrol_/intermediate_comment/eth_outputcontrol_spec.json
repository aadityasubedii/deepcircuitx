    "spec": "Module name: eth_outputcontrol. \nModule specification: The 'eth_outputcontrol' module is tailored for Ethernet applications to manage the output data signals Mdo and MdoEn. It operates based on a clock signal (Clk) and a reset signal (Reset), and processes multiple inputs including status and control signals such as WriteOp, NoPre, InProgress, ShiftedBit, BitCounter, and MdcEn_n. The main functionalities of this module are discerning the enabling state and adjusting the data output dependent on operational modes and other conditions. It utilizes internal signals, notably SerialEn, a wire that determines if serial data transmission is enabled by evaluating conditions related to operation type, transmission status, bit count, and preamble requirements. The module significantly comprises two always blocks; one handles the logic for setting up the MdoEn output following specific conditions evaluated through SerialEn and another for determining Mdo based on ShiftedBit and other internal conditions. Both blocks assess changes on the positive edge of Clk or Reset, and their outputs are further delayed through registers for synchronization purposes. This structure ensures accurate data transmission control tailored for Ethernet communication scenarios.",

It takes several inputs such as the clock signal (Clk), a reset signal (Reset), and status signals indicating the operation type (WriteOp, NoPre, InProgress, ShiftedBit), and manages the bit counter (BitCounter) along with the MDC enable signal (MdcEn_n). The module processes these inputs and determines the enable state and data output based on the operation mode (write operation or other), the progress of the operation, and the current bit count. The output is driven by a combination of logic conditions and the state of the shifted bit when appropriate."
