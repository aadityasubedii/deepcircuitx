    "module": "Module-level comment: The a23_barrel_shift_fpga module performs various bit shifting operations (LSL, LSR, ASR, ROR) on a 32-bit input. It handles shifting through dynamic control logic using internal masks and flags, combined with generated blocks of configurable routing paths. This arrangement enables precise control and flexibility across different types of shifts, tailored by input parameters like shift amount and function type."
