Module name: v6_data_gen. Module specification: This module is a data generator for memory interface testing, capable of producing various data patterns including address-based, PRBS (Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence), walking 1's/0's, neighbor, and fixed patterns. It supports different data widths and burst lengths. The module takes inputs such as clock (clk_i), reset (rst_i), PRBS seed (prbs_fseed_i), data mode (data_mode_i), address (addr_i), and control signals. It outputs generated data (data_o) based on the selected mode. Internally, it uses signals like prbs_data for PRBS generation, acounts for address-based patterns, and w1data for walking 1's/0's patterns. The module is divided into sections for different pattern generations, including PRBS, address-based, walking 1's
