It allows for selective writing to specific bytes within a data word based on the `i_byte_enable` signal. When a write enable (`i_write_enable`) is signaled, the module updates specific bytes of the memory at the address `i_address` with the data from `i_write_data` corresponding to the enabled bytes. The bytes that are enabled for writing are determined by the `i_byte_enable` mask. If writing is not enabled, the module outputs the current data stored at the address `i_address` to `o_read_data`. Additionally, there's functionality to reset the memory content to all zeros or all ones, which can be controlled through the `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO` parameter."

It is provided in the port list but not used in the current implementation.\n- `scan_enable`: Used for scan-based testing, enabling the scan chain mechanism.\n- `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`: Input scan chain signals, likely used for test purposes such as shifting in test data or control bits.\n- `i_write_data`: Data to be written into the SRAM.\n- `i_write_enable`: Enable signal to allow writing to the SRAM. When high, writing is enabled at the addressed location.\n- `i_address`: The address where data is to be written to or read from in the SRAM.\n- `i_byte_enable`: Mask that determines which bytes in the `i_write_data` should be written into the memory.\n\nOutput ports: `scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4, o_read_data`.\nExplanation:\n- `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`: Output scan chain signals, likely used for testing purposes such as shifting out test data or results.\n- `o_read_data`: The data output from the SRAM.

Each address in this memory can store a bit-width equal to `DATA_WIDTH`, and it can be selectively modified by byte based on the `i_byte_enable` signal during write operations.\n  \n- `i`: A loop variable used in the sequential logic to cycle through each byte segment of the data word (`DATA_WIDTH/8`) when handling byte-enabled write operations.
