Module-level comment: The `iodrp_mcb_controller` manages memory interfacing through a Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) in FPGA environments, handling both read and write operations. It operates based on input commands and settings (address, data, operation mode, and DRP specifics), processes these via an internal Finite State Machine (FSM) along with multiple control and status registers, and synchronizes operations using a DRP-specific clock. The module supports flexible configurations and broadcasting capabilities, navigating through distinct operational states and using tasks for data manipulation to ensure efficient DRP interfacing.
