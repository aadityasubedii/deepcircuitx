    "module": "Module-level comment: This module generates memory commands (address, instruction, burst length) for a memory interface. It supports multiple address modes (BRAM, fixed, PRBS, sequential), instruction types, and burst lengths. The module uses PRBS generators, counters, and mode registers to produce commands based on input configurations. It handles timing, refresh commands, and adapts to different FPGA families (Spartan-6, Virtex-6). The module includes logic for read/write balancing, address range management, and output pipelining to ensure efficient command generation for various memory configurations and test scenarios."
