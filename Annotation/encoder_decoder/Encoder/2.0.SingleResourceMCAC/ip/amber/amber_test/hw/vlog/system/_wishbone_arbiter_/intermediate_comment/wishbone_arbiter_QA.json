The arbiter dynamically selects which master has control of the bus based on a set of rules defined in the code, ensuring that no two masters access the bus simultaneously, thus avoiding bus contention. It handles the transactions by assigning the bus signals to the appropriate master and routing data, address, and control signals between masters and the designated slave devices. The module supports input-handling from two masters and output management to eight slave devices, with operations structured around clock edges to ensure timing and synchronization."
