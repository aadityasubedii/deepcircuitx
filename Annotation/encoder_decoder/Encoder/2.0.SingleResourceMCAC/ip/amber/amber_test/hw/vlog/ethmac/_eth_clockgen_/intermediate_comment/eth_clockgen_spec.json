    "spec": "Module name: eth_clockgen. Module specification: The \"eth_clockgen\" module is designed to generate a modified Ethernet clock signal (Mdc), primarily to support Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) operations. It operates by taking an input clock signal (Clk), a synchronous reset signal (Reset), and an 8-bit divider value (Divider) to manage the frequency of the Mdc output. The output ports include the modified clock (Mdc), and two enable signals (MdcEn and MdcEn_n), which indicate the active edges of the Mdc signal. Internally, the module leverages several signals: Counter (an 8-bit register that counts down to trigger the Mdc toggling), CountEq0 (a flag that identifies when Counter reaches zero), CounterPreset (initializes Counter based on Divider), and TempDivider (ensures Divider is within operational limits). The code is organized into distinct blocks responsible for adjusting the Divider, presetting the Counter, managing the Counter's countdown, toggling the Mdc based on the countdown, and setting the enable signals based on the Mdc state. This structured approach ensures that the clock signal generation is both configurable and responsive to real-time changes in control inputs.",

It takes an input clock signal and generates a modified clock (Mdc) based on the specified divider value. The divider is adjustable, allowing the frequency of the generated clock to be set as needed. The module includes mechanisms for synchronously resetting, and outputs both the modified clock (Mdc) and enable signals (MdcEn, MdcEn_n) indicating the active edge of the Mdc signal. The functionality primarily involves counting down from a predetermined value derived from the divider and toggling the Mdc signal when the counter reaches zero."
