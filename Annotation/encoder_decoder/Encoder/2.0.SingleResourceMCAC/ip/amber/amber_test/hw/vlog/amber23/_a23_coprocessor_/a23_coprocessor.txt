Module-level comment: The `a23_coprocessor` module manages cache control and fault handling in computing systems, synchronized by `i_clk`. It processes input commands for cache operations and fault status updates, utilizing internal registers like `cache_control` and `fault_status`. Outputs adjust based on these operations, influencing cache states and error diagnostics, especially under system operational stalls managed by `i_fetch_stall`. Debug features enable detailed state tracking during development.
