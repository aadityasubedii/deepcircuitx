The module takes a clock signal (`clk_i`), a clock enable signal (`clk_en`), and a reset signal (`rst_i`). It also accepts initial PRBS seeds through `prbs_fseed_i` and `prbs_seed_i`. If `prbs_seed_init` is high and `EYE_TEST` is set to \"FALSE\", or if the reset signal is high, the LFSR is initialized with a combination of user-provided seeds and a fixed pattern. During normal operation, when the clock is enabled, the LFSR contents are shifted, and new bits are generated based on the XOR of specific bits in the register. This sequence is continually updated and provided as output `prbs_o`, which captures the current state of the PRBS.\n\nThis module is used for generating data patterns typically in testing scenarios to simulate random data and verify the robustness or functionality of other digital circuits or systems. The parameterization allows for customization in terms of operational specifics like PRBS width and initial values."

If low, the LFSR operation halts.\n- `rst_i`: Reset input; used to reset the LFSR to initial conditions as specified when high.\n- `prbs_fseed_i`: Fixed seed input, a 32-bit value used in initializing the LFSR along with `prbs_seed_i` and a fixed pattern on reset or upon initialization trigger through `prbs_seed_init`.\n- `prbs_seed_init`: Seed initialization trigger; when high, it initiates the seed loading process into the LFSR, used alongside `prbs_fseed_i`.\n- `prbs_seed_i`: Programmable seed input, typically of the width defined by `PRBS_WIDTH`, used for initializing or re-seeding the LFSR.\n\nOutput ports: [prbs_o].\nExplanation: \n- `prbs_o`: Pseudo Random Binary Sequence output, conveys the current state of the LFSR as a PRBS of width defined by `PRBS_WIDTH`.
