Module-level comment: The "wr_data_gen" module manages data generation for write operations in FPGA-based systems, handling various memory configurations with adaptable modules for SPARTAN6 and VIRTEX6. It employs controls for data pattern selection, burst lengths, and command signaling through inputs like `cmd_valid_i` and `data_mode_i`. Outputs ensure synchronous data handling, readable through signals like `data_valid_o` and `data_wr_end_o`. Internally, conditionally compiled blocks specificying hardware configurations, alongside signal control for command readiness and burst management, achieve precise memory interfacing.
