The module interacts with a Wishbone bus interface, allowing for read and write operations to these timers. Each timer can count down from a set value and can be configured to either stop or reload upon reaching zero. The module also manages interrupt signals for each timer, which can be triggered when their count reaches zero, reflecting their respective timer statuses. Additionally, the module supports different data widths for the Wishbone interface, specifically 32-bit and 128-bit configurations, adjusting the data alignments accordingly."

Used to synchronize all operations within the module.\n- i_wb_adr[31:0]: Wishbone address bus. Specifies the address for read/write operations.\n- i_wb_sel[WB_SWIDTH-1:0]: Wishbone byte select line(s). Determines which byte lanes carry valid data.\n- i_wb_we: Wishbone write enable signal. Indicates whether the current cycle is a write operation.\n- i_wb_dat[WB_DWIDTH-1:0]: Wishbone data input bus. Carries data to be written to the device.\n- i_wb_cyc: Wishbone cycle valid input. Signals an active Wishbone cycle.\n- i_wb_stb: Wishbone strobe input. Indicates a valid data transfer cycle.\n\nExplanation:\nThese inputs collectively form the interface required for the timer module to interact with the Wishbone bus. The clock input ensures that the data and control actions are properly synchronized. The address, data, and control lines enable read and write operations to be performed on the timer registers.\n\nOutput ports:\n- o_wb_dat[WB_DWIDTH-1:0]: Wishbone data output bus. Carries data being read from the device.\n- o_wb_ack: Wishbone acknowledge output. Signals that a read or write operation has completed successfully.\n- o_wb_err: Wishbone error output. Indicates that an error occurred during a Wishbone transaction.\n- o_timer_int[2:0]: Timer interrupt outputs. Each bit corresponds to an interrupt signal for each of the three timers.\n\nExplanation:\nThe output data bus provides the results of read operations back to the master on the Wishbone bus. The acknowledge and error signals provide feedback regarding the status of read and write operations. The timer interrupt signals serve as notifications for the system when each of the timers reaches its terminal count, allowing for timely responses to timer-related events."
