Module-level comment: The 'eth_rxaddrcheck' module validates Ethernet frame addresses, checking against unicast, multicast, and broadcast criteria using inputs like RxData and MAC address. It uses signals such as RxAbort and AddressMiss to signal validation outcomes based on byte position checks and hashed values for efficient address matching. The implementation includes initial reset handling, conditional checking based on byte counts and CRC hash results, and address validation logic sequences to ensure proper frame processing.
