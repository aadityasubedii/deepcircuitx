    "spec": "Module name: mcb_flow_control.\n\nModule specification: The 'mcb_flow_control' module is designed to manage command and data flows for a memory controller block (MCB). It synchronizes memory operations across various states such as ready, read, write, command wait, and refresh stages utilizing a Finite State Machine (FSM). Input ports include `clk_i` for clock input, `rst_i` for reset, and other signals like `cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_i`, `addr_i`, `bl_i`, indicating command validity, type, address, and burst length respectively. Outputs such as `cmd_rdy_o`, `cmd_o`, `addr_o`, and `bl_o` indicate the readiness to accept new commands and reflect the processed command, address, and burst length. Internal signals like `cmd_fifo_rdy`, `cmd_rd`, and `cmd_wr` handle the readiness of command FIFO and command types, ensuring proper responses to external commands and internal states. The code extensively manipulates these signals within an FSM that directs the module through its operation, managing state transitions based on input commands and system readiness, and thus controlling the signal flow and operations like read and write command processing. Internal maintenance of write and read operation flags like `wr_in_progress` helps in the module's logical decisions within various FSM states. These functional blocks are supported by signal assignments and always-blocks conditioned on clock edges, managing the transfer and execution of command and data operations effectively in synchronization with memory interface demands.",

It handles aspects such as reading and writing data, handling different states like ready, read, write, command wait, and refresh states, and manages valid signals for data paths based on the status of commands and the readiness of data paths. This module ensures the synchronization and timing of memory operations using various state transitions and condition checks, ensuring data integrity and timely command execution. It operates based on input commands, addresses, burst lengths, and handles full command queues by stalling or enabling commands accordingly."

It synchronizes memory operations across various states such as ready, read, write, command wait, and refresh stages utilizing a Finite State Machine (FSM). Input ports include `clk_i` for clock input, `rst_i` for reset, and other signals like `cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_i`, `addr_i`, `bl_i`, indicating command validity, type, address, and burst length respectively. Outputs such as `cmd_rdy_o`, `cmd_o`, `addr_o`, and `bl_o` indicate the readiness to accept new commands and reflect the processed command, address, and burst length. Internal signals like `cmd_fifo_rdy`, `cmd_rd`, and `cmd_wr` handle the readiness of command FIFO and command types, ensuring proper responses to external commands and internal states. The code extensively manipulates these signals within an FSM that directs the module through its operation, managing state transitions based on input commands and system readiness, and thus controlling the signal flow and operations like read and write command processing. Internal maintenance of write and read operation flags like `wr_in_progress` helps in the module's logical decisions within various FSM states. These functional blocks are supported by signal assignments and always-blocks conditioned on clock edges, managing the transfer and execution of command and data operations effectively in synchronization with memory interface demands."

Resets the module, initializing or resetting internal states depending on the specific bit triggered.\n- `cmd_valid_i`: Command valid input. Indicates that the command on `cmd_i` is valid and should be considered for processing.\n- `cmd_i`: Command input (3-bits). Determines the type of command executed (e.g., read, write, refresh).\n- `addr_i`: Address input (32-bits). Specifies the memory address involved in operations.\n- `bl_i`: Burst length input (6-bits). Specifies the burst length for read or write operations.\n- `mcb_cmd_full`: MCB command full indication. Signals whether the memory controller block's command queue is full.\n- `last_word_wr_i`: Signals the last word for a write operation to terminate the write sequence properly.\n- `wdp_rdy_i`: Write data path ready. Indicates the readiness of the write data path.\n- `last_word_rd_i`: Signals the last word for a read operation to terminate the read sequence properly.\n- `rdp_rdy_i`: Read data path ready. Indicates the readiness of the read data path.\n\nExplanation: These inputs provide operational commands, synchronization, and status indicators critical for managing the data flows and command execution related to the memory controller.\n\nOutput ports:\n- `cmd_rdy_o`: Command ready output (registered). Indicates whether the module is ready to accept new commands.\n- `cmd_o`: Command output (3-bits, registered). Outputs the processed command to the memory controller block.\n- `addr_o`: Address output (32-bits, registered). Carries the processed address related to the ongoing command.\n- `bl_o`: Burst length output (6-bits, registered). Holds the processed burst length for the operation.\n- `cmd_en_o`: Command enable output. Indicates when a command should be executed or accepted by the controller.\n- `wdp_valid_o`, `wdp_validB_o`, `wdp_validC_o`: Write data path valid signals. Indicate validity and readiness of data for the write operations in different contexts or stages.\n- `wr_addr_o`: Write address output (32-bits). Directly mirrors the input address for write operations.\n- `wr_bl_o`: Write burst length output (6-bits). Direct mirror of the input burst length for write operations.\n- `rdp_valid_o`: Read data path valid output. Signals the validity and readiness of data for read operations.\n- `rd_addr_o`: Read address output (32-bits). Direct mirror of the input address for read operations.\n- `rd_bl_o`: Read burst length output (6-bits). Direct mirror of the input burst length for read operations.\n\nExplanation: These outputs provide command, address, data path validation, and control signals that coordinate with the memory controller to execute memory operations effectively. They reflect the workings and status of the module to external components, ensuring proper data transactions and memory manipulations as dictated by internal logic and state management."

It synchronizes memory operations across various states such as ready, read, write, command wait, and refresh stages utilizing a Finite State Machine (FSM). Input ports include `clk_i` for clock input, `rst_i` for reset, and other signals like `cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_i`, `addr_i`, `bl_i`, indicating command validity, type, address, and burst length respectively. Outputs such as `cmd_rdy_o`, `cmd_o`, `addr_o`, and `bl_o` indicate the readiness to accept new commands and reflect the processed command, address, and burst length. Internal signals like `cmd_fifo_rdy`, `cmd_rd`, and `cmd_wr` handle the readiness of command FIFO and command types, ensuring proper responses to external commands and internal states. The code extensively manipulates these signals within an FSM that directs the module through its operation, managing state transitions based on input commands and system readiness, and thus controlling the signal flow and operations like read and write command processing. Internal maintenance of write and read operation flags like `wr_in_progress` helps in the module's logical decisions within various FSM states. These functional blocks are supported by signal assignments and always-blocks conditioned on clock edges, managing the transfer and execution of command and data operations effectively in synchronization with memory interface demands."
