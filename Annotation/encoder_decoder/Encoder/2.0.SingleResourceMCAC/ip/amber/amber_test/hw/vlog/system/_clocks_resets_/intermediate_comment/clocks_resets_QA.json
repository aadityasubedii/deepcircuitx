The module reads the input board clock signals (differential inputs i_brd_clk_p and i_brd_clk_n) and a board reset signal (i_brd_rst). It uses configuration specific to different FPGA families (like Xilinx Spartan-6 and Virtex-6) to create respective PLL configurations which generate output clocks such as o_clk_200 and the system clock o_sys_clk. It also generates a system reset signal (o_sys_rst) which is conditioned on both the input reset and the calibration completion signal (i_ddr_calib_done). The module contains synchronization logic to manage reset propagation and handling of DDR calibration done signal across clock domains to ensure system stability."

It is used to initiate a system-wide reset, clearing all internal states and starting many processes from an initial state.\n- i_brd_clk_n and i_brd_clk_p: These are differential clock inputs from the board providing the main operation clock for the module. They are typically used to generate stable internal clock signals after being processed through clock buffers and/or PLLs/MCMs.\n- i_ddr_calib_done: This signal indicates whether the DDR calibration process has completed successfully. It is used to conditionally release part of the system from reset.\n\nOutput ports: o_sys_rst, o_sys_clk, o_clk_200.\nExplanation:\n- o_sys_rst: The system reset output, which is generated based on the input reset condition combined with the DDR calibration completion status. This reset ensures that system components start operation only after essential configurations are accomplished.\n- o_sys_clk: The main system clock output derived from the PLL/MCM generated clock. This is used to drive synchronous logic within the system ensuring coherent operation across various system components.\n- o_clk_200: An auxiliary or additional output clock generated for specific operational needs within the system, derived directly from the boarded clock processed through differential signaling."
