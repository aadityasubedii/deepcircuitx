Module name: a23_register_bank. 

Module specification: The `a23_register_bank` module is designed as a crucial component of a microprocessor, managing the storage and update of registers based on various control signals and modes. It handles register data under multiple conditions and modes such as user, supervisor, and interrupt states, using input ports like `i_clk` for clock synchronization, and `i_mode_exec` for execution mode setting. Output ports like `o_rm`, `o_rs`, `o_rd`, and `o_pc` deliver the selected register values for use in further execution stages. Internal signals such as `r0` to `r15` represent general-purpose registers, with additional dedicated registers for interrupts and other modes (`r8_firq` to `r14_firq`, etc.). The module includes several internal blocks for register updates, signal assignments, and condition-based register selection, all contingent upon various status flags and mode settings. These functionalities are essential for operations like context switching and executing instructions with appropriate privilege levels, ensuring the processor operates efficiently and correctly under diverse conditions.
