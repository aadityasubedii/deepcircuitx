    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'infrastructure' module generates and manages clock and reset signals using a PLL, suitable for single-ended or differential input clocks. It outputs main and auxiliary clocks (clk0, sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180) and provides synchronized and asynchronous reset signals (rst0, async_rst). Internally, it uses clock buffers, PLL configurations, and reset synchronization mechanisms to ensure stable and precise clock distribution and system reset across various operational domains."
