    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"eth_clockgen\" module generates a configurable Ethernet clock (Mdc) for MAC operations. It utilizes a main clock (Clk), a reset signal (Reset), and a divider (Divider) to manage Mdc's frequency. Internal mechanisms include a countdown from a preset, toggling of Mdc upon countdown completion, and output enable signals (MdcEn, MdcEn_n) indicating Mdc transitions. The configuration ensures adaptive clock management based on divider adjustments."
