Module name: eth_random.

Module specification: The `eth_random` module is designed to generate pseudorandom numbers tailored for Ethernet operations, particularly to manage collision and backoff timing during retransmissions. It leverages a 10-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) to produce the random numbers, influenced by inputs such as transmission clock (`MTxClk`), reset signal (`Reset`), retry attempt count (`RetryCnt`), and data size information (`NibCnt`, `ByteCnt`). The outputs include `RandomEq0`, a boolean indicating if the latched random number equals zero, and `RandomEqByteCnt`, which checks if the latched number matches the byte count adjusted by significant bits of the nibble count. Internal signals such as `Feedback`, derived from XOR of bits in the `x` register, affect the bit shifting in the LFSR; and `Random`, which masks output bits based on `RetryCnt`. Several blocks exist within the code: 1) LFSR implementation managing the shift register `x`, 2) Calculation and conditional masking of `Random` based on `RetryCnt`, 3) Latching mechanism for `Random` into `RandomLatched` during specific states (`StateJam` and `StateJam_q`), and 4) Output logic that evaluates conditions for `RandomEq0` and `RandomEqByteCnt` to aid Ethernet protocol decision-making during packet retransmissions.
