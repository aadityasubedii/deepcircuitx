This module handles operations such as data writing, data reading, and exclusive access checks while interfacing with a wider memory system. It supports various operations including cache flushing, detecting hit or miss scenarios, filling the cache, and managing exclusive access to cache lines. The module uses a state machine to effectively manage different cache states and operations to maintain cache coherence and performance. Additionally, it is parameterizable with respect to the number of cache lines, words per line, and cache ways, allowing flexible adaptation to different system requirements."
