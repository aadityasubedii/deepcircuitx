Module name: eth_rxcounters.

Module specification: The `eth_rxcounters` module is fundamental in Ethernet frame reception for managing various operational counters. This includes registration and regulation of byte counts, CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) delay counters, and handling of the Inter Frame Gap (IFG) in accordance with the reception status and internal state machine. The module processes a clock signal (`MRxClk`) for synchronization, an asynchronous reset (`Reset`), data validity (`MRxDV`), and signals delineating the reception state (`StateIdle`, `StateSFD`, `StateData`, `StateDrop`, `StatePreamble`), among others as input. It outputs signals indicating specific counter conditions like `IFGCounterEq24`, byte count comparisons (`ByteCntEq0` to `ByteCntEq7`, etc.), and the current delayed byte count (`ByteCntOut`). Internally, it employs signals such as `ResetByteCounter` and `IncrementByteCounter` to manage the byte counting operations, alongside `ResetIFGCounter` and `IncrementIFGCounter` for IFG timing considerations. The code can be grouped based on its core functionalities: byte counter management, which handles incrementation and resets; CRC delay counter handling for frame validation adjustments; and IFG counter operations for timing between frames. Each part of the code is meticulously structured to ensure reliable frame processing, taking into account the various states of Ethernet frame reception, from idle through data reception to frame dropping or handling preamble detection, ultimately maintaining data integrity and correct frame boundaries.
