The module handles different configurations for generating addresses or other data patterns, specified by parameters such as `PRBS_WIDTH` and `PRBS_CMD`. LFSRs are used to generate sequences that mimic randomness, which are useful in testing and communication systems. The module accepts a seed as an input (`prbs_seed_i`) and initializes the LFSR with this seed when `prbs_seed_init` is high. Depending on the clock enable signal (`clk_en`), the LFSR updates its state and outputs a new PRBS value. The functionality diversifies for different command modes like \"ADDRESS,\" \"INSTR,\" or \"BLEN,\" adjusting the output `prbs_o` based on the architecture specified by the `FAMILY` parameter and the PRBS configurations."

It drives the timing for state changes within the module, such as the shift operations in the linear feedback shift register (LFSR).\n- `prbs_seed_init`: Seed initialization control signal. When high, it initializes the LFSR with the value provided on the `prbs_seed_i` input.\n- `clk_en`: Clock enable. This signal enables the state update of the LFSR, allowing the module to generate a new PRBS value with each clock cycle when high.\n- `prbs_seed_i`: PRBS seed input. This bus provides the initial value for the LFSR when `prbs_seed_init` is high. The width of this input is determined by `SEED_WIDTH`.\n\nOutput ports: `prbs_o`.\nExplanation:\n- `prbs_o`: PRBS output. This bus outputs the pseudorandom binary sequence generated by the LFSR. The output sequence is used as a PRBS in various applications. The width of this output is also `SEED_WIDTH`, matching the input seed width."
