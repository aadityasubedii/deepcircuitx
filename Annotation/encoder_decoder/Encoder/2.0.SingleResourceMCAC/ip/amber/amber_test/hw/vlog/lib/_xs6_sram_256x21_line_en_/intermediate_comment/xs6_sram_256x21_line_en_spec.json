It supports a 21-bit data interface over an 8-bit address space. The module takes an input clock signal (i_clk), input data (i_write_data), a write enable signal (i_write_enable), and an address (i_address). It outputs data (o_read_data) read from the desired address. This memory interface allows data writing and reading operations based on the write enable signal, organizing data into high and low parts for storage and retrieval, while ensuring that warning messages are displayed if data width or address width parameters are incorrectly set."
