    "module": "Module-level comment: This module implements a 2048x32-bit SRAM with byte-enable functionality using four Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA RAMB16BWER primitives. It supports read and write operations with byte-level granularity, allowing selective writing to individual bytes within a 32-bit word. The design operates on a single clock domain and uses a read-first write mode. The SRAM can be initialized with predefined values using initialization parameters for each RAM block."
