Module name: cmd_gen. Module specification: The cmd_gen module generates memory commands for a memory interface, producing address, instruction, and burst length outputs based on various input parameters and modes. It supports different address generation modes (BRAM, fixed, PRBS, sequential), instruction types, and burst length options. The module takes inputs such as clk_i (clock), rst_i (reset), run_traffic_i (enables command generation), rd_buff_avail_i (indicates available read buffer space), and various mode and configuration signals. It outputs addr_o (generated address), instr_o (generated instruction), bl_o (burst length), and cmd_o_vld (command validity). Internal signals include address counters, PRBS generators, mode registers, and control flags. The module is divided into sections for address generation, instruction generation, burst length calculation, and output pipeline management. It incorporates features like refresh
