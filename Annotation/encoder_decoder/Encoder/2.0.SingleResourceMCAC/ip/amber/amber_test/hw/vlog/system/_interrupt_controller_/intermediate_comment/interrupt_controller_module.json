    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'interrupt_controller' handles interrupt and fast interrupt requests via the Wishbone bus, managing sources like UARTs, Ethernet MAC, and timers. It utilizes internal registers for enabling/disabling interrupts, aggregating signals, and controlling read/write transactions. Detailed outputs are generated for IRQs and FIRQs based on the active statuses of various interrupt registers, while Wishbone interactions are handled through specific address-driven logic blocks for robust system response."
