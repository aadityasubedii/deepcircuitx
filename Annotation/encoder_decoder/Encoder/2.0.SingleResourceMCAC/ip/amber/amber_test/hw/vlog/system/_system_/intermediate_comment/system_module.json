    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/* \nThis top-level system module integrates an embedded processor (A23/A25) with memory \ninterfaces, peripherals, and a Wishbone bus for inter-module communication. It implements \nclock/reset management, memory controllers (including DDR3 for FPGAs), UART and Ethernet \ninterfaces, timers, and an interrupt controller. The module uses conditional compilation \nfor FPGA-specific features and supports various I/O interfaces for system integration.\n*/"
