Module-level comment: The `data_prbs_gen` module generates a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). It initializes with provided seeds on reset or command, then continuously shifts and xors bits in response to a clock input, outputting the PRBS. It employs internal registers for real-time PRBS updates and a parameterized mechanism, ensuring adaptability in testing scenarios.
