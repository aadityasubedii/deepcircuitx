Module-level comment: 
/**
 * DDR3 Memory Controller Interface
 * 
 * This module interfaces with DDR3 SDRAM, providing a 128-bit bi-directional port for data transfer.
 * It uses configurable parameters for clock, memory specs, and port configurations.
 * The module instantiates an infrastructure block for clock/reset management and a memory controller
 * wrapper for DDR3 operations. It supports multiple ports (p0-p5) for command, write, and read operations,
 * enabling flexible memory access from other system components.
