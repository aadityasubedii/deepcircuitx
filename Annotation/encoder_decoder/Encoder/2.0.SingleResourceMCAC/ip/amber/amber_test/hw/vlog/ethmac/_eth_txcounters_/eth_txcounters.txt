Module-level comment: The `eth_txcounters` module manages transmission counters for Ethernet frames, handling nibble and byte counts across various transmission states (preamble, IPG, data, etc.). It implements its functionality through conditional logic that increments or resets these counters based on state transitions and control signals like MTxClk and Reset. This is bolstered with condition checks for frame size constraints and error conditions, ensuring adherence to Ethernet transmission standards.
