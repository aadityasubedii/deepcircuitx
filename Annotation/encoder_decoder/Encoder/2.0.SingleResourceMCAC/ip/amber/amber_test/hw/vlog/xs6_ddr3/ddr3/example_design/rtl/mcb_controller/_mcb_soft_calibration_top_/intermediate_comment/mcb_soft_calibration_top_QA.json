It handles both initial setups, such as memory timing and impedance adjustments, and dynamic calibrations during operation. Inputs to control and monitor the calibration include clocks, reset signals, and various status indicators. The module operates by interacting with an IODRP (I/O Delay and Routing Programmable) block and IO Buffers to properly manage signal timings and interface requirements necessary for memory operations. It is configurable through parameters to adapt to different types of memory (e.g., DDR, DDR2, DDR3) and can skip certain calibration steps based on parameter settings."
