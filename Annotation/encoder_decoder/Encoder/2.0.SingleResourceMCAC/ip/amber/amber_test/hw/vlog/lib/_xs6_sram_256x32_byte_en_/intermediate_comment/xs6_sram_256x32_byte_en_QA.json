The RAM can store 256 32-bit entries, with individual byte enable control for partial writes. It operates on a single clock for both reading and writing activities. The module allows writing or reading from specific locations in the memory array defined by `i_address`. Byte enables are controlled by `i_byte_enable` to selectively write to particular bytes of the 32-bit data word."

Each bit corresponds to one byte of the 32-bit data.\n\nOutput ports: \n[o_read_data]. \nExplanation: \n- `o_read_data`: The 32-bit output data read from the memory.
