Module-level comment: The `boot_mem128` module interfaces with a Wishbone bus for memory operations, supporting 128-bit data and configurable address widths. It handles read and write transactions with signals for starting operations, byte selection, data handling, and address decoding. Debug features introduce operation timing variations. The module includes conditional compilations for FPGA-specific configurations, ensuring adaptability across different hardware setups.
