Module name: boot_mem128. Module specification: The `boot_mem128` module serves as a memory interface tailored for interfacing with a Wishbone bus, focusing on data transfers. This module supports read and write operations with an input clock (`i_wb_clk`), reset (`i_wb_rst`), address (`i_wb_adr`), byte selection signals (`i_wb_sel`), write enable (`i_wb_we`), data input (`i_wb_dat`), bus cycle (`i_wb_cyc`), and strobe (`i_wb_stb`). It outputs data (`o_wb_dat`), an acknowledgment signal (`o_wb_ack`), and a static error signal (`o_wb_err`, always set to 0 indicating no error handling). Internally, the module uses signals like `start_write` and `start_read` to control memory operations, utilizes `byte_enable` for selective data writing, and `address` to handle specific memory addressing. In debugging modes, `jitter_r` and `start_read_r` introduce artificial timing variations or delays. Configurable sections adapt the module for specific hardware or operational parameters. The memory is either an FPGA-specific configuration or a more generic setup, controlled through conditional compilation blocks. These blocks ensure flexibility across different hardware setups, such as Xilinx and generic FPGAs, supporting variations in memory configurations through included parameter files.
