Module-level comment: 
/*
This module generates various data patterns for memory interface testing.
It supports fixed, walking ones/zeros, address-driven, PRBS, and hammer patterns.
The module uses configurable parameters and input signals to select and generate
patterns. It implements pattern generation logic for different data widths (32/64/128 bits)
and DQ pin configurations. The module uses combinational and sequential logic to
produce the desired patterns based on the selected mode and input controls.
