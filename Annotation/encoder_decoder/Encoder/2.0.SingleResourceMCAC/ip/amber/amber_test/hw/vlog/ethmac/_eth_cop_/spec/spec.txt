Module name: eth_cop. Module specification: The eth_cop is a Verilog module designed as a WISHBONE-compatible interconnect multiplexer focused on Ethernet applications, facilitating communication and data exchange between two master devices (m1 and m2) and two slave devices (s1 and s2). It arbitrates access and prioritizes requests based on masters' inputs, while synchronously propagating signals related to addressing, data transfer, and control between the masters and slaves. The module listens to clock and reset signals through inputs `wb_clk_i` and `wb_rst_i`. Master inputs include address (`m1_wb_adr_i`, `m2_wb_adr_i`), select signals (`m1_wb_sel_i`, `m2_wb_sel_i`), write enables (`m1_wb_we_i`, `m2_wb_we_i`), data signals (`m1_wb_dat_i`, `m2_wb_dat_i`), cycle (`m1_wb_cyc_i`, `m2_wb_cyc_i`) and strobe (`m1_wb_stb_i`, `m2_wb_stb_i`). Outputs directed to the masters comprise data (`m1_wb_dat_o`, `m2_wb_dat_o`), acknowledgments (`m1_wb_ack_o`, `m2_wb_ack_o`), and error signals (`m1_wb_err_o`, `m2_wb_err_o`). Slave-related outputs include addresses (`s1_wb_adr_o`, `s2_wb_adr_o`), selects (`s1_wb_sel_o`, `s2_wb_sel_o`), writes (`s1_wb_we_o`, `s2_wb_we_o`), data (`s1_wb_dat_o`, `s2_wb_dat_o`), cycles (`s1_wb_cyc_o`, `s2_wb_cyc_o`), and strobes (`s1_wb_stb_o`, `s2_wb_stb_o`). Internal signals such as `m1_in_progress`, `m2_in_progress`, and various control signals orchestrate the flow and state of data transactions, ensuring accurate and error-free communication. The module's logic is partitioned into blocks for initializing state on reset, processing requests and commands for each master, data forwarding to the appropriate slave based on addressing, handling acknowledgments and errors, and monitoring conditions for halting operation on detected errors, thereby providing robust and resilient communication for Ethernet-based systems.
