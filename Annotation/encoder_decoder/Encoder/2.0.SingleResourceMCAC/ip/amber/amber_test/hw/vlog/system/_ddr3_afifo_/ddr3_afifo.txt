Module-level comment: The `ddr3_afifo` module implements asynchronous FIFOs to interface between system and DDR clock domains for DDR3 memory operations. It consists of three FIFOs managed by `i_sys_clk` and `i_ddr_clk` for commands, writes, and reads. These FIFOs ensure data integrity and synchronization between differing clock domains, effectively handling full and empty states and providing seamless data transactions.
