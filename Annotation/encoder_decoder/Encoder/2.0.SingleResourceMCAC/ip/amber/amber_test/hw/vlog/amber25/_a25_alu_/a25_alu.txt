Module-level comment: The `a25_alu` module is a versatile Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) intended for executing diverse arithmetic and logical operations on two 32-bit inputs based on control signals. It supports input swapping, negation, and carry adjustment via a set of control signals derived from a 9-bit `i_function` input. Internally, it uses conditional compilation for specific FPGA architectures to optimize implementations of addition and subtraction. The output includes both the operation result and status flags indicating result characteristics like zero, carry out, or overflow.
