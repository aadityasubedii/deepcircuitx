Module name: mcb_traffic_gen. 
Module specification: The 'mcb_traffic_gen' module serves as a comprehensive traffic generator targeting memory controller blocks (MCBs), designed primarily to test and ensure proper function of memory controllers via simulation of various memory operation scenarios. It accommodates a variety of input ports like `clk_i` (clock input), `rst_i` (reset input), and `run_traffic_i` (control signal to regulate traffic generation) among others to configure and control the memory operation simulations which include starting and ending addresses, command and data seeds, and various operational modes determined by instructions like fixed burst lengths, address modes, and data patterns. Output ports such as `mcb_cmd_en_o` (command enable output), `mcb_wr_en_o` (write enable output), and `mcb_rd_en_o` (read enable output) drive the enactment of these operations in the MCB environment. The module utilizes internal signals like `cmd2flow_addr` (address transitions between command and flow controls) and `rdpath_rd_data_i` (data read from the memory path) to facilitate the operational logic. Significant code blocks include command generation (`cmd_gen`), flow control (`mcb_flow_control`), and data path management (`read_data_path`, `write_data_path`), each intricately designed to manage specific facets of memory traffic simulation. This structure ensures versatility and robustness in generating and managing memory access patterns, making the 'mcb_traffic_gen' indispensable for testing memory controller efficiency and reliability under varied and potentially rigorous scenarios.
