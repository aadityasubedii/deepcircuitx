    "spec": "Module name: read_posted_fifo. Module specification: The `read_posted_fifo` module primarily functions as a FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer system designed for hardware memory interfaces managing data storage and retrieval with burst capabilities. This module synchronizes data writing and reading to and from the FIFO under varying operational conditions dictated by input signals. The inputs include `clk_i` for clock synchronization, `rst_i` for resetting the module, command and data validity signals (`cmd_valid_i`, `data_valid_i`), address (`addr_i`), burst length (`bl_i`), and control signals (`cmd_sent`, `bl_sent`, `cmd_en_i`, `gen_rdy_i`, `user_bl_cnt_is_1`, `rd_mdata_fifo_empty`). These manage the flow and processing of both commands and data. The outputs of the module include `cmd_rdy_o`, signaling command readiness, `gen_valid_o`, `gen_addr_o`, `gen_bl_o` for FIFO data output status, and `rd_buff_avail_o`, `rd_mdata_en` for internal buffer management and metadata reading enablement.\n\nInternally, the module utilizes several registers and flags such as `empty_r`, `rd_first_data`, `rd_en`, `data_valid_r`, `user_bl_cnt_not_1`, `buf_avail_r`, close tracking of data flow (`rd_data_received_counts`, `rd_data_counts_asked`) and buffer space management (`dfifo_has_enough_room`, `wait_cnt`, `wait_done`), controlling data reads and writes within operational constraints. The module includes an instance of an `afifo` module, configured with parameters extracted from input signals for burst management and buffer space optimization. Additionally, logic and counters in the module orchestrate signal-based actions like reset handling, command processing readiness, wait period management after command receipt, and data read/write enablement synchronized with external system demands. This comprehensive setup ensures robust management of data flow essential for performance-sensitive memory operations in hardware interfaces.",

                    "text": "Module name: read_posted_fifo. Module specification: The `read_posted_fifo` module primarily functions as a FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer system designed for hardware memory interfaces managing data storage and retrieval with burst capabilities. This module synchronizes data writing and reading to and from the FIFO under varying operational conditions dictated by input signals. The inputs include `clk_i` for clock synchronization, `rst_i` for resetting the module, command and data validity signals (`cmd_valid_i`, `data_valid_i`), address (`addr_i`), burst length (`bl_i`), and control signals (`cmd_sent`, `bl_sent`, `cmd_en_i`, `gen_rdy_i`, `user_bl_cnt_is_1`, `rd_mdata_fifo_empty`). These manage the flow and processing of both commands and data. The outputs of the module include `cmd_rdy_o`, signaling command readiness, `gen_valid_o`, `gen_addr_o`, `gen_bl_o` for FIFO data output status, and `rd_buff_avail_o`, `rd_mdata_en` for internal buffer management and metadata reading enablement.\n\nInternally, the module utilizes several registers and flags such as `empty_r`, `rd_first_data`, `rd_en`, `data_valid_r`, `user_bl_cnt_not_1`, `buf_avail_r`, close tracking of data flow (`rd_data_received_counts`, `rd_data_counts_asked`) and buffer space management (`dfifo_has_enough_room`, `wait_cnt`, `wait_done`), controlling data reads and writes within operational constraints. The module includes an instance of an `afifo` module, configured with parameters extracted from input signals for burst management and buffer space optimization. Additionally, logic and counters in the module orchestrate signal-based actions like reset handling, command processing readiness, wait period management after command receipt, and data read/write enablement synchronized with external system demands. This comprehensive setup ensures robust management of data flow essential for performance-sensitive memory operations in hardware interfaces."
