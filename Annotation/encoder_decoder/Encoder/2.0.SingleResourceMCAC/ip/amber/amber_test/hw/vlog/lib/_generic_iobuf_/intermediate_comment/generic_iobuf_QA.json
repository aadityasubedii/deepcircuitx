It features an output 'O', an inout 'IO', an input 'I', and an input 'T'. The functionality can be described by two main operations: \n1. The output 'O' is directly assigned the value present on 'IO', thus it reflects the state of the bidirectional IO pin.\n2. The bidirectional pin 'IO' is controlled based on the value of 'T'. If 'T' is high (true), 'IO' is set to high impedance ('1'bz), making it effectively disconnected and allowing other devices on the bus to drive the line. If 'T' is low (false), 'IO' is driven by the input 'I', actively setting the value of the pin based on 'I'. This behavior enables 'IO' to serve either as an input or an output based on the control signal 'T', thus acting as a buffer."
