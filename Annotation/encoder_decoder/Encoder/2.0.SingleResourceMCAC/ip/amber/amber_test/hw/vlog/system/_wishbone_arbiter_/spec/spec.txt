**Module name:** wishbone_arbiter

**Module specification:** The 'wishbone_arbiter' module is designed to control and manage access to a Wishbone bus interface among multiple master devices. The module ensures that only one master can access the bus at a time to prevent bus contention. It manages bus transactions by dynamically selecting which master device should control the bus based on ongoing transactions and request statuses. The module operates with two master devices and eight slave devices, exchanging data, address, and control signals through input and output ports. Key input ports include clock (`i_wb_clk`), addresses (`i_m0_wb_adr`, `i_m1_wb_adr`), data inputs (`i_m0_wb_dat`, `i_m1_wb_dat`), and control signals like write enable and strobe signals. Corresponding output ports provide data, acknowledge, and error signals to master devices along with address and control signals to slave devices. Internally, the module uses several signals such as `current_master`, `next_master`, and hold registers (`m0_wb_hold_r`, `m1_wb_hold_r`) to manage which master controls the bus, along with `master_adr`, `master_sel`, and other routing signals that direct the transaction parameters from the active master to the selected slave. The Verilog code is organized into sections handling the initialization of parameters, assignments of current and next masters based on the bus cycle status, various signal assignments for slave selection, data handling, and error management. This structured approach ensures synchronized and error-free data management amongst multiple masters and slaves within a hardware system.
