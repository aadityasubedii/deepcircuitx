Module name: eth_maccontrol

Module specification: The `eth_maccontrol` module is designed for controlling the logic involved in transmitting and receiving Ethernet frames within the MAC (Media Access Control) layer. It integrates functionalities for handling frame control signals such as initializing transmission, aborting processes, and marking frames as done. It uses input ports like `MTxClk` and `MRxClk` for synchronize operations, `TxReset` and `RxReset` for resetting the transmissions, and `TPauseRq` for handling pause requests, among others. The module outputs data and control signals about the transmission status through ports like `TxDataOut`, `TxDoneOut`, and `TxAbortOut`. Key internal signals include `TxUsedDataOutDetected` for marking the data usage, and `MuxedDone` and `MuxedAbort` which are used to control final output signals based on the transaction status. The code structure is divided into two major sub-modules: `eth_receivecontrol` which manages all reception-related functionalities such as reception end and validity checks, and `eth_transmitcontrol` which caters to all transmission-related controls including the handling of pause and control frames. Together, these elements make the `eth_maccontrol` a comprehensive module for managing Ethernet frame transmissions at the MAC layer.
