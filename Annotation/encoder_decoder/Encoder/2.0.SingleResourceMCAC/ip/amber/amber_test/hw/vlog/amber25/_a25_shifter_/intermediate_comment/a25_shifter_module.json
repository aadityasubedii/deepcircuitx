    "module": "Module-level comment: The `a25_shifter` module executes bit shifting on a 32-bit input, supporting LSL, LSR, ASR, and ROR operations. It uses input ports like `i_in`, `i_carry_in`, and `i_shift_amount` to determine the shift specifics and processes these using conditional logic within `generate` blocks. This facilitates both full-barrel and quick shift mechanisms, controlled by the `FULL_BARREL` parameter, ultimately producing results via multiplexed internal signals reflecting the selected shift type."
