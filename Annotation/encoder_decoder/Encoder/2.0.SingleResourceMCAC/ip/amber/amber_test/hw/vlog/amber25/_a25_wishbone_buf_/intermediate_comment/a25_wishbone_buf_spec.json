    "spec": "Module name: a25_wishbone_buf.\n\nModule specification: The a25_wishbone_buf is a Verilog module designed to function as a buffer interface for the Wishbone bus protocol, which focuses primarily on managing data transactions such as read and write operations. The module consists of input ports including `clk` (clock input for synchronization), `reset` (asynchronous reset), `scan_enable` and `test_mode` (for testing purposes), `i_req` (indicates an incoming request), `i_write` (specifies the type of operation), `i_wdata` (data for write operations), `i_be` (byte enables for data), `i_addr` (address for operations), `i_accepted` (signal from the connected device indicating operation acceptance), `i_rdata` (data read from the bus), and `i_rdata_valid` (validity of the read data). The output ports include `o_rdata` (data output during read), `o_ack` (acknowledgment signal), `o_valid` (validity of the output data), `o_write` (indicates if output is a write operation), `o_wdata` (data to be written to the connected device), `o_be` (byte enables for outgoing data), and `o_addr` (address for output operations). Internal signals such as `wbuf_used_r`, `wbuf_wdata_r`, `wbuf_addr_r`, `wbuf_be_r`, `wbuf_write_r`, `wbuf_wp_r`, `wbuf_rp_r`, `busy_reading_r`, `wait_rdata_valid_r`, `in_wreq`, `ack_owed_r`, `push`, and `pop` facilitate the control and management of data flow, including buffer operations, data integrity, and synchronization. The module's code is divided into blocks that handle buffer management (push/pop operations and pointer updates), output assignments, acknowledgment handling, and status flags for read operations, ensuring that the module efficiently manages the complexities of read/write operations and buffer management within a synchronous environment.\n",

The module consists of input ports including `clk` (clock input for synchronization), `reset` (asynchronous reset), `scan_enable` and `test_mode` (for testing purposes), `i_req` (indicates an incoming request), `i_write` (specifies the type of operation), `i_wdata` (data for write operations), `i_be` (byte enables for data), `i_addr` (address for operations), `i_accepted` (signal from the connected device indicating operation acceptance), `i_rdata` (data read from the bus), and `i_rdata_valid` (validity of the read data). The output ports include `o_rdata` (data output during read), `o_ack` (acknowledgment signal), `o_valid` (validity of the output data), `o_write` (indicates if output is a write operation), `o_wdata` (data to be written to the connected device), `o_be` (byte enables for outgoing data), and `o_addr` (address for output operations). Internal signals such as `wbuf_used_r`, `wbuf_wdata_r`, `wbuf_addr_r`, `wbuf_be_r`, `wbuf_write_r`, `wbuf_wp_r`, `wbuf_rp_r`, `busy_reading_r`, `wait_rdata_valid_r`, `in_wreq`, `ack_owed_r`, `push`, and `pop` facilitate the control and management of data flow, including buffer operations, data integrity, and synchronization. The module's code is divided into blocks that handle buffer management (push/pop operations and pointer updates), output assignments, acknowledgment handling, and status flags for read operations, ensuring that the module efficiently manages the complexities of read/write operations and buffer management within a synchronous environment.\n"
