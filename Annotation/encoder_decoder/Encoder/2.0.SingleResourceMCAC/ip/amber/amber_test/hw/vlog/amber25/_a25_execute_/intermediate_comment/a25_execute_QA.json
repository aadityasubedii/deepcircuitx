It takes in signals related to program counter management, memory access, ALU operation setup, and processor status flags. This module performs operations like data processing, memory address calculation, status flags updates, and handles conditional execution based on processor flags. It also processes details for privileged mode settings, interrupt, and exception handling necessary to execute ARM instructions correctly.

It's used to synchronize the execution of operations within the module with the rest of the system.\n2. `reset`: A signal to reset the internal state of the module. Upon activation, it brings the module to a known state.\n3. `scan_enable`, `test_mode`: Used for testing purposes, these inputs enable various test modes and scan chains for diagnostics and verification.\n4. `i_core_stall`, `i_mem_stall`: These signals indicate stall conditions from the core and memory subsystem, respectively. If asserted, they can delay operations to ensure correct execution and data coherence.\n5. `i_wb_read_data`, `i_copro_read_data`: Data inputs from the write-back stage and coprocessor, respectively.
