It stores data entries based on the parameter 'DSIZE' and has an adjustable depth defined by 'FIFO_DEPTH'. The FIFO ensures data integrity by using Gray code counters to manage read and write pointers, thereby preventing common clock domain crossing issues such as data corruption or loss. Additional outputs include flags for 'full', 'empty', and 'almost_full', which aid in managing the FIFO's state and providing control signals to other parts of the system interfacing with this FIFO."
