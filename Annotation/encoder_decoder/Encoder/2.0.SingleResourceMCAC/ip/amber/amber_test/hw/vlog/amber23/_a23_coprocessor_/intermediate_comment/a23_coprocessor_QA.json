This includes enabling or disabling cache, flushing the cache, defining cacheable areas, and managing fault statuses and addresses. It reacts to different coprocessor operations specified by `i_copro_opcode1`, `i_copro_opcode2`, and other input signals, altering internal registers and outputting relevant data based on these inputs. The module operates synchronously with the system clock `i_clk` and respects the `i_fetch_stall` signal, which pauses operations when asserted. Various debug messages are conditionally compiled which helps in tracing the internal states and operations, thereby facilitating easier debugging and verification of the coprocessor's behavior."
