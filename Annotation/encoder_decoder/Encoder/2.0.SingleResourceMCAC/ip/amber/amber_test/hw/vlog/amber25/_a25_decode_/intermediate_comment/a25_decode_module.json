    "module": "This module decodes ARM instructions and generates control signals for an ARM processor core. It processes incoming instructions, determines their types, and manages various operations including register operations, memory transfers, branches, and coprocessor interactions. The module implements a state machine to handle different execution stages, incorporates logic for interrupt handling and pipeline control, and manages conditional execution. It includes specialized blocks for multiple register transfers, multiplication operations, and coprocessor communications. The module also detects and resolves conflicts, handles abort conditions, and manages processor status bits, playing a crucial role in the overall operation of the ARM processor."
