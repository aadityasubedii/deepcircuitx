Module-level comment: The 'iodrp_controller' module manages memory read/write operations using a Dynamic Reconfigurable Port (DRP). It operates through a finite state machine (FSM) to handle command sequences, supported by input handling for address and data, and output control for signaling and data transfer. The module uses internal registers and control signals to store command info, shift data, and manage state transitions, effectively controlling the memory device based on the operation mode (read or write) specified by inputs.
