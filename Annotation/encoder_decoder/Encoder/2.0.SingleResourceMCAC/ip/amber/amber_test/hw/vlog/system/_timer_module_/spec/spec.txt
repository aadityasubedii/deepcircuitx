Module name: timer_module. 

Module specification: The timer_module is designed for managing three independent timers, handling their count-down operations, and interfacing with a Wishbone bus. It operates with configurable 32-bit or 128-bit data widths for the bus, supporting read and write transactions. The input ports include the clock signal (i_clk), Wishbone interface signals such as address (i_wb_adr), data (i_wb_dat), byte select (i_wb_sel), write enable (i_wb_we), cycle valid (i_wb_cyc), and strobe (i_wb_stb) signals. The output ports encompass Wishbone data output (o_wb_dat), acknowledge (o_wb_ack), error (o_wb_err) signals, and individual timer interrupt signals (o_timer_int). Internal signals include wb_start_write and wb_start_read which control the initiation of write and read processes respectively, and wb_start_read_d1, a registered version of wb_start_read used to manage state transitions. The code is structured into blocks handling read and write actions distinctively: setting control registers, loading values, managing timer countdowns and interrupts, and interacting with the Wishbone bus. Each timerâ€™s countdown behavior can be programmed to either stop or reload upon reaching zero. The module also provides debug messaging during read or write operations and captures real-time errors or misconfigurations.
