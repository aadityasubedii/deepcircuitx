Module name: eth_top. Module specification: The eth_top module is the top-level module for an Ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) implementation. It integrates various sub-modules to handle Ethernet communication, including MIIM for PHY management, MAC control for flow control and pause frames, transmit and receive Ethernet MAC for packet processing, Wishbone interface for CPU communication, and MAC status monitoring. The module has numerous input and output ports, including Wishbone bus interfaces, Ethernet physical layer signals, management interface signals, and interrupt outputs. Key input ports include clocks (wb_clk_i, mtx_clk_pad_i, mrx_clk_pad_i), reset (wb_rst_i), Wishbone slave interface signals, and Ethernet receive signals. Output ports include Wishbone master interface signals, Ethernet transmit signals, and interrupt signals. The module uses a wide array of
