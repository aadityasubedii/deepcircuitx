Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM memory device, implementing features such as initialization sequence, mode register settings, refresh operations, power-down modes, and various timing checks. It has input ports for control signals (rst_n, ck, ck_n, cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address and bank selection (ba, addr), data mask/termination (dm_tdqs), and data I/O (dq, dqs, dqs_n), with an output port for termination (tdqs_n). The module uses internal signals to track timing parameters, manage operation modes, and control data transfer. Key internal components include clock timing management, command decoding and execution, data read/write operations, and extensive timing checks to ensure compliance with DDR3 SDRAM specifications.
