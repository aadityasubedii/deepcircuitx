These operations include logical left shift (LSL), logical right shift (LSR), arithmetic right shift (ASR), and rotate right (ROR). The selection of the shift operation is determined by the 'i_function' input. Additionally, the module can handle a carry input and provides an updated carry output, which integrates with the shifting operations, particularly influenced by a provided shift amount. The module also supports zero shifting under determined conditions (i.e., when 'i_shift_imm_zero' is true). This functionality is critical in computer architecture for efficient bit manipulation, often required in arithmetic, cryptographic, and data handling algorithms."

The additional bit compared to the input width allows storage of the output carry bit, providing necessary information for chained operations or multi-precision arithmetic.\n- lsr_out: Similar to 'lsl_out' but for logical right shift (LSR). This 33-bit signal stores the result of the LSR operation along with the carry-out bit which might be generated if 'i_carry_in' is used as an input bit in the shifting process.\n- asr_out: This 33-bit wide signal serves the same purpose as the other shift outputs but specifically for the arithmetic right shift (ASR) operation. ASR considers the sign bit and extends it during the shift, hence the output requires capturing the sign extension along with the shifted bits and the carry-out.\n- ror_out: This is used to store the result of the rotate right (ROR) operation. The 33-bit width accommodates the circular nature of rotation where the bits shifted out from one end are reintroduced at the other. The wide signal helps in retaining the carry structure that is crucial for rotate operations."
