Module name: xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en. Module specification: The xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en is a Verilog module that simulates a synchronous dual-port RAM with byte enable features, primarily targeting a Xilinx RAMB8BWER block for implementation. It is designed to handle 256 entries of 32-bit data, supporting partial writes through byte enable functionality. The module takes a single clock `i_clk` for synchronizing read and write operations, a 32-bit data input `i_write_data` for the data to be written, a control signal `i_write_enable` to trigger write operations, an 8-bit address `i_address` to specify the memory location for read/write operations, and a 4-bit `i_byte_enable` to control byte-wise writing within the 32-bit data word. The output `o_read_data` furnishes the 32-bit data read from the memory at the specified address. Internal signals include `nc31`, `nc32`, `nc33`, `nc22` as non-connected signal placeholders to fulfill interface requirements of the RAM block with no functional influence, and `wea`, a 4-bit signal derived from `i_write_enable` and `i_byte_enable` determining which bytes are enabled for writing. The code sets up the RAM block with specified configurations for data width, operational modes, and collision checks, connecting necessary ports for reading and writing operations. Diagnostics via initial blocks ensure that the module parameters meet specific width requirements, preventing configuration errors during synthesis.
