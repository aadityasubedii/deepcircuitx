    "module": "This module performs soft calibration for a memory controller block (MCB), optimizing timing parameters and termination impedances for DDR memory interfaces. It implements a state machine that progresses through initialization, RZQ/ZIO calibration, input termination, DQS delay adjustment, and dynamic calibration stages. The module interacts with IODRP controllers to configure I/O settings, communicates with the MCB for calibration operations, and adjusts DQS delays based on measured values. It handles self-refresh requests, manages calibration cycles, and provides control signals for MCB operation, ensuring optimal memory performance and signal integrity."
