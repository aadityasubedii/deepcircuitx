Module name: generic_iobuf. Module specification: The "generic_iobuf" module serves as a generic bidirectional Input/Output (IO) buffer in Verilog, designed to manage signal flow between internal circuitry and external pins. It contains an input port 'I', a control input 'T', an output port 'O', and a bidirectional port 'IO'. The port 'I' serves as the data input which can be driven out through the 'IO' port when 'T' is low. The control input 'T' determines the behavior of 'IO': if 'T' is high, 'IO' is set to a high impedance state ('1'bz), effectively disconnecting it, and if 'T' is low, 'IO' outputs the value of 'I'. The output port 'O' mirrors the current value on the 'IO' pin, facilitating the monitoring or processing of this signal internally. There are no additional internal signals defined within this module; it directly manipulates and reflects the states of its ports. The module includes two primary assignments: 'O' is assigned the value of 'IO', and 'IO' is conditionally assigned based on 'T'. These assignments ensure the module's functionality in switching between input and output modes, conforming to the control signal 'T', allowing the module to act efficiently as an IO buffer.
