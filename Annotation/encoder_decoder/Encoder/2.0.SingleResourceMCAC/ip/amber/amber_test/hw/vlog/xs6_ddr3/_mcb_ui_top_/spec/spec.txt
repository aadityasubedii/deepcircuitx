Module name: mcb_ui_top. Module specification: This module serves as a top-level wrapper for a memory controller block (MCB) interface, integrating various components including AXI interfaces, MCB raw wrapper, and BUFPLL_MCB for clock management. It supports up to 6 ports, configurable as either native MCB interfaces or AXI interfaces. The module handles address translation, arbitration, and data transfer between user interfaces and the memory controller. Input ports include clock signals, reset signals, arbitration enables, command signals, write/read signals, AXI interface signals, and various control signals for memory operations and calibration. Output ports include buffered clock signals, status signals for command and data operations, memory interface signals, calibration status signals, and AXI interface response signals. Internal signals serve as intermediaries between the module's inputs/outputs and its submodules, including masked versions of AXI
