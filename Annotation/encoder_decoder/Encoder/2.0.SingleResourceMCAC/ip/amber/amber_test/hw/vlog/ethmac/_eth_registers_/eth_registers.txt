Module-level comment: This module implements an Ethernet controller register file, managing configuration settings and status information. It handles read/write operations for various registers (MAC address, interrupts, MII management, etc.) using address decoding and write enable logic. The module processes input data and control signals, updates internal registers, and generates output signals for Ethernet controller configuration. It also manages interrupt flags and synchronization across clock domains for transmit and receive control interrupts.
