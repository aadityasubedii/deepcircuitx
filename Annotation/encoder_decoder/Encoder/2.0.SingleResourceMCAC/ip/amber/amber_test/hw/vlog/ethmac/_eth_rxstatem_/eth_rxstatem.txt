Module-level comment: The eth_rxstatem module manages the reception states of an Ethernet receiver through a state machine. It uses inputs like MRxClk, MRxDV, and various flags to transition between IDLE, DROP, PREAMBLE, SFD, and DATA states. Output ports reflect the current state. State transitions are controlled by internal signals derived from input conditions, updated on clock edges or system resets to assure correct receive logic behavior under varying data reception scenarios.
