Key inputs include `i_clk` (clock signal), `i_mem_ctrl` (memory control), `i_wb_adr` (Wishbone address), `i_wb_sel` (byte select signals), `i_wb_we` (write enable), and data buses `i_wb_dat` (input data) and `i_rd_data` (DDR memory output data).

Module specification: The 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge' module provides an interface between a Wishbone bus protocol and a DDR3 memory controller, handling data read and write transactions. It aligns data, generates control signals, and manages command and data queuing. Key inputs include `i_clk` (clock signal), `i_mem_ctrl` (memory control), `i_wb_adr` (Wishbone address), `i_wb_sel` (byte select signals), `i_wb_we` (write enable), and data buses `i_wb_dat` (input data) and `i_rd_data` (DDR memory output data). Control status signals from DDR, such as `i_cmd_full`, `i_wr_full`, and `i_rd_empty`, indicate queue statuses. Outputs include `o_wb_dat` (output data to Wishbone), `o_wb_ack` (transaction acknowledge), `o_wb_err` (error indicator), `o_cmd_en` (command enable to DDR), `o_wr_en` (write enable to DDR), along with `o_cmd_instr`, `o_cmd_byte_addr`, `o_wr_mask`, and `o_wr_data` for controlling DDR operations. Internal signals like `write_request`, `read_request`, `cmd_full_r`, `wb_adr_r`, `write_buf_r`, and buffers for select and data signals (`wb_sel_buf_r`, `wb_dat_buf_r`) help in managing the read/write requests, and buffering when required. The module's logic is organized in conditional blocks that respond to signal states and control data handling between the protocols, ensuring the DDR3's command and data queues are appropriately managed with respect to the incoming Wishbone requests. This setup allows for efficient data transfers, maintaining synchronization and throughput between the Wishbone bus and DDR3 memory."
