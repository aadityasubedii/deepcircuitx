    "spec": "Module name: iodrp_controller. Module specification: The `iodrp_controller` is a Verilog module designed for managing Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) communication with a memory cell, offering both read and write capabilities. It coordinates operations based on input signals through a defined protocol involving address and data phases controlled by a finite state machine (FSM). The input ports include `memcell_address` (8-bit address of the memory cell), `write_data` (8-bit data for write operations), `rd_not_write` (signal to select read or write), `cmd_valid` (command validity signal), `use_broadcast` (broadcast mode signal), `sync_rst` (synchronous reset), `DRP_CLK` (clock signal), and `DRP_SDO` (input data bit from DRP). The output ports are `read_data` (8-bit data from the memory), `rdy_busy_n` (controller busy status), `DRP_CS` (DRP chip select), `DRP_SDI` (serial data input to memory), `DRP_ADD` (address phase indicator), and `DRP_BKST` (broadcast mode status). Internal signals such as `memcell_addr_reg`, `data_reg`, `shift_through_reg`, `load_shift_n`, `addr_data_sel_n`, `bit_cnt`, `rd_not_write_reg`, `AddressPhase`, `state`, `nextstate`, and `DRP_SDI_pre` facilitate data handling, operation mode setting, and state transitions. Key blocks include: state initialization and transition logic, data shift handling, FSM state assignments, read data capture, and DRP line control, each orchestrated to carefully manage the communication between the controller and the memory cell in various operations under the guidance of `DRP_CLK`.",

It captures the address from the external input *memcell_address* when the controller is ready.\n- **data_reg**: This register stores the data to be written to the memory cell during a write operation.\n- **shift_through_reg**: This shift register is used to manage serial data input/output operations with the DRP. In read mode, it captures serial data from DRP_SDO, and in write mode, it shifts out data to DRP_SDI.\n- **load_shift_n**: A control signal that determines whether to load `data_out_mux` into `shift_through_reg`.\n- **addr_data_sel_n**: A selector signal that controls the source of data for `data_out_mux`, choosing between address and data based on the operation phase.\n- **bit_cnt**: This counter keeps track of the number of bits that have been processed during the address or data phase, ensuring that all bits are handled correctly.\n- **rd_not_write_reg**: This register captures the read/not_write signal at the beginning of an operation to maintain consistent operation mode decision throughout the process.\n- **AddressPhase**: A flag used to indicate whether the controller is currently in the address phase, helping manage the transition between address and data phases.\n- **capture_read_data**: Internal signal intended to manage the storing or capturing of incoming data to `read_data` register, wasn\u2019t actively used in provided code scope.\n- **state, nextstate**: These registers manage the finite state machine (FSM) states. `state` holds the current state, and `nextstate` holds the computed next state based on input conditions and current state.\n- **data_out_mux**: A multiplexer output that selects between address data and write data based on the state of `addr_data_sel_n`.\n- **DRP_SDI_pre**: A preparatory signal for managing the data sent to DRP_SDI; this appears in code comments but isn\u2019t implemented in the provided module description.\n- **state_ascii**: This signal holds a human-readable ASCII string that represents the current state of the FSM, useful for debug and display purposes.\n\nThese internal signals collectively handle data transmission, state management, and control the flow and phase of operations within the `iodrp_controller`, ensuring accurate and synchronized access to the DRP/memory cell."

Module specification: The `iodrp_controller` is a Verilog module designed for managing Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP) communication with a memory cell, offering both read and write capabilities. It coordinates operations based on input signals through a defined protocol involving address and data phases controlled by a finite state machine (FSM). The input ports include `memcell_address` (8-bit address of the memory cell), `write_data` (8-bit data for write operations), `rd_not_write` (signal to select read or write), `cmd_valid` (command validity signal), `use_broadcast` (broadcast mode signal), `sync_rst` (synchronous reset), `DRP_CLK` (clock signal), and `DRP_SDO` (input data bit from DRP). The output ports are `read_data` (8-bit data from the memory), `rdy_busy_n` (controller busy status), `DRP_CS` (DRP chip select), `DRP_SDI` (serial data input to memory), `DRP_ADD` (address phase indicator), and `DRP_BKST` (broadcast mode status). Internal signals such as `memcell_addr_reg`, `data_reg`, `shift_through_reg`, `load_shift_n`, `addr_data_sel_n`, `bit_cnt`, `rd_not_write_reg`, `AddressPhase`, `state`, `nextstate`, and `DRP_SDI_pre` facilitate data handling, operation mode setting, and state transitions. Key blocks include: state initialization and transition logic, data shift handling, FSM state assignments, read data capture, and DRP line control, each orchestrated to carefully manage the communication between the controller and the memory cell in various operations under the guidance of `DRP_CLK`."
