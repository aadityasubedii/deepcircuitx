Module name: a23_core. Module specification: The `a23_core` module acts as a central processing unit within an embedded system, primarily focusing on instruction execution, memory management, and handling different types of interrupts. This module's primary inputs include the system clock (`i_clk`) to synchronize operations, regular and fast interrupt signals (`i_irq`, `i_firq`), system readiness (`i_system_rdy`), and the Wishbone bus data and control signals (`i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_ack`, `i_wb_err`). The outputs are mainly Wishbone bus control and data signals (`o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_cyc`, `o_wb_stb`) used to manage memory and peripheral device transactions. Internally, `a23_core` utilizes numerous signals like `execute_address`, `write_data`, `read_data`, and various control flags to handle different operations and state management within the CPU, such as executing privileges, cache operations, fetch stalls, and register/data pathway control. The module is segmented into specific functional blocks: `a23_fetch` handles fetching data, `a23_decode` decodes the instruction set and prepares execution parameters, `a23_execute` conducts the actual processing of instructions, and `a23_coprocessor` facilitates coprocessor operations and caching functionalities. This structural organization aids in efficient data handling, computation, and interaction with other system components, ensuring robust system performance.
