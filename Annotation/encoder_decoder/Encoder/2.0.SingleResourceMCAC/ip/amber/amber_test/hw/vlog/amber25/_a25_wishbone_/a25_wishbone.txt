Module-level comment: The `a25_wishbone` module arbitrates transactions between three system ports and a Wishbone bus, ensuring sequential access. It intakes port requests, data, and control signals, directing outputs based on bus arbitration results. Internally, port-specific buffers (`a25_wishbone_buf`) manage data flow and state validations, while control logic, driven by clock and reset signals, orchestrates request processing, prioritizing by a fixed sequence to maintain orderly and non-concurrent bus access.
