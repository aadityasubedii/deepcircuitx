    "module": "Module-level comment: The xs6_sram_256x32_byte_en module simulates a 256x32-bit synchronous dual-port RAM with byte enable for partial writes, using a Xilinx RAMB8BWER block. It supports synchronized read and write operations via a single clock, with byte-wise write control facilitated through bit-masked enable signals. The module also includes instantiation configuration and parameter validations to ensure correct setup and operation."
