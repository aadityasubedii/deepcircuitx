It validates whether the received frame's address matches the required criteria such as broadcast, multicast, or unicast addressing based on the MAC (Media Access Control) address and other criteria. The module determines if the frame should be aborted or if there is an address miss, by setting 'RxAbort' and 'AddressMiss' signals respectively. It also evaluates conditions based on the byte counts and utilizes CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) hashed values to ensure the integrity and correct destination of the frame's addressing."

This signal effectively gates various operations including the unicast check, ensuring they are only active when proper.\n- HashBit: This signal represents the specific bit selected from the hashed value contained in 'ByteHash' using the lower bits of 'CrcHash'.
