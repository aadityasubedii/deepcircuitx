Module name: mcb_flow_control.

Module specification: The 'mcb_flow_control' module is designed to manage command and data flows for a memory controller block (MCB). It synchronizes memory operations across various states such as ready, read, write, command wait, and refresh stages utilizing a Finite State Machine (FSM). Input ports include `clk_i` for clock input, `rst_i` for reset, and other signals like `cmd_valid_i`, `cmd_i`, `addr_i`, `bl_i`, indicating command validity, type, address, and burst length respectively. Outputs such as `cmd_rdy_o`, `cmd_o`, `addr_o`, and `bl_o` indicate the readiness to accept new commands and reflect the processed command, address, and burst length. Internal signals like `cmd_fifo_rdy`, `cmd_rd`, and `cmd_wr` handle the readiness of command FIFO and command types, ensuring proper responses to external commands and internal states. The code extensively manipulates these signals within an FSM that directs the module through its operation, managing state transitions based on input commands and system readiness, and thus controlling the signal flow and operations like read and write command processing. Internal maintenance of write and read operation flags like `wr_in_progress` helps in the module's logical decisions within various FSM states. These functional blocks are supported by signal assignments and always-blocks conditioned on clock edges, managing the transfer and execution of command and data operations effectively in synchronization with memory interface demands.
