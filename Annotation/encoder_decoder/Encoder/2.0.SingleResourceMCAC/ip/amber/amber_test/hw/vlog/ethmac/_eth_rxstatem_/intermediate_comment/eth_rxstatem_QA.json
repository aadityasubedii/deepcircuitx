It processes incoming flags and data signals to transition between various states such as IDLE, DROP, PREAMBLE, SFD (Start Frame Delimiter), and DATA handling. It manages these transitions based on the status of received data flags, status of data integrity and transmitting flags, byte counters, and inter-frame gap counters to effectively determine the next state in an Ethernet frame reception process. The state machine ensures valid frame processing and error handling during reception."

This helps in managing byte-wise data processing and is asserted based on the continuation of valid data reception within the frame size constraints.\n- StartPreamble: Used to initiate the PREAMBLE state where the Ethernet frame preamble is processed. Asserted when valid data is recognized that does not correspond to certain mandatory frame delimiters, while the system is not transmitting.\n- StartSFD: Signals entering the Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) state, crucial for identifying the beginning of the actual frame data following the preamble.
