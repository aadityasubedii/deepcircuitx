Module name: xilinx_dist_ram_16x32. Module specification: The xilinx_dist_ram_16x32 is a Verilog module that implements a 32-bit wide, 16-depth dual-port distributed RAM using Xilinx FPGA architecture, specifically utilizing 32 instances of the RAM16X1D primitive. It features input ports for write enable (we), write clock (wclk), data input (data_in), write address (write_address), and read address (read_address). The `we` input enables write operations when high, `wclk` triggers these operations at rising edges, `data_in` is the 32-bit data to be written, and `write_address` and `read_address` both are 4-bit values specifying memory addresses for writing and reading, respectively. The module outputs the data from the specified read address through the `data_out` port, which is 32-bits wide. Internally, the module uses signals `waddr` and `raddr` to handle the address logic for the read and write operations respectively; these are direct mappings from the input addresses. Each RAM16X1D instance is responsible for a specific bit of the datapath, enabling parallel read and write operations. This organization within the module ensures efficient data handling by allowing independent access to different memory bits during the operations. The thorough design and mapping of single-bit dual-port RAMs significantly enhance the functional implementation of distributed RAM in an FPGA environment.
