    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge' serves as an interface between the Wishbone bus protocol and a DDR3 memory controller, handling data transactions. It synchronizes read/write operations via input signals like i_clk and manages data and command queues using internal signals and conditional checks. The module ensures data alignment, generates necessary control signals, and uses parameterized designs for flexibility. It buffers write operations when DDR queues are full and manages read data through conditional data paths based on bus width settings."
