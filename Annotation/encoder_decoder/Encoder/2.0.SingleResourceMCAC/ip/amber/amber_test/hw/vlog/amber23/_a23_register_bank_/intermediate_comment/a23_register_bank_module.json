    "module": "Module-level comment: The `a23_register_bank` module performs as a register bank in a microprocessor, managing the storage and updates of registers based on input control signals and operational modes. It includes ports for mode settings, stall signals, and register selection. Internal register arrays and conditional blocks handle data storage and output in response to user, supervisor, interrupt, and FIRQ modes, ensuring efficient, condition-based interaction with the processor's functional units."
