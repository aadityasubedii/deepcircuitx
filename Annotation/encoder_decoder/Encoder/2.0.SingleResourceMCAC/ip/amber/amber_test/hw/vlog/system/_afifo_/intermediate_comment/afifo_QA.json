It uses a dual-port RAM for storing data and gray code entities for pointer conversions to ensure data coherency across asynchronous boundaries. The module allows data push and pop operations, providing full and empty flags to indicate the status of the FIFO. The FIFO provides stable data communication by converting binary to gray code during write operations and gray back to binary during read operations to prevent errors from multi-bit changes happening simultaneously."
