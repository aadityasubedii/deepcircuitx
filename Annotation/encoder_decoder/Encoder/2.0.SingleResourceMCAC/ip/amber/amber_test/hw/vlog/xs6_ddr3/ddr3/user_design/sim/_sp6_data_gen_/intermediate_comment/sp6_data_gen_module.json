    "module": "This module generates various data patterns for testing and verification purposes, supporting 32, 64, and 128-bit widths. It implements fixed, address-based, alternating 'hammer', pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS), and 'walking' patterns. The module uses parameterized generate blocks to handle different data widths and pattern types. It selects the appropriate pattern based on input control signals and configuration parameters, employing internal registers and combinational logic to produce the desired output data pattern."
