Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module represents a DDR3 SDRAM memory model that simulates the behavior of a DDR3 memory device. It handles timing checks, command processing, and data read/write operations. The module has input ports for control signals (rst_n, ck, ck_n, cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), addressing (ba, addr), and data management (dm_tdqs, dq, dqs, dqs_n, odt). It features a single output port (tdqs_n) and several inout ports for bidirectional data transfer. Internally, the module uses various signals to manage timing parameters, configuration settings, and operational states. These include clock timing variables, mode registers, bank status trackers, and pipeline registers for command and data processing. The code is structured into several
