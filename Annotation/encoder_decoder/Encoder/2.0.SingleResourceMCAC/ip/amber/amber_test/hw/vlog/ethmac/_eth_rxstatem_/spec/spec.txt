Module name: eth_rxstatem.

Module specification: The eth_rxstatem module is designed for an Ethernet receiver and orchestrates the handling of reception states through a state machine. This module uses input signals from the physical layer to manage transitions between several states: IDLE, DROP, PREAMBLE, Start Frame Delimiter (SFD), and DATA states. The input ports include MRxClk (receiver module clock), Reset (system reset), MRxDV (Media Receive Data Valid), ByteCntEq0 (byte counter equals zero), ByteCntGreat2 (byte counter greater than two), Transmitting, MRxDEq5 (received data equals 0x05), MRxDEqD (received data equals 0x0D), IFGCounterEq24 (Inter-Frame Gap counter equals 24), and ByteCntMaxFrame (byte counter reaches maximum frame size). The output ports are StateData (2-bit representation for DATA state), StateIdle, StateDrop, StatePreamble, and StateSFD, showing the active reception state. The module utilizes various internal signals like StartIdle, StartDrop, StartData0, StartData1, StartPreamble, and StartSFD to execute transitions between states based on specific conditions defined in the code. The module's logic is segmented into blocks handling signal assignments for state transitions, and an always block that updates the state based on these transitions and the system reset condition. This structured approach ensures robust handling of Ethernet frame reception under various signal conditions and system states.
