            "content": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals:\n- `TakeSample`\n- `SetInvalidSymbol`\n- `RxLateCollision`\n- `RxColWindow`\n- `ShortFrame`\n- `DribbleNibble`\n- `ReceivedPacketTooBig`\n\nExplanation:\n- `TakeSample`: This signal is used to determine when to sample the current status based on the state of data reception and the status of the `MRxDV` signal. It integrates conditions from multiple states (like the end of data receiving and maximum frame size) to decide the timing of status captures.\n  \n- `SetInvalidSymbol`: This signal identifies instances of invalid symbols during data reception. An invalid symbol is detected specifically when `MRxDV` and `MRxErr` are high, and the received data (`MRxD`) equals `4'he` (binary for \"1110\"). This plays a crucial role in error management in Ethernet communication.\n\n- `RxLateCollision`: A register that flags the occurrence of a late collision during reception. A late collision is identified based on the collision signal, full-duplex mode flag (`r_FullD`), the reception window (`RxColWindow`), and size of the current packet relative to the smallest legal size (`r_RecSmall`).\n\n- `RxColWindow`: Manages the time window in which collisions are considered valid or late. It is set based on current reception state, current byte count matching valid collision count, and when the receiver goes idle.\n\n- `ShortFrame`: This register indicates if a received frame is shorter than the minimum frame length (`r_MinFL`). Such a condition is assessed using the `TakeSample` signal and the actual byte count (`RxByteCnt`) of the frame.\n\n- `DribbleNibble`: Indicates the presence of extra nibble (half a byte) or bits post the expected end of a frame. Typically evaluated during frame reception states and changes in `MRxDV`.\n\n- `ReceivedPacketTooBig`: This register identifies when a received packet exceeds the allowable size configured by `r_MaxFL`, excluding considerations for humongous frames enabled by `r_HugEn`. Like `ShortFrame`, this is controlled largely by the `TakeSample` condition and actual byte count (`RxByteCnt`). \n\nThese internal signals are crucial for managing error conditions, status signal updates, and ensuring the MAC conforms to Ethernet standards throughout the transmit and receive processes. Their roles are closely tied to the module's capability to react and adjust based on dynamic conditions during packet transmissions and receptions."

                    "text": "Internal signals and their explanation is as follows: \nInternal signals:\n- `TakeSample`\n- `SetInvalidSymbol`\n- `RxLateCollision`\n- `RxColWindow`\n- `ShortFrame`\n- `DribbleNibble`\n- `ReceivedPacketTooBig`\n\nExplanation:\n- `TakeSample`: This signal is used to determine when to sample the current status based on the state of data reception and the status of the `MRxDV` signal. It integrates conditions from multiple states (like the end of data receiving and maximum frame size) to decide the timing of status captures.\n  \n- `SetInvalidSymbol`: This signal identifies instances of invalid symbols during data reception. An invalid symbol is detected specifically when `MRxDV` and `MRxErr` are high, and the received data (`MRxD`) equals `4'he` (binary for \"1110\"). This plays a crucial role in error management in Ethernet communication.\n\n- `RxLateCollision`: A register that flags the occurrence of a late collision during reception. A late collision is identified based on the collision signal, full-duplex mode flag (`r_FullD`), the reception window (`RxColWindow`), and size of the current packet relative to the smallest legal size (`r_RecSmall`).\n\n- `RxColWindow`: Manages the time window in which collisions are considered valid or late. It is set based on current reception state, current byte count matching valid collision count, and when the receiver goes idle.\n\n- `ShortFrame`: This register indicates if a received frame is shorter than the minimum frame length (`r_MinFL`). Such a condition is assessed using the `TakeSample` signal and the actual byte count (`RxByteCnt`) of the frame.\n\n- `DribbleNibble`: Indicates the presence of extra nibble (half a byte) or bits post the expected end of a frame. Typically evaluated during frame reception states and changes in `MRxDV`.\n\n- `ReceivedPacketTooBig`: This register identifies when a received packet exceeds the allowable size configured by `r_MaxFL`, excluding considerations for humongous frames enabled by `r_HugEn`. Like `ShortFrame`, this is controlled largely by the `TakeSample` condition and actual byte count (`RxByteCnt`). \n\nThese internal signals are crucial for managing error conditions, status signal updates, and ensuring the MAC conforms to Ethernet standards throughout the transmit and receive processes. Their roles are closely tied to the module's capability to react and adjust based on dynamic conditions during packet transmissions and receptions."

It leverages input signals like 'MRxClk' (receive clock), 'Reset' (module reset), 'MRxDV' (data valid), among others to determine the conditions of ongoing data transactions \u2014 noting issues such as CRC errors via 'RxCrcError', signaling the end of a packet reception through 'ReceiveEnd', and several state flags delineating reception states, like 'RxStateSFD' for detecting the start frame delimiter. The module outputs various flags such as 'ReceivedPacketGood', 'ReceiveEnd', indicating the quality and state of packets processed. Internally, it uses signals like 'TakeSample' to decide when to capture the status based on data reception conditions and 'SetInvalidSymbol' to detect invalid symbols during reception. The code is organized into sections handling error latching (for CRC and reception errors), packet reception handling (determining packet size and collision presence), and managing transmission features like retry count and collision occurrences. This structured approach ensures the module effectively supports Ethernet standards for reliable data communications."
