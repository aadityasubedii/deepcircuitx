Module name: mcb_raw_wrapper. Module specification: This module is a wrapper for a Memory Controller Block (MCB) that interfaces with various types of DRAM (DDR, DDR2, DDR3, LPDDR). It handles the configuration and control of memory operations, including address and data management, command generation, and I/O buffer instantiation. The module supports different port configurations and memory widths, and includes features such as calibration, DQS (data strobe) management, and various timing parameters. Key input ports include clock signals (sysclk_2x, sysclk_2x_180), control signals (pll_ce_0, pll_ce_90, pll_lock, sys_rst), and multiple port-specific inputs for commands, data, and control. Output ports include memory interface signals (mcbx_dram_addr, mcbx_dram_
