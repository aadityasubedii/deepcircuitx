Module name: eth_registers. Module specification: The eth_registers module implements a register file for an Ethernet controller, managing various configuration settings and status information. It handles read and write operations to registers controlling MAC address, interrupts, MII management, transmit and receive parameters, and flow control. The module has numerous input ports including DataIn (32-bit data input), Address (8-bit register address), control signals (Rw, Cs, Clk, Reset), and various status and interrupt signals. Output ports include DataOut (32-bit data output) and numerous configuration settings (r_RecSmall, r_Pad, r_HugEn, etc.). Internal signals are used for address decoding, register selection, and interrupt management. The module is divided into sections for different register groups (e.g., MODER, INT_SOURCE, IPGT, etc.), each with its own write enable logic and output
