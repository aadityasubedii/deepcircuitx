Module name: mcb_soft_calibration_top. 

Module specification: The `mcb_soft_calibration_top` module is crucial for managing the calibration process for memory control blocks (MCB) interfacing with various DDR memory types. It adjusts memory timing and impedance, supporting dynamic calibrations during operation. The module receives synchronization signals including `UI_CLK`, `IOCLK`, and a reset signal `RST`, alongside other inputs like `PLL_LOCK` and `MCB_UO_CAL_START` for initiating calibration sequences. It issues various outputs such as `DONE_SOFTANDHARD_CAL` indicating complete calibration, `SELFREFRESH_MCB_REQ`, and others handling memory operation like `MCB_UIADD`, `MCB_UIDQCOUNT`, and control of memory read and write operations. Internal signals like `IODRP_ADD` and `IODRP_SDI` are used for configuring the I/O Delay and Routing Programmable (IODRP) block, crucial for precise timing adjustments. The code is partitioned into blocks that instantiate the calibration functionalities, manage input/output buffering through `IOBUF`, and configure the IODRP block according to the memory type, which is specified by parameters. Conditional generation (`generate` blocks) adapts the setup based on memory type and calibration modes. This module integrates multiple facets of memory setup and calibration, organizing them cohesively to maintain optimal memory interaction.
