Module-level comment: This Verilog snippet only includes a `timescale` directive, setting simulation time units to nanoseconds with equivalent precision. The directive ensures that simulated timing aligns accurately with real-time behavior. This particular snippet does not define a functional module, nor does it detail any implementation of input/output ports or internal signal usage. The primary purpose here is to establish a timing foundation for potential subsequent module simulations.
