Module-level comment: The "test" module serves as a testbench for the "UPB" module, focused on implementing scan-based testing. It initializes input signals like clk, reset, scan inputs, scan enable, and test mode to predefined values and captures scan outputs after test execution. The initial block sets timing, incorporates optional SDF annotations for detailed scan testing, and completes with execution termination for fast simulation and test verification of the "UPB" module.
