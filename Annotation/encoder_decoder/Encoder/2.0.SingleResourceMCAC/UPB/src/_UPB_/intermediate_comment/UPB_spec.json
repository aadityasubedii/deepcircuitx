    "spec": "Module name: UPB. Module specification: The UPB module is designed to process digital signal inputs to compute an updated value of 'BnP'. It accepts a variety of input signals including a reset, a clock signal (clk), a 2-bit rate indicator (rate_in), a control signal (Un), and data inputs (DQn, Bn) along with scan chain inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4) and mode selectors (scan_enable, test_mode). Its primary output is 'BnP', the updated data processed through the module\u2019s logic, and it also outputs scan chain data through ports (scan_out0 to scan_out4). Internally, the module generates 'DQnMAG' by zeroing the most significant bit (MSB) of 'DQn' to handle only the magnitude component. 'BnS' determines the sign of 'Bn' based on its MSB. 'UGBn' and 'ULBn' are computed based on conditions involving 'DQnMAG', 'Un', 'Bn', and 'rate_in' to set upper and lower boundary values, which are then summed to form 'UBn'. This result is crucial in calculating the final \u2018BnP\u2019 value via summation with 'Bn'. The code is broadly divided into blocks handling magnitude adjustments, boundary value calculations based on input conditions, and the final computation of 'BnP'. These processes are all synchronized with the system clock ensuring robust timing and operational correctness under various conditions set by input signals and internal calculations.",
