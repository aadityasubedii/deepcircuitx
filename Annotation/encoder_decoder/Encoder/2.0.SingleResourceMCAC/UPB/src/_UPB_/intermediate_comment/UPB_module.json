    "module": "Module-level comment: The UPB module calculates an updated value BnP based on inputs DQn and Bn. It initializes DQnMAG from DQn, where the MSB is zeros, for magnitude. BnS determines Bn's sign. Conditional logic defines boundary registers UGBn and ULBn based on DQnMAG, Un, Bn, and rate_in. The final output, BnP, is derived by adding Bn with the sum of UGBn and ULBn. This operation is synchronized with the clock signal, incorporating testing through scan chains."
