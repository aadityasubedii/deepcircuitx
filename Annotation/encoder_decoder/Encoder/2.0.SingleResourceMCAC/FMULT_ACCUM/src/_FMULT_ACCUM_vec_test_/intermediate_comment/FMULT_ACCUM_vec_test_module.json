    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module evaluates the performance of the FMULT_ACCUM unit within an ADPCM system, using varied configurations of companding laws, rates, and operational setups. It initializes test vectors from external files, applies them to the FMULT_ACCUM, checks the resulting outputs against expected error signals, and employs a clock mechanism and scan chain diagnostics to support testing. Error mismatches trigger immediate system alerts and optional halting using the `ERRORSTOP` directive, ensuring precision in operations."
