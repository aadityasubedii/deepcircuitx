Module-level comment: The FMULT_ACCUM module is designed for sequential multiplication and accumulation of digital signals, supporting both regular and test operational modes via inputs like `reset`, `clk`, `start`, and scan options. It comprises two submodules, FMULT and ACCUM, which handle the core mathematical operations. Internal state logic controlled by a clock and a reset enables orderly processing through different phases identified by `in_sel`, with `f1` and `f2` holding temporary data and coefficients. Outputs include the status signal `done` and data `sez`, `se`.
