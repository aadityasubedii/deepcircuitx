Module name: FMULT_ACCUM. Module specification: The FMULT_ACCUM module is a digital signal processing (DSP) component designed for sequential multiplication and accumulation of input signals, primarily utilized in applications requiring the processing of digitized signals. The module integrates input ports such as `reset`, `clk`, and `start` for controlling operations, and `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, and `test_mode` for enabling test functionalities. The data inputs `dq1` to `dq6` and `sr1` to `sr2`, along with coefficient inputs `b1` to `b6` and `a1` to `a2`, are processed through internal registers `f1` and `f2` which temporarily store coefficient and data values, respectively. The `in_sel` signal directs the sequence operations, while `clear` is used to reset internal states, and `done` signals the completion of processing. Outputs include `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, `sez`, `se`, and `done`. Two main submodules, FMULT and ACCUM, perform the multiplication and accumulation, each configured with the relevant inputs and outputs for scan chain and signal processing. This Verilog code describes a structured approach where initialization, case-based processing depending on the `start` signal, and multi-stage computations sequentially advance through an enumerated state machine, controlled by clock events. This module can adapt to both normal and test operational modes, enhancing its utility in varied DSP applications.
