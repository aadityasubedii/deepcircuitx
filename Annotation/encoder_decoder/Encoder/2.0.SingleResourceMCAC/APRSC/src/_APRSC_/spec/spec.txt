Module name: APRSC. Module specification: The APRSC module is a complex digital signal processing unit, likely designed for audio processing applications. It interfaces with a Wishbone bus for control and data transfer, processing input signals and producing output signals. The module has input ports for system control (reset, clk, CoPrclk), testing (scan_in0 to scan_in4, scan_enable, test_mode), and Wishbone bus communication (i_wb_adr, i_wb_sel, i_wb_we, i_wb_dat, i_wb_cyc, i_wb_stb). Output ports include test outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) and Wishbone bus outputs (o_wb_dat, o_wb_ack, o_wb_err). Internally, the module uses numerous signals for peak detection (sigpk, pk0
