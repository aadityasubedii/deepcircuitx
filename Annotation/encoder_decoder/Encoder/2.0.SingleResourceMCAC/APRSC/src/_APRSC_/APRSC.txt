The APRSC module is a complex digital signal processing unit designed for audio processing applications. It interfaces with a Wishbone bus for control and data transfer, processing input signals and producing output signals. The module implements multiple processing stages including peak detection, amplitude processing, and filtering. It utilizes various submodules for operations such as addition, multiplication, delay, and trigonometric functions. The module incorporates a state machine for controlling internal operations, supports different clock domains, and includes pipeline stages for efficient data processing. It also features testing capabilities and reset functionality, making it suitable for integration into larger digital systems.
