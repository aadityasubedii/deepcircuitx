Module name: test. 

Module specification: The 'test' module acts as a testbench for verifying the function of an APRSC hardware model, encompassing a variety of test scenarios facilitated by various input and output ports and internal configurations. Primary input ports include clocks (`clk`, `CoPrclk`), reset signals (`reset`), scan inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`), and scan enable and test mode toggles (`scan_enable`, `test_mode`). Wishbone bus interface signals (`i_wb_adr`, `i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_sel`, `i_wb_we`, `i_wb_cyc`, and `i_wb_stb`) handle memory interactions. Output ports include scan outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`) and Wishbone bus feedback (`o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_ack`, `o_wb_err`). Internal signals such as configuration arrays (`rates`, `laws`, `operations`, `types`, `models`), control registers (`se`, `a2p`, `sr`), and expected values (`seExpected`, `a2pExpected`, `srExpected`) manage testing parameters and track conditions. The module features various tasks and blocks, including clock signal toggles, initialization of test parameters, dynamically loading test vectors, and sequences for setting and reading bus values orchestrated through custom tasks (`wb_write_strobe`, `wb_read_strobe`, etc.). These tasks manage the interactions based on the test schedules and verify the operation against expected results using conditions from `rates`, `laws`, `operations`, `types`, and `models`. Through its stages, the module rigorously inspects the APRSC model under theoretical use conditions, ensuring robustness before deployment.
