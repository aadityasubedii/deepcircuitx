Module-level comment: The 'test' Verilog module is a comprehensive testbench designed to validate the APRSC hardware model, utilizing input and output ports for simulation control and data handling. Primarily, it manages clock signals, test modes, and reset functionality. It leverages internal configurations and Wishbone bus interfaces to simulate and verify operational scenarios. Tasks within the module assist in reading and writing test vectors and expected results through dedicated hardware interfacing, ensuring the ARCSC model meets all specified requirements before deployment.
