Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is designed to simulate and verify the functionality of an APRSC (Adaptive Pulse Rate Synchronous Converter) component with a Wishbone interface. It initializes system clocks, reset signals, and test parameters, then executes a comprehensive test suite covering various operational modes, rates, types, laws, and models. The module uses input ports such as clk, CoPrclk, reset, and Wishbone interface signals (i_wb_adr, i_wb_sel, i_wb_we, i_wb_dat, i_wb_cyc, i_wb_stb) to control the APRSC, while output ports like scan_out0-4, o_wb_dat, o_wb_ack, and o_wb_err provide test results and system responses. Internal signals and arrays (e.g., rates
