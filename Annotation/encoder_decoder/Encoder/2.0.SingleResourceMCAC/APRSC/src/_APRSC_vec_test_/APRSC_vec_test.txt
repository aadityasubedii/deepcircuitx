Module-level comment: This 'test' module simulates and verifies an APRSC component with a Wishbone interface. It executes a comprehensive test suite covering various operational modes, rates, types, laws, and models. The module initializes system signals, reads test vectors from memory files, and uses Wishbone read/write tasks to stimulate the APRSC and verify its outputs against expected values. It implements nested loops to iterate through different test configurations, allowing for thorough validation of the APRSC's functionality under various conditions.
