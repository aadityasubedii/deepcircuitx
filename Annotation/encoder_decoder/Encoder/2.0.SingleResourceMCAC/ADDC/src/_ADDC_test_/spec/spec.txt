Module name: test. Module specification: The "test" module is designed primarily for simulation and testing purposes, particularly suited to scan chain testing within a digital logic environment. The module includes input ports such as `clk` (clock), `reset`, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, and `test_mode`. The `clk` manages the timing for all synchronous activities, `reset` initializes operations, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` provide scan chain inputs for testing, `scan_enable` activates the scan operation, and `test_mode` toggles the module between normal and test operations. The outputs, `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, correspond to the inputs and showcase the result of the scan operations. Internally, the module comprises registers for inputs and wires for outputs, in addition to a main block. This block initializes, sets simulation parameters, and handles optional Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotations for timing accuracy in scan chains. These features collectively validate the functionality and integrity of digital circuits under various conditions.
