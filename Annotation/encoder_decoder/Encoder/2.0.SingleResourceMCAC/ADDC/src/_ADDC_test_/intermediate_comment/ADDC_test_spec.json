    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The \"test\" module is designed primarily for simulation and testing purposes, particularly suited to scan chain testing within a digital logic environment. The module includes input ports such as `clk` (clock), `reset`, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, and `test_mode`. The `clk` manages the timing for all synchronous activities, `reset` initializes operations, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` provide scan chain inputs for testing, `scan_enable` activates the scan operation, and `test_mode` toggles the module between normal and test operations. The outputs, `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, correspond to the inputs and showcase the result of the scan operations. Internally, the module comprises registers for inputs and wires for outputs, in addition to a main block. This block initializes, sets simulation parameters, and handles optional Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotations for timing accuracy in scan chains. These features collectively validate the functionality and integrity of digital circuits under various conditions.",

They allow injecting specific bits serially into the module\u2019s flip-flops to set the state of the device under test (DUT) or observe the state via scan outputs.\n- **scan_enable**: This signal enables the scan operation mode when high. It allows the shifting of data through the scan chains, facilitating the testing process by serially padding data through connected flip-flops.\n- **test_mode**: The test_mode signal determines the mode in which the module operates. If set high, the module works in a test mode, which might bypass some of the normal operations to focus on testing circuits within the module.\n- **scan_out0 to scan_out4**: These are scan output signals corresponding to each of the scan input signals.
