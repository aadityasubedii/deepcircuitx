    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"test\" module is tailored for scan chain testing within digital circuits. It employs inputs like clk, reset, scan_in0 to scan_in4, scan_enable, and test_mode to control operations. It manages scan chain inputs and outputs through wires and registers and initializes in a block that sets simulation conditions and optionally loads SDF annotations for precise timing during scan tests. This setup aids in ensuring the correct functionality under various test conditions."
