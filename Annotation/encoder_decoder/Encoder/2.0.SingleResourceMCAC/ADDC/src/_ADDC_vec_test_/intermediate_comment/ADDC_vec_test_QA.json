The test setup initializes various parameters, loads test vectors from memory files, drives these vectors through the ADDC module, and then checks the outputs against expected values. If discrepancies are found between the expected and actual responses, error messages are displayed, and depending on configuration flags, the simulation may stop upon encountering errors.
