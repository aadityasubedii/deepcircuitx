Module-level comment: The 'test' module simulates and evaluates the functionality of an ADDC module under various voice encoding conditions using input test vectors. It cycles through parameterized sets of bit rates, companding laws, operation types, and configuration models to drive inputs (`DQ`, `SEZ`) and checks outputs (`PK0`, `SIGPK`) against expected results, indicating errors interactively. The procedure includes reading test vectors from memory files and adjusting test settings based on results, ensuring comprehensive verification of the ADDC module's reliability and accuracy across diverse scenarios.
