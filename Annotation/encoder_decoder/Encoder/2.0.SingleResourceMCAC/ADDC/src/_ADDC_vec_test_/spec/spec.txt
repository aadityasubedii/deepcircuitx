Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module in Verilog is designed to validate the functionality of an ADDC module by simulating various test conditions and checking its response against expected values. The input ports include a clock signal (`clk`) for timing synchronization, a reset signal (`reset`) to initialize the simulation state, five scan chain inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`) and a scan enable signal (`scan_enable`) for test configuration, a test mode selection (`test_mode`), and voice encoding data as Differential Quotient (`DQ`) and Signal Estimated Zero (`SEZ`). The output ports are five scan chain outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`) for observing the state of the module, and two signals `PK0` and `SIGPK` indicating the peak signal zero and the presence of a signal's peak respectively. Internal signals include arrays such as `rates`, `laws`, `operations`, `types`, `models`, storing test configurations and conditions, along with `vectorSizes`, `DQs`, `SEZs`, `PK0s`, `SIGPKs` holding expected test vectors. Temporary variables like `rate`, `law`, `operation`, `type`, `model`, `loop`, `DQ`, `SEZ`, `PK0_EXP`, `SIGPK_EXP`, and error flags `PK0_ERROR`, `SIGPK_ERROR` manage the test runs and check outputs. The main code blocks handle initial settings, iterative testing across configurations, real-time simulation control, and file outputs verification, aiming to ensure that every possible scenario is tested for the ADDC, with provision for immediate halt on error detection depending on the configuration flags (`ERRORSTOP`). The module concludes with a test completion message once all scenarios are validated.
