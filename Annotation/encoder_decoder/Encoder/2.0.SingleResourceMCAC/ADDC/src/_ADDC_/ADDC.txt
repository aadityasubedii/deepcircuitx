Module-level comment: The ADDC module performs arithmetic operations on 16-bit DQ and 15-bit SEZ inputs. It conducts sign extension on DQ and SEZ and adds the adjusted values to compute two outputs, PK0 and SIGPK. PK0 outputs the most significant bit indicating overflow or sign, and SIGPK flags if the result is zero. Scan inputs/outputs are integrated for testing, controlled by scan_enable and test_mode flags.
