    "spec": "Module name: ADDC. Module specification: The ADDC module is designed for signal processing operations, primarily executing sign extension and addition on two input signals, DQ and SEZ, to generate two outputs, PK0 and SIGPK. The input ports include a reset signal, a clock signal (clk), five scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4), a scan enable flag, a test mode flag, and the main data inputs DQ (16 bits) and SEZ (15 bits). The outputs comprise five scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) and two result signals, PK0 and SIGPK. PK0 indicates the most significant bit (MSB) of the result, serving as an overflow or sign indicator, while SIGPK is a flag that is true when the result is zero, helping detect specific signal conditions. Internally, the module utilizes signals such as DQS and SEZS to capture the MSBs of DQ and SEZ respectively. These signals help in deciding the sign adjustments for DQ and SEZ, stored in DQI and SEZI. The result of adding these adjusted values is held in DQSEZ, which is used to determine the values of PK0 and SIGPK. The module is structured to perform conditional operations based on the scan_enable and test_mode flags that manage the testing environment, including test data injection and extraction through the scan signals. This modular design allows for efficient testing and operational flexibility in a system that requires robust data handling and condition monitoring.",

Specifically, it conducts sign extension adjustments on `DQ` and `SEZ`, then adds the adjusted values. The result of this addition is used to determine the outputs: `PK0` is the MSB (most significant bit) of the addition result indicating a possible overflow or sign, and `SIGPK` indicates if the cumulative result is zero. This could be part of a larger system involving data signal processing where detecting specific conditions (like zero output or overflow) is necessary.
