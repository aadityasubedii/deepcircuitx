    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'a25_shifter' module executes bit manipulation operations on a 32-bit input, supporting logical shifts (left and right), arithmetic shift right, and rotate right operations. It utilizes internal 33-bit registers for intermediate results and conditionally generates detailed shifting logic based on the FULL_BARREL parameter. Input signals control the shift type, amount, and specific behaviors, while output signals provide the result and carry-out of the operations. This permits optimized performance for various hardware configurations."
