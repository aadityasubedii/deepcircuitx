Module name: a25_fetch.
Module specification: The "a25_fetch" module is designed to manage the instruction fetch logic for a processor, handling both cached and uncached scenarios. Primarily, it interfaces with the cache subsystem and the Wishbone bus to ensure seamless instruction fetching as per processor needs. The module accommodates various input ports including 'clk' for clock signals, 'reset' for resetting the module, 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' for testing modalities, and multiple stall and system readiness signals like 'i_mem_stall', 'i_exec_stall', 'i_conflict', and 'i_system_rdy'. It includes instruction address inputs such as 'i_iaddress', 'i_iaddress_valid', and 'i_iaddress_nxt' alongside cache management signals 'i_cache_enable', 'i_cache_flush', and 'i_cacheable_area'. For output, it provides 'o_fetch_stall', 'o_fetch_instruction', 'o_wb_req', and 'o_wb_address' to indicate fetch stalls, the fetched instruction, and Wishbone bus requests, respectively. Internal signals such as 'core_stall', 'cache_stall', and various data alignment signals (e.g., 'cache_read_data128', 'cache_read_data', 'wb_rdata32') control the flow within the fetch process, indicating cache operations and handling data fetched from the cache or the bus. The code includes a sub-module 'a25_icache' representing the cache logic, and uses combinational logic to decide data paths within the fetch operation, manage stalls, and align fetched data for processor execution. This structured approach in the 'a25_fetch' module ensures effective and efficient instruction fetch tailored to system and operational conditions like cache availability and external stall conditions.
