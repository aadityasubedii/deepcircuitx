It handles both cached and uncached instruction reads, making decisions based on the address's cachability and the validity of the instruction address. The module interfaces with a cache (via an included cache sub-module), and manages read requests to the wishbone (WB) bus when cache misses occur or when fetching uncached instructions directly. The module also manages various stall conditions such as system readiness, wait for write-back completeness, and internal cache stalls, ensuring that fetch operations are synchronized correctly with the rest of the system's state. The output is the next fetch instruction ready for execution or a default value in stall conditions."
