Module name: a25_register_bank. 
Module specification: The `a25_register_bank` module is designed to handle register management within a CPU execution unit, facilitating register read and write operations, supporting various modes like user, supervisor, and interrupt modes, and enabling rapid context switching. The module integrates input ports such as `clk`, `reset`, `scan_enable`, `test_mode`, core and memory stall indicators (`i_core_stall`, `i_mem_stall`), operation modes (`i_mode_idec`, `i_mode_exec`, `i_mode_rds_exec`), registers selection signals (`i_rm_sel`, `i_rs_sel`, `i_rn_sel`), and signals related to the program counter and data inputs (`i_pc_wen`, `i_reg_bank_wen`, `i_pc`, `i_reg`, `i_wb_read_data`, and others). Output ports include `o_rm`, `o_rs`, `o_rd`, `o_rn`, and `o_pc`, which provide the values of selected registers and the program counter for further processing. Internally, the module utilizes signals like `usr_idec`, `svc_idec`, `irq_idec`, `firq_idec` for decoding instruction mode, and `usr_exec`, `svc_exec`, `irq_exec`, `firq_exec` for execution mode handling, along with multiple signals for determining write enable status based on various conditions (`read_data_wen`, `reg_bank_wen_c`, `pc_wen_c`). The code is structured into sections for resetting registers, updating register values based on execution context, managing priority in execution with special conditional signals, and assigning output based on the selected register information. The organization reflects a thorough implementation geared towards optimizing instruction execution through efficient register management in a multi-mode operating environment.
