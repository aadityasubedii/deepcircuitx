    "module": "Module-level comment: The `a25_register_bank` module manages CPU register operations, supporting multi-mode accesses (User, Supervisor, IRQ, FIRQ) and enabling efficient context switching. It features input ports for control signals, data, and mode selections, and outputs register and PC values. Internally, the module uses conditional logic and status flags to control register write and read operations, updates registers based on stalls and mode-specific conditions, and prioritizes outputs based on selector inputs, ensuring agile and precise execution control."
