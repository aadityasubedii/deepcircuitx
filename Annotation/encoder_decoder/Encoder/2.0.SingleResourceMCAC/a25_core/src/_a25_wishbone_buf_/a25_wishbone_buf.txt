Module-level comment: The a25_wishbone_buf module buffers and manages Wishbone bus transactions, handling both read and write requests. It utilizes inputs like control signals, data, and addresses to manage a dual-entry buffer using internal pointers and states. Outputs are driven based on buffer status and incoming acceptances. The implementation efficiently coordinates between pushing new data to and popping old data from the buffer, ensuring reliable transaction processing with synchronization to the system clock.
