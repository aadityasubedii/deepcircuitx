    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is designed primarily to facilitate the scan testing of the 'a25_core' module. It incorporates a setup where various input ports such as `clk` (clock), `reset` (system reset), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (scan input data), `scan_enable` (control for scan operation mode), and `test_mode` (activates specific test settings in a25_core) are initialized, alongside output ports `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` which output the scan results. Internally, the module also defines `clk_count` and `testfail` registers which, although defined, are not actively used within the scope of the given code. The code block under the `initial` keyword is crucial for setting the initial states of the inputs and for ending the simulation with `$finish`. Additionally, when compiled with `SDFSCAN` defined, the module includes an SDF (Standard Delay Format) annotation for timing simulation under scan test conditions, handled by `$sdf_annotate`. This concise setup effectively simulates the environment for testing the `a25_core` under controlled conditions.",

It initializes inputs like clock (`clk`), reset, and scan inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`) to their default states, configures the scan and test modes, and connects to the a25_core module's corresponding ports. The module captures the scan outputs from `a25_core`.
