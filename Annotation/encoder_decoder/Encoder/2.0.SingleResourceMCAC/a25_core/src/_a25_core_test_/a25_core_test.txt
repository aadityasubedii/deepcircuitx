Module-level comment: The 'test' module sets up a test environment for the 'a25_core', initializing inputs and capturing outputs related to scan testing. It contains initial blocks for setting defaults and concluding simulation, and optionally includes SDF annotation under the `SDFSCAN` directive for precise timing simulation.
