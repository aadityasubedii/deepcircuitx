    "module": "The a25_execute module performs instruction execution in an ARM-based processor. It implements arithmetic and logical operations, memory access, and state management through an ALU, barrel shifter, multiplier, and register bank. The module handles conditional execution, supports multiple processor modes (USR, SVC, IRQ, FIRQ), and manages status flags. It processes decoded instructions, generates memory addresses, performs data operations, and updates processor state. The module interfaces with memory and other processor stages, handling stalls and conflicts to ensure proper instruction flow and data consistency."
