Module name: a25_execute. Module specification: The a25_execute module is a critical component of an ARM-based processor, responsible for executing instructions after they have been decoded. It interfaces with memory, handles arithmetic and logical operations, and manages the processor's state across different modes (USR, SVC, IRQ, FIRQ). The module has numerous input ports for control signals, data, and instruction information, and output ports for address generation, data movement, and status updates. Key inputs include clock, reset, stall signals, decoded instruction information, and current processor status. Outputs include memory addresses, write data, status bits, and various control signals. Internally, the module uses a wide array of signals for intermediate calculations, address generation, and state management. The module is organized into several functional blocks, including an ALU, a barrel shifter, a multiplier, and a register bank. It handles conditional execution, manages processor modes and status flags
