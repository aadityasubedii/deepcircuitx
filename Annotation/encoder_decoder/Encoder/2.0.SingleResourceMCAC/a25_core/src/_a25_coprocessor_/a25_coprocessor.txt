Module-level comment: The "a25_coprocessor" module manages cache and fault status operations in a computing system. It processes input signals encompassing operation codes, data inputs, and fault conditions to control cache settings and register operations. Outputs provide cache status and fault data. Internally, it utilizes various register configurations handled in always blocks triggered by clock and reset signals, ensuring synchronization and proper operation in line with system states and operations specified through its inputs.
