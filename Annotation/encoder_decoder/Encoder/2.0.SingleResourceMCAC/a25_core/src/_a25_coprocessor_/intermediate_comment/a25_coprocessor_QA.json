It handles different tasks based on operation codes such as reading from and writing to control registers, setting fault status and address during error conditions, and manipulating cache-enabled areas, flush operations, updateable areas, and disruptive areas. It also includes debug functionalities to output the status of operations for debugging purposes, particularly under specific compiler flags indicating debug mode is active. The module is sensitive to clock and reset changes, ensuring proper initialization and real-time operational response. The outputs include cache-related control signals and read data from the coprocessor, which are determined by the operation type and specified control register numbers."
