Module name: a25_coprocessor. 

Module specification: The "a25_coprocessor" is a Verilog module designed to handle cache management and fault status operations in a computing system. It controls cache enablement, flush operations, and manages areas designated as cacheable, updateable, or disruptive based on operation codes and register values provided through its input ports. The input ports include signals for clock synchronization (clk), system reset (reset), scan testing (scan_enable), and test modes (test_mode), as well as fault condition indicators (i_fault, i_fault_status, i_fault_address), core stall signals (i_core_stall), operation type identifiers (i_copro_opcode1, i_copro_opcode2, i_copro_operation), and data for registering operations (i_copro_crn, i_copro_crm, i_copro_num, i_copro_write_data). The outputs include read data from the coprocessor (o_copro_read_data), and signals to control cache functionality (o_cache_enable, o_cache_flush) and define cacheable areas (o_cacheable_area). Internally, the module utilizes registers for cache control settings (cache_control), defining cacheable, updateable, and disruptive areas, and for storing fault status and fault address information. The code is segmented into several always blocks, handling initialization and operational logic contingent on the clock and reset signals, including conditions for faults, read, and write operations based on coprocessor commands. Additional debug functionalities provide detailed diagnostic outputs under specific test conditions, assisting in development and testing phases.
