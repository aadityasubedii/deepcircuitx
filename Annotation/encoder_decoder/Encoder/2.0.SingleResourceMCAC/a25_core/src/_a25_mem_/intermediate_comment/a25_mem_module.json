    "module": "Module-level comment: The a25_mem module handles memory operations, managing both cached and uncached accesses in a CPU architecture. It receives memory addresses, data for writes, and control signals for cache operations as inputs and outputs status and data regarding memory reads and writes. Internally, the module utilizes control logic with signals like address_cachable and sel_cache to decide whether operations should utilize caching, facilitates synchronization using clk and reset inputs, and manages stalls and data validity through registers and combinational logic. Additionally, it interfaces with a cache module (a25_dcache) to manage detailed cache interactions and stall conditions efficiently."
