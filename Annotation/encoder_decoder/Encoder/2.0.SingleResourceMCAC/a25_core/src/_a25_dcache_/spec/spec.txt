Module name: a25_dcache. Module specification: The a25_dcache module implements a configurable data cache for the A25 processor, supporting multiple ways (2, 3, 4, or 8) and handling read/write operations, cache misses, and exclusive accesses. It interfaces with the processor and memory system through input ports for control signals (clk, reset, scan_enable, test_mode), cache operations (i_request, i_exclusive, i_write_data, i_write_enable, i_address, i_address_nxt, i_byte_enable, i_cache_enable, i_cache_flush), stall signals (i_fetch_stall, i_exec_stall), and memory interface (i_wb_cached_rdata, i_wb_cached_ready). Output ports include o_read_data for cache reads, o_stall for
