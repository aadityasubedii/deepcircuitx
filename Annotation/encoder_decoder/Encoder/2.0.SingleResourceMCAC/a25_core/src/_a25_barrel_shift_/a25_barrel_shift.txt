Module-level comment: The a25_barrel_shift module executes bitwise shifts on a 32-bit input based on shift magnitude and type, supporting quick and full barrel shifts. Inputs include a clock, reset, and control signals, while outputs are the shifted data and a stall signal. Internally, it uses two configurations of a sub-module for varying shift complexities, selecting the appropriate shift mechanism dynamically through internal registers and control logic based on the shift amount and operational mode.
