Module name: a25_barrel_shift. 
Module specification: The a25_barrel_shift module is designed to perform bitwise shift operations (quick and full barrel shifts) on a 32-bit input (`i_in`) based on the shift amount (`i_shift_amount`) and the type of operation specified by the function (`i_function`). The module includes input ports such as the clock signal (`clk`), asynchronous reset (`reset`), scan testing control (`scan_enable`), test mode (`test_mode`), 32-bit input data (`i_in`), input carry bit (`i_carry_in`), 8-bit shift amount (`i_shift_amount`), immediate zero flag (`i_shift_imm_zero`), and 2-bit function control (`i_function`). The output ports are the shifted 32-bit number (`o_out`), carried out bit (`o_carry_out`), and a stall signal (`o_stall`) indicating module readiness. Internally, the module utilizes signals like `quick_out` and `quick_carry_out` for quick shift outputs, `full_out` and `full_carry_out` for full barrel shift outputs, and registers `full_out_r`, `full_carry_out_r`, and `use_quick_r` for storing data and control state across clock cycles. The main sections of the RTL include instantiation of two shift submodules (`a25_shifter`), one configured for quick shifts and the other for full barrel shifts, control logic for selecting between the outputs of these submodules based on the shift amount, and sequential logic for data and state retention across clock cycles to handle the asynchronous reset and updates to the shift type state (`use_quick_r`). This structured approach ensures efficient and accurate data shifting based on dynamic input requirements.
