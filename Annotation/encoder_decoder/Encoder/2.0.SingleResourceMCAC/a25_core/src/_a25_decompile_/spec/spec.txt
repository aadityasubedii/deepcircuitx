Module name: a25_decompile. Module specification: The a25_decompile module is designed to decompile ARM-like processor instructions for debugging and analysis purposes. It takes various input signals related to instruction execution, including the 32-bit instruction, address, execution flags, and interrupt signals. The module doesn't have explicit output ports; instead, it writes decompiled instruction information to a file. Internal signals are used for decoding instructions, storing intermediate values, and controlling the decompilation process. These include register numbers, immediate values, opcodes, and execution control flags. The module is structured into several main blocks: instruction decoding, formatting and writing decompiled instructions, handling interrupts, and tracking program flow. It includes tasks for decoding different instruction types (e.g., register operations, memory transfers, branches) and formatting them appropriately. The module also tracks and reports on interrupts and jumps in program execution, providing a
