Module-level comment: 
/*
This module decompiles ARM-like processor instructions for debugging. It decodes 
incoming instructions, formats them into human-readable assembly-like code, and 
writes the output to a file. The module processes various instruction types, 
handles interrupts, and tracks program flow. It uses internal signals for 
decoding and formatting, and employs tasks for specific instruction types. 
The module operates on clock edges, responding to execution signals and 
interrupt states to provide a detailed view of the processor's operation.
