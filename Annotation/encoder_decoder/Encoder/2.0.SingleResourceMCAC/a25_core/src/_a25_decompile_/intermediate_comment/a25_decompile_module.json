    "module": "Module-level comment: \n/*\nThis module decompiles ARM-like processor instructions for debugging. It decodes \nincoming instructions, formats them into human-readable assembly-like code, and \nwrites the output to a file. The module processes various instruction types, \nhandles interrupts, and tracks program flow. It uses internal signals for \ndecoding and formatting, and employs tasks for specific instruction types. \nThe module operates on clock edges, responding to execution signals and \ninterrupt states to provide a detailed view of the processor's operation.\n*/"
