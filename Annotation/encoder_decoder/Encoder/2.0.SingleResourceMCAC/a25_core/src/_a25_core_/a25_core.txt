Module-level comment: This module implements an ARM25 CPU core, integrating fetch, decode, execute, memory, and write-back stages. It manages instruction processing, data handling, and system interfaces through submodules. The core utilizes Wishbone bus for external communications, supports interrupt handling, and incorporates cache control mechanisms. It employs various internal signals and control logic to coordinate operations between stages, ensuring efficient instruction execution and data management in an embedded system context.
