Module name: a25_core. Module specification: The 'a25_core' module is a central processing unit (CPU) core designed for an ARM25 architecture, handling core operations such as fetching, decoding, executing, handling memory operations, and managing write-back processes. The input ports include `clk` for clock signals, `reset` for initializing the system, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` for scan testing inputs, `scan_enable` to enable scan testing, `test_mode` for diagnostics, along with `i_irq` and `i_firq` for interrupt requests, and `i_system_rdy` indicating system readiness. Output ports consist of `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` for scan testing outputs, `o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_cyc`, and `o_wb_stb` for interfacing with the Wishbone bus, facilitating memory and peripheral communications. Internal signals include `execute_iaddress` and `execute_daddress` for instruction and data address operations, `write_data` and `write_enable` for managing data writes, various stall signals like `fetch_stall`, `mem_stall`, and control signals for cache operations among others, which help maintain efficient and orderly CPU functionality. The module is segmented into major blocks: `a25_fetch` managing the fetching of instructions, `a25_decode` for decoding instructions, `a25_execute` for executing instructions, `a25_mem` for handling memory access, `a25_write_back` for managing the write-back phase, `a25_wishbone` for Wishbone bus communication, and `a25_coprocessor` for coprocessor management, together ensuring a comprehensive execution path within the embedded system.
