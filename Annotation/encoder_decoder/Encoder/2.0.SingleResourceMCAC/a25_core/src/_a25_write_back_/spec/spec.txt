Module name: a25_write_back. 

Module specification: The a25_write_back module is designated for managing the data transfer and processing associated with the write-back stage of a processor pipeline. It specifically handles memory-read data and the associated signals involved in capturing this data under non-stall conditions. The input ports include `clk` (clock signal), `reset` (synchronous reset signal), `scan_enable` and `test_mode` (both for testing purposes), `i_mem_stall` (indicates if the module should halt operations), `i_mem_read_data` (data read from memory), `i_mem_read_data_valid` (validity of the read data), `i_mem_load_rd` (destination register ID for data), `i_daddress` (data address), and `i_daddress_valid` (validity of the data address). The output ports comprise `o_wb_read_data` (latched memory read data), `o_wb_read_data_valid` (validity of the output data), and `o_wb_load_rd` (output destination register ID). Internally, the module uses several registers: `mem_read_data_r` (holds data read from memory), `mem_read_data_valid_r` (holds validity state of the read data), `mem_load_rd_r` (captures the register ID for data), and `daddress_r` (captures the data address during non-stall cycles). The code features two main blocks handling data latching and resets respectively, ensuring that all internal registers are appropriately cleared on reset, and data is only latched when not stalled. The detailed implementation guarantees that only valid and correctly addressed data is carried through to subsequent pipeline stages, facilitating efficient and error-free processor operation.
