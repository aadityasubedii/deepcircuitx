Module-level comment: The a25_write_back module handles the transfer of memory read data for a processor's write-back stage. It uses registers to latch valid data, register IDs, and addresses during non-stall cycles. Outputs provide latched data and IDs for subsequent processing. The implementation uses synchronous reset to clear internal registers and checks for stall conditions to control data updates.
