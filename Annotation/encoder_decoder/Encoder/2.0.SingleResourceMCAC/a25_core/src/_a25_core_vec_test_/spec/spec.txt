Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is a Verilog testbench designed to verify the functionality of the 'a25_core' module, particularly when it is integrated with a scan chain setup for enhanced testing capabilities. The module includes input ports such as `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset` (to initialize or reset the module), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (inputs for the scan chain), `scan_enable` (activates the scan operation), and `test_mode` (puts the core into a test-specific operational mode). The output ports, `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, serve to observe the internal states and verify the core's response to the scan inputs under test conditions. Internal signals mirror these ports and are employed to control and monitor the state of the 'a25_core' during simulation. The testbench code is organized into blocks that initialize simulation settings and annotations for conditional SDF (Standard Delay Format) scan testing, set initial conditions to all inputs and registers, and conclude the simulation. These arrangements allow comprehensive testing of the core module's functionality in a production-like environment with various conditions and potential process variations.
