Module-level comment: The 'test' module is a testbench for the 'a25_core', designed to validate its operation with a scan chain. It features inputs for clock, reset, scan control, and test mode, paired with scan outputs for state observation. Internally, the testbench initializes these signals, sets up conditional SDF annotations for accurate timing tests, and simulates the core's response, ensuring operational integrity under varied test conditions.
