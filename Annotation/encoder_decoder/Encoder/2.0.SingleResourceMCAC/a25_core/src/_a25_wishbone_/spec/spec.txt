Module name: a25_wishbone. Module specification: The 'a25_wishbone' module provides the functionality of interfacing three ports with a centralized Wishbone bus, managing the read and write transactions. It synchronizes these operations using internal signals and buffers for each port to ensure a controlled, sequential access to the bus. Input ports include the clock (`clk`), reset (`reset`), test signals like `scan_enable` and `test_mode`, as well as request signals (`i_port{0-2}_req`), write enable signals (`i_port{0-2}_write`), write data (`i_port{0-2}_wdata`), byte enables (`i_port{0-2}_be`), addresses (`i_port{0-2}_addr`), and Wishbone bus signals (`i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_ack`, `i_wb_err`). The outputs respond to these commands with acknowledge signals (`o_port{0-2}_ack`), read data (`o_port{0-2}_rdata`), and Wishbone bus control signals (`o_wb_adr`, `o_wb_sel`, `o_wb_we`, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_cyc`, `o_wb_stb`). Internal signals include arrays like `wbuf_valid`, `wbuf_accepted`, `wbuf_write`, `wbuf_wdata`, `wbuf_addr` for managing buffered write operations, and `wbuf_rdata_valid` to maintain read data validity. Additionally, the `new_access` signal manages new accesses based on current transaction statuses and `serving_port` indicates which port currently accesses the bus. Three instantiation blocks for `a25_wishbone_buf` handle buffering for each port, and custom logic in the always block coordinates access to the Wishbone bus. This module ensures effective multi-port communication with the Wishbone standard, following strict protocols to ensure reliable, sequenced bus transactions.
