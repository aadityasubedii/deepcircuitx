    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'a25_wishbone' module interfaces three ports with a centralized Wishbone bus, managing sequential read and write transactions. It employs internal buffers for each port and controls bus access through signals like `wbuf_valid`, `wbuf_write`, and `new_access`. Three instances of `a25_wishbone_buf` handle individual port operations, while the main control logic in an always block coordinates bus cycle initiation and operation execution, ensuring structured and reliable data transfers with the bus."
