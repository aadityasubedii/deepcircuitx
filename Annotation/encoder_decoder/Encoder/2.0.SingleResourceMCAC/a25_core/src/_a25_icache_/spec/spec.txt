Module name: a25_icache. Module specification: The a25_icache module implements a configurable instruction cache for a processor, likely an ARM25. It supports multiple ways (2, 3, 4, or 8) and is customizable in terms of cache lines and words per line. The module handles read operations, cache misses, and cache line fills. Key inputs include clock, reset, address signals, and memory interface signals, while outputs provide read data and stall signals. Internal signals manage cache states, data selection, and hit/miss logic. The module is structured with several main blocks: cache initialization, state machine for controlling operations, tag and data memory arrays for each way, hit detection logic, and way selection for replacements. It implements a random replacement policy when all ways are valid. The design includes error checking for multiple way hits and supports various cache sizes through parameters. The module also includes debug signals for monitoring internal states and incorporates
