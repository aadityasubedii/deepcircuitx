Module-level comment: This module implements a configurable instruction cache for a processor. It supports multiple ways (2-8) and customizable cache sizes. The module handles read operations, cache misses, and line fills using a state machine. It includes tag and data memory arrays for each way, hit detection logic, and a random replacement policy. The design manages cache initialization, read/write operations, and error checking for multiple way hits. It interfaces with the processor and memory system, providing read data and stall signals as needed.
