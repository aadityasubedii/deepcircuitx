    "spec": "Module name: a25_alu.\n\nModule specification: The a25_alu module functions as an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed to handle a variety of arithmetic and logic operations based on two 32-bit inputs, `i_a_in` and `i_b_in`, and additional control signals. The operations performed depend on the value of `i_function`, a 9-bit input which controls the operation type using internal multiplexer settings. The module outputs a 32-bit result `o_out` and a 4-bit flags vector `o_flags` signifying zero, carry, negative, and overflow conditions. Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `a` and `b` for operand handling, `b_not` for negated operations, and `fadder_out` for results of addition or subtraction. Control logic is defined by `swap_sel`, `not_sel`, `cin_sel`, `cout_sel`, and `out_sel` based on `i_function` to handle operations like operand swapping and selection of carry inputs and outputs. The ALU also includes conditional compilation paths for optimized arithmetic blocks specific to Xilinx FPGA hardware variants. The key computation sections manage operand selection, carry manipulation, result computation using optimized or generic adders, and final output and flag assignment, all correlated closely with operations designated by the function code input.",

It takes two 32-bit input values (`i_a_in` and `i_b_in`), a function code (`i_function`), and additional status and carry input bits (`i_barrel_shift_carry`, `i_status_bits_carry`). The ALU performs operations like addition, subtraction (using two's-complement logic), bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR), as well as bit extension and selection operations depending on the function code. It outputs a 32-bit result (`o_out`) and a 4-bit flag (`o_flags`) which indicates zero, carry, negative, and overflow conditions. The operations are selected via multiplexers controlled by decoded signals from `i_function`.

The operations performed depend on the value of `i_function`, a 9-bit input which controls the operation type using internal multiplexer settings. The module outputs a 32-bit result `o_out` and a 4-bit flags vector `o_flags` signifying zero, carry, negative, and overflow conditions. Internally, the module utilizes signals such as `a` and `b` for operand handling, `b_not` for negated operations, and `fadder_out` for results of addition or subtraction. Control logic is defined by `swap_sel`, `not_sel`, `cin_sel`, `cout_sel`, and `out_sel` based on `i_function` to handle operations like operand swapping and selection of carry inputs and outputs. The ALU also includes conditional compilation paths for optimized arithmetic blocks specific to Xilinx FPGA hardware variants. The key computation sections manage operand selection, carry manipulation, result computation using optimized or generic adders, and final output and flag assignment, all correlated closely with operations designated by the function code input."
