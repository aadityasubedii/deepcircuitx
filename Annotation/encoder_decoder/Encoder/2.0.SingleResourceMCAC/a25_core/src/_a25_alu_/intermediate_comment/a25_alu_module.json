    "module": "Module-level comment: The a25_alu module serves as an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for various arithmetic and logical operations based on inputs `i_a_in`, `i_b_in`, and control signals. The output consists of a 32-bit result and flags indicating the operation status. It implements configurable operations through internal controls set by `i_function`, using multiplexers and conditionally compiled FPGA-optimized arithmetic blocks, efficiently handling binary arithmetic, logical operations, and carry management."
