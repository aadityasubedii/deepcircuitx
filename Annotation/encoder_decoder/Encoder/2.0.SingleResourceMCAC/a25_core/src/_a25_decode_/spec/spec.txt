Module name: a25_decode. Module specification: This module serves as the instruction decoder for an ARM processor design. It takes in fetched instructions, decodes them to determine the operation to be performed, and generates control signals for other parts of the processor. The module handles various instruction types including register operations, memory transfers, branches, and coprocessor instructions. It also manages interrupt handling and execution state transitions. Key inputs include the clock, reset, fetched instruction, and various status signals, while outputs consist of numerous control signals for ALU operations, register selection, memory access, and processor state management. Internal signals are used for instruction decoding, pipeline management, and conflict detection. The module is structured into several main blocks: instruction decoding logic, control state machine, interrupt handling, and various execution units for different instruction types (e.g., ALU operations, memory transfers, multiplication). It implements conditional execution, manages the program counter, and controls the ALU, register
