    "module": "This module decodes ARM instructions and generates control signals for an ARM processor. It implements a state machine to handle various instruction types, including register operations, memory transfers, branches, and coprocessor instructions. The decoder processes conditional execution, manages interrupts, and controls the ALU, register bank, and memory access. It uses a pipeline structure with instruction pre-fetching and conflict detection to optimize performance. The module also handles special cases like multiply operations and swap instructions, and manages processor mode changes and status flag updates."
