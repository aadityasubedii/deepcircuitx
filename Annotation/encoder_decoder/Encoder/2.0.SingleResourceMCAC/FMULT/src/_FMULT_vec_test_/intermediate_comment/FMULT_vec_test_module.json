    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module acts as a testbench for the FMULT module, simulating various DSP operations like encoding and decoding under different conditions. It leverages input and output ports tied to a clock signal, reset, and scan chain mechanisms to feed and verify test data dynamically. Internal arrays defining rates, laws, types, and operations guide the extensive tests run through nested loops, which cyclically configure FMULT, apply inputs, and verify outputs against expected results, confirming the module's robustness and compliance under varying operational conditions."
