    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"test\" module serves as a testbench for the FMULT module, providing clock and reset controls, scan chain inputs and outputs, and test mode settings to facilitate functional verification. It initializes the environment, instantiates the FMULT module, and sets up simulation parameters, employing internal signals and an initial block to systematically simulate and validate FMULT's behavior under varied conditions."
