    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The \"test\" module is a Verilog testbench designed primarily to verify the operation of the \"FMULT\" module by setting up a testing environment. It configures essential input signals including the clock (`clk`), reset (`reset`), scan chain inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`), a scan operation enable signal (`scan_enable`), and a test mode signal (`test_mode`). The testbench then monitors outputs through signals `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, which represent the results from the internal operations of the FMULT module after applying test data. Internally, the module has reg-type declarations for input signals ensuring control over signal initialization, and wire-type declarations for output signals to capture the results from FMULT. The code is divided mainly into two sections: instantiating the FMULT module with proper signal connections and an initial block that sets up the simulation parameters including timeformat and optional SDF annotation for scan delay effects, initializing the stimuli signals, and terminating the simulation with `$finish`. This structured setup helps in accurately simulating and observing the behaviour of the \"FMULT\" module under test conditions, thereby verifying its functionality.",
