Module-level comment: The code line "`timescale 1ns / 1ns`" is a directive for Verilog simulation tools, setting both time unit and precision to 1 nanosecond. It ensures uniform timing interpretation across simulations but does not define module functionality, inputs, outputs, or internal logic operations. This directive is crucial for accurate simulation timing but does not constitute an actual hardware module implementation.
