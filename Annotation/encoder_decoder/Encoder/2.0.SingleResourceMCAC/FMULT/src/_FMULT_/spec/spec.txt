Module name: FMULT. 

Module specification: The FMULT module is designed to compute the product of two floating-point numbers formatted with sign, exponent, and mantissa parts. The primary functionality is to multiply `AnBn` and `SRnDQn` floating-point inputs and output the result through `WAnWBn`. Input ports include `reset`, `clk` for synchronization, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, and `scan_enable` plus `test_mode` for testing configurations, alongside the primary data inputs `AnBn` (16-bit) and `SRnDQn` (11-bit). Output ports comprise `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, matching the scan inputs for testing chains, and `WAnWBn` (16-bit) which provides the product of the inputs. Internally, the module uses several signals to handle intermediate operations: `AnBnS` and `SRnDQnS` extract sign bits; `AnBnMAG`, `AnBnEXP` process the magnitude and exponent of `AnBn`; similarly, `SRnDQnEXP` and `SRnDQnMANT` for `SRnDQn`; and `WAnWBnS`, `WAnWBnEXP`, `WAnWBnMANT`, `WAnWBnMAG` represent the resulting sign, exponent, mantissa, and magnitude of the output. The code implements extraction and bit manipulation through `assign` statements. An always block is employed predominantly for exponent determination of `AnBn` using a case statement for leading one detection, and mathematical operations involving shifts and additions are performed to compute the final floating-point result, factoring in adjustments for different magnitudes and signs of the input values.
