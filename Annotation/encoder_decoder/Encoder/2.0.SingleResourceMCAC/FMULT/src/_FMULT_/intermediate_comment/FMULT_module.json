    "module": "Module-level comment: The FMULT module multiplies two floating-point numbers, AnBn and SRnDQn, and outputs the product WAnWBn, all formatted with sign, exponent, and mantissa. The implementation extracts signs, computes magnitudes and exponents, and processes multiplication capturing sign differences. Control is managed through clock and reset signals along with scan and test configurations for integration into larger systems, mainly using bit manipulations and arithmetical operations."
