The inputs to the module include AnBn and SRnDQn, each carrying its respective sign, exponent, and mantissa values. The module computes the product of these inputs and provides the result as output WAnWBn, also formatted with a sign, exponent, and mantissa. This is accomplished through bit manipulation, addition of exponents, and multiplication of mantissas, taking into account sign differences by XOR operation and alignment shifts controlled by computed exponents. The module also supports certain test and scanning features, making it adaptable for integration and testing in larger digital system environments."
