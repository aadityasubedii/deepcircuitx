Module-level comment: The Verilog snippet contains only a `timescale directive, which sets both the simulation's time unit and precision to 1 nanosecond. This directive ensures that the simulation's timing behavior is managed consistently, with no additional module or functional blocks implemented. The sole purpose is to configure how time is measured during simulations, without any input, output, or internal computational logic.
