Module-level comment: The 'test' module serves as a test bench for the 'wishbone_arbiter', configuring initial conditions like clock, reset, and scan chain signals. It initializes inputs and enables conditions via an 'initial' block, ensuring controlled setups for functionality and timing tests of the 'wishbone_arbiter' under various conditions, facilitated by conditional SDF annotation for scan testing.
