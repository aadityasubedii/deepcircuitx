    "spec": "Module name: test. \nModule specification: The 'test' module functions as a test bench for the 'wishbone_arbiter' module, handling the initialization and configuration of simulation conditions such as clock signals, reset states, and scan chains. It specifies input ports including 'reset', 'clk' (the clock signal), 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' (scan inputs for testing internal states), 'scan_enable' (activates scan testing), and 'test_mode' (enables test operation mode). Output ports comprise 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4', which echo the results of processing their corresponding scan inputs. Internally, the module utilizes registers for the control signals and inputs, and wires for the outputs, all properly connected to the 'wishbone_arbiter' module. The 'initial' block in the code sets the initial conditions by resetting all inputs and controls, annotating with SDF files under conditional compilation for scan testing, and executing a termination with '$finish' after setup. This setup ensures the 'wishbone_arbiter' is tested under controlled, reproducible conditions, verifying functionality and timing in various operating modes.",
