    "module": "Module-level comment: The `wishbone_arbiter` module arbitrates access between a master and multiple slaves in a Wishbone bus interface, directing address, data, and control signals as per the transaction requirements. It uses internal signals to determine the active slave based on the master's address and routes the input signals from the master to the selected slave while managing outputs back to the master based on slave responses. This ensures efficient, conflict-free communication in multi-master-slave systems.\n"
