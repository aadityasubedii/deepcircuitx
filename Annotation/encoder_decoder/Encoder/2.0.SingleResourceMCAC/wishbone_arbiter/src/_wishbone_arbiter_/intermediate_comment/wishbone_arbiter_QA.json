It primarily determines which master gets access to which slave based on the master's address and operational signals. The module routes master command signals such as address, data, and control signals to the appropriate slave based on the current slave selection, and it handles the return path of data, acknowledgment, and error signals from slaves back to the master. This ensures coordinated and conflict-free data transfer within the system that has multiple masters and slaves connected via the Wishbone bus."
