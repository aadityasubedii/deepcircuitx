Module name: `wishbone_arbiter`

Module specification: The `wishbone_arbiter` module is designed to manage the routing and control signals between one master and multiple slaves in a Wishbone bus interface system. It arbitrates access, ensuring that signals such as data, addresses, and control flags are correctly distributed between the master and the relevant slave based on the current transaction. Inputs to the module include `reset`, `clk` (for synchronization), various `scan` inputs for test configurations, and signals (`i_m0_wb_*`) from the master specifying address, data, control aspects like write enable, and strobe signals. Outputs include `scan_out*` for test outputs, `o_m0_wb_*` delivering data, acknowledgments, or errors back to the master, and `o_sX_wb_*` (where X is the slave index) designating routed signals to each slave such as address and control flags conditioned on the active slave. Internal signals like `current_slave` determine the active slave based on the address, and `master_*` signals hold the routed master inputs. The code has multiple blocks assigning these internal signals and output signals. Each block setup involves directing specific segments of the masterâ€™s input to appropriate slave outputs conditional on the active slave and handling the feedback from slaves back to the master. Additionally, it incorporates logic for DFT and operational testing via specific test input and output pins. This module ensures streamlined, conflict-free data transactions adhering to the Wishbone protocol standards within a multi-master-slave system setup.
