    "module": "Module-level comment: /* This module is a testbench for a Wishbone bus arbiter. It verifies the functionality of a 'wishbone_arbiter' module by simulating transactions between one master and ten slave interfaces. The testbench generates clock and reset signals, initializes inputs, and performs a series of transactions across all slave interfaces, checking for correct signal routing and timing. It uses internal signals for verification and includes error checking to ensure proper arbiter operation. */"
