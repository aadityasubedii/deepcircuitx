Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is a testbench for a Wishbone bus arbiter, designed to verify the functionality of a 'wishbone_arbiter' module. It simulates a system with one master and ten slave interfaces, each with 32-bit data width and 4-bit select width. The module generates clock and reset signals, and includes input ports for scan testing (scan_in0 to scan_in4, scan_enable, test_mode) and Wishbone interface signals for the master and slaves (address, data, control signals). Output ports include scan chain outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4). Internal signals (adr, sel, we, cyc, stb, dat, slave_data, i) are used for verification and temporary storage. The testbench initializes all signals, performs a reset sequence, and then iterates through each slave interface
