Module name: test. 

Module specification: The "test" module is designed primarily for simulation and testing of the 'FLOATA' module. It initializes the 'FLOATA' module with several signals including a clock (`clk`), reset (`reset`), and scan chain inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`). The module supports scan mode and test mode through signals `scan_enable` and `test_mode`, respectively. Output results from the 'FLOATA' are captured in scan chain outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`). The internal signals comprise both input and output types for synchronization, initialization, testing, and debugging functionalities. The module infrastructure includes the instantiation of the 'FLOATA' block connecting all relevant input and output signals, setup in an initial block that formats simulation time display, potentially annotates a Standard Delay Format (SDF) file into the simulation when compiled with `SDFSCAN`, and sets default states for all specified signals concluding with the termination of the simulation. This setup is pivotal for testing the operational and timing characteristics of the 'FLOATA' circuit under various simulated conditions.
