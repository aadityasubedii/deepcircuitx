Module name: FLOATA. 
Module specification: The FLOATA module processes a 16-bit input signal, DQ, and produces an 11-bit output, DQ0, encoded in a pseudo-floating-point format. This Verilog module includes input ports such as reset, clk for resetting states and controlling operation timing, respectively, and multiple scan-related inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4, scan_enable, test_mode) used for testing purposes. The output ports include corresponding scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) and the main output DQ0. Internally, the module uses several signals: DQS (sign bit of DQ), MAG (magnitude after masking the sign bit from DQ), EXP (floating-point exponent), and MANT (mantissa). The primary operations are performed in several procedural blocks where DQS is directly assigned from DQ's MSB, MAG is calculated by masking DQ's sign, and a case structure determines EXP based on MAG's most significant '1'. The MANT is then calculated by shifting MAG based on EXP, and finally, DQ0 is formed by concatenating DQS, EXP, and MANT. This module effectively transforms the binary data from DQ into a compact, pseudo-floating-point representation in DQ0, capitalizing on structural and conditional assignments alongside priority encoders to establish the transformation logic.
