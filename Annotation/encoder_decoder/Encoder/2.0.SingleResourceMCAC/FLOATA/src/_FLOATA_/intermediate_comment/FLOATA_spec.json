    "spec": "Module name: FLOATA. \nModule specification: The FLOATA module processes a 16-bit input signal, DQ, and produces an 11-bit output, DQ0, encoded in a pseudo-floating-point format. This Verilog module includes input ports such as reset, clk for resetting states and controlling operation timing, respectively, and multiple scan-related inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4, scan_enable, test_mode) used for testing purposes. The output ports include corresponding scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) and the main output DQ0. Internally, the module uses several signals: DQS (sign bit of DQ), MAG (magnitude after masking the sign bit from DQ), EXP (floating-point exponent), and MANT (mantissa). The primary operations are performed in several procedural blocks where DQS is directly assigned from DQ's MSB, MAG is calculated by masking DQ's sign, and a case structure determines EXP based on MAG's most significant '1'. The MANT is then calculated by shifting MAG based on EXP, and finally, DQ0 is formed by concatenating DQS, EXP, and MANT. This module effectively transforms the binary data from DQ into a compact, pseudo-floating-point representation in DQ0, capitalizing on structural and conditional assignments alongside priority encoders to establish the transformation logic.",

It captures the most significant bit (`DQ[15]`) and thus denotes the sign of the input value, where `1` typically represents a negative number and `0` represents a positive number in signed binary representations.\n- `MAG`: This wire holds the magnitude of the input `DQ`, which is the absolute value derived by masking off the sign bit. This is done by performing a bitwise AND operation between `DQ` and `32767` (binary representation `0111111111111111`), which effectively retains all bits of `DQ` except the sign bit.\n- `EXP`: This register stores the exponent derived during the processing of `MAG`. The exponent `EXP` is calculated based on the position of the most significant '1' in `MAG`. This calculation helps in encoding the magnitude of `DQ` into a floating-point-like format where `EXP` specifies the number of positions the most significant '1' has shifted from the least significant bit.\n- `MANT`: This wire carries the mantissa of the processed value, which is computed as a resultant value after right-shifting `MAG` concatenated with six zeros by the value `EXP`. This operation scales down `MAG` based on the computed exponent `EXP`, contributing to the pseudo-floating-point representation of the input signal `DQ`."
