    "module": "Module-level comment: The FLOATA module converts a 16-bit input DQ into an 11-bit pseudo-floating-point representation DQ0. It extracts the sign bit (DQS), computes the magnitude (MAG), determines the appropriate exponent (EXP) based on the position of MAG's most significant '1', and calculates the mantissa (MANT) by right-shifting MAG. DQ0 is created by concatenating DQS, EXP, and MANT, effectively encoding the input into a compact format. This module utilizes combinational and sequential logic to manage the data transformation within a synchronous digital system."
