The input is separated into a sign bit `DQS` and a magnitude `MAG`. The magnitude undergoes a binary floating-point-like transformation where an exponent `EXP` and a mantissa `MANT` are derived. Specifically, `EXP` is determined based on the position of the most significant '1' in `MAG`, and `MANT` is a shifted version of `MAG` adjusted by `EXP`. Finally, `DQ0` combines `DQS`, `EXP`, and `MANT` to form the output, effectively encoding the magnitude in a pseudo-floating-point format."

It captures the most significant bit (`DQ[15]`) and thus denotes the sign of the input value, where `1` typically represents a negative number and `0` represents a positive number in signed binary representations.\n- `MAG`: This wire holds the magnitude of the input `DQ`, which is the absolute value derived by masking off the sign bit. This is done by performing a bitwise AND operation between `DQ` and `32767` (binary representation `0111111111111111`), which effectively retains all bits of `DQ` except the sign bit.\n- `EXP`: This register stores the exponent derived during the processing of `MAG`. The exponent `EXP` is calculated based on the position of the most significant '1' in `MAG`. This calculation helps in encoding the magnitude of `DQ` into a floating-point-like format where `EXP` specifies the number of positions the most significant '1' has shifted from the least significant bit.\n- `MANT`: This wire carries the mantissa of the processed value, which is computed as a resultant value after right-shifting `MAG` concatenated with six zeros by the value `EXP`. This operation scales down `MAG` based on the computed exponent `EXP`, contributing to the pseudo-floating-point representation of the input signal `DQ`."
