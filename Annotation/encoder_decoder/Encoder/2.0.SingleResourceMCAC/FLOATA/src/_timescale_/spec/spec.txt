Module name: Not available.
Module specification: The provided Verilog code snippet does not define a Verilog module but solely includes a `timescale directive. This directive specifies the simulation time unit and time precision, both set at 1 nanosecond. There is no module name, functionality description, input or output ports, or internal signals mentioned. Furthermore, there are no blocks or sections within the code as it contains only the `timescale directive used for simulation purposes in Verilog environments. The absence of a module definition or any logical descriptions implies that the snippet is intended for configuration in a testbench or other modules, not standalone functionality.
