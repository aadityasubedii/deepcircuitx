    "module": "Module-level comment: The Verilog snippet contains solely the `timescale directive, setting both the simulation time unit and precision to 1ns. This directive is used for configuration purposes in simulations, ensuring temporal accuracy and consistency. It does not form part of a module's functional or structural implementation but assists in aligning simulation environments. No module, ports, or internal logic are defined within this code."
