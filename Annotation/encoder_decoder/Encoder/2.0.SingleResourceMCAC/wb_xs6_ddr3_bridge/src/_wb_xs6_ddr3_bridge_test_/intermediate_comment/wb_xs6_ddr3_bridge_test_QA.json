This setup might be used for testing functionality or for running simulations to validate design operation.

When high, it allows the shifting of test data via scan inputs.\n- **test_mode**: This input enables the test mode of operation for additional test or debug functionalities.\n\nOutput ports: scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4. \nExplanation: \n- **scan_out0 to scan_out4**: These are scan outputs corresponding to the scan inputs. They are used in scan testing to chain and observe the module outputs after processing the input test data via scanning, facilitating fault detection and characterization in integrated circuits."

It ensures that all operations occur in a coordinated manner according to the system's clock.\n- **reset**: This signal is used to return the system to its initial state or a predefined safe state. It's crucial during the initial power-up of the system or when it needs to recover from an error state.\n- **scan_in0 to scan_in4**: These inputs are part of a scan chain, often used in testing to inject specific test data into the module. They facilitate the checking and verification of internal states and logic by shifting in test patterns.\n- **scan_enable**: This is a control signal used to activate the scan mode operation. When scan_enable is set high, it allows the shifted-in test data (from scan_in0 to scan_in4) to propagate through the device for test purposes.\n- **test_mode**: When activated, this input puts the module into a test or diagnostic mode, enabling certain features or behaviors that aid in testing the function of the module.\n- **scan_out0 to scan_out4**: These outputs are the resultants of the scan input data being processed by the module. They provide feedback from the scan operation, showing the outgoing test data after it has traversed the internal logic. This is essential for analyzing the integrity and correctness of the module's operations under test conditions."
