    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for the `wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge`, incorporating input and output configurations such as clock, reset, scan inputs and outputs, and test modes to simulate different scenarios. The functionalities are achieved through direct connections to the bridge module and controlled initialization in the Verilog code, including optional SDF annotation for timing checks during post-layout simulations."
