Module name: test. 
Module specification: The 'test' module in Verilog serves as a testbench for the `wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge` component, focusing on initializing and configuring the environment suitable for scan and test modes, as well as simulating the functionality of the design. The module has several input ports including `clk` (clock signal to synchronize operations), `reset` (for initializing or resetting the system), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (input channels for scan testing), `scan_enable` (activates the scan operation), and `test_mode` (enables specific test functionalities). Corresponding output ports `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` are used to output the results of the scan test data processed within the module. The internal signals mirror these inputs and outputs, serving to manage the flow and processing of test data within the testbench environment. In the Verilog code, the instantiation of the `wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge` module connects these inputs and outputs directly. The initial block sets up the simulation environment, including time format, optional SDF annotation for post-layout simulations under scan test conditions, and initial conditions for the testbench signals, leading to a termination of simulation after setting up initial conditions.
