Module name: test. Module specification: The "test" module is specifically created for simulation and testing purposes, aimed at rigorously checking the functionality of the 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge' component in various conditions. It utilizes input ports such as clk (clock), reset, scan_in0 to scan_in4 for delivering test data into the internal state of the bridge, scan_enable for toggling between normal and test modes, and test_mode which adjusts the bridgeâ€™s operational mode to meet specific test criteria. The output ports include scan_out0 to scan_out4 which are used to monitor the data ejected from the bridge's internal test mechanisms, ensuring proper operation and testing are accomplished. Internally, this module houses registers for inputs and wires for outputs, setting up necessary controls and data paths for bridge operation and its state modifications. The initial block in the code sets up the simulation environment, conditions for SDF (Standard Delay Format) back-annotation under the compile-time flag 'SDFSCAN', and initializes the various control and test signals to begin the testing sequence, which concludes with a simulation finish command. This arrangement ensures that the 'wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge' is thoroughly vetted for functionality and timing before deployment.
