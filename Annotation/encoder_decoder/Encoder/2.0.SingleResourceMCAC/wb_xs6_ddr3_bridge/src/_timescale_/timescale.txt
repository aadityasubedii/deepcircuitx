Module-level comment: This Verilog snippet includes only a `timescale directive` (`timescale 1ns / 1ns`), used to set the simulation's time unit and precision to 1 nanosecond. It does not define a module or include any implementation details, inputs, outputs, or internal signals but solely sets the timing configuration for simulation environments.
