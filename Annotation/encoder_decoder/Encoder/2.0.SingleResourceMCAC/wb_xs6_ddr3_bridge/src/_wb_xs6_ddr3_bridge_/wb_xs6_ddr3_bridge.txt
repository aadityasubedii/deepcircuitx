Module-level comment: The wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge module interfaces between a Wishbone bus and a DDR3 memory controller, handling memory read and write operations with signal synchronization and buffer management. It uses input signals to manage request states and outputs to control data transfer, employing registers and conditional logic to adapt to DDR3's operational constraints and ensure robust data flow and error handling.
