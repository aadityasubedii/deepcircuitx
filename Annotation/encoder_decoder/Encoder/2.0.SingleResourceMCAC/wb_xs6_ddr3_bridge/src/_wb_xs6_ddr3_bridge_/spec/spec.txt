Module name: wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge. 

Module specification: The wb_xs6_ddr3_bridge is a Verilog module designed to bridge the Wishbone bus protocol and a DDR3 memory controller, handling read and write operations between the two. It features various input ports such as `i_clk` (clock input), `i_mem_ctrl` (memory control signal for address mapping), `i_wb_adr` (Wishbone address), `i_wb_sel` (active byte selection), `i_wb_we` (write enable signal), `i_wb_dat` (data from Wishbone for writing), `i_wb_cyc` (indicates active transfer cycle), `i_wb_stb` (valid cycle strobe signal), `i_cmd_full` (DDR3 command queue full indicator), `i_wr_full` (DDR3 write buffer full indicator), `i_rd_data` (data read from DDR3), `i_rd_empty` (DDR3 read buffer empty indicator). The output ports include `o_wb_dat` (data to Wishbone), `o_wb_ack` (transfer acknowledgment to Wishbone), `o_wb_err` (error signal), `o_cmd_en` (command enable to DDR3), `o_cmd_instr` (DDR3 command), `o_cmd_byte_addr` (byte address for DDR3), `o_wr_en` (DDR3 write enable), `o_wr_mask` (write mask), and `o_wr_data` (data written to DDR3).

The internal signals such as `write_request`, `read_request`, `write_buf_r`, `wb_sel_buf_r`, `wb_dat_buf_r`, `wb_adr_buf_r`, `wb_sel`, `wb_adr`, `wb_dat`, `write_ack` manage requests, buffering, and conditional data flow based on DDR3 and Wishbone bus states. The module includes logic for capturing write and read requests, transitioning these through registered flags to manage synchronous DDR3 memory interactions. Conditional write processes adjust data masking based on the write data width setting. Read processes toggle readiness based on data availability and manage the sequential data read-back aligned with the Wishbone address requests. The module thereby ensures efficient and error-free data transactions between a standard bus interface and high-speed DDR3 memory.
