It goes high if the Wishbone strobe (`i_wb_stb`), write enable (`i_wb_we`), and `read_request_r` are correctly asserted.\n- `read_request`: A signal that indicates a read operation is requested. It is high if the Wishbone strobe (`i_wb_stb`) is asserted and write enable (`i_wb_we`) is deasserted, along with `read_ready` being true.\n- `write_request_r`: A registered version of `write_request`, used to latch the write request condition for synchronization with the DDR3 operations.\n- `read_request_r`: Registered version of `read_request`, serves a similar purpose as `write_request_r` but for read operations.\n- `read_active_r`: Keeps track of ongoing read operations until they are acknowledged. It helps in managing the read process from DDR3 to Wishbone.\n- `wb_adr_r`: Registered version of Wishbone address signal (`i_wb_adr`). It is modified or directly used based on `i_mem_ctrl` signal conditioning.\n- `cmd_full_r`: A registered signal to track the status of the DDR3 command full status (`i_cmd_full`).\n- `read_ack_r`: Flags when the read data is ready to be transferred to the Wishbone bus.\n- `read_ready`: A control signal to indicate that the module is ready for a new read request.\n- `cmd_en_r`: Used to enable transmission of commands to DDR3, driven by conditions of read or write requests and absence of command full status.\n- `wr_en_r`: Used to signal a write enable for DDR3 based on write operation requests and buffering control.\n- `write_buf_r`: Indicates if write operation data is buffered due to DDR3 command or data channel being previously full.\n- `wb_sel_buf_r`, `wb_dat_buf_r`, `wb_adr_buf_r`: Buffer registers for the `i_wb_sel`, `i_wb_dat`, and `i_wb_adr` inputs, respectively, used when the DDR3 interfaces are busy.\n- `wb_sel`, `wb_dat`, `wb_adr`: Signals used to determine current active selection, data, and address lines for DDR3 operations either directly or from buffer based on the status of `write_buf_r`.\n- `write_ack`: A handshake signal that gets asserted when DDR3 write commands are successfully latched and the write buffer is not active.\n\nThese internal signals play crucial roles in managing transaction continuity, buffering, and interfacing between the Wishbone protocol and the DDR3 memory's operation requirements, ensuring data integrity and operational synchronization."

It goes high if the Wishbone strobe (`i_wb_stb`), write enable (`i_wb_we`), and `read_request_r` are correctly asserted.\n- `read_request`: A signal that indicates a read operation is requested. It is high if the Wishbone strobe (`i_wb_stb`) is asserted and write enable (`i_wb_we`) is deasserted, along with `read_ready` being true.\n- `write_request_r`: A registered version of `write_request`, used to latch the write request condition for synchronization with the DDR3 operations.\n- `read_request_r`: Registered version of `read_request`, serves a similar purpose as `write_request_r` but for read operations.\n- `read_active_r`: Keeps track of ongoing read operations until they are acknowledged. It helps in managing the read process from DDR3 to Wishbone.\n- `wb_adr_r`: Registered version of Wishbone address signal (`i_wb_adr`). It is modified or directly used based on `i_mem_ctrl` signal conditioning.\n- `cmd_full_r`: A registered signal to track the status of the DDR3 command full status (`i_cmd_full`).\n- `read_ack_r`: Flags when the read data is ready to be transferred to the Wishbone bus.\n- `read_ready`: A control signal to indicate that the module is ready for a new read request.\n- `cmd_en_r`: Used to enable transmission of commands to DDR3, driven by conditions of read or write requests and absence of command full status.\n- `wr_en_r`: Used to signal a write enable for DDR3 based on write operation requests and buffering control.\n- `write_buf_r`: Indicates if write operation data is buffered due to DDR3 command or data channel being previously full.\n- `wb_sel_buf_r`, `wb_dat_buf_r`, `wb_adr_buf_r`: Buffer registers for the `i_wb_sel`, `i_wb_dat`, and `i_wb_adr` inputs, respectively, used when the DDR3 interfaces are busy.\n- `wb_sel`, `wb_dat`, `wb_adr`: Signals used to determine current active selection, data, and address lines for DDR3 operations either directly or from buffer based on the status of `write_buf_r`.\n- `write_ack`: A handshake signal that gets asserted when DDR3 write commands are successfully latched and the write buffer is not active.\n\nThese internal signals play crucial roles in managing transaction continuity, buffering, and interfacing between the Wishbone protocol and the DDR3 memory's operation requirements, ensuring data integrity and operational synchronization."

It features various input ports such as `i_clk` (clock input), `i_mem_ctrl` (memory control signal for address mapping), `i_wb_adr` (Wishbone address), `i_wb_sel` (active byte selection), `i_wb_we` (write enable signal), `i_wb_dat` (data from Wishbone for writing), `i_wb_cyc` (indicates active transfer cycle), `i_wb_stb` (valid cycle strobe signal), `i_cmd_full` (DDR3 command queue full indicator), `i_wr_full` (DDR3 write buffer full indicator), `i_rd_data` (data read from DDR3), `i_rd_empty` (DDR3 read buffer empty indicator). The output ports include `o_wb_dat` (data to Wishbone), `o_wb_ack` (transfer acknowledgment to Wishbone), `o_wb_err` (error signal), `o_cmd_en` (command enable to DDR3), `o_cmd_instr` (DDR3 command), `o_cmd_byte_addr` (byte address for DDR3), `o_wr_en` (DDR3 write enable), `o_wr_mask` (write mask), and `o_wr_data` (data written to DDR3).\n\nThe internal signals such as `write_request`, `read_request`, `write_buf_r`, `wb_sel_buf_r`, `wb_dat_buf_r`, `wb_adr_buf_r`, `wb_sel`, `wb_adr`, `wb_dat`, `write_ack` manage requests, buffering, and conditional data flow based on DDR3 and Wishbone bus states. The module includes logic for capturing write and read requests, transitioning these through registered flags to manage synchronous DDR3 memory interactions. Conditional write processes adjust data masking based on the write data width setting. Read processes toggle readiness based on data availability and manage the sequential data read-back aligned with the Wishbone address requests. The module thereby ensures efficient and error-free data transactions between a standard bus interface and high-speed DDR3 memory."
