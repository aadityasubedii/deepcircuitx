    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The \"test\" module primarily serves as a testbench for an embedded XOR submodule, facilitating scan testing and mode settings for comprehensive simulations of XOR operations under various conditions. It includes input ports such as clk (clock signal), reset (resets the module's internal states), scan_in0 to scan_in4 (scan inputs for serial data shifting), scan_enable (activates the scan chain mode), test_mode (enables specific operational test modes), DQ (multi-bit operational data input), and DQn (complementary or variable data input related to DQ). The output ports are scan_out0 to scan_out4 (used for shifting data out serially in scan testing), and Un (an additional output whose specific role is context-dependent). Internal signals mirror these inputs and are used to drive both the main module logic and the embedded XOR submodule, ensuring the correct sequential and combinational logic behavior under test conditions. The code structure includes the XOR submodule instantiation, an always block to generate the clock, and an initial block that sets up the test environment, possibly annotating Standard Delay Format (SDF) files for timing simulations and initializing all inputs for a defined start state. This setup is crucial for accurately assessing the XOR submodule's functionality and reliability.",
