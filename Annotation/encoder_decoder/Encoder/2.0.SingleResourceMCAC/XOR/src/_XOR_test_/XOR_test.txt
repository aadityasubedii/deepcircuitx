Module-level comment: The "test" module simulates the XOR submodule for testing purposes, integrating scan testing and mode setting functionalities. It utilizes input signals like clk, reset, and scan inputs to control and monitor the XOR operations, and outputs scan results. The module employs flip-flops for state management and a clock generation block to synchronize operations, ensuring accurate testing outcomes are achieved via setup and simulation protocols.
