    "module": "Module-level comment: The XOR module performs a bitwise XOR between the most significant bits of two input signals, DQ (16-bit) and DQn (11-bit). It utilizes internal registers DQS and DQnS to store these bits. The module outputs the XOR result on Un, and includes diagnostic scan outputs. The logic, encapsulated inside an always block, activates on changes to DQ or DQn, ensuring dynamic response with input variations."
