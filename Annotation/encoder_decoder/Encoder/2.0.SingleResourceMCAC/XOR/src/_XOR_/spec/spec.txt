Module name: XOR. 
Module specification: The XOR module is designed to perform a bitwise XOR operation on the most significant bits of two input signals, DQ and DQn, and produces the result on the output signal Un. This module utilizes several input ports: 'reset' and 'clk' for initializing and clocking purposes, 'scan_in0' through 'scan_in4' and 'scan_enable' for handling scan operations, and 'test_mode' for toggling between normal and test operational modes. The signal DQ is a 16-bit input, utilized for its 15th bit, while DQn is an 11-bit input, utilized for its 10th bit. Outputs include 'scan_out0' through 'scan_out4' for scan diagnostic results and 'Un' which carries the XOR result of DQ[15] and DQn[10]. Internally, the module declares and uses two registers, DQS and DQnS, to temporarily store these significant bits for the XOR computation. The primary functional block, set within an always block triggered by changes in DQ or DQn, captures the significant bits from inputs, executes the XOR operation, and updates the output Un accordingly.
