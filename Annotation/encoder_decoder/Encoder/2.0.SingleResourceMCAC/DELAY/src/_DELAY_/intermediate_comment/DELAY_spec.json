It incorporates input ports including reset, clk, scan_in0-4, scan_enable, test_mode, and X, which facilitate resetting operations, clock synchronization, testing scenarios, and signal input, respectively. The output consists of Y and scan_out0-4, with Y providing the delayed signal and the scan outputs serving purposes related to testing, not explicitly detailed in the provided functionality. Internally, the module uses an array of 31 registers (R) and a single register (Y). Each element in R acts as a stage in a shift register, storing intermediate delayed states of X, while Y outputs the final delayed signal. The always block in the code handles both reset behavior, setting all registers to a default reset value (RSTVAL), and the normal operation which shifts values through the R array and updates Y with the value from the final register in the sequence. The module architecture efficiently supports both the functional requirement of delaying signal X and the testing infrastructure without any formulation delays.\n",

It uses a shift register implemented as an array of registers (R) to hold intermediate values of the signal, each slot in the array representing a delay of one clock cycle. The parameter SIZE defines the bit-width of the signal X and Y, whereas RSTVAL sets the reset value. The module outputs the delayed version of X through Y. When the reset is active, all register values, including Y, are set to RSTVAL. During each positive clock edge, the values in the register array R are shifted by one position, effectively moving the input signal X through the registers over time and eventually outputting a delayed version at Y."
