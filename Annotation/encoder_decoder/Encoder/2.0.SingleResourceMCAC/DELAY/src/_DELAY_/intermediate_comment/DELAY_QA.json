It uses a shift register implemented as an array of registers (R) to hold intermediate values of the signal, each slot in the array representing a delay of one clock cycle. The parameter SIZE defines the bit-width of the signal X and Y, whereas RSTVAL sets the reset value. The module outputs the delayed version of X through Y. When the reset is active, all register values, including Y, are set to RSTVAL. During each positive clock edge, the values in the register array R are shifted by one position, effectively moving the input signal X through the registers over time and eventually outputting a delayed version at Y."
