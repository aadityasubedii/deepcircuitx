Module name: DELAY. 
Module specification: The DELAY module is designed to introduce a precise 31-clock-cycle delay to its input signal, X. It incorporates input ports including reset, clk, scan_in0-4, scan_enable, test_mode, and X, which facilitate resetting operations, clock synchronization, testing scenarios, and signal input, respectively. The output consists of Y and scan_out0-4, with Y providing the delayed signal and the scan outputs serving purposes related to testing, not explicitly detailed in the provided functionality. Internally, the module uses an array of 31 registers (R) and a single register (Y). Each element in R acts as a stage in a shift register, storing intermediate delayed states of X, while Y outputs the final delayed signal. The always block in the code handles both reset behavior, setting all registers to a default reset value (RSTVAL), and the normal operation which shifts values through the R array and updates Y with the value from the final register in the sequence. The module architecture efficiently supports both the functional requirement of delaying signal X and the testing infrastructure without any formulation delays.
