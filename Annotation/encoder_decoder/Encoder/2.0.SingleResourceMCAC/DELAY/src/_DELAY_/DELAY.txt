Module-level comment: The DELAY module delays an input signal X by 31 clock cycles using a shift register. It employs a 31-element array (R) of registers and an output register Y. On each positive clock edge, signal X is shifted through R, and after 31 cycles, output Y captures the delayed signal. Reset synchronously clears all registers to a defined reset value (RSTVAL). This setup is designed to ensure a consistent delay mechanism while supporting test functionalities through additional scan ports.
