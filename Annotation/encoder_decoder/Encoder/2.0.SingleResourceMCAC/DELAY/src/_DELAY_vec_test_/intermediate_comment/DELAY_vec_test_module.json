    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for the DELAY module, simulating various operational conditions. It utilizes input and output ports (scan_in0 to scan_in4, scan_out0 to scan_out4) and controls (clk, reset, scan_enable, test_mode) to evaluate the DELAY module\u2019s response to scan tests and test modes. Implementation includes configuring initial states, optional SDF annotations based on `SDFSCAN` compilation flag, and initializing signals for comprehensive behavioral tests."
