Module-level comment: The provided Verilog code contains only a `timescale directive (1ns / 1ns), setting simulation time resolution and precision. This directive neither defines a module nor its functionality but configures how time is represented in subsequent simulations. No module functionality, ports, or internal signals are specified as this is a global simulation setting.
