Module name: test. 

Module specification: The "test" module is designed to establish a testbench environment for testing and simulating the "TDMO" module. It handles the initialization and configuration of various crucial signals used in scan and test operations. The module includes several input ports: `clk` (clock signal for timing the sequences), `reset` (to reset the TDMO module), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (input signals to inject test data or control signals), `scan_enable` (allows scan operations), and `test_mode` (activates specific test configurations). The output ports include `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, which output the results of scan operations, essential for verifying the TDMO module's response under test conditions. Internal signals mirror these inputs and outputs, ensuring proper linkage and functional simulation within TDMO. The Verilog code for the module contains a connection instantiation for the TDMO module with detailed port mappings, an initial block for setting up initial values and conditions for testing, and optionally, SDF (Standard Delay Format) annotations are applied if compiled with `SDFSCAN` definition for timing simulations. This meticulous setup facilitates exhaustive testing, crucial for validating the TDMO module's design and functionality in simulated scan testing environments.
