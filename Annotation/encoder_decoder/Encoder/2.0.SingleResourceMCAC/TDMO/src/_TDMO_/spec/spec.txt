Module name: TDMO. 
Module specification: The TDMO module stands as a dynamic data processing unit pivotal to time division multiplexing operations, adept at managing the flow of input/output data across multiple channels, and ensuring synchronization via frame sync signals. In terms of interface, the module accommodates inputs including a reset, serial clock (ser_clk), frame synchronization signal (frame_sync_in), scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4), a scan enable signal, a test mode selector, system clock (clk), and Wishbone bus signals such as address (i_wb_adr), select lines (i_wb_sel), write enable (i_wb_we), data input (i_wb_dat), cycle, and strobe control. The output ports include data_out, frame_sync_out, ser_clk_out, scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4), and Wishbone bus outputs comprising data output (o_wb_dat), acknowledgment (o_wb_ack), and error signal (o_wb_err). Internally, the module uses various clock signals (serial_clk, serial_clk_inv, sys_clk, selected_clk) and registers like data_reg for storage, data_buf_1, data_buf_2, data_out_buf for buffering, along with counters like ch_count, bit_count for controlling channel and bit processing, and mechanisms for handling grey code conversions in CHR0 operations. The code is sectioned into blocks handling reset conditions, data processing driven by the selected and inverted clocks, and Wishbone bus communication, ensuring that data integrity, synchronization, and proper interfacing with system protocols are maintained throughout operations. This framework enables TDMO to effectively administer data across different channels, switch operational modes, and interact seamlessly with system-level buses in a synchronized, efficient manner.
