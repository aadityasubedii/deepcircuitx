    "module": "Module-level comment: The TDMO module is a data processor for time division multiplexing, managing multiple data channels and synchronization using frame sync signals. It supports serial and system clocks, scanning inputs, and a Wishbone bus interface for sophisticated data handling. Internally, it utilizes dynamic clock selection (test mode dependent), data buffers, and channel/bit counters to organize and output data, ensuring coherent timing and operational flexibility. This module particularly excels in switching modes and interfacing with system-level buses under different operational conditions."
