Module-level comment: This Verilog code specifies a simulation directive using "`timescale 1ns / 1ps", setting the time unit to 1 nanosecond and precision to 1 picosecond for accurate simulation timing. It does not contain a functional module, inputs, outputs, or internal signals, solely focusing on simulation environment settings.
