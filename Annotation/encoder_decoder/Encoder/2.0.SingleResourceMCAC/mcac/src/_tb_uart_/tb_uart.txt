Module-level comment: The tb_uart module is a UART communication testbench, handling data transmission and reception based on UART protocol. It utilizes input and output ports for clock synchronization, resets, test configurations, and data flow management. Internally, it features state machines for RX/TX processes, a clock buffer for UART timing, and FIFO stacks for TX data buffering, ensuring precise UART operation simulation and data integrity during tests.
