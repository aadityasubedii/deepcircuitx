    "spec": "Module name: tb_uart. Module specification: The tb_uart module functions as a testbench component for simulating UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communications, specifically aiming to handle both data transmission and reception in accordance with UART standards. Its input ports include `clk` for the main clock signal, `reset` for resetting the module, `scan_enable` and `test_mode` for testing configurations, and `i_uart_cts_n` and `i_uart_rxd` serving as the UART clear-to-send indicator (active low) and received data input, respectively. The outputs are `o_uart_txd` for transmitting data and `o_uart_rts_n` (active low), which signifies readiness to send data. In terms of internal signals, key components include `clk_uart` (a buffered clock signal tailored for UART operations), `rx_state` and `tx_state` (managing states for reception and transmission), and various counters and buffers like `rx_byte` and `tx_fifo` to handle data bytes. The Verilog code comprises several blocks: a clock buffer to generate the `clk_uart` signal, state machines for managing RX and TX operations, and a FIFO stack for managing the TX data buffer. It effectively simulates a UART by processing incoming and outgoing data, maintaining synchronization, and ensuring data integrity during test procedures.",

                    "text": "Module name: tb_uart. Module specification: The tb_uart module functions as a testbench component for simulating UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communications, specifically aiming to handle both data transmission and reception in accordance with UART standards. Its input ports include `clk` for the main clock signal, `reset` for resetting the module, `scan_enable` and `test_mode` for testing configurations, and `i_uart_cts_n` and `i_uart_rxd` serving as the UART clear-to-send indicator (active low) and received data input, respectively. The outputs are `o_uart_txd` for transmitting data and `o_uart_rts_n` (active low), which signifies readiness to send data. In terms of internal signals, key components include `clk_uart` (a buffered clock signal tailored for UART operations), `rx_state` and `tx_state` (managing states for reception and transmission), and various counters and buffers like `rx_byte` and `tx_fifo` to handle data bytes. The Verilog code comprises several blocks: a clock buffer to generate the `clk_uart` signal, state machines for managing RX and TX operations, and a FIFO stack for managing the TX data buffer. It effectively simulates a UART by processing incoming and outgoing data, maintaining synchronization, and ensuring data integrity during test procedures."
