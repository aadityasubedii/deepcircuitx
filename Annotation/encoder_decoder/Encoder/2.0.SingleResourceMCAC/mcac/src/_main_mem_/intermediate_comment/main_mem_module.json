    "module": "Module-level comment: The `main_mem` module interfaces with a Wishbone bus, supporting 32-bit or 128-bit data operations for reads and writes. It uses internal logic and memory `ram` to handle transactions, controlled by signals like `start_write`, `i_wb_we`, and `busy`. Page enable and data segmentation are managed through conditional blocks for different widths, employing masks for byte-wise data handling. Data integrity and synchronization are ensured using phased read signals (`start_read_d1`, `start_read_d2`) and dynamic address handling based on `i_mem_ctrl`."
