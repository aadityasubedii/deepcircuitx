Module name: main_mem. Module specification: The `main_mem` module interfaces with a Wishbone-compatible bus and manages memory operations for configurations supporting either 32-bit or 128-bit data widths. The module's input ports include the clock signal (`clk`), a reset (`reset`), and other control signals including `scan_enable`, `test_mode`, and `i_mem_ctrl` to handle specific modes and memory control functions. It also receives address (`i_wb_adr`), select (`i_wb_sel`), data input (`i_wb_dat`), write enable (`i_wb_we`), and strobe (`i_wb_stb`). The outputs are read data (`o_wb_dat`), an acknowledge signal (`o_wb_ack`), and an error signal (`o_wb_err`). Internal signals like `start_write`, `start_read`, `start_read_d1`, `start_read_d2`, `rd_data`, `masked_wdata`, `wr_en`, `wr_mask`, `wr_data`, `addr_d1`, and `busy` control the read and write logic, data manipulation, and synchronization. The module uses two parameterized blocks (for 128-bit or 32-bit operations) configured using a `generate` statement based on `WB_DWIDTH`. Each block handles reset initialization, data writing with byte enabling, and reading operations with specific alignments depending on the data width using registers, memory arrays (`ram`), and conditional logic to maintain data integrity and operational coherence throughout memory transactions.
