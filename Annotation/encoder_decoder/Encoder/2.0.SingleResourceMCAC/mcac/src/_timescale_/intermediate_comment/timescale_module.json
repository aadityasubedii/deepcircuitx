    "module": "Module-level comment: This Verilog directive sets the simulation time scale for any Verilog module that includes it, specifying a time unit of 1 nanosecond and a precision of 1 picosecond. It does not define module functionality or structure but prepares the simulation environment for interpreting time-related operations accurately."
