    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'dumpvcd' module in Verilog handles Value Change Dump (VCD) for debugging by monitoring internal simulation states. It activates VCD based on clock ticks, predefined conditions, and manages dynamic VCD toggling without external I/O. Key controls include initial setup blocks to configure dumping parameters and always blocks for dynamic response to simulation timelines, ensuring detailed state capture for analysis."
