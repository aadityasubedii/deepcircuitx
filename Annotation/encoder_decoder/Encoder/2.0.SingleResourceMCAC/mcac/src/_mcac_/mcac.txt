Module-level comment: The `mcac` module manages secure communication through encryption and decryption. It interfaces with UART and Wishbone bus systems, regulating interactions via parameterized signals and internal configuration controls. This setup includes dedicated sub-modules (`CFG_INT`, `ENC_INST0`, `DEC_INST0`) for configuration, encryption, and decryption, respectively, using both test and operational modes. Comprehensive input and output ports facilitate robust data flow and system control across different communication channels.
