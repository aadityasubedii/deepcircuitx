Module name: test. Module specification: The module 'test' functions as a testbench for the 'ADDB' module, primarily focusing on verifying the functionality and timing aspects through simulation and scan chain testing. It consists of input ports such as `clk` (clock signal driving synchronous operations), `reset` (resets the module state), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (scan inputs for test vector shift-in operation), `scan_enable` (enables scan or test mode), and `test_mode` (activates test-specific operational modes). The output ports include `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, which correspond to the above scan inputs and are utilized to shift out the internal states during test operations. Internal signals mirror the input and output ports, with inputs initialized and controlled directly within the testbench to simulate various conditions. Key blocks in the code include the instantiation of the 'ADDB' module, where all port connections are defined, and the initial block setting up the test environment. This includes time format configuration, optional Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotation for timing verification under specific technology (like TSMC 18nm), setting initial signal states, and ending the simulation. The design ensures comprehensive testing capability, modeling both functional and timing-focused scenarios for the 'ADDB' module.
