Module-level comment: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for verifying the 'ADDB' module, implementing scan chain testing and functional simulation. It integrates input setups for initializing and controlling scan modes, testing clock-driven operations, and contains an instantiation of the 'ADDB' module. Optional SDF annotations for timing checks and test scenarios are defined, and the module controls are directly manipulated within an initial block to simulate various conditions efficiently.
