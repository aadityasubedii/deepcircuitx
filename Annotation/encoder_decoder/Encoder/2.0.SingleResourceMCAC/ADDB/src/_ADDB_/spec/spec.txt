Module name: ADDB. Module specification: The ADDB module is designed to perform arithmetic operations while managing scan chain inputs and outputs under various test conditions. It operates synchronously with a clock signal and includes a reset function to establish a known initial state. The input ports include a 16-bit data input (DQ), a 15-bit operand (SE), scan chain inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4), a scan mode enable signal (scan_enable), a test mode signal (test_mode), a reset signal (reset), and a clock signal (clk). The module outputs include scan chain signals (scan_out0 to scan_out4) and a 16-bit result (SR) of the arithmetic operations performed on the processed inputs. Internal signals such as DQS and SES are derived from the most significant bits of DQ and SE, respectively, determining the processing logic for the operands, including possible two's complement and sign extension transformations resulting in DQI and SEI. The core arithmetic operations, represented by the addition of DQI and SEI to produce SR, are handled inside the module. The scan chain outputs align with the scan chain inputs unless overridden by other conditions, facilitating diagnostic and testing operations while maintaining regular module functionality.
