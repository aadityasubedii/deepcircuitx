    "module": "Module-level comment: The ADDB module performs arithmetic additions between two operands, DQ and SE, with considerations for sign and complement. It processes inputs based on their most significant bits, utilizing internal signals DQS and SES to possibly adjust values to two's complement or perform sign extension, resulting in DQI and SEI. The module also manages scan chain inputs and outputs for diagnostic modes, synchronized by a clock and optionally reset to a known state. The final output, SR, is the sum of the processed inputs."
