    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module verifies the 'ADDB' module by simulating different DSP configurations. It tests various input conditions using nested loops to iterate through predefined data arrays and external files, checking the processed outputs against expected results. Inputs like 'scan_in', 'DQ', and 'SE' guide the DSP operations, while outputs 'scan_out' and 'SR' reflect the internal state and signal processing results, respectively. The module provides detailed testing and error reporting for effective DSP verification."
