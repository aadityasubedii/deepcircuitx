Module name: test. 
Module specification: The `test` module is designed to facilitate verification of the `ADDB` module's functionality across various digital signal processing configurations by simulating an extensive array of test scenarios. It accepts inputs like `reset` and `clk` for control flow, `scan_in0` through `scan_in4` for scan testing, `scan_enable` for enabling scan mode, `test_mode` specifically for non-standard test operations, and `DQ` and `SE` representing Data Quantization and Signal Estimation respectively. These inputs aid in testing DSP operations in the embedded `ADDB` module. Corresponding outputs are `scan_out0` through `scan_out4`, which help in observing the internal state post-scan operation, and `SR` for viewing the Signal Reconstruction output processed by the `ADDB` module. The module uses internal signals like arrays `rates`, `laws`, `operations`, `types`, `models`, `vectorSizes`, and others to hold various configurations and test data, such as operation rates and test laws. The unique internal setup involves multitudes of nested loops navigating through combinations of models, rates, laws, operations, and types, where conditions and test vectors are read from external files, thereby setting up the DSP processing context. Various conditions are tested and results compared against expected values, with an optional halt on discrepancies to ease debugging. Toward the end, the module prints whether all tests have completed successfully or errors have occurred during execution. This structured approach ensures thorough testing and verification of the DSP functionalities embedded within the `ADDB` module in variegated operation scenarios.
