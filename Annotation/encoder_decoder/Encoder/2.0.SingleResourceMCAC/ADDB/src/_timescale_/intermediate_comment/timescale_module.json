    "module": "Module-level comment: This code configures the simulation time settings for a Verilog environment by using the `timescale directive. It sets both the unit and precision to 1 nanosecond (`timescale 1ns / 1ns), ensuring all timing in simulation processes is consistently interpreted. No module functionality, ports, or internal signals are defined here, as it solely establishes the temporal parameters for simulations."
