Module name: TDMI

Module specification: The TDMI module, short for Time Division Multiplexed Interface, manages serial data input via time-division multiplexing. The input ports include reset, ser_clk, data_in, frame_sync (for frame alignment), scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4 for diagnostics), scan_enable and test_mode (for test configurations), clk and Wishbone bus signals (i_wb_adr, i_wb_sel, i_wb_we, i_wb_dat, i_wb_cyc, i_wb_stb). Output ports are new_data_int (interrupt signal), scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4), and Wishbone bus signals (o_wb_dat, o_wb_ack, o_wb_err). Internal signals such as sys_clk (buffered system clock), serial_clk (inverted clock based on mode), and selected_clk (selected based on test_mode), along with status and data tracking buffers (e.g., ch_count for channel count, data_out_buf for data storage), facilitate the moduleâ€™s operation. The module features two key blocks: a serial input processing section and a Wishbone interface management section. The former handles the sampling of incoming data synchronized to a serial or test clock, organizing data into frames and channels, and setting interrupt conditions. The latter interacts with the Wishbone bus for data transfer, command interpretation (start operations or output data based on addresses), and response generation. This architecture ensures both flexibility in data handling and robustness in system integration.
