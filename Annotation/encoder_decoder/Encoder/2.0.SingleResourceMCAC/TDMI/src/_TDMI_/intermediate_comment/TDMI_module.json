    "module": "Module-level comment: The TDMI (Time Division Multiplexed Interface) module manages serialized data input for system bus communication using time-division multiplexing. It supports synchronous and asynchronous modes with serial and system clocks, enabled by test_mode, handling input via a combination of buffers and state machines. It processes data aligned to frame_sync signals, storing in buffers for output via the Wishbone bus protocol, based on bus commands. It includes an interrupt mechanism and test diagnostics via scan chains, ensuring versatile data handling and system integration."
