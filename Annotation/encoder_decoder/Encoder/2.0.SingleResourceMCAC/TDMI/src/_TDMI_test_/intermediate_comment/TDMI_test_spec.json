    "spec": "Module name: test. \nModule specification: The 'test' module is primarily designed to facilitate testing of the TDMI (a Verilog component) within a simulated environment, focusing on signal processing and bus interaction via Wishbone protocol. This module generates and manipulates various input and output signals to test and verify the functionality of the TDMI component under different scenarios. Input ports include `reset`, `ser_clk`, `frame_sync`, `data_in`, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, `test_mode`, `clk`, `i_wb_adr`, `i_wb_sel`, `i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_we`, `i_wb_cyc`, and `i_wb_stb`, which provide control signals, clock signals, data inputs for both serial and bus communication. Output ports consist of `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_ack`, and `o_wb_err`, which offer diagnostics, data outputs, and transaction status indications. Internal signals like `ser_clk`, `frame_sync`, `data_in`, and others contribute to the internal control and data flow, managing everything from clock signals to input data conditioning. The code is structured in several blocks, including initialization, clock signal generation, data input loop simulation, bus operations, and error checking integrated into tasks that handle specific test sequences and verify data integrity against expected values. This structured approach allows for comprehensive testing of the TDMI component, simulating real-world operating conditions and checking for any operational anomalies or failures.",

This module generates and manipulates various input and output signals to test and verify the functionality of the TDMI component under different scenarios. Input ports include `reset`, `ser_clk`, `frame_sync`, `data_in`, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, `test_mode`, `clk`, `i_wb_adr`, `i_wb_sel`, `i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_we`, `i_wb_cyc`, and `i_wb_stb`, which provide control signals, clock signals, data inputs for both serial and bus communication. Output ports consist of `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, `o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_ack`, and `o_wb_err`, which offer diagnostics, data outputs, and transaction status indications. Internal signals like `ser_clk`, `frame_sync`, `data_in`, and others contribute to the internal control and data flow, managing everything from clock signals to input data conditioning. The code is structured in several blocks, including initialization, clock signal generation, data input loop simulation, bus operations, and error checking integrated into tasks that handle specific test sequences and verify data integrity against expected values. This structured approach allows for comprehensive testing of the TDMI component, simulating real-world operating conditions and checking for any operational anomalies or failures."
