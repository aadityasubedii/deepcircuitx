Module-level comment: The 'test' module orchestrates the functional verification of the TDMI component by simulating operational scenarios using serial and Wishbone bus interface signals. It initializes control and data signals, dynamically generates test vectors, manipulates inputs per specified scenarios, and monitors outputs for errors, ensuring compliance and robustness of the TDMI through detailed simulations mimicking real-world conditions.
