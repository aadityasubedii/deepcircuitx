Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is a testbench crafted for simulating the 'TDMI' module, primarily focusing on its scan chain functionalities in various test modes. It initializes the 'TDMI' module and sets up the scan inputs, scan enable, and test mode signals to default low states. The input ports include `reset`, `clk`, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, and `test_mode`. `reset` is used for initializing the 'TDMI' module, `clk` drives the internal sequential logic, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` serve as inputs for test data to the scan chains, `scan_enable` toggles between normal and test modes, and `test_mode` configures different test scenarios. Output ports are `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, indicating the end states of the scan chains, crucial for monitoring test results. Internally, the signals are used similarly to their roles as inputs/outputs, managing the testbench's internal logic and the interfaced 'TDMI' module. The code structure includes an instance of the 'TDMI' module, initializing of signals with default values, optional SDF annotation under `SDFSCAN` for timing verification, and signal-driven operations managed in an `initial` block, culminating with a `$finish` to terminate the test activity after setup without running a full test sequence.
