Module-level comment: This Verilog snippet does not define a module but sets the simulation `timescale to 1 nanosecond with a precision of 1 picosecond. This configuration is essential for controlling simulation resolution and timing accuracy in Verilog simulations, but it lacks any modular structure or functional implementation details.
