Module name: dumpvcd. Module specification: The `dumpvcd` module is designed for the management of Value Change Dump (VCD) files, crucial for simulating and debugging within an Amber processor environment, assuming the presence of the `AMBER_DUMP_VCD` directive. This module features no input or output ports; it operates solely based on global definitions and signals. The internal signals such as `clk_count`, `xINSTRUCTION_EXECUTE`, `o_write_enable`, and various signals from different units like `U_EXECUTE`, `U_FETCH`, `U_CACHE`, etc., are crucial for capturing and recording the state and behavior of the processor during simulation. The code encompasses various blocks: an initial block that displays the simulation range and sets up the VCD file, along with dumping relevant variables from processor units and registers. Additionally, always blocks respond to clock edges to toggle VCD logging based on the simulation tick count, facilitating dynamic debugging and potentially terminating the simulation based on specific conditions (`AMBER_TERMINATE`). The integration of these elements supports comprehensive testing and debugging throughout different phases of processor simulation.
