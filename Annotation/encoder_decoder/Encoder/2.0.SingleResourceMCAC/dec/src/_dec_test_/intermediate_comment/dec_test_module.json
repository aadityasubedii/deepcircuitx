    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module simulates a testing framework for a 'dec' device, utilizing inputs like clocks, resets, and scan signals to set initial states and test modes. It instantiates the 'dec' submodule, connecting scan inputs and outputs accordingly. The module quickly initializes system parameters, optionally annotates SDF files for timing in test setups, sets initial values, and terminates, highlighting its role in verification rather than continuous operation."
