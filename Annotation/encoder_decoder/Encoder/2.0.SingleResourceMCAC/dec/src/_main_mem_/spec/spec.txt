Module name: main_mem. 
Module specification: The 'main_mem' module is implemented to act as a memory interface that handles memory transactions based on the Wishbone protocol and supports configurable data widths of 32-bit and 128-bit. The input ports include 'clk' (clock signal), 'reset' (system reset), 'scan_enable' (used for scan-based testing), 'test_mode' (enables diagnostic modes), 'i_mem_ctrl' (memory control signals affecting addressing modes), and Wishbone specific signals like 'i_wb_adr' (address bus), 'i_wb_sel' (select signals for partial access), 'i_wb_we' (write enable), 'i_wb_dat' (input data bus), 'i_wb_cyc' (indicates active bus cycle), and 'i_wb_stb' (strobe signal). The output ports are 'o_wb_dat' (output data bus), 'o_wb_ack' (transaction acknowledge), and 'o_wb_err' (error signal indicator). Internally, the module uses signals like 'start_write' and 'start_read' to initiate write and read cycles, 'busy' to indicate ongoing operations, 'masked_wdata' to manage data masking during write operations, and address and data registers. The module includes memory storage implemented as a register array and control logic to handle write and read operations efficiently, governed by parameters that dictate the operational width of the data bus (32 or 128 bits). The operations are segregated into parts managed by generate blocks which conditionally compile the relevant sections for operating either in a 32-bit or 128-bit mode. These blocks control data masking, address calculations, and conditional compilation for data width-specific operations, ensuring correct data handling and response according to the set configuration and input commands. This design encapsulates complex memory interfacing logic to promote modularity and reusability in systems requiring robust memory management through a standard bus interface.
