It includes read and write operations, controlled through various input signals such as address, data, control signals, and byte-select functionality. The module supports two configurations for data widths: 32-bit and 128-bit, determined by a parameter. It handles memory requests by checking the availability (not busy), processes read or write logic including managing write enable signals and masks for partial writes. The read data is returned based on the requested address and data width. The module also utilizes a synchronous reset to initialize internal states and memory content.\n\nFor the decoding and the accurate writing to and fetching from a simulated RAM, the module maps incoming addresses and processes them according to the given control signals, facilitating both normal operation and special test modes. It supports sequential read operations based on the state machine logic encapsulated within the module. This encapsulation of complex memory interfacing logic into the module promotes modularity and reusability in system designs requiring memory management."
