    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'main_mem' module interfaces with a memory system using the Wishbone protocol, supporting 32-bit and 128-bit operations. It handles read and write transactions based on input signals like address, data, and control lines. Internally, it uses signals to initiate and manage memory operations, a register array for storage, and conditional blocks for data path configurations depending on operation width. The module ensures efficient and modular memory management in systems requiring robust data handling capabilities."
