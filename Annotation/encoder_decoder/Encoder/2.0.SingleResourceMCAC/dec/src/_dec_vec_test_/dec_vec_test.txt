Module-level comment: /**
 * Testbench for decoder (DEC) system. Simulates and validates functionality by:
 * - Generating clocks and reset signals
 * - Loading memory and configuring test parameters
 * - Generating input vectors based on various test cases (rates, laws, operations, types)
 * - Capturing and verifying outputs against expected results
 * - Handling UART communication and providing error checking
 * - Logging results and reporting errors
 * Implements comprehensive testing environment for DEC system validation.
