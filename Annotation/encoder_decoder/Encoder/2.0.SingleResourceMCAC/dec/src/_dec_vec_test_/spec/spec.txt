Module name: test. Module specification: This module is a comprehensive testbench for a decoder (DEC) system, designed to simulate and validate its functionality. It includes clock generation, memory loading, configuration of test parameters, input vector generation, and output verification. The module has various input ports (e.g., sysrst, clk, uart_clk, reset, scan inputs) for system control and testing, and output ports (e.g., scan outputs, UART signals, decoder outputs) for observing the system's behavior. Internal signals are used for memory handling, test vector management, and configuration control. The testbench is structured with sections for initialization, memory loading, test vector generation, output capture, and error checking. It simulates various test cases with different rates, laws, operations, and types, and checks the output against expected results. The module also handles reset sequences, UART communication, and provides detailed logging and error reporting.
