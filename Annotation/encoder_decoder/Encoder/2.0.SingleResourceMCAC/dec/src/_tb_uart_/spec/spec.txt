Module name: tb_uart. 

Module specification: The 'tb_uart' Verilog module is purpose-built for simulating or testing a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) interface, focusing on both transmitting and receiving serial data according to UART communication standards. This module utilizes input ports such as 'clk' for the timing of operations, 'reset' to initialize the system state, 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' for various testing configurations, 'i_uart_cts_n' indicating external device readiness to receive data, and 'i_uart_rxd' for input data in serial form. It outputs 'o_uart_txd' to transmit serial data, and 'o_uart_rts_n', signaling readiness to receive data. Internal signals include 'clk_uart' for stable UART operation timing derived from 'clk', receiver related signals like 'rx_state', 'rx_bit', 'rx_byte', which track the current receiving status and assemble received bits into bytes, and transmitter-related signals such as 'tx_state', 'tx_bit', 'tx_byte', handling the data sending. The code is divided into configuration blocks that set clock and baud rate parameters, signal processing blocks that manage data transmission receptions, and blocks controlling the overall data flow and system state transitions, making it a compact, functional unit for UART testing scenarios in a hardware design verification environment.
