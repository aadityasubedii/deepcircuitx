Module-level comment: The 'tb_uart' module simulates UART interfacing, handling serial data transmission and reception. It uses clk-generated timing signals and internal states for synchronization and uses FIFOs for data buffering. Receiver and transmitter states are managed through specific signal process blocks, responding to serial start bits and organizing data into bytes. This module thoroughly tests UART communications by emulating real hardware behaviors in a controlled environment.
