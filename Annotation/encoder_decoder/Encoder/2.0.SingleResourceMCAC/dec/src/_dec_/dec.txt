Module-level comment: /**
 * The 'dec' module is a comprehensive system-on-chip component that integrates data processing, 
 * communication, and control functions. It implements a Wishbone bus architecture to connect 
 * various sub-modules including clock generation, UART, memory controllers, co-processor, 
 * timers, and interrupt handling. The module manages data flow through time-division 
 * multiplexing, provides testing capabilities, and supports multiple clock domains for 
 * efficient operation of different system components.
