Module name: dec. Module specification: The 'dec' module is a complex system-level module that integrates various components for data processing and communication. It features clock generation, UART communication, a Wishbone bus arbiter, memory controllers, and other functionalities. The module has numerous input and output ports, including reset, clock, data inputs/outputs, scan chains for testing, UART interfaces, and Wishbone bus interfaces for main memory and configuration. Internal signals manage clock distribution, Wishbone bus transactions, interrupts, and system status. The module consists of several sub-modules: CLK_GEN for clock generation, wishbone_arbiter for bus management, boot_mem128 for boot memory, APRSC for co-processing, uart for serial communication, TDMI and TDMO for time-division multiplexing input/output, test_module for testing and debugging, timer_module for timing functions, interrupt_
