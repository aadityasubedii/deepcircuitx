It implements a Wishbone bus architecture to connect \n * various sub-modules including clock generation, UART, memory controllers, co-processor, \n * timers, and interrupt handling. The module manages data flow through time-division \n * multiplexing, provides testing capabilities, and supports multiple clock domains for \n * efficient operation of different system components.\n */"
