    "module": "Module-level comment: This Verilog snippet only contains a `timescale directive, setting both time unit and precision for simulations to 1 nanosecond. It does not define a module or its functionalities; thus, no input/output ports or internal signals are present. This directive is exclusively for simulation context to manage how time is interpreted."
