    "spec": "Module name: test.  \nModule specification:  \nThe 'test' module simulates the 'generic_sram_byte_en' block, primarily for scan testing under controlled conditions. The module comprises input ports such as `reset`, `clk` (clock), and `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` which load test patterns into the block. It also has control inputs `scan_enable` (activates scan operations) and `test_mode` (activates test-specific modes). Output ports `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` provide test responses that verify the functionality of the `generic_sram_byte_en` block. Internally, signals like `clk` and `reset` manage timing and initial settings, while `scan_inx` and `scan_outx` handle test data flow. The code outlines various sections including the instantiation of the `generic_sram_byte_en` block and an initial block setting simulation parameters, handling SDF annotations for accurate timing simulation under the condition `SDFSCAN` is defined, and initializing all controls and test inputs to zero. This setup ensures the module's readiness for a systematic scan test, reflected by zeroing out signals and managing test mode environments effectively.",

Enabling this signal allows shifting in test data through the scan inputs and shifting out test responses.\n- `test_mode`: Used to enable the test mode of the `generic_sram_byte_en` block.
