Module-level comment: The 'test' module simulates the 'generic_sram_byte_en' block for scan testing. It initializes inputs and control signals to zero, sets up the clock and reset, and optionally handles SDF annotations for timing analysis under the 'SDFSCAN' conditional flag. The module connects these signals to a 'generic_sram_byte_en' instantiation, enabling systematic testing of scan chains within simulation environments.
