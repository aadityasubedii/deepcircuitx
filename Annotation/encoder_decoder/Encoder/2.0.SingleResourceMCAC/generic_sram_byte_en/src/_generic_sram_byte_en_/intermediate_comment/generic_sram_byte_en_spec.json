Module specification: The `generic_sram_byte_en` module defines a parameterized static RAM (SRAM) capable of byte-wise write operations for selective data updating in memory. It operates based on input data width, address width, and initialization parameters. The module's inputs include a reset signal for initializing memory, a clock signal for pacing operations, and a write-enable signal to enable writing processes. Data to be written is provided through `i_write_data`, while `i_address` determines the memory address for both read and write operations, supported by `i_byte_enable` to specify active byte lanes for writing. Outputs from the module are mainly for read data, `o_read_data`, while other outputs like `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` are potentially for future design for testability (DFT) purposes but remain as placeholders in the current design. Internal signals include a memory array `mem` to store data, and loop variables `i` and `j`, which assist in byte-specific write operations and memory initialization respectively. The code includes blocks for memory initialization upon reset, data retrieval, and executing write operations based on byte enable signals.",

During a reset, the memory can be initialized to zeros or ones, depending on the parameter `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO`.
