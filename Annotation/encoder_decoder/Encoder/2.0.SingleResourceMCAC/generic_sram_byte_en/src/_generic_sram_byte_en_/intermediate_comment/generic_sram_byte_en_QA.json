It is parameterized by data width, address width, and an initialization option. The SRAM allows writing data to specific byte locations controlled by the byte enable input. During a reset, the memory can be initialized to zeros or ones, depending on the parameter `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO`. The SRAM supports regular operation where it reads and optionally updates memory locations based on the write enable and byte enable signals. Specifically, it performs selective byte updating during write operations, allowing flexibility in modifying parts of the data in memory without affecting the entire data width."
