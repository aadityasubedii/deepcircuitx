    "module": "Module-level comment: The `generic_sram_byte_en` module implements a parameterized SRAM with byte-enable functionality, enabling selective data updates. It utilizes internal memory `mem` for storage, coupled with control logic for initialization based on `INITIALIZE_TO_ZERO`. Each clock cycle processes potential write operations to specified addresses, controlled by write and byte enable signals, ensuring efficient and precise data handling."
