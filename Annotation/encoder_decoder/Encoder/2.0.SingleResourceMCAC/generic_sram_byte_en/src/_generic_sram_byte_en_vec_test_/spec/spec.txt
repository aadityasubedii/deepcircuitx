Module name: test.
Module specification: The "test" module is designed to verify the "generic_sram_byte_en" module's functionality by providing various inputs like clock (clk), reset, and scan-related signals, and observing its outputs. The module's inputs include `clk` (the main clock signal), `reset` (resets the system to an initial known state), assorted `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (scan test data inputs during scan testing), `scan_enable` (enables scan test mode), and `test_mode` (alters module behavior for test configurations). Output ports consist of `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, which output the scan test results reflecting the module's functionality under test inputs. Internal signals such as clock and reset signals, as well as the scan input and output signals, are exclusive to their functionalities. The module includes an instantiation (`generic_sram_byte_en top`) of another module with all available inputs wired to corresponding outputs. Furthermore, an initial block sets up the simulation environment, initializes input signals, annotates timing from an SDF file if `SDFSCAN` is defined, and terminates the simulation with `$finish`, illustrating a simple test and verification setup.
