Module-level comment: This code segment specifies the simulation time scale using the `timescale directive in Verilog. It sets the simulation time unit and precision both to 1 picosecond (1ps), which is crucial for simulations that require high temporal precision. This directive does not define a functional module but sets the timing framework for potential modules in a larger simulation environment.
