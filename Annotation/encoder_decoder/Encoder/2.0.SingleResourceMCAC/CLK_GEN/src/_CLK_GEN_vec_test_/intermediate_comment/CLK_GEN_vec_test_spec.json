    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is designed as a testbench for evaluating the 'CLK_GEN' module, geared towards simulating and validating its functionality under various test conditions. Key input ports include 'reset' for initializing to a known state, 'clk' for providing synchronization, 'scan_in0' through 'scan_in4' for scan-based testing inputs, 'scan_enable' for activating scan mode, and 'test_mode' for switching operational modes. Corresponding outputs, 'scan_out0' through 'scan_out4', mirror the scan inputs for observing internal states and testing logic continuity. Internally, the module assigns and manipulates these signals to accurately feed into the 'CLK_GEN' instantiated within. Significant code blocks include the initial start-up section that sets up simulation conditions and initial values, a potential SDF (Standard Delay Format) annotation block determined by compilation conditional `SDFSCAN` for detailed timing simulations in test environments, and the primary instantiation of 'CLK_GEN' linking the established inputs and outputs. This setup facilitates a controlled test environment to extensively check and debug the 'CLK_GEN' module's design and response under simulated conditions.",

It is essential for the synchronized operation of sequential elements like flip-flops inside the 'CLK_GEN'.\n- **reset**: This signal is used to initialize or reset the internal logic states of the 'CLK_GEN' module to a known state, ensuring the module starts operating from a clean, predictable state during simulations or after power-up.\n- **scan_in0, scan_in1, scan_in2, scan_in3, scan_in4**: These signals are inputs used for scan testing, which helps in loading test data into the module's internal flip-flops directly. These inputs are particularly useful for manufacturing tests and debugging to ensure internal states can be controlled and observed directly.\n- **scan_enable**: This control signal activates the scan test mode in the 'CLK_GEN'. When enabled, it allows the test data to be shifted in through the scan_in ports and observed at the scan_out ports, facilitating detailed testing of the internal flip-flop connections and logic.\n- **test_mode**: This signal toggles the operating mode of 'CLK_GEN' between normal operation and test operation.
