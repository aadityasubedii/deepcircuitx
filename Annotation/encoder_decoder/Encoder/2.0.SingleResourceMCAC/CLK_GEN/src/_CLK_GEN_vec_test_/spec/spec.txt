Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is designed as a testbench for evaluating the 'CLK_GEN' module, geared towards simulating and validating its functionality under various test conditions. Key input ports include 'reset' for initializing to a known state, 'clk' for providing synchronization, 'scan_in0' through 'scan_in4' for scan-based testing inputs, 'scan_enable' for activating scan mode, and 'test_mode' for switching operational modes. Corresponding outputs, 'scan_out0' through 'scan_out4', mirror the scan inputs for observing internal states and testing logic continuity. Internally, the module assigns and manipulates these signals to accurately feed into the 'CLK_GEN' instantiated within. Significant code blocks include the initial start-up section that sets up simulation conditions and initial values, a potential SDF (Standard Delay Format) annotation block determined by compilation conditional `SDFSCAN` for detailed timing simulations in test environments, and the primary instantiation of 'CLK_GEN' linking the established inputs and outputs. This setup facilitates a controlled test environment to extensively check and debug the 'CLK_GEN' module's design and response under simulated conditions.
