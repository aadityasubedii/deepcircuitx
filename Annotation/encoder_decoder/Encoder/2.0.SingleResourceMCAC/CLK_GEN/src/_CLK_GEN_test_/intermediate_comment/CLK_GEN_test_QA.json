This involves checking various clock signals, namely the system clock, co-processor clock, and serial clock against their expected periods to ensure they are operating correctly. The module also tests the functionality of frame synchronization signals across different channels and conditions using a defined propogation delay (PROPDLY) to model real-time signal processing delays. The test involves generating and checking test scenarios, using various initial conditions, stimulus inputs, and timing checks, reported via displays that indicate the commencement, proceeding, and completion of each test phase, helping to validate the correct behavior of the synthesized system under specified conditions. Additionally, the module contains provisions to halt simulations and output errors if the clocks or synchronization signals do not meet expected parameters during testing."
