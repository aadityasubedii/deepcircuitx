    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"test\" module simulates and verifies the functionality of clock and synchronization signals in integrated circuits. It initializes with inputs like reset and clock, performs clock synchronization using internal counters, and checks output consistency against expected values. The module uses scan inputs for diagnostics and controls test operations based on mode settings. It dynamically validates various clocks and frame synch signals, ensuring system integrity, and detailed feedback is provided for test progression and error conditions."
