    "spec": "Module name: CLK_GEN. Module specification: The CLK_GEN module is designed to generate multiple clock and synchronization signals for various operational needs. It takes a primary 'clk' input and some control signals including 'reset', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', 'test_mode', and 'i_frame_syn'. The outputs of the module are multiple clock signals: 'o_sys_clk', 'o_serial_clk', 'o_co_proc_clk', and a frame synchronization signal 'o_frame_syn', along with 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' for testing and diagnostics. Internally, the module utilizes several significant signals such as 'mux_serial_clk' and 'mux_co_proc_clk' which decide the source of serial and co-processor clock signals based on the 'test_mode'. Counters like 'co_count' and 'ser_count' help in deriving the co-processor and serial clocks ('co_proc_clk' and 'ser_clk') respectively. The module comprises of buffers like 'CLKBUFX4' for outputting stable signals and sequential logic blocks to manage counters and state transitions based on different inputs such as 'reset'. Each section is dedicated to handling specific parts of the module operation, like clock generation controlled by timing counters, and frame synchronization driven by edge conditions and timing signals. Overall, the CLK_GEN module is pivotal for creating and managing clocks and synchronization required to ensure smooth operation and testing of digital systems.",

It takes a primary clock input and some control signals such as reset, scan inputs, and test mode flag. The module uses these inputs to generate four types of output clocks: system clock (o_sys_clk) replicated from the original clock (clk), a serial clock (o_serial_clk) derived from clk but can be manipulated through counters and test mode, a co-processor clock (o_co_proc_clk) similarly controlled, and a frame synchronization signal (o_frame_syn) based on the input frame sync signal and counting system favorable for serial data transmission environments. The clocks can be directly taken from the input clock or derived based on counters, which can be reset or toggled according to conditions defined in the code. There's also handling for various test modes to either use the primary clock directly or the conditioned signals."

It takes a primary 'clk' input and some control signals including 'reset', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', 'test_mode', and 'i_frame_syn'. The outputs of the module are multiple clock signals: 'o_sys_clk', 'o_serial_clk', 'o_co_proc_clk', and a frame synchronization signal 'o_frame_syn', along with 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' for testing and diagnostics. Internally, the module utilizes several significant signals such as 'mux_serial_clk' and 'mux_co_proc_clk' which decide the source of serial and co-processor clock signals based on the 'test_mode'. Counters like 'co_count' and 'ser_count' help in deriving the co-processor and serial clocks ('co_proc_clk' and 'ser_clk') respectively. The module comprises of buffers like 'CLKBUFX4' for outputting stable signals and sequential logic blocks to manage counters and state transitions based on different inputs such as 'reset'. Each section is dedicated to handling specific parts of the module operation, like clock generation controlled by timing counters, and frame synchronization driven by edge conditions and timing signals. Overall, the CLK_GEN module is pivotal for creating and managing clocks and synchronization required to ensure smooth operation and testing of digital systems."
