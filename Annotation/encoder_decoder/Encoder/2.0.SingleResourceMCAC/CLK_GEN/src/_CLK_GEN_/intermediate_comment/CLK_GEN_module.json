    "module": "Module-level comment: The CLK_GEN module produces various clocks and synchronization signals for digital systems. It uses inputs like 'clk' and control signals to generate outputs using counters, multiplexers, and state machines. Several internal signals control clock modifications and output behaviors. Operations vary based on 'test_mode' and reset conditions, ensuring functionality across normal and testing scenarios."
