Module name: test. 

Module specification: The 'test' module is designed to facilitate scan testing of the 'LIMC' component within a Verilog environment, focusing on setting up a test environment with specific controls for scan and test modes. It includes input ports such as 'reset' for initializing systems, 'clk' for synchronizing operations, 'scan_in[0:4]' for inputting test vectors across multiple scan chains, 'scan_enable' for activating the scan process, and 'test_mode' for switching between normal and test operational modes. The output ports 'scan_out[0:4]' are used to output the results from the scan tests, reflecting the state of the circuit under test. The internal signals mirror these inputs and outputs, syncing the entire module's operation and feeding into the 'LIMC' component. The Verilog code encompasses an 'initial' block that primarily sets all these signals to default low states and optionally includes a Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotation for delay constraints, determined by the `SDFSCAN` directive. This block sets the simulation's time format and finishes the execution after initializing conditions, thus preparing the module for a rigorous scan testing process.
