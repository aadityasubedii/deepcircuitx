    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module sets up a scan testing environment for the 'LIMC' component, initializing control signals for scan and test operations. It configures input and output ports for scan chains, controlled via an 'initial' block that sets default states and optionally includes SDF annotations based on the `SDFSCAN` condition, coordinating the test settings and ensuring structured execution compatible with scan methodologies."
