Module name: LIMC. Module specification: The LIMC module functions as a conditioning unit to ensure that the input A2T is kept within specified upper and lower limits before it is output as A2P. The module accepts various inputs, including a reset signal and a clock signal (clk) which are standard for initializing and timing operations, respectively. It also includes multiple scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4) and a scan_enable input used during scan testing or debugging, as well as a test_mode input to toggle between normal and test operations. The main input, A2T, is a 16-bit signal that represents the value to be conditioned. The outputs of the module include scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) for observing states during testing, and a single 16-bit output, A2P, which is the conditioned version of A2T. Internally, the module utilizes two 16-bit registers, A2UL and A2LL, set to constant values of 16'h3000 and 16'hD000 respectively, representing the upper and special lower limits for A2T. The operational logic within the module checks if A2T exceeds A2UL or falls below A2LL (and above 16â€™h8000), adjusting A2P accordingly, or passing A2T through unchanged if within limits. This functional block ensures that output A2P adheres to the defined thresholds, stabilizing the input condition as specified.
