Module-level comment: The LIMC module limits the 16-bit input A2T to ensure it remains within predefined bounds before outputting as A2P. It uses internal registers, A2UL (upper limit set to 0x3000) and A2LL (special lower limit set to 0xD000), to compare against A2T. If A2T exceeds A2UL or falls below A2LL but is above 0x8000, it gets clamped to these limits, otherwise, it passes unchanged. This module integrates scanning and testing capabilities with respective inputs and outputs to facilitate debugging and testing processes.
