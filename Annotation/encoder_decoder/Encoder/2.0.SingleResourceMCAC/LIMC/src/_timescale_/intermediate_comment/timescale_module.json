    "module": "Module-level comment: The provided Verilog snippet solely contains a `timescale directive set at 1ns/1ns, meaning it defines the simulation time unit and precision, both set to 1 nanosecond. This directive is essential in simulations for ensuring that timing behavior is modeled and interpreted accurately. However, there is no actual Verilog module defined in the snippet, hence no specific functionality, implementation details, or internal structure to comment on."
