Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is specifically designed for thorough testing and simulation of the 'LIMC' module across different parameter configurations and scenarios. The module tests with varied 'rates', 'laws', 'operations', 'types', and 'models' related to encoding and decoding. Input ports include 'clk' (clock), 'reset', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' (scan chain inputs), 'scan_enable', 'test_mode' (controls test-specific operations), and 'A2T[15:0]' (16-bit encoded data input for simulation). Output ports include 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' (deliver results of scan chain evaluations) and 'A2P[15:0]' (processed data output to verify module operations). The module uses internal arrays and signals like 'rates', 'laws', 'operations', 'types', 'models', 'A2Ts', 'A2Ps', and control variables such as 'rate', 'law', 'operation', 'type', 'model', 'j', 'loop' to handle different configurations and maintain simulation sequences. The code details a systematic simulation setup in the initial block setting up test parameters, arrays, followed by dual nested loops structured to cover a comprehensive combination of scenarios. The simulation leverages `readmemh` to load test vectors and design configurations, with checks and display statements to identify discrepancies during various simulation states. The test architecture encapsulated in this module provides a robust framework aimed precisely at validating the 'LIMC' module's performance under a myriad of simulated operational conditions.
