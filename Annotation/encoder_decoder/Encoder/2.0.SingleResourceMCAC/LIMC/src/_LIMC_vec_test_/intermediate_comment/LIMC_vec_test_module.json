    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module conducts comprehensive testing for the 'LIMC' module by simulating various encoding and decoding configurations through tunable parameters such as rates, laws, operations, types, and models. It employs nested loops, configurable scenarios via memory-loaded vectors, and extensive output checking to ensure the performance and correctness of the 'LIMC' module across diverse operational conditions. This setup provides a thorough validation framework using detailed condition checks and feedback on failure points, through predefined test vectors and expected results."
