It uses arrays to store multiple test scenarios and systematically applies these scenarios through nested loops. The module functionally tests for correct behavior based on expected results (using 'A2T' and 'A2P') against actual outcomes with parameters adjusted for different operational, legal, rate, and type conditions. The purpose of detailed display functions and conditions checks (`$display` and `if` statements) is to identify errors and differences accurately, indicating a robust testing framework aimed at verifying the 'LIMC' module's functionality and performance across a range of scenarios."
