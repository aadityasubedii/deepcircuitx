Module-level comment: The 'test' module is a testbench for verifying the 'LIMD' component by simulating various operational conditions using predefined test vectors. It utilizes input and output ports for controlling and monitoring operations, such as scan chains and data processing. Internally, the module initializes specific scenarios through arrays storing configuration data, manages clock signals for timing, and iteratively checks outputs against expected values, logging results and errors, to ensure the LIMD component behaves as specified across different configurations.
