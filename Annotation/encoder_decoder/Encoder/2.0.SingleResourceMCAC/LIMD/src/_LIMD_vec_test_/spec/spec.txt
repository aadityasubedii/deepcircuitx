Module name: test. Module Specification: The 'test' module acts as a testbench for the 'LIMD' component, simulating various operational conditions to verify its functionality. It includes input ports such as `reset`, `clk`, and `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` for providing a reset signal, clock, and scan-chain inputs, alongside `scan_enable`, `test_mode`, `A1T`, and `A2P` for enabling scan operations, setting test modes, and input data. Output ports like `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` and `A1P` output the results from scan operations and processed data. Internally, the module defines arrays like `rates`, `laws`, `operations`, `types`, and `models` that configure test scenarios, and uses indices like `rate`, `law`, etc., to loop through these configurations. Important operations include initial setups for constants, clock signal toggling, and extensive nested loops for reading test vectors from files, applying them as inputs, and checking the outputs against expected values. These operations allow comprehensive testing of the 'LIMD' component across various settings and conditions, documented thoroughly using display functions for errors and test completions during simulation.
