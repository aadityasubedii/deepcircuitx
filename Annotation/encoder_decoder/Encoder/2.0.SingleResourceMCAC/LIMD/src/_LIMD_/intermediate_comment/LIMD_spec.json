    "spec": "Module name: LIMD. Module specification: The LIMD module is designed to adjust the value of the input signal A1T based on dynamically calculated upper and lower limits derived from another input A2P and internal constants. The module operates synchronized to a clock input (`clk`) and can be reset (`reset`). It supports diagnostics and testing features through multiple scan input (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`) and output (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`) ports, coupled with scan enable (`scan_enable`) and test mode (`test_mode`) controls. The primary inputs are `A1T` and `A2P`, both 16 bits wide, used to determine the adjusted output `A1P`, also 16 bits. Internally, the constant `OME` (15360) aids in computing the upper limit (`A1UL`) and lower limit (`A1LL`) for `A1T`, where `A1UL` is calculated as `OME + 65536 - A2P`, and `A1LL` as `A2P + 65536 - OME`. The adjustment logic checks if `A1T` falls between `32768` and `A1LL` or between `A1UL` and `32767`, setting `A1P` to `A1LL` or `A1UL` respectively; otherwise, `A1P` directly mimics `A1T`. This conditional logic ensures `A1P` outputs values within specific controlled boundaries, making the module suitable for applications needing dynamic threshold management or signal conditioning based on input variations and predefined constraints.",

It assesses where A1T falls within calculated upper (A1UL) and lower limits (A1LL) and adjusts its output (A1P) accordingly. If A1T falls between a specific range defined by the constant 32768 and A1LL, A1P is set to A1LL. If it falls between another range defined by A1UL and the constant 32767, A1P takes the value of A1UL. Otherwise, A1P will mimic the value of A1T directly. This can be useful in systems requiring dynamic threshold adjustments based on monitored values or presets, potentially in test or measurement systems where input values are conditioned and recalibrated for system use or further processing."
