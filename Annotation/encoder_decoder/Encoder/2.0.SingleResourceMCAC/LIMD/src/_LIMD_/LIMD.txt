Module-level comment: The LIMD module dynamically adjusts the output A1P based on the input A1T, considering upper (A1UL) and lower (A1LL) limits derived from A2P and a constant (OME). It uses conditional logic to set A1P within controlled limits, ensuring it aligns with thresholds based on A2P, facilitating robust signal conditioning and threshold management in varying input scenarios. Supports diagnostic features through scan inputs and outputs, controlled via clock and reset signals.
