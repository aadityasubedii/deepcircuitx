Module name: LIMD. Module specification: The LIMD module is designed to adjust the value of the input signal A1T based on dynamically calculated upper and lower limits derived from another input A2P and internal constants. The module operates synchronized to a clock input (`clk`) and can be reset (`reset`). It supports diagnostics and testing features through multiple scan input (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`) and output (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`) ports, coupled with scan enable (`scan_enable`) and test mode (`test_mode`) controls. The primary inputs are `A1T` and `A2P`, both 16 bits wide, used to determine the adjusted output `A1P`, also 16 bits. Internally, the constant `OME` (15360) aids in computing the upper limit (`A1UL`) and lower limit (`A1LL`) for `A1T`, where `A1UL` is calculated as `OME + 65536 - A2P`, and `A1LL` as `A2P + 65536 - OME`. The adjustment logic checks if `A1T` falls between `32768` and `A1LL` or between `A1UL` and `32767`, setting `A1P` to `A1LL` or `A1UL` respectively; otherwise, `A1P` directly mimics `A1T`. This conditional logic ensures `A1P` outputs values within specific controlled boundaries, making the module suitable for applications needing dynamic threshold management or signal conditioning based on input variations and predefined constraints.
