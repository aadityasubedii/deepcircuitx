    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module acts as a testbench for the 'LIMD' module, providing a range of inputs like clock, reset, scan controls, and test modes to assess its functionality. It initializes all inputs, configures time formatting for simulation, optionally annotates with delay data via SDF, and ends with simulation completion. This setup rigorously verifies 'LIMD' under designated test conditions."
