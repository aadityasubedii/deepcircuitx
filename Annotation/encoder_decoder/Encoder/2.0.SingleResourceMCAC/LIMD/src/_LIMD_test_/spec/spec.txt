Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module serves as a testbench primarily designed to evaluate the 'LIMD' digital module under various test conditions. It incorporates several input ports including `clk` (clock signal to drive synchronous operations), `reset` (signals to initialize or reset the 'LIMD' module's internal state), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (scan inputs for internal circuit testing), `scan_enable` (activates scan mode), and `test_mode` (switches the 'LIMD' module between normal and test operations). The output ports `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` provide feedback on the internal state or the behavior of the 'LIMD' module under test conditions. These inputs and outputs are directly connected to the instantiated 'LIMD' module within this testbench. Internal signals mirror the inputs and outputs, acting as conduits between the testbench environment and the 'LIMD' module. The Verilog code distinctly includes an initial block that sets up the simulation environment by configuring time format, optionally annotating delay information through SDF files based on a compilation directive (`SDFSCAN`), initializing all inputs to zero, and terminating the simulation with the `$finish` task. This structured approach ensures that the 'LIMD' module can be rigorously tested and validated within controlled conditions, enhancing reliability and performance verification.
