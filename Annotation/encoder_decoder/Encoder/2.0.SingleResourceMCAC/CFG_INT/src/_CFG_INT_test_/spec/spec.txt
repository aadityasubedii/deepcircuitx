Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is designed to validate the operational integrity of Encoder and Decoder modules interfacing through a Wishbone bus by simulating different testing scenarios. It uses inputs like 'clk' for clock signals, 'reset' for initializing the module to a known state, scan inputs 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' and 'scan_enable' for diagnostic purposes, and 'test_mode' to select operational modes. The module outputs 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' for observing internal states post-scanning, and 'r_data' to output data fetched during read operations. Internally, the module uses control signals like 'cs' (chip select), 'ws' (write strobe), 'rs' (read strobe), and data buses 'w_data' and 'r_data' for managing data flow. It also contains specific Wishbone protocol signals for both encoder ('i_wb_*_e') and decoder ('i_wb_*_d') for managing read/write operations and acknowledges. The primary code blocks include initialization of states, continuous testing loops for read and write operations, tasks for managing Wishbone operations ‘wb_read_strobe_*’ and ‘wb_write_strobe_*’, and signal toggles adhering to clock cycles, all aimed at thorough testing of the encoder and decoder functionality under simulated conditions. This module is critical for ensuring the system's reliability before deployment in real-world applications.
