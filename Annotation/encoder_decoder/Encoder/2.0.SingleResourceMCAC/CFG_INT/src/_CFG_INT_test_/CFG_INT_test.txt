Module-level comment: The 'test' module evaluates Encoder and Decoder operations via a Wishbone interface, performing read/write tests controlled by clocked input signals and scanning functionalities. It integrates extensive simulation tasks for data integrity checks and employs tasks ‘wb_read_strobe_*’ and ‘wb_write_strobe_*’ to manage Wishbone transactions, ensuring comprehensive validation of the interconnected hardware before deployment.
