It includes simulated input scans, @random driven test data generation for addresses and data, and read-write operations. The module toggles data and checks the integrity of the outputs against expected results using tasks and loop constructs to continuously monitor and validate read/write operations on the Wishbone bus for Encoder and Decoder sections separately. Error conditions are flagged and can halt the test process depending on the configuration (`ERRORSTOP`). The module makes extensive use of tasks to encapsulate Wishbone operations which interface with hypothetical Encoder and Decoder submodules. Overall, the 'test' module acts as a comprehensive checking mechanism to ensure that Encoder and Decoder modules interface correctly with the system bus and respond appropriately under simulated operational conditions."

Explanation: Used to provide the timing signal for the synchronous operations within the module, particularly for triggering state transitions and clocking register changes.\n- reset: Reset signal input. Explanation: Used for initiating the reset state condition, ensuring the module starts in a known state for starting or restarting operations.\n- scan_in0, scan_in1, scan_in2, scan_in3, scan_in4: Scan data inputs. Explanation: These are used for scanning operations, potentially for test and diagnostics purposes to emulate or debug internal states.\n- scan_enable: Scan enable input. Explanation: Controls whether the scanning inputs are active; enabling the scan function to inject or monitor internal signals.\n- test_mode: Test mode select input.
