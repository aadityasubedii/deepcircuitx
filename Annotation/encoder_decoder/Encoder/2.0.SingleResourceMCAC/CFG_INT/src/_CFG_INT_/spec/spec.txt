Module name: CFG_INT. Module specification: The CFG_INT module is a Verilog-based hardware design that primarily serves to manage the configuration and status monitoring of two distinct functional cores, likely an encoder and a decoder, within a device. It features bidirectional interaction with a system bus adhering to the Wishbone protocol, supported by a set of input and output ports. Input ports include `reset`, `clk`, and a suite of scanning and control signals (`scan_in0` through `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, `test_mode`, amongst others), as well as signals like `w_data` and `addrs` for data handling through the Wishbone interface. Output ports such as `scan_out0` through `scan_out4` and `r_data` provide scan outcomes and read data respectively, while signals like `o_wb_dat_e`, `o_wb_ack_e` denote data and acknowledgments in the Wishbone context.

Internally, the CFG_INT module maintains configuration status and readiness indicators (`encoder_configured`, `decoder_configured`, `enc_ready_for_data`, `dec_ready_for_data`) and channel-specific data (`enc_ch`, `dec_ch`) for each core. Buffer registers (`buffer_1` to `buffer_4`) are utilized for intermediate data staging during bus interactions. Control flags (`start_read_e`, `start_read_d`) and clocks (`read_clk`, `write_clk`) derived conditionally from the operation mode regulate read and write sequences. Additionally, acknowledgment handling within the module is facilitated by a layered signal architecture (`wb_ack1_e`, `wb_ack2_e`, etc.).

The code is organized into blocks handling different aspects like read and write operations, acknowledgement processing, and reset conditions, each sensitive to specific conditions (e.g., edge of a clock or a reset signal). These blocks ensure responsive synchronization with the bus protocol and internal state updates based on external control inputs and operations executed in normal or test modes, aligning with the module's purpose to effectively manage core configurations and readiness for data processing.
