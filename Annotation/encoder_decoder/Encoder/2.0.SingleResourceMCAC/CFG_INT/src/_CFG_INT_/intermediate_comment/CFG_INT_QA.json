It uses separate data and control pathways for encoder and decoder for operations such as configuration verification, data readiness signaling, and perhaps initialization or reset functionalities.\n\nThe module interacts with a system bus using the Wishbone protocol, evident from signals prefixed with 'i_wb_' and 'o_wb_', signifying data flow into and out from the CFG_INT module. The module processes read and write operations from the bus, adjusts internal states accordingly, and responds back with acknowledgments or data based on the request type.\n\nThis module utilizes input scan signals and also configures internal registers based on external write cycles.
