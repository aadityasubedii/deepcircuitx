    "module": "Module-level comment: The CFG_INT module configures and monitors the status of encoder and decoder cores via the Wishbone bus interface. It handles bus communication, configuration data, and operational readiness, using internal registers, buffers, and flags. The code modulates read and write operations based on external signals, controlling data flow and integrating test and reset conditions to ensure robust, synchronized module performance."
