Module-level comment: The "test" module is designed for scan-based testing of the CFG_INT submodule, initializing inputs like clock, reset, and scan signals to low, and setting up the test environment. It features input ports for signals including clock, reset, scan inputs, scan enable, and test mode, and output ports for scan outputs. The implementation includes an initial block setting all inputs low and ending the simulation, with optional SDF file annotation for delay accuracy in test scenarios.
