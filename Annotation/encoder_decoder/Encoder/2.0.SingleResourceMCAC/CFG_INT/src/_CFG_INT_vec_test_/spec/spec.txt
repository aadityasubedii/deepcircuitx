Module name: test. 
Module specification: The "test" module is designed primarily for conducting scan-based tests on the CFG_INT submodule within a digital circuit design. It initializes test conditions for scan-based testing and observes output responses to verify the submodule behavior. The module has the following inputs: clk (clock signal for synchronization), reset (signal to initialize the submodule to a known state), scan_in0 to scan_in4 (scan input signals to shift test patterns into the submodule), scan_enable (signal to toggle the test mode), and test_mode (signal to specify the type of test running). The outputs are scan_out0 to scan_out4, which are used to shift out responses from the submodule's flip-flops for analysis. Internal signals mirror these inputs and outputs, directly interfacing with the CFG_INT submodule. Within the code, there's an initial block setting all input signals to low and ending the simulation to set up initial conditions for the test. Additionally, system tasks like $timeformat and $sdf_annotate (conditional on SDFSCAN being defined) are used to format simulation time display and annotate delay information, respectively, from an SDF file to the module, ensuring testing accuracy related to timing and delays.
