    "module": "Module-level comment: This Verilog snippet includes only a `timescale directive (1ns / 1ns) which is employed to define both the simulation's time unit and the precision as 1 nanosecond. It lacks any module, ports, or internal signals, serving solely to set simulation parameters for timing accuracy and does not embody any functional or structural elements of a typical Verilog module."
