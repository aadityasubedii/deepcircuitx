    "spec": "Module name: test. \nModule specification: The 'test' module simulates the initialization and testing of the UPA1 component, focusing on configuration and behavioral simulations under various conditions. It includes input ports like 'clk' (clock), 'reset' (to initialize module state), 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' (for inputting scan data), 'scan_enable' (controlling scan operations), and 'test_mode' (switching between normal and test operational modes). The output ports 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' facilitate exporting scan data after internal processing. Internal signals mirror the input and output ports' functionality and are essential in driving and capturing the state and outputs of the UPA1 during testing. The Verilog code includes an instantiation of the UPA1 module linking these ports and signals appropriately. A crucial initial block sets simulation timing, optionally annotates SDF for scan testing (if compiled with `SDFSCAN`), initializes all control and data signals to zero, and ends the simulation. This structured setup ensures comprehensive initial behavior testing and scan functionality testing of the UPA1 module under simulated conditions.",
