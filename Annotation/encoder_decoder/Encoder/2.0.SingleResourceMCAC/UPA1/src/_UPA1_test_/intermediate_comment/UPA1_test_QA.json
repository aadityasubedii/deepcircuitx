Scan techniques are often employed for testing and debugging integrated circuits by shifting data into the chip, performing operations, and then shifting data out.\n- scan_enable: This signal controls whether the scan functionality is enabled on the UPA1 module. When active, scan data can be shifted through the device.\n- test_mode: This input determines whether the UPA1 module operates in a normal mode or in a test mode which may alter its behavior for various testing scenarios.\n\nOutput ports:\n- scan_out0\n- scan_out1\n- scan_out2\n- scan_out3\n- scan_out4\n\nExplanation:\n- scan_out0 to scan_out4: These outputs are used to export scan data from the UPA1 module after it has been processed internally. This enables external systems or subsequent stages in a test environment to analyze the data, verifying the internal state and functionality of the UPA1 module during or after a scan operation.\n\nThese ports play crucial roles in setting up the UPA1 module for initial testing, providing capabilities for scan testing and being able to check the module behavior under controlled test inputs."
