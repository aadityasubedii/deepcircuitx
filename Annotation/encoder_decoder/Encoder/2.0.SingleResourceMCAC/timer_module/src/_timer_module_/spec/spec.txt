Module name: timer_module.

Module specification: The 'timer_module' is crafted to control three distinct timers within a hardware system, interfacing via a Wishbone bus protocol. It features various input ports such as 'clk' for synchronization, 'reset' for initializing registers, 'scan_inX' (X: 0-4) for test inputs, 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' for test configurations, and Wishbone-related signals ('i_wb_adr', 'i_wb_sel', 'i_wb_we', 'i_wb_dat', 'i_wb_cyc', 'i_wb_stb') for bus communication. Output ports include 'scan_outX' (X: 0-4) for test outputs, 'o_wb_dat' for sending data back to the processor, 'o_wb_ack' for transfer acknowledgments, 'o_wb_err' for error signaling, and 'o_timer_int' for timer event interrupts. Internal signals such as 'wb_start_write', 'wb_start_read', 'wb_start_read_d1', 'wb_wdata32', and 'wb_rdata32' facilitate the operations of write and read on the Wishbone bus, data handling, and synchronization. The code is organized into several blocks, including input handling, timer control logic distinguishing write/read operations, data transfer handling as per the bus width (either 128 bits or 32 bits), and debug blocks for evaluation during development. Timer functionalities such as loading values, starting, stopping, and auto-reloading are managed through specific registers addressed through the Wishbone bus and controlled via the module's logic tailored to interface effectively with SoC environments.
