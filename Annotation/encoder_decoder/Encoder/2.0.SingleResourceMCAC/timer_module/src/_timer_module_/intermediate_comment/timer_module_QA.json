Each timer can be loaded with a specific count value and controlled via specific control settings, including auto-reloading and prescaling options, according to the loaded count. The module tracks the decrement of each timer's value, issuing interrupts when they reach zero. The timers' control, load, and current value can be read and written through specified bus addresses. The module also handles data widths dynamically, supporting both 32-bit and 128-bit bus widths. This flexibility allows for efficient handling of different data sizes and address mappings in broader system integrations, like SoC (System on Chip) environments. Additionally, debug statements are integrated to provide useful output during simulation to trace and verify operations and data transactions on the bus."

All operations inside the module are triggered on the rising edge of the clk.\n- **reset**: Active-high reset signal that initializes all registers and control logic to a predefined state, effectively resetting the module's operation.\n- **scan_in0** to **scan_in4**: Scan chain inputs used in test modes for boundary scan or other test procedures to check and verify the function of the module in a larger system.\n- **scan_enable**: Enables the scan test mode allowing the scan inputs to be used.\n- **test_mode**: A signal to enable specific test modes of operation, possibly altering normal behavior for testing purposes.\n- **i_wb_adr**: Wishbone bus address input used to address the specific register(s) or function within the module.\n- **i_wb_sel**: Wishbone write data select signals, which determines the byte enable signals during bus data transfers.\n- **i_wb_we**: Wishbone write enable signal that controls whether a given Wishbone cycle is a read or write operation.\n- **i_wb_dat**: Wishbone data bus for input data being written into the device.\n- **i_wb_cyc**: Wishbone cycle signal indicating that a valid Wishbone transfer is in progress.\n- **i_wb_stb**: Wishbone strobe signal that indicates a valid data transfer cycle along with the i_wb_cyc signal.\n\n**Output Ports**: scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4, o_wb_dat, o_wb_ack, o_wb_err, o_timer_int.\n**Explanation**:\n- **scan_out0** to **scan_out4**: Scan chain outputs contiguous to the inputs that propagate test data out of the module for test verification.\n- **o_wb_dat**: Output data bus for the Wishbone protocol which sends data back to the processor or controlling entity from the module.\n- **o_wb_ack**: Wishbone acknowledge signal, which indicates the completion of a successful data transfer.\n- **o_wb_err**: Signals an error in the Wishbone transfer, typically used for indicating issues such as access to invalid addresses or other fault conditions.\n- **o_timer_int**: Timer interrupt outputs as a 3-bit vector where each bit corresponds to an interrupt signal for each of the three timers, signaling events like timers reaching a value of zero when configured to do so."

It is derived by logically ANDing the Wishbone strobe (`i_wb_stb`), the Wishbone write enable (`i_wb_we`), and the inverse of `wb_start_read_d1`. This ensures that a write operation is initiated only when the bus is strobed for write and no read operation was initiated just prior.\n- **wb_start_read**: This signal determines the start of a read operation. It is set when the Wishbone strobe (`i_wb_stb`) is active, the write enable (`i_wb_we`) is inactive, and no acknowledgment (`o_wb_ack`) has been made yet. It helps in controlling read operations distinctly from write operations.\n- **wb_start_read_d1**: A delayed version of the `wb_start_read` signal, achieved by registering the signal with each clock pulse or upon reset. This delay is crucial as it is used to control the synchronization and ordering of operations, especially to interlock consecutive read operations and avoid collision with ongoing write cycles.\n- **wb_wdata32**: This signal represents the 32-bit data word extracted from the corresponding bits of the 128-bit or 32-bit Wishbone data input (`i_wb_dat`) based on the byte address signaled by `i_wb_adr[3:2]`. It dynamically adapts to the configurations of the bus width and is crucial for handling data correctly according to the specified address.\n- **wb_rdata32**: This internal signal holds data to be passed on the output Wishbone data bus (`o_wb_dat`). It gathers the appropriate data from the respective timer registers depending on the address accessed and the operation invoked. This register is key for providing the read data back to the requesting master on the Wishbone bus, complying with the read transactions initiated by `wb_start_read`."
