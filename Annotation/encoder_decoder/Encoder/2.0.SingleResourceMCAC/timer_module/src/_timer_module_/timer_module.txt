Module-level comment: The 'timer_module' administers three independent timers in a hardware system interfaced via Wishbone bus. It supports dynamic configuration for 32 or 128-bit data widths and handles timer operations such as load, control, and auto-reloading through register-based communication and dedicated control logic. Timer events trigger interrupts managed through internal signal and bus transaction handling, ensuring efficient operation within SoC environments.
