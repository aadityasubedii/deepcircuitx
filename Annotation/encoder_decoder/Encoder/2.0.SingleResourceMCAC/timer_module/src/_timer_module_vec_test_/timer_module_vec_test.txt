Module-level comment: The 'test' module is a testbench designed for the simulation and verification of the 'timer_module'. It configures input signals like clock, reset, and various scan inputs, and observes output through scan outputs. Primarily, it initializes conditions and controls simulation through an initial block that configures signals and can annotate SDF files for scan testing, before terminating the simulation with `$finish`. This setup helps to systematically test and validate the embedded timer module under a variety of conditions.
