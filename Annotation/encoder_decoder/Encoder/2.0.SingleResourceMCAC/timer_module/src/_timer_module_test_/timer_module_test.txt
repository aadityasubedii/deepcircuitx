Module-level comment: The 'test' module simulates and tests the 'timer_module' using input controls and scan chains. It initializes with default signal values, employs conditional SDF annotation for timing accuracy during scans, and provides output via `scan_out` ports to verify internal state shifts. Execution ceases with `$finish` after setup, ensuring precise environment emulation for testing module behavior under various conditions.
