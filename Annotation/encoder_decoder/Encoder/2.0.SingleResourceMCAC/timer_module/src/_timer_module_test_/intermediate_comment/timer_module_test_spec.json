    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is designed primarily for simulation and testing of a 'timer_module', focusing on its functionality in various test modes. It incorporates input ports including `clk` (clock signal), `reset` (system reset), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (scan chain inputs for testing), `scan_enable` (activates scan mode), and `test_mode` (enables specific test operations). The output ports consist of `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, which serve as the scan chain outputs to verify the internal state and functionality by observing the test data after it has been shifted through the module. Internal signals such as the registers for `clk`, `reset`, and the `scan_in` series replicate the functionality of controlling timing, resetting the module, and feeding test vectors respectively. The module contains a main subcomponent, `timer_module`, connected according to these inputs and outputs. An `initial` block initiates with setting simulation conditions such as time format and applying a Standard Delay Format (SDF) file for timing back-annotation under conditional compilation, followed by initializing all control signals to zero and an instruction to terminate the simulation with `$finish`. This setup is crucial for verifying the timing and operational correctness of the 'timer_module' in a controlled test environment.",

When high, it allows the shifting in of test data via scan inputs.\n- `test_mode`: This input is used to enable a specific test mode in the module, allowing it to operate differently for testing purposes.\n\nOutput ports: scan_out0, scan_out1, scan_out2, scan_out3, scan_out4.\nExplanation: \n- `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`: These outputs are the scan chain outputs corresponding to each scan input.

They represent serial data inputs that can be shifted through internal flip-flops when in test mode.\n- `scan_enable`: When activated, this signal permits the system to switch into scan mode, allowing data to be shifted in via the `scan_in` signals and observed at the `scan_out` outputs.\n- `test_mode`: This input dictates whether the module should operate in a normal mode or a test mode. In test mode, different behaviors might be exhibited to fulfill certain test conditions or to make internal states more accessible.\n- `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`: These are the outputs from the scan chains, serving as the endpoints for the test data shifted in through `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`.
