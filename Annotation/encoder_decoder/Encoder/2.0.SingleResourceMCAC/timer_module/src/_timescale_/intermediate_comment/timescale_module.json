    "module": "Module-level comment: This Verilog snippet specifies a simulation timescale using the directive \"`timescale 1ns / 1ns`\". It sets both the time unit and time precision for simulations at 1 nanosecond. The code does not define a module or include hardware logic, hence it solely serves to configure simulation settings in a Verilog environment without implementing any specific functionality or internal operations."
