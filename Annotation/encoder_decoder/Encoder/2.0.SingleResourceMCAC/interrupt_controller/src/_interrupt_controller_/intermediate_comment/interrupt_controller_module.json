    "module": "Module-level comment: The `interrupt_controller` module manages and prioritizes hardware interrupts in systems, interfaced via a Wishbone bus. It supports interrupt handling from sources like UART and timers, using internal registers and masking logic to enable, disable, and process IRQ and FIRQ interrupts. It also features configurable bus width handling, scan chain testing, and extensive debugging capabilities for efficient system monitoring and troubleshooting."
