It handles different types of interrupts including regular interrupts (IRQ) and fast interrupts (FIRQ). The module is equipped to process interrupts from various sources like UART, timer modules, and external interrupt requests. It features functionality to enable, disable, set, and clear these interrupts, as well as to read their status and other related information. The controller operates based on input conditions and system registers, accommodating different data bus widths as specified by the parameter `WB_DWIDTH`. An extensive debbugging capability is also included, allowing for detailed monitoring and troubleshooting as specified in the AMBER_IC_DEBUG block."
