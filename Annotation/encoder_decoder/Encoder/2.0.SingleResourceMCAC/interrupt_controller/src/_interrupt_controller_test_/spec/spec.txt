Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is designed for setting up and simulating the 'interrupt_controller' within a test environment. It primarily functions to instantiate the 'interrupt_controller' and configure its connections via input and output ports. The input ports include `clk` (the clock signal to synchronize module operations), `reset` (resets the module state), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (scan inputs for shifting data into the module's internal state during testing), `scan_enable` (enables scan mode), and `test_mode` (puts the module into a special operational state for testing). The corresponding output ports, `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, allow external observation of the internal states for verification. The module uses internal signals such as registers for the inputs (`clk`, `reset`, `scan_in` ports, `scan_enable`, and `test_mode`) and wires for the outputs (`scan_out` ports) aligned with their designated input counterparts. The module includes a crucial initial block that sets initial conditions for all input signals and ends with a `$finish` call for terminating the simulation. This block is augmented with a Standard Delay Format (SDF) annotation in a conditional compile block (`ifdef SDFSCAN`), indicating that the module can be used with timing simulations, especially pertinent during specific test conditions in a design verification setup.
