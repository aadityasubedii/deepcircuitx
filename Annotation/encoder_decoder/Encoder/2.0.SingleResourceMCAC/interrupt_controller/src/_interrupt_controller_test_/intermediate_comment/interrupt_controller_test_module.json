    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module orchestrates the setup and testing of the 'interrupt_controller'. It initializes the 'interrupt_controller' by connecting input control signals (like `clk`, `reset`, `scan_in`s) and monitoring through `scan_out`s. The module toggles these input signals in the initial block to simulate various states, ending with a `$finish` to conclude the simulation. It optionally incorporates timing simulation through SDF annotations for detailed verification."
