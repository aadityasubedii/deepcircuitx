    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module serves as a test bench for the 'interrupt_controller', providing stimuli for simulation. It utilizes input signals (clk, reset, scan signals, scan_enable, test_mode), which are defined as reg types, and output signals as wires connected to the 'interrupt_controller'. The initial block sets these signals, optionally annotates SDF for timing simulation, and concludes testing with `$finish`. It comprehensively tests functionality and operational integrity of the 'interrupt_controller'."
