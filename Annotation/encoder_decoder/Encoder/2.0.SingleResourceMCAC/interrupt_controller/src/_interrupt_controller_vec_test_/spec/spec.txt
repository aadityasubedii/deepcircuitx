Module name: test. 
Module specification: The 'test' module in Verilog serves as a test bench purposed for simulating an 'interrupt_controller' module. This setup includes initializing various signal lines and simulating different states of the interrupt controller to ensure its functionality. The input ports include 'clk' (clock signal for synchronization), 'reset' (resets the controller), 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' (scan inputs for test data), 'scan_enable' (enables scan operation), and 'test_mode' (activates test or diagnostic modes). The corresponding output ports 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' are in place for capturing the scan outputs post processing within the 'interrupt_controller'. Internally, the module utilizes reg type signals for inputs and manipulates these through direct assignment within an initial block, which sets states and drives the test scenario. The setup process involves optional annotation of timing information through SDF files contingent on a compile-time flag 'SDFSCAN', useful for detailed timing simulations. The module concludes with setting initial conditions and employing `$finish` to end the simulation, encapsulating a typical test bench flow aimed at verifying the operations and reliability of an interrupt controlling mechanism under various test conditions.
