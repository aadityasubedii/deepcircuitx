    "spec": "Module name: FLOATB. Module specification: The FLOATB module is designed to convert a 16-bit binary integer (SR) into an 11-bit floating-point-like packed format (SR0) within a test or scan environment. It splits SR into a sign bit (SRS) and magnitude (MAG), calculates an exponent (EXP) corresponding to the highest non-zero bit position in MAG, and determines a mantissa (MANT) by right-shifting MAG by EXP. The module's inputs include a reset, clock (clk), five scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4), a scan enable, and a test mode signal, which govern its operations and testing mode. It outputs five scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) and the floating-point output SR0. Internally, SRS is extracted directly from SR, MAG is computed accordingly as either SR or its two's complement based on SRS, EXP is determined through a priority encoder implemented in an always block, and MANT is calculated by shifting MAG. The structure of the code divides logically into signal assignment, magnitude calculation, exponent determination via a case statement, mantissa computation, and output assembly which packs SRS, EXP, and MANT into SR0. This module serves in environments requiring both normal float-like operations and design for testability facilitated through scan chains.",

This is used to determine whether the number represented by `SR` is positive or negative.\n- **MAG**: This represents the \"Magnitude\" and is derived from the input `SR` based on the SRS.
