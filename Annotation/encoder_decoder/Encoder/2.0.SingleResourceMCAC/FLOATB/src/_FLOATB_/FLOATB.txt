Module-level comment: The FLOATB module converts a 16-bit integer (SR) to an 11-bit floating-point-like format (SR0). It extracts the sign (SRS), computes magnitude (MAG) based on SRS, determines the exponent (EXP) from the high-order bit position in MAG, and shifts MAG to form the mantissa (MANT). The result (SR0) combines SRS, EXP, and MANT, suitable for test environments with scan chain inputs and outputs.
