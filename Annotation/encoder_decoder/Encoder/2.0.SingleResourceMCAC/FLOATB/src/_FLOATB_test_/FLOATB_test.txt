Module-level comment: The "test" module facilitates scan testing, primarily focusing on scan chain operations within a test environment. It features input ports (clk, reset, scan_in0-4, scan_enable, test_mode) and corresponding outputs (scan_out0-4), all interfaced with an internal FLOATB submodule for scanning logic. Initialization sets all inputs low, optionally utilizes SDF annotations for timing accuracy, and concludes with simulation termination. The module is robustly structured for clear, systematic testing operations.
