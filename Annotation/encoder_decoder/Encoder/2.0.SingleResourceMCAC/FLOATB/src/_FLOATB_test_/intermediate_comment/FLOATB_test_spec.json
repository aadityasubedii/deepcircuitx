    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The \"test\" module is specifically designed for simulation testing, targeting scan testing within a test environment. The module uses input ports such as clk (clock), reset, scan_in0 to scan_in4, scan_enable, and test_mode; each of these plays a crucial role in scan testing. The clk helps synchronize operations, reset initializes the system, scan_in0 to scan_in4 serve as data inputs for the scan chain represented by the connected FLOATB submodule, scan_enable turns the scan mode on or off, and test_mode switches the module between normal or test operational modes. The corresponding output ports, scan_out0 to scan_out4, represent the test results obtained from the scan operations. Internally, all these signals are connected to the FLOATB submodule, which likely handles the detailed logic for scanning operations. The code also includes an `initial` block that mainly sets the initial state of input signals, incorporates optional SDF (Standard Delay Format) annotations for simulation accuracy under the `SDFSCAN` compile-time conditional, and concludes by finishing the simulation. These elements together encapsulate the setup and basic operational testing paradigm of the module.",

It is fundamental in timing the latching of input data lines in synchronous designs such as this scan test setup.\n- reset: The reset input is used to initialize or reset the system to a known state, usually at the beginning of simulation or when errors need to be cleared.\n- scan_in0 to scan_in4: These are scan input ports meant to feed test data into the FLOATB submodule. They are crucial for manipulating individual flip-flops in the scan chain during scan testing.\n- scan_enable: This input is used to enable or disable the scan operation mode in the FLOATB submodule. When high, it allows the submodule to enter scan mode to facilitate testing.\n- test_mode: This input determines whether the module operates in normal or test mode.
