Module-level comment: The 'test' module is designed to validate the 'FLOATB' module by simulating various test conditions using input control and data signals, including scan-in and test mode selectors. It employs internal data arrays for parameters and test vectors, and a structured iterative process (nested loops) that applies these vectors to the FLOATB module, checks the outputs against expected results, and logs discrepancies, ensuring comprehensive coverage of operational scenarios and robust module verification.
