Module-level comment: The provided Verilog snippet only contains a `timescale directive with settings of 1ns/1ns, crucial for defining time interpretation during simulations. It lacks any functional modules, inputs, outputs, or internal signal definitions. This directive exclusively manages simulation time precision and does not pertain to any specific hardware functionality or logic design.
