    "module": "Module-level comment: The `test_module` interfaces with the Wishbone bus protocol for testing and diagnostics, supporting parameterized data widths. It employs input signals for initiating bus transactions and outputs for scanning, interrupts, and control signals. Internally, it utilizes timers, counters, and registers to manage operations like UART communication, memory control, and test statuses. Blocks within the code respond to clock and reset events, updating based on wishbone transactions and test conditions."
