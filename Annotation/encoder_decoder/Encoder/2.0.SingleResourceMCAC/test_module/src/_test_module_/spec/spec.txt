Module name: test_module.

Module specification:
The `test_module`, parameterized by Wishbone data and selection width, manages interfacing and testing functionalities using the Wishbone bus protocol. Its primary inputs include a `clk` (clock signal), `reset` (reset signal), various `scan_inX` and `scan_enable` for scan testing, and Wishbone specific signals (`i_wb_adr`, `i_wb_sel`, `i_wb_we`, `i_wb_dat`, `i_wb_cyc`, `i_wb_stb`) to execute data transactions. Outputs consist of scan outcomes (`scan_outX`), interrupts (`o_irq`, `o_firq`), memory control (`o_mem_ctrl`), Wishbone response data (`o_wb_dat`, `o_wb_ack`), an error flag (`o_wb_err`), LED control signals (`o_led`), and a physical reset control (`o_phy_rst_n`). Internally, the module employs several registers and counters for managing interrupts (`firq_timer`, `irq_timer`), generating pseudo-random numbers (`random_num`), UART communications (`tb_uart_control_reg`, `tb_uart_status_reg`, `tb_uart_push`, `tb_uart_txd_reg`), test status (`test_status_reg`, `test_status_set`), memory control (`mem_ctrl_reg`), and others (`cycles_reg`, `wb_start_write`, `wb_start_read`, `wb_rdata32`, `wb_wdata32`, `led_reg`, `phy_rst_reg`). The code includes conditional compiling blocks for varied data widths (128-bit or 32-bit), managing data reading and writing operations through specified address mappings (`AMBER_TEST_*` constants from included header files), and concurrent processes triggered by clock and reset signals to update internal states and outputs accordingly, enhancing test diagnostics and system interfacing capabilities.
