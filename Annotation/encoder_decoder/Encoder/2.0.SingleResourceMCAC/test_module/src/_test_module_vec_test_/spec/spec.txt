Module name: test.  
Module specification: The 'test' module is designed to facilitate scan-based testing for an integrated circuit by interfacing with a 'test_module'. It utilizes input ports such as 'clk' (clock signal for synchronization), 'reset' (to initialize or reset states), 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' (scan inputs for test data), 'scan_enable' (to enable scan mode), and 'test_mode' (to toggle between normal and test operation modes). The output ports include 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4', which output the results from the scan tests. Internal signals correspond with the inputs and outputs, ensuring control and data flow within the 'test' module. The code comprises an instance of 'test_module', which is parameterized with these inputs and outputs. An initial block is used to set up simulation parameters, possibly including an SDF file for timing data (conditional on `SDFSCAN` definition), and to initialize all inputs and control flags before finishing the simulation. This setup is crucial for conducting precise and effective testing of the 'test_module' under controlled scan conditions.
