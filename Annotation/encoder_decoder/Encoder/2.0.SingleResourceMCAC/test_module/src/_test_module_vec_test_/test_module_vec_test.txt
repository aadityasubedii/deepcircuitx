Module-level comment: The 'test' module facilitates scan-based testing of an integrated circuit by interfacing with 'test_module'. It handles inputs like clock, reset, scan data, and mode control, connecting them to 'test_module'. Outputs reflect scan results. Includes simulation setup with optional SDF annotation and initial conditions for exhaustive testing.
