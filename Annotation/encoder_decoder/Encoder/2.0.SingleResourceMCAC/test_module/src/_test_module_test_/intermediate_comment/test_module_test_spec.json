    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: The 'test' module serves as a testbench designed to validate the functionality of the 'test_module'. It is equipped with an array of input ports - **clk** (clock) which coordinates the timing within the 'test_module', **reset** which initializes the module, **scan_in0** to **scan_in4** which provide scan test inputs, **scan_enable** which triggers the scan mode, and **test_mode** which adjusts the module's operation for test scenarios. Correspondingly, it has output ports **scan_out0** to **scan_out4** that output the scan results after data traversal through 'test_module'. Internally, these input and output ports along with two additional regs, **clk** and **reset**, are declared, where the input ports provide necessary signals to examined module, and output ports display scan results reflecting internal state changes. The testbench encapsulates an instantiation of 'test_module', linking its inputs and outputs directly to those defined in the 'test' module. Further, the code defines an `initial` block that sets initial conditions, including clocking and signal resets, and might conditionally annotate a Standard Delay Format (SDF) file for timing simulation when SDFSCAN is defined. This conditional compilation help in verifying the timing aspect of the module under test scenarios. The block concludes with a `$finish` command, indicating the end of this test simulation. This holistic setup primarily aims at basic initialization and debugging rather than comprehensive testing.",
