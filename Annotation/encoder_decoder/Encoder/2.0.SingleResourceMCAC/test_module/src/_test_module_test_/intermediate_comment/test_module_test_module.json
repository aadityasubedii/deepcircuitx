    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for the 'test_module,' facilitating the verification of its functionality through various input signals like clk (clock), reset, scan inputs, and modes. It configures initial states, performs conditional SDF file annotation for timing accuracy, and instantiates 'test_module' with corresponding inputs and outputs wired directly. This setup predominantly addresses basic initializations and preliminary checks."
