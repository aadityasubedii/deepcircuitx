    "module": "Module-level comment: The `test` module simulates and validates the functionality of the TRIGB module under various configurations. Utilizing input and output ports for test signals and internal control mechanisms, it iterates through predefined configurations stored in arrays, applying test vectors and analyzing outputs against expected results. This approach ensures a comprehensive coverage and validation of TRIGB's operational integrity across multiple scenarios."
