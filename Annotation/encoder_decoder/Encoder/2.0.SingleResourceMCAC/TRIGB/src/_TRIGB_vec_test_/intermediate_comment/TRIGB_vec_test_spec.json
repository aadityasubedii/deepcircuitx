Input ports include `clk` (clock signal), `reset` (asynchronous reset), multiple `scan_in` and `scan_out` for scan-based configurations, `scan_enable` to activate scanning, `test_mode` to toggle between normal and test operations, and `TR` and `AnP` for feeding test vectors. The output port `AnR` captures the response from the TRIGB for analysis. Internal signals such as arrays (`rates`, `laws`, etc.) store different test configurations, and integer/index variables (`rate`, `law`, etc.) control the simulation flow and select these configurations. Test vectors are managed by arrays like `TRs`, `AnPs`, `AnRs`, etc., which are essential for applying and validating test conditions. The code is organized into blocks for initializing test conditions and values, a main testing loop iterating through model configurations and applying vectors, and control mechanisms for checking outputs against expected results with provisions for verbose and error-stop conditions. This thorough setup enables detailed testing of TRIGB under simulated conditions reflecting various operational scenarios.",

Input ports include `clk` (clock signal), `reset` (asynchronous reset), multiple `scan_in` and `scan_out` for scan-based configurations, `scan_enable` to activate scanning, `test_mode` to toggle between normal and test operations, and `TR` and `AnP` for feeding test vectors. The output port `AnR` captures the response from the TRIGB for analysis. Internal signals such as arrays (`rates`, `laws`, etc.) store different test configurations, and integer/index variables (`rate`, `law`, etc.) control the simulation flow and select these configurations. Test vectors are managed by arrays like `TRs`, `AnPs`, `AnRs`, etc., which are essential for applying and validating test conditions. The code is organized into blocks for initializing test conditions and values, a main testing loop iterating through model configurations and applying vectors, and control mechanisms for checking outputs against expected results with provisions for verbose and error-stop conditions. This thorough setup enables detailed testing of TRIGB under simulated conditions reflecting various operational scenarios."
