Module name: Not available.  
Module specification: The provided Verilog snippet does not define a Verilog module but only includes the `timescale 1ns / 1ns` directive. This directive specifies that the unit of measurement for time in the simulation is nanoseconds (ns), and the precision of the simulation time is also set to nanoseconds. This setting is crucial for accurate simulation behaviors, especially when dealing with delay and timing analysis, but it does not inherently describe any functionalities, input/output ports, internal signals, or structural blocks of a Verilog module. Consequently, without additional code that defines a module, its functionality, and structural components, no comprehensive specification can be provided. The code snippet given is purely for simulation environment setup and does not encompass any design or operational details typically associated with Verilog modules.
