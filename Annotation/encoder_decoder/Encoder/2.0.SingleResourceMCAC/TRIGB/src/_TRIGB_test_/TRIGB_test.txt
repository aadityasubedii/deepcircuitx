Module-level comment: The "test" module simulates a test environment for the TRIGB sub-module, monitoring its responses under various test conditions. It manages input signals like clock, reset, and test data, and captures outputs through scan chains. Clock signal toggling is achieved using an `always` block, while initial setups and test control are handled in an `initial` block. This setup ensures thorough validation of the TRIGB functionalities within defined test scenarios.
