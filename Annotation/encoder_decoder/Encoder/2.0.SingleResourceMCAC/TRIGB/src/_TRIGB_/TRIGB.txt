Module-level comment: The TRIGB module conditionally transfers a 16-bit input (AnP) to an output register (AnR) based on the trigger (TR). If TR is low, AnR equals AnP; if TR is high, AnR is cleared to 0. This is implemented in an always block, handling synchronization or conditional data processing based on TRâ€™s status.
