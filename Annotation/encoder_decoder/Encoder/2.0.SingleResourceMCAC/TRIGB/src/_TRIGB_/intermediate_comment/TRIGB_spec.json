    "spec": "Module name: TRIGB. Module specification: The TRIGB module is designed to conditionally transfer a 16-bit input signal (AnP) to a 16-bit output register (AnR) based on the state of a trigger input (TR). The operation is dictated such that if TR is low (0), AnR is set to the value of AnP; if TR is high, AnR is cleared to 0. This functionality provides controlled data transfer typically used for synchronization or conditional processing in digital systems. The inputs to the module include reset and clk (clock) signals for managing the timing and initialization, scan_in0 to scan_in4 for scanning or testing, scan_enable and test_mode to determine operational modes, and TR for controlling the data transfer. The outputs consist of scan_out0 to scan_out4 which might be used for diagnostics or testing outputs, and AnR, the 16-bit output register that holds the transferred or cleared data. AnR also acts as an internal signal and is the key register holding the output data dependent on TR's condition. Within the Verilog code, the primary blocks include the definition of input and output ports, the internal register declaration for AnR, and the always block that defines the conditions for data transfer to AnR based on the state of TR. This structure effectively encapsulates the module\u2019s operational logic and data handling mechanism.",

If TR is low (0), AnR is directly assigned to AnP, meaning it retains the incoming data. If TR is high, AnR is reset to 0, effectively clearing the data.
