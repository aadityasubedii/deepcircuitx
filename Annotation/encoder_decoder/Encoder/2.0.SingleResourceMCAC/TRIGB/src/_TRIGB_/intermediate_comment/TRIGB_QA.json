Specifically, if TR is low (0), AnR is set to the value of AnP. If TR is high, AnR is cleared to 0. This operation allows for controlled data transfer based on the trigger condition, commonly used in digital systems for synchronization or conditional processing."

Its role in the module is critical for holding the output value, depending on the logic derived from the trigger input TR. If TR is low (0), AnR is directly assigned to AnP, meaning it retains the incoming data. If TR is high, AnR is reset to 0, effectively clearing the data.
