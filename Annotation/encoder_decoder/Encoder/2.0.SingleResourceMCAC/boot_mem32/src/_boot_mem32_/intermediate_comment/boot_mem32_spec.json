    "spec": "Module name: boot_mem32. \nModule specification: The `boot_mem32` module is designed to interact with a Wishbone bus for handling memory operations aimed at boot-time usage in FPGA platforms. It integrates with the bus to support read and write functionalities based on the Wishbone signals. The input ports include `i_wb_clk` (clock signal), `i_wb_adr` (address bus), `i_wb_sel` (byte select), `i_wb_we` (write enable), `i_wb_dat` (data bus for writes), `i_wb_cyc`, and `i_wb_stb` (strobe signal). The output ports consist of `o_wb_dat` (data output for reads), `o_wb_ack` (acknowledge signal), and `o_wb_err` (error signal). Internal signals include `start_write` and `start_read` for initiating write and read operations, `start_read_r` for managing read acknowledgments across cycles, `jitter_r` used in debugging to introduce jitter, `read_data` and `write_data` which are the data buses for reading and writing operations, `byte_enable` for byte-specific operations, and `address` which is derived from `i_wb_adr`. The code is structured into blocks handling conditional compilation for debug features, memory interface instantiation based on whether a Xilinx FPGA is used, and signal assignments for operational control. Conditional directives (`ifdef`, `endif`) enable specific configurations and debugging aids, such as jitter insertion in acknowledgment signals. The module also contains instantiations of memory blocks which vary depending on FPGA type, with parameters and file inclusions managed conditionally for different deployment scenarios.",

The output ports consist of `o_wb_dat` (data output for reads), `o_wb_ack` (acknowledge signal), and `o_wb_err` (error signal). Internal signals include `start_write` and `start_read` for initiating write and read operations, `start_read_r` for managing read acknowledgments across cycles, `jitter_r` used in debugging to introduce jitter, `read_data` and `write_data` which are the data buses for reading and writing operations, `byte_enable` for byte-specific operations, and `address` which is derived from `i_wb_adr`. The code is structured into blocks handling conditional compilation for debug features, memory interface instantiation based on whether a Xilinx FPGA is used, and signal assignments for operational control. Conditional directives (`ifdef`, `endif`) enable specific configurations and debugging aids, such as jitter insertion in acknowledgment signals. The module also contains instantiations of memory blocks which vary depending on FPGA type, with parameters and file inclusions managed conditionally for different deployment scenarios."
