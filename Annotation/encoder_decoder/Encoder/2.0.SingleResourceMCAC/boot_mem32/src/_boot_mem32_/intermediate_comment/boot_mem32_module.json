    "module": "Module-level comment: The `boot_mem32` module interfaces with a Wishbone bus for handling boot-time memory reads and writes in FPGA environments. It uses input signals like clock, address, and data buses to manage memory operations through control signals such as `start_write` and `start_read`, which are designed with optional debugging features. The module supports conditional compilation for different FPGA platforms, enabling tailored behavior and memory interfacing. Internal blocks handle signal mapping, bus cycle acknowledgment, and instantiate memory components specific to the FPGA type."
