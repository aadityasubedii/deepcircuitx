Module-level comment: The "test" module is designed to simulate test scenarios for the "boot_mem32" sub-module, focusing on scan-chain testing. It initializes all inputs and outputs, sets up clock and reset signals, and configures optional timing simulation via SDF annotations. The setup includes defining the behavior of the module under reset and test modes, ensuring comprehensive test coverage during post-layout simulation.
