    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The \"test\" module is primarily designed for simulation testing of the \"boot_mem32\" sub-module, focusing on scan-chain testing environments. It includes input ports such as 'reset', 'clk' (clock), 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' (scan chain inputs), 'scan_enable' (enables scan test mode), and 'test_mode' (puts the module into a test mode). The output ports are 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4', which represent outputs from the internal scan chains of the 'boot_mem32' sub-module. Internal signals mirror these ports and are used to drive the sequential logic and manage states within the module. The module's Verilog code encompasses an initial block that sets the simulation environment, providing initial states for signals and potentially incorporating an SDF annotation for timing verification. This setup helps in evaluating the 'boot_mem32' sub-module's behavior under reset and various test conditions. The entire setup ensures that each component is initialized correctly and is ready for a comprehensive testing phase, simulating both functionality and timing aspects post-layout.",

It includes setup for a typical scan-chain test environment by defining multiple scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4), a scan_enable signal, a test_mode signal, and corresponding scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4). The module initializes the system with all inputs at a low state and toggles the clock. It is configured to simulate the behavior under reset conditions and potentially under scan or test conditions, though these latter functionalities are predetermined to be inactive by the initialization values. Additionally, it includes optional SDF (Standard Delay Format) annotation for timing simulation which suggests its use in a post-layout simulation environment to check timing and functionality."
