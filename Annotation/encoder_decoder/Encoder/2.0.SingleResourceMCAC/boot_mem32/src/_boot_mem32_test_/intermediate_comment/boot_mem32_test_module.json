    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"test\" module is a testbench for the \"boot_mem32\" module, primarily evaluating scan chain features. It initializes and manipulates inputs including clock, reset, scan chains, and modes to model test conditions. Outputs reflect the internal data shifts during the tests. It uses $timeformat and optional $sdf_annotate for timing analysis, and prepares all signals initially at low, concluding with $finish to end simulations effectively."
