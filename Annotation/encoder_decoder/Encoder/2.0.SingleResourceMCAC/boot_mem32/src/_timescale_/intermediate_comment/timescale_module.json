    "module": "Module-level comment: This Verilog snippet only includes a timescale directive \"`timescale 1ns / 1ns`\", which specifies the simulation's time unit and precision but does not define or implement any functional Verilog module. Thus, there are no module functionalities, input/output ports, or internal signals present, as it solely serves to configure the timing resolution for simulation environments."
