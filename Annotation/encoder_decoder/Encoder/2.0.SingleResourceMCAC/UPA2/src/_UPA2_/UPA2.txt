Module-level comment: The UPA2 module processes 16-bit inputs A1 and A2 using control inputs PK0, PK1, and PK2 to compute output A2T. It uses internal signals for conditional logic and arithmetic computations; for instance, XOR operations determine intermediate values which influence subsequent arithmetic, adjusting the output based on a combination of inputs and internal states. The module incorporates an always block for handling signed input adjustments and assign statements for calculating the final output, enabling dynamic signal transformations determined by the operational context.
