    "spec": "Module name: UPA2. \nModule specification: \nThe UPA2 is a digital computation module primarily designed for processing and transforming 16-bit input signals, A1 and A2, based on various control inputs including PK0, PK1, and PK2. The module operates synchronized by the 'clk' signal and includes capabilities for reset and testing through the 'reset' and 'test_mode' inputs, and scan operations enabled by 'scan_enable' with scan inputs and outputs ('scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4'). The module also features an output, A2T, which is a computed 16-bit value integrating all inputs after executing complex logical and arithmetic operations.\n\nWithin the module, internal signals like PKS1 and PKS2 perform preliminary conditional logic based on input flags to influence subsequent computations. Signals like UGA2A, FA, and UGA2B are used in Intermediate arithmetic calculations to process the primary data signals (A1 and A2), with other signals such as UGA2S, A2S, and 'a' further refining these computations based on criteria such as sign bits or module-specific flags like SIGPK. The core logic of the module is encapsulated within several 'assign' statements and a single 'always' block. These sections handle the necessary data transformations and conditional assignments to compute the final output A2T by incorporating all internal adjustments and input dependencies. \n\nOverall, the UPA2 module emphasizes versatile signal processing capabilities, enabling dynamic response to control inputs and stringent internal computational logic to derive a specific output essential for broader system functions where signal integrity and manipulation are crucial.",
