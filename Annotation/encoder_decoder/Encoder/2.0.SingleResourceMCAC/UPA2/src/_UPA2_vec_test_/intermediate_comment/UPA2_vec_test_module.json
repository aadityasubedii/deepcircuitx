    "module": "Module-level comment: The `test` module rigorously tests the `UPA2` module by simulating various operational scenarios defined by combinations of rates, laws, operations, types, and models. It utilizes input and output scan ports for testing and debug, and vector arrays for input conditions and expected outputs. Nested initialization and looping constructs dynamically adjust testing parameters, load vector data, and verify `UPA2` processing outputs against expected results, efficiently identifying discrepancies and ensuring module reliability."
