Module name: test.
Module specification: The `test` module is intricately designed to facilitate comprehensive testing of the `UPA2` module across varied operational conditions defined by combinations of rate, law, operation, type, and model parameters. Input ports include `reset`, `clk`, and multiple scan inputs (`scan_in0` to `scan_in4`) for debug and verification, along with `scan_enable`, `test_mode`, and specific test data inputs (`PK0`, `PK1`, `PK2`, `A1`, `A2`, `SIGPK`). The outputs are primarily scan outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`) and a verification output `A2T`, which visualizes the module's processing output. Internal signals like arrays `rates`, `laws`, `operations`, `types`, `models`, and corresponding indices manage iterative test conditions. Data sets for each test are stored in arrays such as `PK0s`, `PK1s`, `PK2s`, `A1s`, `A2s`, `SIGPKs`, and expected outputs `A2Ts`, which are compared against the output `A2T` to validate accuracy. The module is segmented into initialization blocks setting up test parameters and arrays while the primary functionality unfolds within nested loops dynamically altering test conditions and streaming test vectors through the `UPA2` modules to validate operational correctness under specified configurations. The process concludes with a clean termination sequence announcing the completeness of the testing regimen.
