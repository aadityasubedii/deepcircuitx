Module-level comment: This Verilog snippet includes only a `timescale directive set at 1ns / 1ns, specifying the simulation time unit and precision both at 1 nanosecond. It doesn’t define a functional module or contain elements like input/output ports or internal signals. It's purely for simulation time settings, ensuring consistent time interpretation across the simulation without implementing any specific hardware functionality.
