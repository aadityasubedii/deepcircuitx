    "spec": "Module name: test. \nModule specification: The 'test' module is designed primarily for simulation and testing of the 'UPA2' sub-module within a controlled environment to verify the scan chain and test mode functionality. It comprises input ports including 'clk' (clock signal for timing), 'reset' (to initialize or reset the UPA2 module), 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' (scan inputs for the scan chain), 'scan_enable' (to control scan mode activation), and 'test_mode' (for enabling test operations), along with output ports 'scan_out0\u2019 to 'scan_out4' corresponding to the scan inputs, representing the processed results. Internal signals correspond to the input and output ports and control the operations within the UPA2 module. The Verilog code includes a declaration of the internal and I/O signals, an instantiation of the UPA2 sub-module that connects these signals, and an initial block that sets up the simulation environment. This initial block handles the timing format, optional SDF (Standard Delay Format) annotation for timing simulations if 'SDFSCAN' is defined, initializing all signals to default values, and concludes with a simulation end command.",
