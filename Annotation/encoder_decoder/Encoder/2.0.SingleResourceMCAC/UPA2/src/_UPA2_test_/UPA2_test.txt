Module-level comment: The 'test' module simulates the 'UPA2' design for testing its scan chain and test mode functionalities. It incorporates 'clk', 'reset', scan inputs 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode' for control operations, linked to corresponding outputs 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4'. The module initializes these signals and optionally annotates SDF for timing verification, controlling simulation process and states directly in the initial block.
