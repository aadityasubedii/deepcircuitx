Module specification: The 'test' module is primarily designed to demonstrate the impact of varying configurations using preprocessor directives without actual data transmission through input or output ports. It contains no input or output ports, aligning with its self-contained functionality which focuses on displaying different parameter values under varying preprocessor conditions. The module does not utilize any internal signals such as wires or registers, but instead uses macro definitions (`define, `undef) and external file inclusion (`include \"global_defines.vh\") to modify and display the values of parameters `A and `B. The code includes three distinct blocks in its initial begin-end block: first, `ENC is defined to load and display the values corresponding to encoding, followed by `DEC for decoding, and finally with both undefined, demonstrating the default or undefined state. Each state change is accompanied by a display statement (`$display) showing the current values of `A and `B, providing a simple method to track and demonstrate the changes in configuration without additional data processing or interface interaction.",
