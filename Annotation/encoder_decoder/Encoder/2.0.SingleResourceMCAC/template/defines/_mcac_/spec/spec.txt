Module name: mcac. Module specification: The "mcac" module in Verilog serves primarily as a test or monitoring entity rather than processing or transforming data. This module has no input or output ports, underlining its use case restricted to displaying internal states for debugging or verification purposes at simulation start. It instantiates two submodules named "ENC" and "DEC." The module interacts with internal signals ENC.A, ENC.B, DEC.A, and DEC.B, which are likely to represent internal configuration or state information within these submodules. The actual Verilog code of the module comprises an initial block that executes at the beginning of the simulation. This block contains display statements to check and output the initial values of these internal signals directly to the simulation console, aiding in a straightforward initial state verification of configurations within the ENC and DEC submodules. Such a setup suggests that the mcac module is utilized fundamentally for debugging or monitoring the initial states of its submodules.
