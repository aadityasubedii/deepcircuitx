Module-level comment: The "mcac" module primarily functions as a diagnostic tool in Verilog simulations, lacking explicit input/output ports. It instantiates "ENC" and "DEC" submodules and utilizes an initial block to display internal states (ENC.A, ENC.B, DEC.A, DEC.B) from these submodules at simulation start. This setup aids in verifying initial configurations and provides a quick operational snapshot for debug purposes.
