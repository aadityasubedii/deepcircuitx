    "spec": "Module name: dec. Module specification: The 'dec' module primarily serves for demonstration or debugging purposes within Verilog simulations, focusing on initialization and display of register values. It does not have any input or output ports, which indicates that it operates internally without interaction with external modules or data flows. The key internal signals are two 2-bit registers: A and B. These registers are assigned predefined values using macros `A and `B, which are likely defined in an included file specified by \"global_defines.vh\". The principal functional block of the module is an initial block, which sets the values of registers A and B from the macros and subsequently displays these values. This module is useful for understanding or demonstrating how values are assigned and managed in Verilog designs without the complications of data exchange through ports.",
