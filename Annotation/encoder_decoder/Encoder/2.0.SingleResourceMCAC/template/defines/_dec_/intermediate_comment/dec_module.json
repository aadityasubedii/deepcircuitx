    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'dec' module, defined without external I/O ports, showcases initialization and display of internal 2-bit registers A and B. It uses predefined macros `A and `B for assignments, as designated in an included definitions file (\"global_defines.vh\"). Key operation occurs in an initial block where values of A and B are set and displayed, serving purposes of demonstration or debugging in Verilog simulations."
