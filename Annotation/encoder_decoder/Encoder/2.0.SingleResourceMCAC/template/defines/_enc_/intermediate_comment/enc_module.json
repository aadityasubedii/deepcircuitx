    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'enc' module demonstrates initial set-up of internal 2-bit registers A and B, which are assigned values from 'global_defines.vh'. It lacks I/O ports, operating solely within its definitions to display initialized values. This setup is encapsulated in an initial block that verifies these register values at simulation start, aiding foundational demonstrations for encoding systems without external interactions."
