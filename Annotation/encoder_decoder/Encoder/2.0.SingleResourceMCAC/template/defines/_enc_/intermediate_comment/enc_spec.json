This module does not include any input or output ports, indicating that its operation is confined within the module without external data interchange. Internally, the module utilizes two 2-bit registers named A and B. These registers are initialized at the beginning of the simulation with predefined values possibly defined in the included \"global_defines.vh\" file. The functionality of the module is segmented into key areas, including preprocessor directives at the start for conditional compilation, an inclusion of a definitions file, the definition of internal registers, and an initial block. The initial block is used to set initial values to the registers A and B and thereafter displays these values. This simple setup aids in verifying the basic functionality of register initialization and display, serving as a foundational block for more complex encoding systems.",
