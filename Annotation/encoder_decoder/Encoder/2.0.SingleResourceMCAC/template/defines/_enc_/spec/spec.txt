Module name: enc. 

Module specification: The 'enc' module is designed primarily for demonstration purposes to initialize and display register values as part of an encoding setup, though specific encoding functionalities are not directly implemented in the visible snippet. This module does not include any input or output ports, indicating that its operation is confined within the module without external data interchange. Internally, the module utilizes two 2-bit registers named A and B. These registers are initialized at the beginning of the simulation with predefined values possibly defined in the included "global_defines.vh" file. The functionality of the module is segmented into key areas, including preprocessor directives at the start for conditional compilation, an inclusion of a definitions file, the definition of internal registers, and an initial block. The initial block is used to set initial values to the registers A and B and thereafter displays these values. This simple setup aids in verifying the basic functionality of register initialization and display, serving as a foundational block for more complex encoding systems.
