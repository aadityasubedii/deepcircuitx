Module-level comment: The 'test' module functions as a testbench for evaluating the 'EXPAND' module, focusing on scan and test modes via digital circuits' testing protocols. It sets up and monitors input/output signals like clock, reset, scan chains, and test mode controls, and instantiates the 'EXPAND' module directly. Initial conditions are defined for all inputs and outputs to validate the circuit behavior under predefined states, with optional SDF timing annotation for precise simulation conditions.
