Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module serves as a testbench designed to test the 'EXPAND' module in a digital circuit design environment. This module initializes and monitors inputs and outputs connected to the 'EXPAND' module to validate its behaviors under control-driven and scan-based testing conditions. It includes input ports such as `clk` (clock signal for synchronization), `reset` (signal for initializing the system), `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` (a series of scan inputs for scan chain testing), `scan_enable` (control signal for scan operations), and `test_mode` (signal to switch between normal and test operational modes). The output ports consist of `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, which are used to observe how the module under test responds to inputs. Internally, the test module uses `reg` definitions for the input signals and `wire` definitions for the output signals to facilitate proper connectivity and signal assignment to the 'EXPAND' module. The primary sections in the code include module instantiation for `EXPAND`, setup of initial signal values, and efficiency control through the SDF (Standard Delay Format) annotation conditionally compiled with the `ifdef SDFSCAN` directive for incorporating timing implications during testing scenarios. The code begins with an `initial` block to set initial states of the involved signals and concludes with the end of the simulation command `$finish`. Overall, this test module plays a crucial role in ensuring that the 'EXPAND' module operates correctly under various testing conditions, verifying both the functionality and timing aspects particularly during scan-based testing strategies.
