Module-level comment: This Verilog segment sets the simulation time unit and precision both to 1 nanosecond with the `timescale` directive, foundational for configuring simulation timing but does not describe a functional module, inputs, outputs, or internal signals. It is intended for use within a broader configuration or hardware description framework.
