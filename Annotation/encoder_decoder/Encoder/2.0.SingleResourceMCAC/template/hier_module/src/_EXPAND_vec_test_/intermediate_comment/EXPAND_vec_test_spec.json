    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The 'test' module is employed primarily as a testbench for the 'EXPAND' module, which is aimed at evaluating and ensuring the correct functioning of scanning operations in digital designs. This module simulates various testing conditions for the 'EXPAND' module by utilizing input ports: `clk` (clock), `reset`, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, and `test_mode`. The `clk` manages timing for the operations, `reset` initializes system states, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` are used for inputting test patterns into the scan chains, `scan_enable` activates the scan mode, and `test_mode` switches the module between normal and test operation modes. The outputs of the module are `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, which are used to monitor the scan chain test results to verify their integrity. Internally, the same named signals are propagated through connections to the 'EXPAND' module, highlighting their role in synchronous, control, and data path applications. The `initial` block in the Verilog code sets up the simulation environment, defining time formats, optionally annotating SDF data if compiled with the `SDFSCAN` definition, initializing all input signals to zero, and finally terminating the simulation setup processes with `$finish`. This arrangement ensures a controlled and thoroughly defined test scenario for the 'EXPAND' module's scan capabilities.",
