Module-level comment: The 'test' module serves as a testbench for the 'EXPAND' module, simulating test conditions to evaluate scan capabilities. It inputs signals through `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, with control via `clk`, `reset`, `scan_enable`, and `test_mode`, capturing outputs at `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`. Initial setup includes time formatting, optional SDF annotation, signal initialization, and concludes with simulation termination, thereby facilitating a systematic testing environment.
