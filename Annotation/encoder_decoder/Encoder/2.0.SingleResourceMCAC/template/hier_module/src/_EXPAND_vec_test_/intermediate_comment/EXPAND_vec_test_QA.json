It initializes and simulates the conditions for testing the 'EXPAND' module using input signals like `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, and `test_mode`. The module drives these inputs and captures outputs (`scan_out0` to `scan_out4`) based on the specified configuration, under a controlled clock (`clk`) and reset (`reset`) environment. The initial block sets up the simulation environment, including the time format and optionally loads scan configuration data from an SDF file if compiled with `SDFSCAN` definition, and it also initializes the input signals to default states before finishing the execution. This setup is crucial for validating the functionality of onboard scanning mechanisms in hardware designs."

It is crucial in starting operations from a known state, especially at the beginning of simulation or after encountering faults.\n- **scan_in0 to scan_in4**: These signals form the input scan chain used during testing. They allow the observation and manipulation of state elements within the module, facilitating targeted tests and debugging.\n- **scan_enable**: This internal signal activates the scan test mode, where inputs from scan_in0 to scan_in4 are used to test the internal logic and connectivity, rather than normal functional signals.\n- **test_mode**: Determines operational mode; when activated (set high), it bypasses normal functionality for test routines, particularly focusing on scanning operations.\n- **scan_out0 to scan_out4**: Outputs from the scan chain, these signals provide feedback or results after test patterns have been shifted through the module's internal paths. Monitoring these outputs helps in diagnosing faults and ensuring proper internal operation during the scan test mode."
