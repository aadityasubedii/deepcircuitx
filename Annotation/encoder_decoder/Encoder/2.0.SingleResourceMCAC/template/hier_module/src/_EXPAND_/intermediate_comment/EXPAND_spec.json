Module specification: The EXPAND module is designed primarily for test or diagnostic operations involving scan chains, but lacks explicit internal logic in the provided snippet. It includes a variety of input ports: 'reset' for initializing module state, 'clk' as a timing signal, scan inputs 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' for receiving test data or vectors, 'scan_enable' for enabling scanning operations, and 'test_mode' for toggling between operational modes. The output ports 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4' correspond directly to the scan inputs, suggesting a simple pass-through or buffering role, but the exact behavior is not implemented or visible in the code snippet. There are no internal signals or functional blocks defined in the current module definition, indicating that any processing logic is either omitted or externally handled.
