Module-level comment: The EXPAND module is designed for interfacing scan test inputs and outputs, primarily used in diagnostic setups. It features input ports like 'reset', 'clk', 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4', 'scan_enable', and 'test_mode', with corresponding outputs 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4'. The module lacks internal processing logic, suggesting its functionality may primarily be to route or buffer inputs directly to outputs, depending on external control.
