    "spec": "Module name: test. \n\nModule specification: The 'test' module simulates a test environment for the digital system encapsulated in the `MODULE_NAME` sub-module. This environment is designed to initialize the submodule with various configurations and test vectors to ensure comprehensive testing under different conditions. The module receives several input ports, including a reset signal to initialize the state of `MODULE_NAME`, a clock signal (clk) for synchronization, multiple scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4) for diagnostic testing, a scan enable signal to activate scan mode, a test-mode switch, and an input In1, which is part of the test vectors. The outputs from the module are mainly the scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) and The primary computational output (Out1) from the `MODULE_NAME`. Internal signals such as clk, reset, various control and configuration signals (e.g., scan_enable, test_mode), and arrays holding rates, laws, operations, types, and models assist in managing test cycles and configurations. The module code is divided into blocks initializing test parameters (arrays of configurations and vector sizes), a master clock signal generation, and dynamic test vector application loops that evaluate `MODULE_NAME` under multiple scenarios. During testing, it uses nested loops based on parameters like models, rates, and operations to load expected input-output vectors from files, simulate inputs, and check for discrepancies between expected and acquired outputs, with comprehensive logging of results and error conditions. Upon completion, it indicates the end of the testing sequence.",

This environment is designed to initialize the submodule with various configurations and test vectors to ensure comprehensive testing under different conditions. The module receives several input ports, including a reset signal to initialize the state of `MODULE_NAME`, a clock signal (clk) for synchronization, multiple scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4) for diagnostic testing, a scan enable signal to activate scan mode, a test-mode switch, and an input In1, which is part of the test vectors. The outputs from the module are mainly the scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4) and The primary computational output (Out1) from the `MODULE_NAME`. Internal signals such as clk, reset, various control and configuration signals (e.g., scan_enable, test_mode), and arrays holding rates, laws, operations, types, and models assist in managing test cycles and configurations. The module code is divided into blocks initializing test parameters (arrays of configurations and vector sizes), a master clock signal generation, and dynamic test vector application loops that evaluate `MODULE_NAME` under multiple scenarios. During testing, it uses nested loops based on parameters like models, rates, and operations to load expected input-output vectors from files, simulate inputs, and check for discrepancies between expected and acquired outputs, with comprehensive logging of results and error conditions. Upon completion, it indicates the end of the testing sequence."
