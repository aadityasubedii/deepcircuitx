Module-level comment: The 'test' module acts as a testbench for the QUAN module, checking its performance across varying data rates and encoding laws. It initializes test parameters and sequences through combinations of DLN and DS inputs, determining QUAN's correctness by comparing output I with expected values. Design includes initializing arrays, dynamically setting rates and laws, and iteratively feeding and validating data, with conditional test status outputs and error handling.
