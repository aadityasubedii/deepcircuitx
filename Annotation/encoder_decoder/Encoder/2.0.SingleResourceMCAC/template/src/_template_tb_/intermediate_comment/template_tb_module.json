    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"test\" module serves as a template for future design expansion, currently without active functionality. It contains internal signal declarations, including an 8-bit register and single-bit registers for potential storage or state control. There's also an instantiation of an undefined 'template' submodule suggesting a placeholder for future integration. No I/O ports are defined, indicating self-contained internal logic setup."
