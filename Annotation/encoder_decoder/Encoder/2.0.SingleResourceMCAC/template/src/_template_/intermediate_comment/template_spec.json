    "spec": "Module name: TEMPLATE. Module specification: The TEMPLATE module serves as a basic structural framework or placeholder within a Verilog design, lacking specific functionality in its current form. It includes input ports named sig1 and sig2; these serve as generic inputs, potentially for future functionalities to be defined. The single output port, sig3, similarly serves as a placeholder, intended to output data based on undeveloped logic involving sig1 and sig2. Internally, the module defines several registers and wires: an 8-bit wide register (8bit_reg) for storing data across clock cycles, three single-bit registers (reg0, reg1, reg2) for maintaining state information, an 8-bit wire (8bit_bus), and three single-bit wires (wire0, wire1, wire2) which presumably are intended to connect parts of a circuit within a yet-to-be-specified logic. The code structure lists declarations of inputs, outputs, registers, and wires but does not elaborate on interconnections or functional logic, indicating its use as a preliminary template in larger designs.",
