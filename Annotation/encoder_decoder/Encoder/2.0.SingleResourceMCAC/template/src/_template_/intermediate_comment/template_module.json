    "module": "Module-level comment: The TEMPLATE module acts as a structural framework for future designs and lacks specific functionality at present. It initializes input ports sig1 and sig2, and output port sig3, alongside internal signals including 8-bit and single-bit registers and wires. This setup prepares the module for subsequent addition of detailed logic and interconnections as required in larger system implementations."
