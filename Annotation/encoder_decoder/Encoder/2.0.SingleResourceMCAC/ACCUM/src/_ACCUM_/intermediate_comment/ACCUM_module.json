    "module": "Module-level comment: The ACCUM module is a synchronous accumulator summing input `W` with the stored value `S` on each clock's positive edge, unless reset or clear are active, which zero `S`. It uses an always block sensitive to positive edges of `clk` and `reset` for handling accumulation, clear, and reset logic, preserving state across cycles with the register `S`."
