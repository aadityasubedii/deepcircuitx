If the reset or clear signals are active when the clock pulses, the module resets the accumulator S to zero. This module captures synchronous reset behavior along with basic accumulation functionality under a clock-driven system, suitable for operations where cumulative values are needed over periods defined by sequential logic clock pulses."
