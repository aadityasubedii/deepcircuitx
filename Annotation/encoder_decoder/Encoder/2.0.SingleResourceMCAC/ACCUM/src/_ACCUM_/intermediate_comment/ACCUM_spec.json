    "spec": "Module name: ACCUM. \n\nModule specification: The ACCUM module is an accumulator that operates synchronously with a clock signal. Its primary function is to sum a 16-bit input value 'W' with its previously stored value contained in the register 'S' whenever the clock signal rises and neither the reset nor the clear signals are active. If either the reset or the clear signal is activated during the clock pulse, the accumulator's stored value 'S' reset to zero. The module has several input ports including reset, clk, clear, five scan inputs (scan_in0 to scan_in4), scan_enable, test_mode, and the 16-bit input W. It also features output ports consisting of the 16-bit accumulated value 'S' and five scan outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4). Internally, the primary signal is the output register 'S', which is used to store the accumulated sums. The main block of the code houses an always block triggered on positive edges of 'clk' or the 'reset' signals, handling the accumulation logic as well as the clear and reset behavior. This always block executes conditional checks, where it resets or clears 'S', or updates 'S' by adding the input 'W' to the current value of 'S', hence maintaining the accumulator's functionality across different clock cycles. The module does not modify or utilize scan inputs and outputs directly in its functional logic, which suggests their use is reserved for test modes, although specifics of their implementation or connection are not detailed in this snippet.",
