    "module": "Module-level comment: The \"test\" module simulates and tests the \"ACCUM\" module's functionality and timing. It uses input signals (clk, reset, scan_in0 to scan_in4, scan_enable, test_mode, W) and outputs (scan_out0 to scan_out4, S). Internal signals are setup and driven through an ACCUM instance, with a clock generated in an always block and initial configurations in an initial block, including optional SDF annotations for timing analysis."
