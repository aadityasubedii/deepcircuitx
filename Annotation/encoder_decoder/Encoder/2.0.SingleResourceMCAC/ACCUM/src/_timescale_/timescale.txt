Module-level comment: This Verilog snippet sets the simulation's timescale using the `timescale 1ns / 1ns` directive, which specifies that both the unit of time and the precision of the simulation are in nanoseconds. It lacks functional modules or implementation details as it solely configures the simulation environment without defining any signal processing or operational logic.
