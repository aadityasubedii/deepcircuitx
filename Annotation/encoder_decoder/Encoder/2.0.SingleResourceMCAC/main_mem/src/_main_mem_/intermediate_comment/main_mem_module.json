    "module": "Module-level comment: The 'main_mem' module is designed for scan operations in chip testing, using inputs `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` for test data and `scan_enable`, `test_mode` for operation control. Outputs `scan_out0` to `scan_out4` indicate test results. Primarily an interface setup, the module lacks internal logic in this snippet, suggesting external handling of data processing and scan logic."
