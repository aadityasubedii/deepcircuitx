Module name: main_mem. Module specification: The 'main_mem' module is designed primarily for testing and verification functionalities, which might be utilized in scan operations during manufacturing tests or design verification of integrated circuits. It includes input ports such as `reset`, which is used to reset the module to a known state, and `clk`, a clock signal for synchronizing operations. The module also features scan inputs `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, used for feeding test data into the scan chain, and control signals `scan_enable` and `test_mode`, which respectively enable scanning operations and toggle between normal and test modes. The outputs of the module, `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, provide outputs from the scan operations, presumably indicating the status or results of these tests. Internally, the module appears to be simplified for this snippet, with no internal signals like registers or additional logic explicitly defined, suggesting that this fragment of the code primarily deals with interfacing rather than the core logic of the scan operations. The module, as represented, establishes a framework for input and output with a control mechanism for test operation but lacks detailed implementation of the scanning or logic operations, which would likely be defined in other sections of the full implementation.
