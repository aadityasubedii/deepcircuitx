Module-level comment: The "test" module configures and simulates a memory subsystem "main_mem" for verification. It leverages input signals (clk, reset, scan inputs, scan_enable, test_mode) and observes outputs through scan_out signals. In an initial block, the module sets signal defaults, incorporates optional SDF annotations for precise timing with `SDFSCAN`, and concludes the simulation, ensuring robust testing and functionality assessment of the memory subsystem.
