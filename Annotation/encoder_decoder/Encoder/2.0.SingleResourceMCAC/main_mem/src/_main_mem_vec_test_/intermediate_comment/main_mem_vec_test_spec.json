    "spec": "Module name: test. Module specification: The \"test\" module is primarily designed to simulate and test a memory subsystem called \"main_mem\" within a Verilog test environment. It utilizes input ports such as 'clk' (clock signal for timing control), 'reset' (signal for initializing subsystem), 'scan_in0' to 'scan_in4' (inputs for injecting test data), 'scan_enable' (signal to activate scan test mode), and 'test_mode' (signal to enable test mode operations). The output ports include 'scan_out0' to 'scan_out4', which are used to observe the output response from the memory after test data processing. The internal signals mirror the input and output ports to interface directly with the internal \"main_mem\" module, managing the flow and evaluation of test data. The Verilog code contains an 'initial' block that defines the simulation's time format, optionally integrates SDF (Standard Delay Format) annotations conditional on the 'SDFSCAN' directive for advanced testing scenarios, initializes all signals to default values, and terminates the simulation with `$finish`. This setup provides a controlled environment for evaluating the \"main_mem\" under various test conditions to ensure functionality and integrity.",
