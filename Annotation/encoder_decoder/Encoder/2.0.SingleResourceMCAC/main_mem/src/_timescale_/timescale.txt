Module-level comment: This Verilog snippet sets the `timescale directive` specifying both the time unit and precision to 1 nanosecond for simulations. It configures the timing behavior necessary for simulating any subsequent modules accurately, but does not contain logic or define functionalities of a hardware module itself.
