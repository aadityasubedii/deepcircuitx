Module-level comment: The "test" module acts as a test bench for the "main_mem" module, testing its functionality through initialization and scan chain operations. It employs input ports such as `reset`, `clk`, and `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` for test data input, and outputs results via `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`. Internally, it maps these signals to the "main_mem" instantiation, controlling settings and modes with `scan_enable` and `test_mode`. The initial block sets default values, optionally loads SDF for timing, and completes with `$finish` to analyze the behavior and integrity of "main_mem" under test conditions.
