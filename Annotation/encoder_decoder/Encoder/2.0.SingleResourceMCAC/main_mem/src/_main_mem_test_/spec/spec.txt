Module name: test. 
Module specification: The "test" module serves as a test bench for the "main_mem" module, aimed at verifying the functionality of the memory module under various operational conditions. The module includes input ports such as `reset`, `clk`, `scan_in0` to `scan_in4`, `scan_enable`, and `test_mode`. The `reset` port is for initializing the state of the module, `clk` is the clock signal for synchronization, and `scan_in0` to `scan_in4` are for inputting test data. `scan_enable` switches between normal and test operation, while `test_mode` activates diagnostic functions. The output ports, `scan_out0` to `scan_out4`, output the data serially shifted through the memory module for analysis. Internally, signals like `clk` and `reset` control the timing and initial state, respectively, whereas `scan_inX` and `scan_outX` handle the serial input and output for the scan chain testing. In the Verilog code, the external "main_mem" module is instantiated with these ports mapped accordingly. The initial block initializes these signals, optionally annotates timing with an SDF file if the `SDFSCAN` macro is defined, and concludes simulation with `$finish`. This setup enables comprehensive testing of the "main_mem" module through functional and scan chain operations.
