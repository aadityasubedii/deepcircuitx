    "module": "This module simulates a DDR3 SDRAM memory device, implementing timing checks, command processing, and data read/write operations. It models the behavior of a real DDR3 memory chip by handling various DDR3 features such as burst operations, power-down modes, self-refresh, and on-die termination. The module uses multiple internal signals and tasks to manage timing parameters, memory configuration, bank and row management, and data transfer operations. It performs extensive timing violation checks and generates error messages for non-compliant behavior, ensuring accurate simulation of DDR3 memory functionality."
