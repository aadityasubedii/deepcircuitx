Module name: ddr3_model_c3. Module specification: This module represents a DDR3 SDRAM memory model that simulates the behavior of a DDR3 memory device. It handles timing checks, command processing, and data read/write operations. The module has input ports for control signals (rst_n, ck, ck_n, cke, cs_n, ras_n, cas_n, we_n), address and bank selection (ba, addr), data mask (dm_tdqs), data input/output (dq), and data strobe signals (dqs, dqs_n). It also has an output port for termination data strobe (tdqs_n) and an input for on-die termination control (odt). Internally, the module uses numerous signals to manage timing parameters, memory configuration, bank and row management, power states, and data transfer operations. The code
