Module-level comment: 
/*
This module implements a UART interface with configurable baud rates and FIFO buffers.
It handles serial data transmission and reception, uses Wishbone bus for register access,
and supports flow control. The module employs state machines for TX/RX operations,
manages FIFOs, implements UART control registers, and generates interrupts for TX/RX events.
It includes debug functionality and error checking for FIFO overflow/underflow.
