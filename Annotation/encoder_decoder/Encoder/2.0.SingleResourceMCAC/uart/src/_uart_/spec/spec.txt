Module name: uart. Module specification: This module implements a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) interface with configurable baud rates and FIFO buffers for both TX and RX. It includes a Wishbone bus interface for register access, interrupt generation for TX and RX events, and supports flow control (CTS/RTS). The module has input ports for clock, reset, scan chain inputs, Wishbone bus signals, and UART RX data, and output ports for scan chain outputs, Wishbone bus responses, UART interrupt, and UART TX data. Internal signals manage TX and RX FIFOs, UART control registers, and state machines for transmit and receive operations. The code is organized into sections for FIFO management, TX and RX state machines, register access, and debug functionality. The module handles both transmitting and receiving serial data, implements various UART control registers
