    "module": "Module-level comment: This Verilog directive (`timescale 1ns / 1ps) configures the simulation environment by setting the time unit to nanoseconds and the time precision to picoseconds. It does not describe a module's functionality or implementation details but ensures accurate timing simulation of Verilog designs. Further module-specific code is needed to detail functionality and implementation."
