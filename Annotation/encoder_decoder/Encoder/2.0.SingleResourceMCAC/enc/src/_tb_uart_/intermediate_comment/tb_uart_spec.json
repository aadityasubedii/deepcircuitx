    "spec": "Module name: tb_uart. Module specification: The tb_uart module serves as a testbench for simulating a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) system, primarily focusing on managing the transmission and reception of serial data as specified by UART protocols. The input ports include 'clk' (a primary clock signal), 'reset' (resets the module), 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' (used for diagnostic purposes), 'i_uart_cts_n' (indicates readiness of the external device to receive data), and 'i_uart_rxd' (serial data received from an external transmitter). The output ports consist of 'o_uart_txd' (serial data sent to an external receiver) and 'o_uart_rts_n' (a control signal indicating the readiness to send data, set always active in this configuration). Internally, several signals manage the operations: 'clk_uart' is a buffered clock signal for UART tasks, state and byte counters like 'rx_state' and 'rx_byte' handle the receiving process, while 'tx_state' and 'tx_byte' manage the sending process. FIFO buffers and additional counters manage data flow and transmission control. The module integrates various functional blocks: a clock buffer for stable UART operations, receive and transmit mechanisms processing incoming and outgoing bytes, and debugging outputs conditional on receiving specific control characters. This thorough structure enables the module to simulate a UART interface accurately, helping in the development and testing of UART-based designs.",

Module specification: The tb_uart module serves as a testbench for simulating a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) system, primarily focusing on managing the transmission and reception of serial data as specified by UART protocols. The input ports include 'clk' (a primary clock signal), 'reset' (resets the module), 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode' (used for diagnostic purposes), 'i_uart_cts_n' (indicates readiness of the external device to receive data), and 'i_uart_rxd' (serial data received from an external transmitter). The output ports consist of 'o_uart_txd' (serial data sent to an external receiver) and 'o_uart_rts_n' (a control signal indicating the readiness to send data, set always active in this configuration). Internally, several signals manage the operations: 'clk_uart' is a buffered clock signal for UART tasks, state and byte counters like 'rx_state' and 'rx_byte' handle the receiving process, while 'tx_state' and 'tx_byte' manage the sending process. FIFO buffers and additional counters manage data flow and transmission control. The module integrates various functional blocks: a clock buffer for stable UART operations, receive and transmit mechanisms processing incoming and outgoing bytes, and debugging outputs conditional on receiving specific control characters. This thorough structure enables the module to simulate a UART interface accurately, helping in the development and testing of UART-based designs."
