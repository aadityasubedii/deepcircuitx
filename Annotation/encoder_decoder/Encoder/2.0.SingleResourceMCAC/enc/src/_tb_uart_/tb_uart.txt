Module-level comment: The 'tb_uart' module simulates UART communication by managing data transmission and reception. Key functions include synchronization via 'clk_uart', serial data processing through handling states and FIFO buffers, and debugging outputs based on received data. This testbench aids in verifying UART interface designs by simulating operational conditions and data flow.
