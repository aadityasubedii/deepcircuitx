Module-level comment: The 'main_mem' module interfaces with a Wishbone bus, handling read and write operations to internal memory. Configured for 32-bit or 128-bit modes, it uses signals for write enable, addressing, and data transfer. Internal logic includes memory access controls, data masking, and signal delays to synchronize bus communication and data processing. Various blocks adapt operations to the configured data width, ensuring data integrity and sequential consistency based on clock and reset dependencies.
