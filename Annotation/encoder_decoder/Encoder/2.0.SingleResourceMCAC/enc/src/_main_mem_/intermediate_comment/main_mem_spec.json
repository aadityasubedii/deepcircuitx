    "spec": "Module name: main_mem. Module specification: The 'main_mem' module acts as a memory interface for a Wishbone bus with flexibility in supporting both 32-bit and 128-bit operation modes through configurable parameters. It is responsible for handling memory operations including read and write functionalities based on the control signals derived from the Wishbone bus. The input ports include a clock ('clk'), reset signal ('reset'), test signals such as 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode', memory control ('i_mem_ctrl'), Wishbone address ('i_wb_adr'), select lines ('i_wb_sel'), write enable ('i_wb_we'), Wishbone data ('i_wb_dat'), cycle valid signal ('i_wb_cyc'), and strobe signal ('i_wb_stb'). The outputs are the data fetched from memory ('o_wb_dat'), acknowledge signal ('o_wb_ack'), and an error signal ('o_wb_err'). Internal signals like 'start_write' and 'start_read' manage the initiation of write and read processes, respectively, with delays introduced by 'start_read_d1' and 'start_read_d2' to time the data output accurately. The 'busy' signal ensures no new operation starts while another is in progress. Memory write operations are managed through signals such as 'wr_en', 'wr_mask', and 'wr_data', while read data is handled via 'rd_data', 'masked_wdata', and address manipulation is done using 'addr_d1'. The module uses parameterized conditional generate blocks to tailor its behavior based on the data width defined, creating separate logic branches for 32-bit and 128-bit operation modes, including how data read and write are addressed and processed. The entire module leverages sequential logic controlled by the clock and reset signals to ensure robust and synchronous operation, potentially integrated with debugging outputs conditioned on compilation flags to facilitate development and testing.",

                    "text": "Module name: main_mem. Module specification: The 'main_mem' module acts as a memory interface for a Wishbone bus with flexibility in supporting both 32-bit and 128-bit operation modes through configurable parameters. It is responsible for handling memory operations including read and write functionalities based on the control signals derived from the Wishbone bus. The input ports include a clock ('clk'), reset signal ('reset'), test signals such as 'scan_enable' and 'test_mode', memory control ('i_mem_ctrl'), Wishbone address ('i_wb_adr'), select lines ('i_wb_sel'), write enable ('i_wb_we'), Wishbone data ('i_wb_dat'), cycle valid signal ('i_wb_cyc'), and strobe signal ('i_wb_stb'). The outputs are the data fetched from memory ('o_wb_dat'), acknowledge signal ('o_wb_ack'), and an error signal ('o_wb_err'). Internal signals like 'start_write' and 'start_read' manage the initiation of write and read processes, respectively, with delays introduced by 'start_read_d1' and 'start_read_d2' to time the data output accurately. The 'busy' signal ensures no new operation starts while another is in progress. Memory write operations are managed through signals such as 'wr_en', 'wr_mask', and 'wr_data', while read data is handled via 'rd_data', 'masked_wdata', and address manipulation is done using 'addr_d1'. The module uses parameterized conditional generate blocks to tailor its behavior based on the data width defined, creating separate logic branches for 32-bit and 128-bit operation modes, including how data read and write are addressed and processed. The entire module leverages sequential logic controlled by the clock and reset signals to ensure robust and synchronous operation, potentially integrated with debugging outputs conditioned on compilation flags to facilitate development and testing."
