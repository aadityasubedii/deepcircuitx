Module-level comment: This testbench module simulates and verifies an AMBER core. It sets up the simulation environment, loads memory, generates test vectors, and checks outputs. The module implements clock generation, memory initialization, UART simulation, and result verification. It uses various counters, file handlers, and configuration parameters to control test scenarios, error checking, and logging. The testbench supports different operating modes, reset sequences, and timeout monitoring for comprehensive core verification.
