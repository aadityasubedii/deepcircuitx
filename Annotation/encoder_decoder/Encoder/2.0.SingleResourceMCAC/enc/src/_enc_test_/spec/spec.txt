Module name: test. Module specification: The test module is a comprehensive testbench for simulating and verifying the functionality of an AMBER core, likely a processor or microcontroller. It sets up the simulation environment, including clock generation, memory loading, and various test scenarios. The module has input ports for system reset, clocks, scan chains, and encoder inputs, and output ports for UART communication, scan outputs, and encoder outputs. Internal signals include counters, file handlers, memory-related variables, and test configuration parameters. The testbench initializes memory, configures test parameters, generates input stimuli, and checks output responses. It includes functionality for error checking, logging, and displaying register contents. The module is divided into several sections, including clock generation, memory loading, test vector generation, UART simulation, and result verification. It simulates different operating modes, handles reset sequences, and monitors test completion or timeout conditions. The testbench also includes
