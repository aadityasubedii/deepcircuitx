Module-level comment: The "tb" (testbench) module simulates and tests digital designs for FPGAs such as Xilinx Virtex-6 and Spartan-6. It utilizes internal signals and test scenarios without traditional I/O ports, offering dynamic reliance on clock signals, system resets, and memory loading to ensure design integrity. Integrated sub-modules like DDR3 models and UART and Ethernet testers further facilitate comprehensive functional validation, accommodating FPGA-specific configurations and detailed simulation controls.
