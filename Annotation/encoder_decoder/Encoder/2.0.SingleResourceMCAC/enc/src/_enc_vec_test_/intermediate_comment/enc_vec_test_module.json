    "module": "Module-level comment: This testbench module simulates and verifies an encoding/decoding system. It generates clock signals, initializes memories, and manages test vectors. The module configures the system, loads test data, and compares outputs with expected results. It supports various encoding/decoding scenarios, uses both main and boot memory, and includes error-checking mechanisms. The testbench implements UART simulation, memory instantiation, and configuration interfaces to comprehensively test the system under different conditions."
