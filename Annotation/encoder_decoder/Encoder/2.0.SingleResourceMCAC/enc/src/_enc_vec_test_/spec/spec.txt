Module name: test. Module specification: This testbench module simulates and verifies an encoding/decoding system's functionality. It generates clock signals, handles resets, initializes memories, and manages test vectors. The module has various input ports for system control and configuration (e.g., sysrst, scan inputs, test_mode), and output ports for UART communication and scan chain outputs. Internal signals include clocks, reset, configuration flags, and counters for managing test sequences. The module comprises several blocks: clock generation, memory initialization, UART simulation, main memory instantiation, configuration interface, and test vector management. It loads test vectors, configures the system, and compares output data with expected results. The testbench supports different encoding/decoding scenarios with various rates, laws, and operations, utilizing both main and boot memory. It includes error-checking mechanisms and functions for displaying register contents and handling timeouts. The module is designe
