    "module": "Module-level comment: The `dumpvcd` module manages VCD file operations for simulations, providing debugging support by dynamically tracking system states based on simulation times or events. It uses internal signals like clock counters and CPU states, controlled through conditional compilation and timing events, to activate and deactivate data logging. With preprocessor conditions, it also adapts to different system configurations, aiding in precise system verification and debugging efforts."
