Module name: enc. Module specification: The 'enc' module is a complex system-on-chip (SoC) integration module designed for encryption, communication, and system management. It operates on a 128-bit wide Wishbone bus with 16-bit select lines and supports 10 slave devices. The module interfaces with various input and output signals including reset, clock, serial data interfaces (enc_s, enc_s_clk, enc_s_fs, enc_o, enc_o_clk, enc_o_fs), scan chain signals for testing, UART interfaces, and Wishbone bus interfaces for main memory and configuration. Internally, it utilizes multiple clock domains (tdmo_ser_clk_in, tdmo_fs_in, sys_clk_in, aprsc_clk_in) and employs Wishbone bus signals for both master and slave interfaces. The module
